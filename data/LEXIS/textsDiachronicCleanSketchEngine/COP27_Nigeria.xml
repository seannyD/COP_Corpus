The Commonwealth ( HYPERLINK https://TheCommonwealth.org https://TheCommonwealth.org United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ). The Secretary-General will head a delegation to attend the world's largest annual gathering of leaders around the issue of climate change, which takes place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt from 6 to 18 November. At the summit, Secretary-General Scotland will advocate for ramped-up climate action through more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), national plans and targets. She will also seek to amplify the shared concerns of the 56 Commonwealth countries, including crucial issues around climate finance, sustainable energy transition, loss and damage, and partnerships and coordinated action. Ahead of her arrival in Egypt on 5th November, the Secretary-General stated: " COP27 takes place in the midst of overlapping, interlinked and accelerating global challenges. The lasting impacts of COVID-19 combine with the effects of conflict, including in Ukraine, to destabilise global economic, energy and food systems. Against this backdrop, the climate crisis has continued to worsen, and its profound impacts are being felt by families, communities and countries across the Commonwealth. "I understand the pressure world leaders are under, but I urge all decision-makers, advocates and allies at COP27 to ensure the promises already made are delivered, and accelerate efforts to mitigate and adapt to the urgent threat of climate change. We must never lose sight of the crushing consequences of inaction, for the for the millions who face the dangers of climate change every day, and for generations to come. We need urgent action now." Thirty-two of the total 56 Commonwealth member countries are small states, including 25 small island developing states, while 14 are classified as least developed countries - among the poorest and most vulnerable in the world. Commonwealth heads of government recognise that developing countries, least developed countries and small island developing states are particularly at risk of their development gains being reversed by the impacts of climate change. During their meeting ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3U7jWRt https://bit.ly/3U7jWRt The Secretary-General added: "We must build on the substantive progress made at the previous COP26 summit, and urgently translate these commitments into action. Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 45 per cent by 2030. But to achieve this, developing countries will need enhanced support."

Ahead of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP27 , in Egypt in November, the African Development Bank ( HYPERLINK http://www.AfDB.org www.AfDB.org ) and the Global Center on Adaptation participated in a series of events at the Africa Climate Week to build consensus among African countries and stakeholders. COP27 is described as Africa's COP and will significantly shape the future. To deliver on adaptation, a transformative adaptation agenda is needed now. Titled 'Adaptation Dialogue: Implementing the Vision', ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3F6hsOB https://bit.ly/3F6hsOB HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3DoKPKC ) so far, notably its contribution to narrowing the adaptation gap and accelerating the implementation of the Africa Adaptation Initiative (AAI). The AAI represents Africa's bold and innovative step to galvanize the support needed to significantly scale up adaptation across the continent. Speaking on behalf of Dr. Kevin Kariuki, Vice President, Power, Energy, Climate Change and Green Growth, Al-Hamndou Dorsouma, Acting Director of Climate Change & Green Growth Department at the African Development Bank, underscored the urgent need for accelerated adaptation action. Dorsouma called for accelerated action against climate change while making rapid, deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to avoid a mounting loss of life, biodiversity, and infrastructure. He noted that progress on adaptation has been uneven so far, with increasing gaps between action taken and what is needed to deal with the increasing risks. Prof. Anthony Nyong, Senior Director and Africa Regional Director at the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA), highlighted the need to improve climate resilience and adaptation in Africa. He estimated the cost of climate change at $579 billion by 2030, with global finance skewed towards mitigation. Only 7.2% of global finance goes to climate adaptation. Tanguy Gahouma-Bekale, Special Advisor to the President of the Gabonese Republic and the Permanent Secretary of the National Climate Council, endorsed the AAAP as a primary vehicle for implementing the Africa Adaptation Initiative's mandate. The program seeks to mobilize $25 billion to accelerate climate change adaptation actions across Africa. The AAAP is an Africa-owned and Africa-led response to the continent's expressed needs and priorities to reduce its vulnerabilities to climate change and harness the opportunities that result from climate change. Since its launch in April 2021, the AAAP upstream financing facility, managed by GCA, has enabled mainstreaming adaptation into investments worth over $3 billion.

Charity Migwi, Africa Regional Campaigner, 350.Org, an international environmental organisation has called for the immediate cleanup and remediation of all oil spills in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Migwi told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt on the sidelines of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) that the clean up is key to the just transition from fossil fuels. She lamented the increasing oil pollution and gas flaring in Niger Delta, with a call on the Federal Government to shift it's energy mix to renewable energy. According to her issues of green house gas (GHG) emissions from the oil and other sectors was responsible for the increasing climate crises such as devastating floods in Nigeria. 'The climate change crises we are witnessing, especially in Africa is caused by these greenhouse gas emissions. Read Also: UK votes \Â£3200m to AfDB to boost climate action 'That is why we are opposed to fossil fuel projects across Africa, and it's not just the fossil fuel companies but also the financial institutions backing them. 'So we want to encourage the local communities in the Niger Delta to stand up for their rights and protect their land, protect the water resources, so that they can live in a healthier and cleaner planet. 'Fossil fuel is not the answer to meeting people's energy needs, its not the answer to development, or economic growth of Nigeria, there should be a just shift to renewable energy because it's cleaner, sustainable and even cheaper,' she said.

President Muhammadu Buhari has called for urgent climate actions from, especially developed countries to tackle the effects of climate change in Africa. Buhari who was represented by Minister of Environment, Mohammed Abdullahi made the call on Monday in Sharm el-Sheikh on the sidelines of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ). The sideline Clean Energy Transition event organised by Bloomberg Philanthropies and Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) provided opportunity for Nigeria to highlight it's climate efforts and concerns. "Without a doubt, we are at a critical time with respect to the world's climate future and our actions today and over the next few decades will determine the fate of future generations and the planet. "This year, we have witnessed disastrous extreme weather events from terrifying wildfires in the United States, to unprecedented heat waves in India, Pakistan, and Europe, to intense floods in my country, Nigeria," he said. He therefore called for more accelerated actions from developed countries who contribute most of the emissions affecting Africa's climate. "For developing nations particularly in Africa who, despite contributing the least to both historical and current emissions, are facing climate impacts to a disproportionate degree, the case for accelerated climate action is even more pressing. "We need to see urgent and decisive climate action from the countries most responsible for the emissions that cause climate change. "We cannot afford any more delays; our people and nations are on the line. The blame game should stop, affirmative and positive commitment to address these challenges must begin now," Buhari said. He said Nigeria and other African countries were committed to tackling the climate change crises "We are committed to tackling climate change by embarking on bold actions ourselves. COP 27 in Egypt. The minister is expected to deliver Nigeria's National Statement at plenary, attend bilateral and side meetings on Nigeria's Energy Transition Plan, amongst other engagements.

By Muhyideen Jimoh Charity Migwi, Africa Regional Campaigner, 350. Org, an international environmental organisation has called on the Federal Government to stop issuing coal mining licences and shift to renewable energy. Migwi told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt on the sidelines of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) that coal mining activities in Nigeria has led to extensive environmental degradation. She said Nigeria as a party to the Paris Agreement must do more to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy, especially because of its negative impacts. "The ongoing coal mining in Nigeria has led to extensive environmental degradation, including the contamination of air, water, and soil which continues to negatively affect the health of local communities. "This is despite the country being party to the Paris Agreement," she said. Migwi said the devastating impacts of fossil fuels had led 350. Org to launch a 'Coal-Free Nigeria campaign' with the aim of having a just transition to renewable energy. The activist noted that Nigeria holds large coal deposits from the East to the Northern parts of the country, estimated to be at least 2bn metric tons. She decried the continued activities of some companies, including Dangote, ETA Zuma and Ashaka who are into coal mining in Kogi, Benue, Gombe states among others. On Nigeria's recently launched Energy Transition Plan (ETP), she expressed worry on gas being a significant part of the energy mix. "Recently, Nigeria launched its Energy Transition Plan, which sadly includes gas in the energy mix. This is contrary to a shift in renewables. "The government should instead focus on implementing the climate change act, which would mean the government would need to put in diverse efforts to ultimately reduce fossil fuel exploration in the country. "Nigeria being one of the largest economies in Africa, should be a beacon for other African states by accelerating its plans towards a rapid, just transition towards embracing 100% renewable energy," she said.

The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has requested the inclusion of Nigeria in the G7's Climate Partnerships List for the co-creation of a Just Energy Transition Partnership. According to him, this will enable the country's Energy Transition Plan to achieve its set target by 2060. The plan requires $410bn, which translates to an additional $10bn in annual spending. He said this on Monday on the sidelines of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Egypt, dubbed COP27 . Represented by the Minister of Environment, Mohammed Abdullahi, the President stated that actions concerning climate change taken today and over the next few decades would determine the fate of future generations and the planet. He said, "This year, we have witnessed disastrous extreme weather events from terrifying wildfires in the United States, to unprecedented heat waves in India, Pakistan, and Europe, to intense floods in my country, Nigeria,. From early summer till now, devastating floods have affected about 33 states in Nigeria, displacing over 1.4 million people, destroying over 100,000 hectares of farmland and causing about 600 deaths. In addition, we are witnessing increased desertification, erosion, and pollution in the country; the impacts of which are too severe to ignore. These glaring climate signals indicate that we do not have the luxury of time when it comes to the impacts of climate change," he said. The President lamented that Africa, which had contributed the least to both historical and current emissions, was facing climate impacts to a disproportionate degree. He said, "As will be strongly demanded here at COP27 , we need to see urgent and decisive climate action from the countries most responsible for the emissions that cause climate change. We cannot afford any more delays; our people and nations are on the line. The blame game should stop, affirmative and positive commitment to address these challenges must begin now." Buhari stated that while climate change was getting focused on, there was the need to consider the energy poverty in Africa. "These energy deficits have staggering quality and length of life ramifications. For instance, the clean cooking deficits lead to about 500 million premature deaths from household air pollution in Sub-Saharan Africa annually, and due to the electricity deficits, half of secondary schools and a quarter of health facilities in the region have no power. "African nations, and in fact most developing countries, must balance contributing our quota to the global climate response with resolving our significant energy needs. The clean energy transition is perhaps our main tool to achieve this. As we sought to scale our climate mitigation efforts, the Federal Government of Nigeria recognized the need for an extensive clean energy transition while providing sufficient energy to meet the needs of the 92 million Nigerians without access to electricity and the 175 million Nigerians without access to clean cooking solutions," he said. \</doc>

Africa has been and remains the top focus of UNIDO\' s efforts to accelerate inclusive and sustainable industrial development. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 Africa is one of the most vulnerable continents in the world, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Temperature increase, heat waves, extensive floods, tropical cyclones, prolonged droughts, and sea level rise resulting in loss of lives, property damage, and population displacement, undermine Africa\' s ability to achieve its commitments to meet the targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the African Union Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want. The Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan adopted at COP 27 paves the way for the African leaders to formulate sound climate and industrialization policies in line with the vision of African Union\' s Agenda 2063 -The Africa We Want. The African Union\' s Extraordinary Summit on Industrialization and Economic Diversification and the Extraordinary Session on the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) is being held in Niamey, Niger, from 20 to 25 November 2022 during the Africa Industrialization Week. The impact of Covid-19 pandemic, energy and food crises facing the world have had a disproportionate effect on the African countries and exposed their vulnerability especially in agriculture, pharmaceuticals and food sectors. There is an urgent need to promote resilient regional and continental value chains. The coming info force of AfCFTA opens up enormous opportunities for intra-African trade  creating employment, promoting standardization, skill development and integration into the global value chains  putting Africa on the right trajectory to sustainable development. In accordance with the United Nations General Assembly\' s resolution, passed in 2016, UNIDO is tasked with leading the implementation of the Third Industrial Development Decade for Africa in cooperation with the African Union and other partners. In this capacity UNIDO has co-organized and substantially contributed to the Africa Industrialization Summit.

As the United Nations Climate Change Conference tagged COP27 begins today, November 6, in Egypt, the head of the Nigerian delegation and Minister of Environment, Mohammed Abdullahi, has set the agenda for Nigeria at the conference. Loss and damage is a term in UN climate negotiations used to describe harm caused by climate change due to man-made activities. The Minister of Environment is representing President Muhammadu Buhari at the event. Speaking on the expectations of Nigeria at COP27 , the minister in a statement said, 'We are focused on ensuring that we bring the issue of loss and damage to the fore, and we are already making progress in this regard because during the Pre-Cop engagement the COP 27 President, Sameh Shoukry highlighted flood-related issues with particular reference to Nigeria and Pakistan amongst other nations as one of the key issues on the agenda for discussion. Already, the issues of flood are linked to loss and damage, and that is a priority to us as a nation.' 'In addition, Nigeria as the leader of the PAN African Agency for the Great Green Wall will focus on climate finance to support its activities in the Sahel Region particularly in the most endemic Northern states described as the front line states where there is fast approaching desert encroachment and of course wetland drying up, these and others are huge issues that we will be focusing on,' Abdullahi stated. He also stated that the Nigerian delegation will also focus on the African carbon market initiative as it tries to kick start the framework for carbon trading, adding that similar attention will also be given to a novel issue called debt for climate swap aimed at calling the attention of developed countries to the impact of their industrialisation on the developing countries and the need for them to mitigate the impact on the continent of Africa and Nigeria in particular. The minister said that Nigeria will unite with other African countries to push what was agreed upon at the Africa Minsters' Conference on Environment held in Senegal earlier this year with a focus on afforestation, and climate finance among other issues. 'Nigeria negotiators will align with other African countries in recognition of what we agreed in Kigali and at the Africa Minsters' Conference on Environment (AMCEN) declaration in Dakar Senegal. to focus on afforestation, Climate Finance, the need to mitigate desertification and of course to emphasised on loss and damage, this is important and crucial to address some of the climate challenges Africa grappled with,' Abdullahi said. Again, the minister expressed hope of securing funding for Africa's carbon market initiative in collaboration with the United Nations Sustainable Energy for All. 'We have secured the assurance of the Head of the United Nations Sustainable Energy for all, Damilola Ogunbiyi, who is also a Nigerian, that there is a window of about 400 million dollars to support Africa's carbon market initiative, we are beginning to record achievements even before we started,' he said. COP27 holds in Sharm El Sheik, Egypt from November 6 to 18, 2022. Vice President Yemi Osibanjo is scheduled to speak at a special high-level segment for vice presidents and Heads of Government on Tuesday, November 7.

For Nigeria to fasten its net-zero agenda, the government, public and private sectors must collaborate and not compete, according to the Oando Clean Energy Limited (OCEL) at the just concluded 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ). Ademola Ogunbanjo, executive vice president, OCEL, made the assertion during a presentation on OCEL's sustainable transport initiative targeted explicitly at decarbonising the Niger Delta among other initiatives. He said, 'This is not the age of competition; it is the age of collaboration. We must collaborate, not only between the government and the public sector but also, within the private sector, if we want to push forward the country's net-zero agenda.' With the successful conclusion of the COP27 themed 'delivering for the people and the planet', one message reverberated across the globe - climate pledges must be matched with action. The event tagged Africa's COP, served as an opportunity to showcase what countries are doing to safeguard the planet and Africa was not left out. OCEL, the renewable energy subsidiary of Oando plc, and part of the Nigerian delegation to COP27 hosted two side events at the Nigeria pavilion. The first side-event themed 'Decarbonising an oil-rich region: A case for the Niger Delta was held in partnership with the ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, National Council on Climate Change, REAN and Stratus Limited.

Nigeria's Minister of Environment, Mohammed Hassan Abdullahi, has delivered Nigeria's national statement on behalf of President Muhammadu Buhari, at the ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. The minister delivered the statement on Tuesday at the resumed high-level segment of COP 27 . whose Head of State or Government did not deliver a national statement on November 7 or 8 when COP27 began, and where a number of heads of state and government were physically present themselves. A national statement gives the position of a country (party) and what it seeks to advance at the conference negotiations. In the statement, President Buhari spoke about the need for a loss and damage facility to help developing countries recover from the effects of climate change. He also talked about the need to expand existing adaptation acceleration programmes for developing countries. The president stated that 'At COP26, I did say that 'For Nigeria, climate change is not about the perils of tomorrow but what is happening today.' Today, Nigeria is currently grappling with devasting effects of terrible flooding which has affected 3.2 million persons, over 600 lives lost, over 100,000 persons displaced and over 300 hectares of farmlands destroyed. Nigeria and indeed the rest of Africa, from the Sahara to the Cape, is living with increasing fear of food insecurity as a result of the floods. 'The economic cost for Loss and Damage for Africa is estimated at almost USD 2 Trillion excluding non-economic losses. Developed nations must not ignore the demand from developing nations to establish a Loss and Damage finance facility to help developing nations recover from the adverse effects of climate change, particularly the devastating floods, worsening desertification, and rising sea levels. 'At COP26 in Glasgow, I announced Nigeria's commitment to net-zero by 2060 on the basis of a detailed Energy Transition Plan (ETP). This plan, the first of its kind in Africa highlights the significant scale of resources required to attain both development and climate ambitions by 2060. However, the public finance urgently needed to fund energy transitions and climate action is lacking - a situation compounded by debt distress affecting many low- and middle-income countries. We are therefore taking bold steps to pioneer innovative climate finance instruments such as debt for climate swaps; and championing the development of the African carbon market initiative. In support of this, Nigeria has enacted the climate change law alongside the initial governance framework and launched the Nigeria Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). 'To signal investment readiness, we have made significant progress in creating the enabling policies and incentives to advance a shortlist of priority projects, including Renewable Solar Independent Power Plants (IPPs), scaled Decentralised Renewable Energy (DRE) projects and gas flare commercialization opportunities, to name a few. We are hopeful that investors in the global community will recognize the immense investment opportunities and potential for impact. 'Mr President, as the largest economy in Africa, we are engaging the G7 to request the inclusion of Nigeria in the G7's Climate Partnerships List for the co-creation of a Just Energy Transition Partnership. Nigeria and the rest of Africa, call for an effective and sustainable framework that will address the socio-economic effects of energy transition including energy poverty, and loss of jobs and livelihoods. 'Africa contributes about 3% to the global emissions but is left to cope with the devasting impacts of climate change. Nigeria has spearheaded initiatives aimed at recovering degraded land for the Sahara and the Sahel such as the Great Green Wall. There is a dire need to expand existing adaptation acceleration programmes for developing countries.' The resumed high-level holds on November 15 and 16.

Members of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA) have expressed fears that Africa is losing out already at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) holding in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt from November 6 to 18. COP27 has been called an African COP. However, PACJA which is a network of more than 1000 organisations from 48 countries in Africa, has said that for the fact that the Special Needs and Circumstances consideration for Africa has been dropped from the agenda, meaning that the issue will not even be discussed at COP27 , Africa is already losing out on the negotiations at the conference of parties. Speaking at a press conference at the venue of COP27 , the Executive Director of PACJA, Mithika Mwenda, said that 'All the scientific reports recognise Africa as the most impacted continent by climate change. Africa has contributed very little to the global emissions.' COP27 not to relent in putting forward Africa's interests because according to him, 'this is a fight for our livelihoods and for our lives.' Also speaking to the issue, Lucky Abeng, a young digital activist member of PACJA, said the organisation was displeased with the dropping of the consideration of Africa as a continent of special needs and circumstances. 'This issue we have followed since 2015. We are disappointed to see that COP27 which we have termed an African COP could not also adopt Africa as a continent of special needs and circumstances. 'We did this press briefing to further show our displeasure over what the negotiations are going to be about. We are already considering COP27 to be a failed COP, just like COP26 in Glasgow.' The young Nigerian climate justice activist added, 'As one of the young people representing the young digital activists of PACJA, we came here with high expectations. 2023 was declared the year of the youth by the Commonwealth. Africa is a youthful continent. If the negotiations do not go in favour of young people, it is important that we also express our displeasure. With job losses, we are continually disadvantaged if you compare us with our counterparts in the global north. This further reiterates the fact that we are already at a disadvantage as young people.' \</doc>

Nigeria, Nov. 18 -- The African Group of Negotiators and the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment have expressed concerns about the slow pace of progress on issues that affect the continent at the ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP27 , in Egypt. This position is contained in a statement jointly delivered on Tuesday by Alioune Ndoye, Minister of Environment, Sustainable Development and Ecological Transition of Senegal, who doubles as the President of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN), and Collins Nzovu, Minister of Green Economy and Environment of Zambia, Chair of the African Group of Negotiators. The statement reads in part: "As you know, COP-27 has been dubbed as an implementation COP, and for us, as the African Group, we came here focused and determined to ensure we deliver on implementation. "We also view COP-27 as an African COP being held on African soil, a continent that is worst affected by the climate crisis and yet contributes least to the pollution that causes climate change; as such, we expect COP-27 to result in tangible outcomes which reflect people's aspirations, including Africa's special needs and special circumstances". On assessment report The group made reference to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) which has released daunting findings, in particular on the African continent. The report found that Africa will be impacted more than any other continent while the continent only contributes less than 4 per cent of the world's total emissions. "Africa has the lowest historical and current emissions. AR6 also estimates that adaptation costs in developing countries will reach $127 billion, and Africa needs up to $86.5 billion annually by 2030," the statement quoted. The group said the position of Africans is not a contest for vulnerability, but the COP decisions have recognised Africa, and science alludes to the fact that Africa is a continent plagued by complex overlapping challenges, and many generations of Africans have been left behind and suffer consequences of actions not of their own making. The statement added: "The systemic problems facing Africa require dedicated and targeted interventions. This will also unleash our continent's potential to contribute to achieving the 1.5c world; In a continent that is already food insecure, Africa has suffered a 34 per cent decline in food production and loss & damage to agricultural productivity (IPCC AR6). "We are concerned about the lack of progress on various issues of importance to our group, particularly on finance, adaptation and loss and damage. However, with a few days remaining, we believe we can still deliver on all work streams, including on adaptation, loss and damage, mitigation and means of implementation." The group said adaptation is a matter of survival for Africa and that COP27 should deliver on scaling up adaptation action and support, including Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA). The negotiators said the intensive technical work was undertaken throughout the year and therefore called on all Parties to "work constructively to reach an agreement on a framework to enable achieving and assessing progress towards GGA." " COP27 On Loss and Damages The statement said: "The African continent is exposed to diverse types of loss and damage, which manifest most significantly in various sectors and are associated with extreme and slow events over different time scales Climate change impacts on Africa Africa has and continues to suffer the brunt of the adverse effects of climate change and has not received the required multilateral support to face the climate challenge. African countries require access to scaled-up levels of new, additional and predictable grant and concessional finance, which undoubtedly could be deployed effectively to create enabling environments by beginning to buy down risks and create new asset classes for clean investments. This would allow for more significant mobilisation and leveraging of public and private finance and enhance access to the elusive and unseen trillions of dollars. The African group expresses continued disappointment that the USD100 billion per year goal by 2020 from developed to developing countries remains unfilled, emphasising the importance of delivering such a target as soon as possible for building trust and faith in the multilateral process of addressing climate change. "We urge developed countries to deliver on their commitment to meet the goal and ensure the progression of efforts in the ongoing mobilization of climate finance," the statement said. On mitigation On mitigation, the group said they will continue to engage constructively in the technical work to design an effective and dynamic mitigation work programme that will result in concrete decisions on scaling up both mitigation ambition and support for just transitions. The negotiators want the mitigation work programme to accelerate the implementation of NDCs, urging developed countries to take the lead in implementing targets while providing enhanced support to developing countries. COP27 should design an effective and dynamic work programme and result in concrete decisions on scaling up both mitigation ambition and support for just transitions," the statement said.

The COP27 President, Sameh Shoukry has addressed a press conference at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , holding in Sharm El Sheik, Egypt, to give an idea about the state of negotiations which has gone beyond the scheduled closing date of November 18. Speaking at 10.30 am local time, Shoukry said, 'I want to explain why we extended COP. 'Deliberations did not result in a clear direction towards consensus. We worked all of yesterday and through the night. 'After hearing various perspectives, I as president developed text on all three issues that are balanced and I believe constitutes a basis for moving forward. I further consulted with groups and gave them an opportunity to comment and introduce minor amendments. 'None of the groups could say all interests were reflected but the vast majority think the text is balanced and can give a breakthrough that can lead to consensus. 'Groups of parties want to explore text further, will provide them with the opportunity to do so 'It rests now with Parties to find consensus and move forward.' The COP27 'It is really up to the parties to find consensus to reinforce the credibility of the UNFCCC process...' A key issue such as a dedicated facility for loss and damage finance is one of the contentious issues at COP27 . Developing nations want a commitment from developed nations on financing for losses attributed to climate change. However, no agreement on this and more issues have kept negotiations going beyond Friday.

More than 90 heads of state and government will be attending this year's climate change conference called COP27 , Egypt's COP27 Presidency has said. The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , more commonly referred to as COP27 , will be the 27th edition of the conference, holds from November 6 to 18, 2022 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. During a press briefing on the COP27 negotiations on Tuesday, Ambassador Mohamed Nasr speaking on behalf of Egypt's COP27 Presidency said, 'We hope that parties come here and focus on the climate agenda and make sure everyone is doing their share.' He noted that success at COP27 among other indicators would mean delivering on mitigation 'to ensure we keep 1.5 degrees limit within reach,' delivering on loss and damage and delivering on adaptation. He said agreements should be made on providing finance for loss and damage, adding that Egypt's COP27 Presidency was focused providing the atmosphere for that agreement to be reached. Nasr said that the gap in financing was impacting the implementation of decisions made in Glasgow at COP26. He expressed hope that economic challenges faced by countries will not make them back-track on pledges made. The challenge is in 'the political will after the COP' to deliver on commitments, he said. He added that there were challenges in implementation. 'We need to work together not just for our children's future but for our present realities. The media is needed to give governments a reality check so that backsliding on commitments will not occur. What has been pledged must be delivered,' Nasr concluded. The Egyptian COP27 In an earlier address, President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi of Egypt said, 'The hosting of COP27 in the green city of Sharm El-Sheikh this year marks the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 'In the thirty years since, the world has come a long way in the fight against climate change and its negative impacts on our planet; we are now able to better understand the science behind climate change, better assess its impacts, and better develop tools to address its causes and consequences. 'Thirty years and 26 COPs later, we now have a much clearer understanding of the extent of the potential climate crisis and what needs to be done to address it effectively.' \</doc>

As the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) holds in Egypt, the Federal Government, represented by the Federal Ministers of Environment, Power and Trade, has recommended a white paper entitled: Trade, Energy and Climate Change: Harmonising Nigerian and Global Concerns on Climate. Led by PUTTRU, the white paper is a collaborative effort with the Federal Ministry of Environment, Federal Ministry of Power, Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, Energy Commission of Nigeria and the Office of the Deputy President of the Senate. The objective of the white paper is aimed at informing the international community and Nigeria's trade partners on how the country's national concerns on trade, energy and climate change can be harmonised with global concerns in a manner that ensures that Nigeria's interests are seen as global interests. The white paper posits that given Nigeria's large and growing population, achieving this balance between trade, energy and climate change is a matter of national, continental and global concern. Ultimately, the goal is to strengthen Nigeria's position as a global trade partner in the global supply chain as the world moves towards a net-zero future. The 58-page document is divided into four chapters namely: 'Climate Change', 'Energy', 'Trade' and 'Trade, Energy and Climate Balance' with three Forewords written by Mohammed Abdullahi (Minister of Environment), Abubakar Aliyu (Minister of Power) and Otunba Niyi Adebayo (Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment). Enriched with insights, the document has an impressive list of contributors and reviewers drawn from members of Technical Working Group (TWG) with experts from the Federal Ministries of Environment, Power, Industry, Trade and Investment, Energy Commission of Nigeria (ECN) and other ministries, department and agencies (MDAs) of the Federal Government, the academia and civil society organisations. \</doc>

As the 27th edition of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) enters its final moments, the COP27 president, Sameh Shoukry, has asked for cooperation among the parties in order to reach a 'concrete climate action plan'. He stated this while giving an update on the negotiations on Thursday. Issues such as loss and damage have been at the heart of negotiations at COP27 . Developing countries have largely been seeking financial compensation from developed countries under loss and damage. However, after loss and damage finally made it to the agenda for negotiations at the conference, it appears a consensus is far from being reached. In a statement issued at a press conference held with the UN Secretary-General, Ant\'f3nio Guterres, Sameh said, 'I've just had the pleasure of welcoming His Excellency Secretary-General Guterres once again here in Sharm el-Sheikh for the last crucial stretch of COP27 . He noted that 'Yesterday and today, I have been attending the consultations amongst parties and have been actively involved in direct discussions with all parties on the various issues under consideration. 'While some of the discussions were constructive and positive, others did not reflect the expected recognition of the need to move collectively to address the gravity and urgency of the climate crisis. 'The Mitigation work program is yet to reach the desired outcome. Adaptation is still held back by procedural matters. Ambitious outcomes in finance have not yet materialized. And on loss and damage parties are shying away from taking the difficult political decisions.' The COP27 COP27 'I urge all parties to go the extra mile and take the necessary steps to reach the much-needed conclusions and agreements. The world is waiting for us to demonstrate the seriousness by which we tackle this matter, and as a community of nations we must live up to their expectations.'

Nigeria, Nov. 6 -- Starting today, 6th November 2022, more than 50,000 attendees will gather at the Conference Centre, Sharm el-Sheikh for the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ). The annual convening of governments around the world, representatives from various non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and nearly thousands of journalists to discuss climate change issues is referred to as the Conference of the Parties (COP). COP is a platform where global leaders lay out their plans on how to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees and aim for 1.5 degrees, to adapt to the impacts of a changing climate, and to make money available to deliver on these aims. COP26 in 2021 set the strategy for closing out the 2020-2030 decade. It was a COP that mobilised efforts to deliver on pledges made at COP21 in Paris seven years ago. The "Parties" refer to the 197 nations that agreed to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992. In June 1992, representatives from 172 countries gathered in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), commonly called the Earth Summit. The Earth Summit was an unprecedented meeting of representatives, including 108 heads of state, 2,400 representatives from various non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and nearly 10,000 journalists. An additional 17,000 NGO representatives attended a parallel NGO forum that provided recommendations to the Earth Summit. At the summit, the countries signed a treaty promising to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and prevent dangerous changes to the climate. Almost every year since then, the parties to this agreement have met to talk about what still needs to be done. Since then, there have been annual convenings to discuss progress on global climate change ambitions. The Paris agreement is an international agreement on climate change that is legally binding. At COP 21 in Paris, it was approved by 196 Parties on 12 December 2015, and it became effective on 4 November 2016. Under the Paris Agreement, countries committed themselves to cooperatively reduce greenhouse emissions to keep the earth from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. Poorer countries have also been offered huge sums of money to assist them to cope with climate change and cut their greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement calls for countries to take progressively aggressive climate action over a five-year period. This year is the 27th annual summit - giving it the name COP27 . With Egypt as President, COP27 will be held from 6 to 18 November 2022 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. In Sharm, on the eve of COP27 , Egypt's presidency honoured the moment through the illumination of Egypt's historic pyramids. It lit up the Khafre Pyramid, one of the three ancient pyramids of Giza that dates back 4,500 years. Egypt Pyramid Egypt will take over the COP Presidency and around 45,000 international delegates are expected to come together to advance the world's climate agenda by increasing ambition and accelerating climate action. Tagged the "implementation COP", COP27 is expected to be one of the largest COP summits ever hosted. It will be the transition of nations from rhetoric to concrete action. The Paris Agreement has been the subject of ongoing talks since 2015, but after the Paris Rulebook was finished at COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, implementation is anticipated to start this year. A new report from the United Nations Climate Change secretariat has indicated that the current commitments will still increase emissions by 10.6 per cent by 2030, and will spell doom for humanity if more efforts are not made by the concerned parties. COP 27 will start with the Climate Implementation Summit, which will gather over 100 world leaders scheduled for 7 and 8 November 2022. The Climate Action agenda to be discussed during COP27 will focus on bringing the world together for implementation to ensure a just and sustainable future for all. A report has shown that the combined climate pledges of 193 Parties under the Paris Agreement could put the world on track for around 2.5 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century, so it is important for the implementation summit to set the agenda. More than 50,000 attendees are registered and expected to participate in COP27 and the Egyptian Presidency has designated several key thematic days that will include pledging opportunities, discussions, roundtables, and side events. The thematic days are part of efforts to advance climate action that can address existing implementation bottlenecks and gaps and deepen engagement with youth, women, civil society and indigenous people. The Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Implementation Summit, which includes all participating heads of state and government, will begin tomorrow and last for two days. Tens of world leaders will participate in a number of roundtable discussions after the summit's opening to focus on six main issues: Just Transitions, Food Security, Innovative Finance for Climate and Development, Investing in the Future of Energy, Water Security, and Climate Change and The Sustainability of Vulnerable Communities. According to COP27 "It comes as no surprise to anyone that the COP is being held this year in a world which is witnessing political turmoil that cast a long shadow on all our nations and has resulted in energy and food crises; however, these challenges should be no reason for delaying our collective effort to fight climate change. It is inherent on us all in Sharm El Sheikh to demonstrate our recognition of the magnitude of the challenges we face and our steadfast resolve to overcome it." Mr Shoukry said Egypt provides the best framework for COP27 to coordinate and converge multiple views, promoting transparent, inclusive and fruitful discussions to achieve the best possible outcome.

SIR: Finally, the 27th United Nations , Climate Change Conference of Parties, # COP27 , in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, is here with an estimated 5,000 attendees, including world leaders, activists, and youth representatives. For the 27th year, world leaders will share more plans towards mitigating climate change disasters and a road map to keeping the earth below two degrees. Alongside other global leaders, African leaders would be expected to negotiate through an African lens. It is an essential time for Africans to make quality deliberations reflecting the torrent of situations in Africa. Although climate change is a global phenomenon, it is manifested differently in Africa. With recent disasters ranging from hunger and famine in Madagascar to the flood that swept across Nigeria, Africa is grossly unprepared. A recent publication by the World Meteorological Organisation explained that East Africa has suffered a below average 'rainfall in four consecutive wet seasons, the longest in 40 years, with indications that the current season could also be dry. As a result of the persistent drought and other compounding factors, an estimated 18.4 to 19.3 million people faced food 'crisis' or worse levels of acute food insecurity. Humanitarian agencies are warning that another below-average season will likely result in crop failure and further exacerbate the food insecurity situations in Kenya, Somalia, and Ethiopia.' 'The southern Africa region was battered by a series of cyclones over two months at the start of the year, hitting Madagascar hardest with torrential rain and devastating floods.' Over half of the 78 million people that will experience chronic hunger by 2050 will be from Africa. COP27 isn't just happening in Africa. Referring to it as the 'implementation COP', Africans need to negotiate mainly about climate finance, sustainable funding for climate justice and equity. Regarded as the 'Implementation COP,' COP27 is the fifth COP happening in Africa. At least this is strategic for Africans, and hopes are high for beneficial engagement. Beyond the euphoria and the feeling of a COP happening in Africa, what pact favours Africans from COP27 depends on what narratives Africans are bent on putting forward. In a panel discussion last year by the African Center for Economic Transformation (ACET) and AUDA-NEPAD, the African Union Development Agency, tagged; 'Climate Change: Securing Africa's Future', the Glasgow climate pact from COP26 was reviewed using the decisions to measure the progress in Africa. The discovery was the wide distance between expectations and reality in Africa. The $100 billion dollar a year committed to the Paris agreement isn't enough to offset greenhouse gas and keep the earth below 1.5 degrees. As we speak, developed countries have not been able to come through with that commitment, even though the time frame for execution was 2020. Two years behind time, climate financing has to be a priority discussion at COP27 . Power Shift Africa states, 'in the last decade, the least developed countries spent an average 14% of their domestic revenue on interest payments, compared with 3.5% in developed countries.' This constrains the countries' ability to invest in public services and worsens their credit ratings, making it harder to attract foreign investments. Lesley Ndlovu, a panellist at the ACET event, noted that '700 million people's economic activities in agriculture can be impacted by extreme weather', -but only 20-30 million farmers have sufficient prearranged financial coverage. Cesar Calderon noted that 'the impact of drought on medium-term growth is about eight times higher for countries in Africa.' As Africa struggles to attract investment, keeping its food production optimal is challenging. Africa is worst hit by pollution from the developed countries. It is a time to demand climate justice, accountable expenditures, and a roadmap for climate justice. The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, has said that the fight to defeat climate disasters and to have a liveable planet must be won this decade. COP27 is a reminder of that commitment. We can't continue like this. Let the action commence. The UK has taken the lead, promising Nigeria \Â£395 million for climate resilience. Other countries need to start putting their foot down where necessary; otherwise, this coming disaster will not spare any of us. And as the superpowers attempt to make do with their promise, Africans must not forget to demand what is right in Egypt. \</doc>

In the final hours of the formal final day of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, global youth groups including YOUNGO and Fridays for Future have demanded that polluting nations agree to pay for loss and damage. At a press conference held at the Children and Youth Pavilion at the COP27 venue, Alexia Leclercq, a 22-year-old grassroots environmental justice organiser from the US, said: 'It is historic that loss and damage are on the agenda, but that is not enough if there are no actions taken. This is why we are convened together to demand a loss and damage finance facility during this COP.' She added that 'The bare minimum of $100 billion of climate finance per year has to be delivered and extended. Year by year of rising emissions, the funding has to increase to $600 billion, which currently is the material cost of the climate crisis, and does not even take into account the culture and lives that have been taken away. Fatemah Sultan from Pakistan, a member of Fridays For Future, said: 'Coming from a developing nation-state as a young voice, we, as the global youth, stand with the most impacted communities across the global south and global north to demand polluters to pay for loss and damage. 'We are specifically supporting a funding facility to finally start implementing the necessary accountability measures. Loss and damage are reparations for the inaction of the past. Climate finance is for continued action in cities like mine in the present and the future.' SkwÂ£kwÂ£s Lillian Dunstan from Canada, of the Videa and Environment Climate Change Youth Council, added her voice to the call. She said, 'I am SkwÂ£kwÂ£s Lillian a Nlakapamux and Yakama youth from Tlkemstin, also known as Lytton, British Columbia in so-called Canada. 'Indigenous communities in so-called Canada are the most vulnerable to climate crisis-related disasters, but with the colonial structures that uphold the systemic oppression of Indigenous Peoples, we are often left waiting too long for help. 'The past two weeks I have watched global Indigenous Youth have the strength, power, and bravery to speak, to be loud, and demand to be heard within an unsafe colonial space. United with our non-Indigenous allies we are no longer waiting. No longer accepting empty promises and empty commitments. We will be loud, we will challenge, and we will demand accountability.' So far according to the latest draft cover text as of press time, negotiators at COP27 are yet to reach an agreement on loss and damage due to push-back from rich nations.

Some speakers at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 In a statement on Monday by Dharini Parthasarathy, Global Communications Lead, Climate Action Network, the speakers noted that for the first time ever in the UN climate negotiations, loss and damage finance had made it onto the agenda. The News Agency of Nigerians (NAN) reports that over 40,000 attendees are gathered at the Conference Centre, Sharm el-Sheikh, in Egypt, for COP27 . The speakers said while this was a historic moment, small island nations had been raising this issue for over 30 years, and now it was a reality following a concerted push from developing countries and civil society. According to them, the timeline to set up a loss and damage finance facility cannot be delayed till 2024 with communities on the frontline witnessing increasing climate devastation with every passing month. The speakers warned that COP27 risks becoming a greenwashing festival with large numbers of gas lobbyists expected to attend. Mohamed Adow, Founder and Director of PowerShift Africa, warned that 'the EU cannot use this opportunity to strike new deals with Africa to extract natural gas reserves to meet Western energy demands.' Read Also: # COP27 : We are on highway to climate hell, UN chief warns He cautioned that EU should not do this while defaulting on their climate pledges to enable African countries to transition to renewables and tide over the debt crisis. 'This is a new type of colonialism and gas deals involving Africa's resources cannot be determined in Berlin,' he said. Similarly, Ahmed El Droubi, Campaigns Manager for Greenpeace MENA, said COP27 was an African COP where the prevailing Global North narrative must be challenged and the voices calling for climate justice asserted. 'The Global South must seize this opportunity to consolidate our united stance to hold to account those overwhelmingly responsible for the climate disasters wreaking havoc on our vulnerable communities. 'Climate justice can be served at this COP through the establishment of a Loss and Damage funding facility, at least doubling adaptation finance in the form of grants rather than loans and strong commitments for a fossil fuel phase out in line with the 1.5c scenario. 'Climate justice cannot happen without political, economic and social justice,' he said. Adow added: 'I can sum up COP27 so far in two words - poor start. The COP in Egypt needs to learn from the mistakes that undermined COP26 in Glasgow. 'For it to be a successful African COP, the priorities of developing countries must take centre stage. We cannot claim to be tackling the climate crisis if we kick the can down the road on issues like loss and damage. Also, Tasneem Essop, Executive Director of CAN-International, noted that the context of COP27 showed a trust deficit with rich nations not following through with their commitments made on finance and Civil Society Organisations being limited on their rights to raise their voices. 'The Global South must unite behind the decision to set up a loss and damage finance facility. We are not yet defeated,' he said. Essop highlighted the human rights crisis prevailing in Egypt directly infringes on local civil society's ability to hold the powerful accountable to deliver on climate justice. \</doc>

Nigeria, Nov. 7 -- The United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) kicked off on Sunday in Egypt featuring a formal opening plenary of the conference, the 17th session of the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol and the 4th session of the meeting of the Paris Agreement at the Sharm El-Sheikh International Convention Centre. According to the schedule, the conference will run for 14 days, and on Monday and Tuesday, the first part of the high-level segment for Heads of State and Government during the Conference will take place. This two-day event which is called the Climate Implementation Summit, a gathering to implement and transform key climate-related decisions into concrete actions and credible plans, continue raising ambition, building up from previous Conference of the Parties, including the Glasgow COP 26 outcomes. The summit will keep the high-level commitment on climate change issues, with an aim to fight back against climate emergency and is aimed at promoting coordinated action to tackle climate change. Heads of State and Government from over 100 countries are expected to have arrived in Sharm El-Sheikh on either Sunday evening or Monday morning, after which other negotiations will be done by their representatives, environment ministers, or other high-ranking officials. Sameh Shoukry, Egypt's Foreign Minister and COP27 President will act as a neutral arbiter of the 196 nations attending the summit. In his speech on Sunday, while addressing climate envoys and delegates, he said: "It comes as no surprise to anyone that the COP is being held this year in a world which is witnessing political turmoil that casts a long shadow on all our nations and has resulted in energy and food crises; however these challenges should be no reason for delaying our collective effort to fight climate change." The Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Implementation Summit will focus on six main issues spread across roundtables to be held in parallel with high-level side events. The issues to discuss include Just Transitions, Food Security, Innovative Finance for Climate and Development, Investing in the Future of Energy, Water Security, and Climate Change, and The Sustainability of Vulnerable Communities. During the Climate Implementation Summit, Heads of State and Government will be invited to deliver national statements. This will form the first part of the high-level segment.

Oando Clean Energy Limited is to speak at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) themed 'Delivering for People and the Planet' which kicked off in Sharm El Sheik, Egypt, on Sunday, November 6. The event will host more than 45,000 registered COP27 participants representing parties, the United Nations (UN), regional non-governmental and intergovernmental organisations, businesses, the scientific community, local communities as well as civil society to jointly enhance and accelerate the implementation of climate action and follow up on collective commitments and pledges. Oando in a statement on Sunday said the event tagged 'Africa's COP', couldn't have been hosted in Africa at a better time, as Africa is no stranger to the disproportionate impact of climate change. 'The continent contributes only 3 percent to greenhouse gas emissions but suffers disproportionately from its negative impacts. Today, Africa loses between $7 billion and $15 billion annually to climate change, and according to Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank, 'If things don't change, it will be $50 billion a year by 2030.' Last year, Madagascar became the first country on earth to suffer a famine solely due to the impact of climate change. By 2050, climate change will lead to an additional 78 million people experiencing chronic hunger - over half of them in Africa. Therefore, Egypt hosting COP27 is significant and incredibly important for Africa and the rest of the world,' Oando said in the statement. It added that as Africa's largest economy and most populous nation, Nigeria will be actively participating in COP27 with the minister of environment, Mohammed Abdullahi amongst other Nigerian stakeholders scheduled to attend. In the private sector, Oando Clean Energy Limited (OCEL), the renewable energy subsidiary of Oando plc will also be in attendance. Recall that at COP26 in Glasgow, President Muhammadu Buhari, pledged that Nigeria would reach net zero carbon emissions by 2060. Part of the discourse this year will be reviewing where countries are in relation to the commitments they made in 2021. OCEL will join key renewable players across the African public and private sectors to reiterate the role the continent is playing in supporting global targets and creating a more sustainable future. Specifically, OCEL in partnership with the Federal Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, National Council on Climate Change (NCCC), Renewable Energy Association of Nigeria (REAN), and Stratus Consult Limited, will lead two dialogues at the Nigeria pavilion. The first dialogue themed 'Decarbonising an oil-rich region: A case for the Niger Delta, Nigeria's will hold on Thursday, November 10, and the second, 'Achieving Nigeria's Net Zero Target: A public-private partnership' will take place on Friday, November 11. These events will showcase the investments the company is making in renewable energy in Nigeria and the importance of public-private partnerships in enabling the nation to actualise its industrialisation goals whilst at the same time supporting the achievement of global climate change ambitions. If COP26 was about countries making promises to avoid catastrophic climate change, the broader themes in Egypt will be moving from ambition to action, especially in Africa,' the statement said. \</doc>

In an open letter to parties and observers at the forthcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference tagged COP27 in Egypt, Sameh Shoukry, Egypt's Minister of Foreign Affairs and COP27 President-designate, has said the conference will aim to restore the 'grand bargain' at the centre of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement is an international treaty on climate change adopted in 2015. In the letter made public on Thursday ahead of COP27 which runs from November 6 to 18 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, Shoukry stated that, 'We aim to restore the 'grand bargain' at the centre of the Paris Agreement and our collective multilateral climate process - whereby developing countries agreed to increase their efforts to tackle a crisis for which they are far less responsible, in return for appropriate financial support and other means of implementation as per the agreement in the Convention and the Paris agreement.' Calling for greater cooperation, the COP27 president said, 'The climate crisis needs dedicated efforts by all, from heads of states and governments to young climate activists and advocates, from multinationals and major stakeholders to small community groups at local level. 'We as international community have agreed and recognized that the magnitude of the climate challenge requires an inclusive partnership and collaboration amongst all stakeholders to deliver the action we need now in a people-centred and an all of society approach that ensures that no one is left behind. 'As negotiators, we are here to transition from words to actions and to take meaningful and tangible steps to implement the robust system which we have painstakingly created including most recently in Glasgow- the Paris Agreement Work Programme - in a balanced manner. ' COP27 He explained that 'the Sharm El Sheikh Implementation Summit will feature six roundtable discussions which will focus on enhancing implementation across six priority issues. These roundtables will provide the opportunity for heads of state to engage with heads of UN agencies, multilateral development banks, CEOs of private institutions and representatives of civil society with the aim of developing practical, impactful and ambitious solutions to several of the climate challenges spanning mitigation, adaptation and finance. 'In addition, we want all stakeholders to make their voices heard, showcase solutions, and effectively engage in this critical global conversation on implementing climate action, with a strong focus on just transition. We have also worked with our sisters and brothers in Africa to provide for the broadest possible participation of African and Egyptian NGOs, bringing the grassroot voices of the global south closer to the climate process and its parties. \</doc>

The 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ), underway in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, opened with sombre speeches reflecting the mood of the people on the host continent, Africa. The climate change crisis manifested in catastrophic flooding in Nigeria, deadly drought in Somalia and raging cyclone Idai that tore through Madagascar, Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. How death of friends exposed rot in Niger hospitals The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, said, 'Humanity has a choice: cooperate or perish. It is either a climate solidarity pact or a collective suicide pact.' Speaking to over 100 world leaders reunited for the first official plenary of the climate conference, the UN chief insisted that the proposed pact would see all countries making extra efforts to reduce emissions; wealthier nations and international financial institutions providing assistance to emerging economies; ending dependence on fossil fuels and the building of coal plants; providing sustainable energy for all and uniting to combine strategy and capacities for the benefit of humankind. He reiterated that a 'clear, time-bound roadmap' for loss and damage that delivered 'effective institutional arrangements for financing' was a priority. The major issue for Nigeria would be how to de-fossilise its energy source; and transition from dirty and deadly fossil fuels to clean and sustainable energy. The Nigeria Energy Transition Plan, a pathway to reducing carbon emissions, requires $1.9 trillion up to 2060 to be implemented; and that raises the question: where will the funding come from? Already, Nigeria's Minister of Environment, Barr Mohammed Abdullahi, prioritised climate finance and partnership building during his pre-COP speech, but there are concerns by experts that the big polluters are backsliding on commitments to slash global emissions by 45 per cent by 2030, compared to 2010's levels. Reducing emissions is key to tackling the climate change crisis generally, and it is a precursor to a commitment to meeting the targets of the 2015 Paris Agreement - limiting warming to 1.5\'b0C above late-19th century levels. The Ecologist, a United Kingdom-based publication, quoting the Global Carbon Budget 2022, said 'Global carbon emissions in 2022 remain at record levels - with no sign of the decrease that is urgently needed to limit warming to 1.5\'b0C, according to the Global Carbon Project science team.' Some predictions warn that current trends will see carbon pollution actually increase by 10 per cent at the end of the decade, and a 2.8\'b0C increase. This scenario paints a bleak picture for Nigeria, especially for a country with a culture of profligacy in handling public funds and haphazard planning and implementation of policies. The manner in which the country, which depends largely on fossil fuels for its revenue, handled the Ogoni cleanup, has raised suspicions that it is ill-prepared to tackle de-fossilisation and the emerging climate crisis. However, Barr Abdullahi, who is the head of Nigeria's delegation to the COP 27 , said, 'We are focused on ensuring that we bring the issue of loss and damage to the fore, and we are already making progress in this regard, because during the pre-Cop engagement, the COP 27 President, Sameh Shoukry, highlighted flood-related issues with particular reference to Nigeria and Pakistan, among other nations. 'Already, the issue of flooding is linked to loss and damage, and that is of priority to us as a nation.' He said that the Nigerian delegation would also focus on the African carbon market initiative as it tried to kick start the framework for carbon trading, adding that similar attention would be given to the issue of debt for climate swap aimed at calling the attention of developed countries on the impact of their industrialisation on the developing countries and the need for them to mitigate the impact on the continent of Africa and Nigeria in particular. He further said, 'In addition, Nigeria, as the leader of the PAN African Agency for the Great Green Wall, will focus on climate finance to support its activities in the Sahel Region, particularly in the most endemic northern states described as the frontline states where there is fast approaching desert encroachment and, of course, wetland drying up. These and others are huge issues that we will be focusing on.' Professor Abdullahi Bashir, a climate change expert from the Modibbo Adama University of Technology (MAUTECH), Yola, Adamawa State, said accountability and transparency were key in driving and implementing a robust climate change agenda for Nigeria. He said, 'Accountability and transparency is very important, not only because of donor funds but for the sake of ourselves. Nigeria needs to provide a good framework for accountability and it should be transparent in a manner that whatever money is spent in relation to mitigating or adapting to the effects of climate change can be seen. 'The most prioritised areas should be given more attention, and the priority should be right; not buying cars and building offices in the name of climate finance, whereas people needing intervention, are left unattended to.' Meanwhile, the Global Initiative for Food Security and Ecosystem Preservation (GIFSEP), with the support of 350 Africa in partnership with the Activists for Climate Justice Coalition, has urged Nigerians to vote for only candidates that understand climate change issues. Team Lead of GIFSEP, David Terungwa, said, 'Climate action is critical to the survival of democracy and for sustainable development. We are worried! We are so worried that climate change is under-represented in the campaigns for the 2023 general elections so far. 'Climate change issues are too important to be left in the hands of deniers. And that is why we are calling on citizens, especially those in communities impacted by climate change, to ensure that they collect their PVCs and look beyond empty campaign promises and other forms of inducement to vote for candidates that understand climate change issues and have a climate action plan.' The recent floods in Nigeria have ravaged communities, killing over 600 people, displacing over two million others, while farms have been washed away, thereby threatening food security. Ahead of the conference, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, while welcoming parties, said, 'Egypt will spare no effort to ensure that COP27 becomes the moment when the world moved from negotiation to implementation and where words were translated to actions, and where we collectively embark on a path towards sustainability, a just transition, and eventually a greener future for coming generations.' Now, Nigerians anticipate that the conference will be a chastening and awakening for authorities to religiously implement the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and that, the National Council on Climate Change will implement policies of the council to engender a sustainable and livable environment. \</doc>

The Commonwealth Secretary-General, the Rt Hon Patricia Scotland KC, has called on member countries to uphold global climate change commitments and take decisive action to tackle the gaps in implementation, ahead of next week's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ). At the summit, Secretary-General Scotland will advocate for ramped-up climate action through more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), national plans and targets. She will also seek to amplify the shared concerns of the 56 Commonwealth countries, including crucial issues around climate finance, sustainable energy transition, loss and damage, and partnerships and coordinated action. Ahead of her arrival in Egypt on 5th November, the Secretary-General stated: &ldquo; COP27 takes place in the midst of overlapping, interlinked and accelerating global challenges. The lasting impacts of COVID-19 combine with the effects of conflict, including in Ukraine, to destabilise global economic, energy and food systems.\\xa0 Against this backdrop, the climate crisis has continued to worsen, and its profound impacts are being felt by families, communities and countries across the Commonwealth. &ldquo;I understand the pressure world leaders are under, but I urge all decision-makers, advocates and allies at COP27 to ensure the promises already made are delivered, and accelerate efforts to mitigate and adapt to the urgent threat of climate change. We must never lose sight of the crushing consequences of inaction, for the for the millions who face the dangers of climate change every day, and for generations to come. We need urgent action now.&rdquo; Thirty-two of the total 56 Commonwealth member countries are small states, including 25 small island developing states, while 14 are classified as least developed countries &ndash; among the poorest and most vulnerable in the world. Commonwealth heads of government recognise that developing countries, least developed countries and small island developing states are particularly at risk of their development gains being reversed by the impacts of climate change. During their meeting in Kigali, Rwanda in June, they called on developed countries to deliver on their promise to jointly mobilise US$100 billion per year to support developing countries in coping with climate change, stressing the importance of transparency in implementing their pledges. The Secretary-General added: &ldquo;We must build on the substantive progress made at the previous COP26 summit, and urgently translate these commitments into action. Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 45 per cent by 2030. But to achieve this, developing countries will need enhanced support.&rdquo; The COP27 HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3T5X03O https://bit.ly/3T5X03O HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3A8WuLR https://bit.ly/3A8WuLR \</doc>

Africa's energy requirements in the face of a world transitioning to renewable energy to keep the 'global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius,' tops the agenda at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), in Sharm El Sheik, Egypt. The hypocrisy of the rich world in asking that poor countries similarly adopt cleaner energy technologies when even for dirty fuels, they are yet to be self-sufficient, is writ large. Even so, the opportunity of adding renewable sources into an African energy mix that has barely made much use of its vast fossil fuel reserves is widely acknowledged. In the almost three decades of COP summits, there has been a trend of shifting goal posts. Pledges have been made routinely with little to show for. Estimates of the costs of successfully transitioning developing countries to renewable energy sources by 2050 range from $1-2trillion. Rich countries fell short of their annual $100 billion climate financing commitment made to developing countries by as much as $17 billion in 2020, according to data by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Africa contributes less than 5 percent to global carbon emissions and yet, it suffers most as a result of climate change. Thus, it is imperative that global stakeholders agree on concessions for Africa at COP27 that ensure that the continent is able to make the transition as painlessly as possible Africa contributes less than 5 percent to global carbon emissions and yet, it suffers most as a result of climate change. Thus, it is imperative that global stakeholders agree on concessions for Africa at COP27 that ensure that the continent is able to make the transition as painlessly as possible. Climate reparations and compensation by rich countries to their poor counterparts, which are most affected by the effects of carbon emissions from the rich world's pollution, is on the agenda at COP27 , the first time it will be formally tabled since the first COP meeting in Berlin, Germany, in March 1995. In the face of its longstanding energy poverty, what should Africa's position be at COP27 ? This is the key question I address in the research paper. COP and the African energy dilemma Sufficiency in fossil fuels, which are relatively abundant and cheaper, for their energy requirements has eluded most African countries thus far. It is hard to imagine that renewables will be any different for Africa, as the world aims for net zero carbon emissions by 2050. It is unrealistic to expect African countries to give up fossil fuels within such an ambitious timeframe. Still, many African governments launched their energy transition plans well ahead of COP27 , where they expect to secure concessions of a time-bound continued usage of fossil fuels as well as financing to successfully transition to greener energy sources. In August 2022, Nigeria launched a $410 billion energy transition plan that aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2060, with an annual $10 billion financing requirement, for instance. A shift to renewable energy will come at significant costs to many African countries. First, there will be redundancies in the traditional extractive industry even as new jobs get created in the green economy. Second, there is the real possibility that much of fossil fuel assets could remain stranded - thus denying governments much needed revenue. It is simply unrealistic to expect that rich countries will fund the annual $1.3trillion financing requirement that is estimated Africa will need from 2025 onward to meet its climate action goals, when an earlier commitment of $100billion a year turned out to be just hot air. Thus, while plans by poor nations under the aegis of the Climate Vulnerable Forum to push for compensation from rich countries for increasing incidences of floods and droughts at COP27 are justifiable, it will hardly materialise into action if past antecedents of rich countries on climate action reparations and financing are anything to go by. Even so, the European Union signalled in late October 2022 that it would be willing to negotiate climate reparations for poor countries at COP27 , which is why it agreed to its inclusion on the agenda. Several ideas are being mooted about how rich countries could better fulfill their climate financing commitments. The bumper profits of oil and gas companies could be taxed by their rich parent countries to pay for the negative externalities of their industry on the planet, Oxfam International suggests, for instance. In any case, the African Union (AU) will be insisting that the continent be allowed to continue using all forms of energy sources available to its member countries towards development. This is not entirely peculiar, as even Germany resorted to coal when its energy poverty was as low as 30% talk less the African case of over 70 percent. There is certainly now a 'need to find the nexus of transition energy and energy poverty,' according to Bogolo Kenewendo, the Africa director of the UN Climate Change High-Level Champions initiative.

AVEVA, a global industrial software provider, will highlight how digital technologies can support public-private partnerships and unlock innovation to close the implementation gap on climate change at COP27 . The United Nations Climate Change Conference 2022 is being held on November 6-18 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. A sponsor of the parallel Climate Action Innovation Zone, AVEV believes trusted data-led technologies are essential to decarbonization, driving responsible use of the world's resources and delivering innovative, climate-forward products in the net-zero economy. AVEVA is one of the first 50 companies in the world to have its net-zero commitments validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). AVEVA's presence at COP27 will be led by some of its most prominent climate advocates: Amish Sabharwal, Executive Vice-President - Engineering and Simulation and member of AVEVA's Executive Leadership Team; Lisa Wee, Global Head of Sustainability; and Nayef Bou Chaaya, Vice-President - Middle East, Africa and Turkey. During a number of thought-provoking sessions at the Sustainable Innovation Forum 2022, being held alongside COP27 , the AVEVA executives will use real-life examples to showcase how digital technologies are unlocking opportunities in the net-zero economy. On November 9, broadcaster Nik Gowing will interview Wee in the context of her role as a climate leader. She will share insights from the frontline of climate change mitigation and offer real-life examples of how AVEVA and its partners are paying it forward by co-innovating climate-responsive technological solutions to help usher in a zero-carbon economy. 'At AVEVA we recognize that we can drive exponential impact through the products we bring to market while supporting our customers on their decarbonization journey,' Wee said. 'Now, our thinking has moved beyond measuring and managing our carbon footprint to considering our sustainability handprint. This positive contribution to sustainability through business activities and partnerships is a way of paying it forward to secure a better future for humanity and our planet.' Also on November 9, Bou Chaaya will amplify the discussion around innovation in the face of climate change in a high-level spotlight session, with case studies of how global organizations are responding to - and taking advantage of - the opportunities arising from the focus on net-zero targets. In addition, Sabharwal will join a plenary panel on November 10. Alongside UN executives, he will seek to explain why climate change mitigation represents our biggest opportunity yet. 'UN data shows that immediate action can halve greenhouse gas emissions (GHG emissions) by 2030 and put us on track to achieving our goal of keeping global temperature increases to 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. At the same time, we are facing our biggest opportunity yet. Climate change is accelerating the fourth industrial revolution and nowhere is that more obvious than in the communities and industries here in Africa,' Sabharwal said. \</doc>

Nigeria, Aug. 29 -- As Africa gets set to host the 27th edition of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in November (6-18) this year, it offers another golden opportunity for Africa's most populous country-Nigeria, to intensify its "mitigation and adaptation" proactive measures towards achieving its Net-zero emission targets by 2060. During the COP26 held in Glasgow (Scotland), last year, President Muhammadu Buhari announced a 2060 net-zero emissions target. "Desertification in the north, drought in the centre, pollution in the coast are enough evidence for all to see, Nigeria is committed to net zero by 2060," Mr Buhari said while delivering his speech at the conference. In November later that year, he signed into law the Climate Change Act, which commits the Federal Government to measurable action plans for climate change mitigation and adaptation. This subsequently led to the appointment of Salisu Dahiru as the pioneer Director-General (DG) and Chief Executive officer (CEO) of the national council on climate change eight months after. Likewise, on 24 August, Nigeria launched the Energy Transition Plan (ETP), a multipronged strategy developed for the achievement of net-zero emissions from the nation's energy consumption. The COP is the supreme decision-making body of the Convention. All States that are Parties to the Convention are represented at the COP, at which they review the implementation of the Convention and any other legal instruments that the COP adopts. At the meeting, the Parties take decisions necessary to promote the effective implementation of the Convention, including institutional and administrative arrangements. According to the United Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a key task for the COP is to review the national communications and emission inventories submitted by Parties. Based on this information, the COP assesses the effects of the measures taken by Parties and the progress made in achieving the ultimate objective of the Convention. The COP meets every year, unless the Parties decide otherwise. Its first meeting was held in Berlin, Germany in March, 1995. As world leaders are preparing to assemble at the Sharm el-Sheikh International Convention Centre (SHICC), Egypt, for COP27 this year, sustainable environmental practices advocates in Nigeria say this will make a good avenue for Nigeria and other African countries to cut a better deal amidst a profound surge in the negative impacts of Climate Change in the continent. Global Initiative for Food Security and Ecosystem Preservation (GIFSEP) Executive Director, David Michael, said Nigeria should take a leading role at COP 27 in ensuring that Africa speaks with one voice. He said as the continent's biggest economy, Nigeria should join hands with other African countries to make clear demands on the need for "Climate Finance and Loss and Damage." "Few days ago Nigeria launched the Energy Transition Plan and this plan will be enabled by finance. Without climate finance, Nigeria and other developing countries cannot achieve their zero emissions targets," he said. COP27 is "partnership and funding". He said Nigeria is on board to achieve its Net-Zero emission target by 2060 but there is a need to deploy capital on a massive scale for this to be achieved. "No doubt the Nigerian economy has been largely affected by the fluctuating oil price. However, to achieve what we have pledged to do, partnerships and funding will make a difference in driving Nigeria towards a Net Zero Emission target," Mr Adeojo said. He noted that adaptation funding is crucial in various sectors such agriculture and energy and that Nigeria needs to invest more in smart agriculture, renewable energy, hydro and bio-gas. "In my view, Egypt COP27 presents an opportunity for Nigeria to secure more partnerships and have more inflow of capital targeted towards adaptation as well as mitigation. If this is actualised Nigeria would be on the fast lane to achieving its set target," he added. Analysis by SBMIntel, an Africa focused research firm, revealed that about 79 per cent of Nigerian farmers who grow fruits, vegetables, cassava and maize were estimated to have been affected by the ravaging effects of extreme climatic events (drought and flooding) in 2020. The research, which was conducted in seven states of the country, showed that the harvests of 26.3 per cent of Nigerian farmers were greatly affected by extreme weather conditions. Of the seven states surveyed, the report noted that the majority of the respondents (73.7% of farmers) had their farms in the South-west States, 10.5 per cent had their farms in Benue and the remaining 15.9 per cent were distributed between Nasarawa, Osun and Katsina states respectively.

As the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) enters its final week, which will see tense negotiations and important decisions being made, African Ministers of the Environment have established a common position to drive and negotiate for loss and damage, just energy transition, food security, climate finance, land degradation, and biodiversity conservation. A high-level consultative meeting of African environment ministers was held in Sharm El-Sheikh to reinforce the African position, hear from African negotiators, and set a single route for harmonization before the final round of negotiations. This is when the reiterated appeal for a unified African position was made. The head of the Nigerian delegation at COP27 , the Minister of Environment, Mohammed Abdullahi, reiterated that Nigeria will take a position in line with the rest of Africa. He stated that Nigeria was seeking resolutions on loss and damage, climate finance, and biodiversity conservation. 'We are not going to take a new position and that is why we are here at the level of African ministers of the environment to meet and harmonize our position especially focusing on loss and damage. 'You are quite aware of the devastating flood in Nigeria and other parts of the world, basically Nigeria remains focused on loss and damage, climate finance, and biodiversity conservation. We are on course in our position. 'We are also putting pressure on developed countries to ensure that commitments are firmed and implementable,' Abdullahi stated. Also speaking to the issue, Zambia's Minister of Green Economy and Environment, Collins Nzovu, who also leads the African Group of Negotiators, said: 'Our presidents have been engaging my president, President Hakainde Hichilema, and he has been engaging the other world leaders. 'President Macky Sall of Senegal has been chairing the various engagements they engage at the highest level. So we believe that the presidents have been doing their part. Remember, it's economic diplomacy, it's development, diplomacy - climate diplomacy! What value do you extract from everybody else? How do you make them account for mitigation as well? 'What we've been basically telling them is, can you increase your ambition? Because we are experiencing these devastating effects, how do you increase on ambition? Again, that's a topic which our leaders at the presidential level have been taking on adaptation. 'I'm sure you know that our demand has been that adaptation finances be increased, actually, that is doubled. And that they come through with $100 billion. 'We've also been pushing the agenda on loss and damage. So for us, when we see all of this, the movement there, we are happy. 'However, we can only be happier when the funds start flowing.'

African climate activists have expressed their displeasure over the new Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI) launched at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, as well as other propositions considered to be false solutions to the climate crisis. COP27 . The ACMI has a 13-member steering committee of African leaders, CEOs, and carbon credit experts, who believe the initiative will support the growth of carbon credits production, create jobs and protect biodiversity in Africa, according to a press release the group issued. The initiative is also said to be targeting over 1.5 billion credits annually in Africa by 2050, leveraging over $120 billion and supporting over 110 million jobs. The Africa carbon markets initiative is also part of the agenda for Nigeria at COP27 , according to the Minister of Environment, Mohammed Abdullahi. However, activists have called it Â£ further distraction from the real solution to climate change.' Nnimmo Bassey, Director, Health of Mother Earth Foundation, said: 'This initiative is a disincentive to progress in cutting down on emissions. Carbon trade is simply business at the expense of the planet. Unfortunately, the fossil fuel industry backed by Global North governments have found willing partners in African leaders who have shockingly decided to close their ears to the cries of their people carrying the biggest burdens of the climate crisis' Akinbode Oluwafemi, Executive Director of Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA) said: 'It is disheartening that at a time when the crucial discussion is about voluntarily cutting down on emissions African leaders are again embracing a false solution that licences and encourages pollution to continue.' Ndivile Mokohena, Gender CC, South Africa said: 'As African leaders drift in every wrong direction at the whim of the fossil fuel industry and their enablers, people on the continent continue to suffer. Leaving the fossils in the ground is the faultless path that the world continues to ignore. This carbon market initiative is disappointing.' Kwami Kpondzo, Friends of the Earth Togo said: 'It would seem African leaders are determined not to learn from their mistakes of the past. For a fictional initiative that keeps Africa locked in the fossil fuels trap to be conceived as at a time that Africa is on the grip of climate crisis is totally inconceivable and unacceptable.' On Wednesday, activists held a protest in the Blue Zone of COP27 demanding an end to the pursuit of false solutions. These false solutions include the concepts of carbon markets upon which the ACMI is based; the geoengineering solutions like cloud seeding, REDD+, among others. 'They are tricks. What we have done is to go further and subject some of these so-called solutions to scientific analysis, and we have realised that they are totally false.'

The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 'This outcome moves us forward,' said Simon Stiell, UN Climate Change Executive Secretary. 'We have determined a way forward on a decades-long conversation on funding for loss and damage - deliberating over how we address the impacts on communities whose lives and livelihoods have been ruined by the very worst impacts of climate change.' After days of intense negotiations and set against a difficult geopolitical backdrop, COP27 resulted in countries delivering a package of decisions that reaffirmed their commitment to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The package also strengthened action by countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the inevitable impacts of climate change, as well as boosting the support of finance, technology and capacity building needed by developing countries, the United Nations said in a press release. Creating a specific fund for loss and damage marked an important point of progress, with the issue added to the official agenda and adopted for the first time at COP27 . Alex Scott, E3G Climate Diplomacy and Geopolitics Programme Lead said: 'Strong diplomacy from small, climate vulnerable countries, and late compromise led by Europe renewed the High Ambition Coalition to secure a few steps forward on climate action. Political leaders addressed climate impacts, but are still not up to the task of transitioning away from fossil fuels. In one crucial step forward, the deal makes strong calls for broader international finance system reform. While far beyond the decision-making power of the climate COP, but a sign of the power of bringing small vulnerable countries like Barbados to the foreground - to lead the way through chaos.' Governments took the ground-breaking decision to establish new funding arrangements, as well as a dedicated fund, to assist developing countries in responding to loss and damage. Governments also agreed to establish a 'transitional committee' to make recommendations on how to operationalize both the new funding arrangements and the fund at COP28 next year. The first meeting of the transitional committee is expected to take place before the end of March 2023. Parties also agreed on the institutional arrangements to operationalize the Santiago Network for Loss and Damage, to catalyze technical assistance to developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. COP27 saw significant progress on adaptation, with governments agreeing on the way to move forward on the Global Goal on Adaptation, which will conclude at COP28 and inform the first Global Stocktake, improving resilience amongst the most vulnerable. New pledges, totaling more than USD 230 million, were made to the Adaptation Fund at COP27 . COP27 President Sameh Shoukry announced the Sharm el-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda, enhancing resilience for people living in the most climate-vulnerable communities by 2030. UN Climate Change's Standing Committee on Finance was requested to prepare a report on doubling adaptation finance for consideration at COP28 next year. The cover decision, known as the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan, highlights that a global transformation to a low-carbon economy is expected to require investments of at least USD 4-6 trillion a year. Delivering such funding will require a swift and comprehensive transformation of the financial system and its structures and processes, engaging governments, central banks, commercial banks, institutional investors and other financial actors. Serious concern was expressed that the goal of developed country Parties to mobilize jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020 has not yet been met, with developed countries urged to meet the goal, and multilateral development banks and international financial institutions called on to mobilize climate finance. At COP27 'In this text we have been given reassurances that there is no room for backsliding,' said Stiell. 'It gives the key political signals that indicate the phasedown of all fossil fuels is happening.' The World Leaders Summit, held over two days during the first week of the conference, convened six high-level roundtable discussions. The discussions highlighted solutions - on themes including food security, vulnerable communities and just transition - to chart a path to overcome climate challenges and how to provide the finance, resources and tools to effectively deliver climate action at scale. COP27 brought together more than 45,000 participants to share ideas, solutions, and build partnerships and coalitions. Indigenous peoples, local communities, cities and civil society, including youth and children, showcased how they are addressing climate change and shared how it impacts their lives. The decisions taken here today also reemphasize the critical importance of empowering all stakeholders to engage in climate action; in particular through the five-year action plan on Action for Climate Empowerment and the intermediate review of the Gender Action Plan. These outcomes will allow all Parties to work together to address imbalances in participation and provide stakeholders with the tools required to drive greater and more inclusive climate action at all levels. Young people in particular were given greater prominence at COP27 , with UN Climate Change's Executive Secretary promising to urge governments to not just listen to the solutions put forward by young people, but to incorporate those solutions in decision and policy making. Young people made their voices heard through the first-of-its-kind pavilion for children and youth, as well as the first-ever youth-led Climate Forum. In parallel with the formal negotiations, the Global Climate Action space at COP27 provided a platform for governments, businesses and civil society to collaborate and showcase their real-world climate solutions. The UN Climate Change High-Level Champions held a two-week programme of more than 50 events. This included a number of major African-led initiatives to cut emissions and build climate resilience, and significant work on the mobilization of finance. 'We have a series of milestones ahead. We must pull together, with resolve, through all processes, may they be national, regional, or others such as the G20. Every single milestone matters and builds momentum,' said Stiell. 'The next step for change is just around the corner, with the United Arab Emirates' stewardship of the First Global Stocktake. For the very first time we will take stock of the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It will independently evaluate the progress we have made and if our goals are adequate. It will inform what everybody, every single day, everywhere in the world, needs to do, to avert the climate crisis.' Stiell reminded delegates in the closing plenary that the world is in a critical decade for climate action. A stark report from UN Climate Change underpinned his remarks, as well as discussions throughout the two-week conference. According to the report, implementation of current pledges by national governments put the world on track for a 2.5\'b0C warmer world by the end of the century. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicates that greenhouse gas emissions must decline 45% by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C. COP27 President Sameh Shoukry said: 'The work that we've managed to do here in the past two weeks, and the results we have together achieved, are a testament to our collective will, as a community of nations, to voice a clear message that rings loudly today, here in this room and around the world: that multilateral diplomacy still works.... despite the difficulties and challenges of our times, the divergence of views, level of ambition or apprehension, we remain committed to the fight against climate change.... we rose to the occasion, upheld our responsibilities and undertook the important decisive political decisions that millions around the world expect from us.' Speaking about the year ahead, Stiell said UN Climate Change will help Parties and future COP Presidencies to navigate this path to the new phase of implementation. A summary of some of the other key outcomes of COP27 follows below. Technology COP27 saw the launch of a new five-year work program at COP27 to promote climate technology solutions in developing countries. Mitigation COP27 significantly advanced the work on mitigation. A mitigation work programme was launched in Sharm el-Sheikh, aimed at urgently scaling up mitigation ambition and implementation. The work programme will start immediately following COP27 and continue until 2030, with at least two global dialogues held each year. Governments were also requested to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their national climate plans by the end of 2023, as well as accelerate efforts to phasedown unabated coal power and phase-out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. The decision text recognizes that the unprecedented global energy crisis underlines the urgency to rapidly transform energy systems to be more secure, reliable, and resilient, by accelerating clean and just transitions to renewable energy during this critical decade of action. Global Stocktake Delegates at the UN Climate Change Conference COP27 wrapped up the second technical dialogue of the first global stocktake, a mechanism to raise ambition under the Paris Agreement. The UN Secretary-General will convene a 'climate ambition summit' in 2023, ahead of the conclusion of the stocktake at COP28 next year. Other announcements The conference heard many announcements. Countries launched a package of 25 new collaborative actions in five key areas: power, road transport, steel, hydrogen and agriculture. The UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres announced a USD 3.1 billion plan to ensure everyone on the planet is protected by early warning systems within the next five years. The UN Secretary-General's High-Level Expert Group on Net-Zero Commitments published a report at COP27 , serving as a how-to guide to ensure credible, accountable net-zero pledges by industry, financial institutions, cities and regions. A G7-led plan called the Global Shield Financing Facility was launched at COP27 to provide funding to countries suffering climate disasters. Announcing a total of USD 105.6 million in new funding, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Walloon Region of Belgium, stressed the need for even more support for the Global Environment Facility funds targeting the immediate climate adaptation needs of low-lying and low-income states. The new Indonesia Just Energy Transition Partnership, announced at the G20 Summit held in parallel with COP27 , will mobilize USD 20 billion over the next three to five years to accelerate a just energy transition. Important progress was made on forest protection with the launch of the Forest and Climate Leaders' Partnership, which aims to unite action by governments, businesses and community leaders to halt forest loss and land degradation by 2030. \</doc>

The federal government is seeking effective collaboration between Nigeria and other West African countries on energy transition. Vice President Yemi Osinbajo made the call Monday in Abuja while declaring open the two-day International Energy Transition Week, Nigeria-ECOWAS Sustainable Energy Forum (ESEF) 2022, themed, 'Achieving Sustainable Energy Targets in the ECOWAS Region: Moving from Resilience to Transition'. Osinbajo, represented by the Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu, restated the call on developed countries to bridge the disparity in energy investments. He said, "Of the $2.8 trillion invested in renewable energy from 2000 to 2020, only about 2%, or $60 billion, came to Africa. "The West African region received just 7% of that, about USD4 billion. To reach our goals, sufficient capital must be made available in the region, and we must do our part in creating the enabling environment for these funds. "This is a crucial time for us to collaborate as neighbours and work interdependently, leveraging on our cooperation and abundant energy resources to secure for ourselves and our children a sustainable energy market for the socio-economic development of the region. "In particular, we must work together on strategies and reforms needed to crowd in the investments required for real and impactful projects and progress on the ground. Lack of access to finance remains the biggest challenge for accelerating action on energy access and climate goals in Africa." Osinbajo recalled that at COP26, in Glasgow, President Muhammadu Buhari made a commitment on behalf of Nigeria to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060/ He added that "The realisation of this goal depends on the implementation of our nation's Energy Transition Plan (ETP) which was recently launched by this administration." Daily Trust reports that the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as COP27 , will be held November 6-18, 2022 at Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The Ambassador of Spain to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Juan Ignacio Sell, said energy poverty and security needed to be addressed to achieve sustainable energy transition. "The EU is planning to allocate 600 million euros to the sustainable energy sector in West Africa alone," he said. Speaking during a panel discussion on 'Fostering Energy Transition Investment in West Africa', Aliyu said his ministry was working hard to raise the operational capacity of the country's national grid through the Presidential Power Initiative (PPI). \</doc>

The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 finally came to a close on Sunday with a breakthrough agreement to provide 'loss and damage' funding for developing countries that are vulnerable to climate disasters. The lack of agreement on Loss and Damage among other issues kept the negotiations going beyond the scheduled end date of November 18 for COP27 . Speaking at the closing plenary, COP27 President, Sameh Shoukry said: 'The work that we've managed to do here in the past two weeks, and the results we have together achieved, are a testament to our collective will, as a community of nations, to voice a clear message that rings loudly today, here in this room and around the world: that multilateral diplomacy still works.... despite the difficulties and challenges of our times, the divergence of views, level of ambition or apprehension, we remain committed to the fight against climate change.... we rose to the occasion, upheld our responsibilities and undertook the important decisive political decisions that millions around the world expect from us.' He added that 'This was not easy. We worked around the clock. Long days and nights. Strained and sometimes tense, but united and working for one aim, one higher purpose, one common goal that we all subscribe to and aspire to achieve. In the end, we delivered. 'This outcome moves us forward,' said Simon Stiell, UN Climate Change Executive Secretary in a statement. 'We have determined a way forward on a decades-long conversation on funding for loss and damage - deliberating over how we address the impacts on communities whose lives and livelihoods have been ruined by the very worst impacts of climate change.'

Nine-year-old Keran Kimani, the youngest delegate at the ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) holding in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, will be receiving funding from the President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Mr Akinwunmi Adesina, through his foundation for her tree-planting project. Kimani was present at the African Pavilion, where the AfDB was hosting a side event on Thursday. The side event was the awards ceremony for the African Youth Adaptation Solutions Challenge (YouthAdapt Challenge). The challenge is an annual competition and awards programme for youth-led enterprises (50 per cent women-led) jointly organised by the Global Centre on Adaptation (GCA), Climate Investment Funds (CIF) and the AfDB. Mr Adesina, while responding to her question among other questions, said her project would be funded by next week via a foundation he runs with his wife. He said, 'My wife and I have a foundation that we run. You give me your proposal; you will get funded next week.' An excited Kimani told Nigerian Tribune that 'I do planting of trees. I have a tree nursery with more than 30,000 tree seedlings. I want to start my own factory making biodegradable bottles. 'I started when I was four years old. Then I planted four trees. When I was five years old. Then I planted five trees to mark my fourth birthday. When I was five years old. Then I planted five trees to mark my fifth birthday.' She said she did that every year up till her ninth birthday. She stated that when she turns 10 on November 22, she will plant 10 trees to commemorate her birthday. She said she was into tree planting because 'trees are important. Some give us food, some give us medicine. They give us oxygen. I have planted in many places in Kenya, and I want to plant a tree here in Egypt.' According to the GCA, winners of the second edition of the YouthADAPT Challenge will be awarded business grants of up to $100,000 each and the opportunity to participate in a 12-month business accelerator program to help them scale up their businesses, deepen their impact, and create decent jobs. In addition, the winning youth-led enterprises will be provided with mentorship and support to expand partnerships, knowledge sharing, and learning through a network of young entrepreneurs in climate adaptation.

From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja Ahead of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , otherwise known as COP27 , scheduled for Egypt between November 8 and 10, Fame Foundation organized a walk in Abuja on Saturday called "The Green Ball Walk for Climate Change" and demanded that Nigerian delegations take steps to improve the country's climatic and environmental conditions. This is even as Coordinator, African Centre for Media and Information Literacy (AFRICMIL), Dr. Chido Onumah, who was part of the walk has warned that the challenges posed by global warming are genuine, thus it is necessary to raise awareness among the public. "The global warming is real and the environmental challenge is real and it is important we raise awareness for citizens to know to measures to put in place to protect their environment. "Whether it is planting of trees, timely disposal of their refuse all kinds of measures. And it's for the benefit of everybody because if we destroy our environment we are inadvertently destroying our lives, so I am happy to be part of this event. I congratulate Fame Foundation on what they are doing creating this type of awareness" he stated the AFRICMIL boss. The Executive Director of Fame Foundation, Aderonke Ogunleye-Bello, addressing participants at the an end of the over three hour walk, urged Federal Government to take immediate action to address the effect of climate change in the country. She clarified that the Walk was a part of initiatives to raise awareness on effects of climate change in the wake of floods that are wreaking havoc in several parts of the nation. She emphasizes that residents of particular places, such as rural communities, refugee camps, slums, and underprivileged groups, are already more at risk from climate change and are therefore more vulnerable to its consequences. "Citizens residing specific locations, such as rural communities, refugee camps, slums, and underserved communities, are already at a higher risk from climate change. They are the most vulnerable to the effects of these damages because of things like high illiteracy rates, poor governance, and little to no actions and policies to control climate change. "Aside from our health, our ability to generate food, safety, shelter, and employment are all impacted by climate change. Research predicts that between 2030 and 2050, hunger, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress will be responsible for an additional 250,000 deaths. "While governments with the power and money to address the climate emergency drag their feet, vulnerable groups and communities are paying the deadly price of climate inaction. "Alongside the recently established climate change council, Nigeria has written and signed policies and treaties to tackle climate change. However, the implementation of these existing policies is relatively poor. "Additionally, while establishing policies is necessary for climate action, these rules, with new challenges facing Nigeria, hardly ever fit our local context for climate change. "We hereby demand that the Nigerian government take immediate action to address the ongoing climate disaster affecting the nation. We demand that they take note of Nigerians' suffering and consider a long-term solution to the matter. "We urge the delegates to the upcoming COP27 in Egypt to examine the country's climate situation objectively and make decisions that will benefit the country, particularly the most vulnerable and impacted We anticipate that they will take actions that will improve Nigeria's climatic and environmental situation. "We urge the political candidates running in the upcoming general elections in 2023 to address climate change in their manifestos. "The government at every level, federal, state, or local, must play a role in tackling climate change. "We also call for a new approach to implementing climate policies into practice fur inclusivity and sustainability. The need to prevent self-defeating austerity, national contexts, and the promotion of government and public cooperation in achieving climatic and environmental goals must all be considered in policy initiatives" Ogunleye-Bello \</doc>

They spoke on Tuesday during a virtual meeting as part of activities commemorating of the 2022 World Habitat Day. The trio of climate activists, Jonah Gbemre, Murphy Akiri and Jake Hess, who jointly addressed the virtual press conference, said it is important that the world sustained its call for system change at the World Bank, especially on climate change. Daily Trust reports that the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as COP27 , would hold from 6 to 18 November 2022 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. According to them, this year's World Habitat Day seeks to draw attention to the growing inequalities and vulnerabilities that have been exacerbated by the triple 'C' crises comprising COVID-19, Climate and Conflict, thus the need for the World Bank to move from rhetoric to action, and reform its climate policy. 'The World Bank's failure to tackle climate change is the latest challenge where the Bank has come short and failed to deliver for low-income countries. Since the Paris Agreement, the World Bank has provided $12bn in direct project finance to fossil fuels projects in 35 countries, more than any other multilateral development bank. 'The figure does not include billions more in support of fossil fuels through financial intermediaries, the biggest culprit being the commercial lending arm of the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC). 'The false narrative that fossil fuels will bring prosperity is a harmful distraction from the actual demands of Global South citizens, especially Africans, who want clean, community owned energy,' they said. 'For example, it continues to invest in fossil fuels which are driving climate change, at the same time as investing in trying to fix the problems caused by climate change, such as investing $10m into reversing degradation of Lake Chad,' they said. 'In Nigeria, a current major concern is that the Bank has announced funding for Carbon Capture and Storage, a controversial and unproven technology that claims to store carbon underground, to 'help Nigeria reach its emissions targets', despite criticisms that this techno-fix reinforces fossil fuel dependence.' They recalled that in his speech at the last UN Climate talks, President Buhari announced that Nigeria would become net zero by 2060, saying 'the government is looking for partners, technology, and finance to make cleaner and efficient use of all available resources for a more stable transition in energy markets'. They also noted that Nigeria, as a major oil producer, wants to prolong the status quo as much as possible. \</doc>

The Swiss Confederation and Spain, have \~announced additional financial support of 10 million Euros to African countries and cities affected by the negative effects of climate change. In a statement issued by the Communication and External Relations Department of the AfDB, the announcement was made at the ongoing 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference . It is also known as Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ). Switzerland and Spain confirmed they would each donate approximately five million Euros to the AfDB Group's Urban and Municipal Development Fund (UMDF). The UMDF is a trust fund that would help African vulnerable countries to encourage equitable green and climate resilient urbanisation. It was also created by the AfDB in 2019 to work upstream with African municipalities, local and national authorities by consolidating investment action plans, accelerating project identification and preparation (pre-investment activities). Amb. Dominique Paravicini, SECO's Head of Economic Cooperation and Development spoke on Switzerland's recognition of the importance of cities for economic development, and their impact on and vulnerability to climate change. Paravicini is also the Swiss Governor for the AfDB. "SECO consequently increases its contribution by CHF 4.9 million. A part is intended for cities in emerging economies such as Egypt, Ghana and South Africa. "Switzerland expects its contribution to have a catalytic effect on other potential donors to raise contributions to the fund," Paravicini said. Also speaking, Ram\'f3n L\'f3pez P\'e9rez, said Spain recognised the significant role the AfDB Group played in fostering economic and social progress in Africa. P\'e9rez is the Senior Advisor on Climate Finance in Spain's Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation. "In times of uncertainty and in spite the current generalised budgetary constraints following the extraordinary expenses due to the response to COVID-19 pandemic, this new contribution reaffirms the strong support of Spain to the AfDB." Thanking the partners for the support, Mike Salawou, Director of Infrastructure and Urban Development Department, AfDB Group said the support from the governments of Switzerland and Spain was precious. "This additional budget will boost the UMDF activities, allowing us to support better urban governance and planning, and ensure that partner cities develop sustainably in a climate-optimised manner." According to the statement, Africa is projected to face the fastest urban growth rate in the world at about 3.2 per cent per annum. By 2050, it is expected that about 1.5 billion people will live in Africa's towns and cities, an additional urban population of 900 million people. (NAN) \</doc>

At the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, on Friday, President Joe Biden of the United States of America, announced over $150 million to accelerate the implementation of his Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience (PREPARE) work across the Africa. This is in support of the 'Adaptation in Africa' initiative he and Egypt's President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi announced in June. This funding, according to White House sources, includes US support for expanding access to early-warning systems for all of Africa; building the capacity of African decision-makers of today and tomorrow to accelerate adaptation across the continent for years to come; supporting locally-led efforts to adapt to climate impacts; expanding access to risk-based insurance for the most vulnerable; mobilising the private sector for adaptation and resilience; further supporting climate-smart food systems in Africa, and advancing climate security through Sahel-Climate Advocacy and peacebuilding with pastoralists. Regarding better early-warning systems, President Biden announced new US support to accelerate these efforts, including a $13.6 million contribution to the Systematic Observations Financing Facility that will help fill weather, water, and climate observation gaps in Africa. The United States will also invest $15 million to support the co-development and deployment of early-warning systems in Africa, leveraging the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) long-standing relationships with national and regional weather services across Africa. According to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, better early-warning systems can reduce the number of people who need emergency assistance by half by 2030. In mobilising the private sector for adaptation and resilience, the US is contributing an additional $25 million to the African Union's flagship Africa Adaptation Initiative (AAI), which is hosted by the Egyptian government, to launch the AAI Food Security Accelerator, which will dramatically speed- and scale-up private sector investments in climate resilient food security in Africa. The US is also launching a 'call to action' to the private sector to tap into their ability to develop innovative adaptation solutions in ways that the public sector cannot, providing an additional $3.8 million to CRAFT TA Facility, and $2 million to launch an adaptation window of the Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance to help develop new financial instruments and mechanisms to harness private investment in adaptation. The US Sahel-Climate Advocacy and Peacebuilding with Pastoralists initiative aims to reduce the risk of farmer-herder climate change-related conflict in communities spanning the border of Niger and Benin by concurrently increasing herders' access to political participation in local and national government and improving herders' and farmers' access to climate forecasts of rainfall, droughts, and other environmental factors. President Biden said, 'My friends, I came to the presidency determined to make transformational changes that are needed, that America needs to make, and we have to do for the rest of the world, to overcome decades of opposition and obstacles to progress on this issue alone' and 'to reestablish the United States as a trustworthy and credible global leader on climate. As I stand here before you, we've taken enormous strides to achieve that. 'At this gathering, we must renew and raise our climate ambitions. The United States is acting. Everyone has to act. It's a duty and responsibility of global leadership.' \</doc>

If years of failure to check the depletion of what is arguably man`s greatest resource is finally yielding unpleasant results, it is because the toll has become much too tyrannical to ignore. All over the world, as nature has continued to protest its abuse in varying degrees, it is some of the world`s poorest people that have been left to count the cost. Because human existence has been long marked by inequity, inequality and injustice, as the ripple effects of climate change bite harder, those most affected are those who were already left behind, and were consequently most vulnerable to the shocks that have been known to course through human existence from time to time. \\xa0In the crosshairs of climate change \\xa0\\xa0According to the World Health Organization, Climate change is impacting human lives and health in a variety of ways. It threatens the essential ingredients of good health &ndash; clean air, safe drinking water, nutritious food supply and safe shelter &ndash; and has the potential to undermine decades of progress in global health. Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. The direct damage costs to health are estimated to between US$ 2-4 billion per year by 2030. Area with weak health infrastructure-mostly in developing countries -will be the least able to cope without assistance to prepare and respond. Greenhouse gas emissions that result from the extraction and burning of fossil fuels are major contributors to both climate change and air pollution. Many policies and individual measures, such as transport, food and energy use choices, have potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and produce major health co-benefits, particularly by abating air pollution. \\xa0Checking climate risk The most disturbing effect of climate change yet is that the people who bear its brunt are those who do little to contribute to it by the way they live. They are predominantly the world`s poorest people. The Global Climate Risk Index (CRI) from Germanwatch analyses quantified impacts of extreme weather events &ndash; both in terms of the fatalities as well as the economic losses that occur. The 2021 Index showed that between 2000 and 2019, over 475,000 people lost their lives worldwide and losses of US$2.56 trillion were incurred as a direct result of more than 11,000 extreme weather events. Countries most affected in 2019 were Mozambique, Zimbabwe, the Bahamas, Japan, Malawi, Islamic Republic of Japan, India, South Sudan, Niger, Bolivia. From 2000 to 2019, Puerto Rico, Myanmar and Haiti ranked as the countries most affected by extreme weather events as a result of climate change. All easily some of the world`s poorest countries. If it is clearly the case, and it appears it is, that the worlds poorest people are most vulnerable to climate risk and disproportionately left to suffer the ravaging effects of change, it means that fighting climate change means fighting for the worlds poorest people, many of them children. COP 27 The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference more commonly referred to as COP27 will be the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference and it will be\\xa0 held\\xa0 from 6th\\xa0 to\\xa0 18th November\\xa0 2022 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. COP27 will enable governments to meet and accelerate global efforts to confront the climate change crisis. The meeting will be important because it has been shown that climate change is moving at a faster pace than actions to curb it, and as a result ecosystems and communities are being pushed to their limits. It is hoped that mitigation of climate risk will be at the front burner at the conference. \\xa0Kene Obiezu, HYPERLINK mailto:keneobiezu@gmail.com keneobiezu@gmail.com \</doc>

Following the successful conclusion of the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, Oando Clean Energy has said climate pledges must be matched with action, promising to champion Nigeria's net zero agenda. A statement by the company said with the COP27 themed 'delivering for the people and the planet', it served as an opportunity to showcase what countries are doing to safeguard the planet, and Africa was not left out at the event. OCEL, the renewable energy subsidiary of Oando Plc, and part of the Nigerian delegation to COP27 , hosted two side events at the Nigeria pavilion. The first side-event themed 'Decarbonising an oil-rich region: A case for the Niger Delta', was held in partnership with the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, National Council on Climate Change, REAN and Stratus Limited. Conversations on the role of PPPs, climate financing and an enabling business environment intensified at OCEL's second side event, themed 'Achieving Nigeria's net zero'. \</doc>

Reactions have continued to trail the revelation that 636 fossil fuel lobbyists registered to attend the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) holding in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. These lobbyists are said to be affiliated with some of the world's biggest polluting oil and gas giants. The figure quoted from official records from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) shows an increase of over 25 per cent from COP26. A statement from Corporate Accountability noted that this indicates Â£ rise in the influence of the fossil fuel industry at the climate talks that are already rife with accusations of civil society censorship and corporate influence.' According to Corporate Accountability, its data analysis of the UN's provisional list of named attendees, done in collaboration with Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO), and Global Witness (GW), reveals the scale at which corporate actors with a stake in the continued burning of fossil fuels have been enjoying access to these critical talks. 'The findings are giving fuel to a growing global push to safeguard the talks from polluter interference. 'Researchers counted the number of individuals registered - either directly affiliated with fossil fuel corporations, including the likes of Shell, Chevron and BP; or attending as members of delegations that act on behalf of the fossil fuel industry.' Corporate Accountability stated that the analysis finds that oil and gas influence at COP is growing: 636 fossil fuel lobbyists registered at COP27 , an increase of over 25% from COP26 held last year in Glasgow. This is more fossil fuel lobbyists than any single national delegation, besides the UAE who have registered 1,070 delegates compared to 176 last year; 70 members of their delegation this year are classified as fossil fuel lobbyists. Corporate Accountability added that despite being the 'African COP' there are more fossil fuel lobbyists registered than any national delegation from the African continent. Twenty-nine countries in total have fossil fuel lobbyists within their national delegations. After the UAE, Russia has the second most with 33. Also, there are more fossil fuel lobbyists registered than representatives of the 10 countries most impacted by climate change according to GermanWatch (Puerto Rico, Myanmar, Haiti, Philippines, Mozambique, The Bahamas, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Thailand, Nepal). Reacting, Phillip Jakpor, Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa, said: 'There's been a lot of lip service paid to this being the so-called African COP, but how are you going to address the dire climate impacts on the continent when the fossil fuel delegation is larger than that of any African country? More than 450 organisations around the world are calling on world governments to do what they should have done from day one. It's time to kick Big Polluters out! No more writing the rules or bankrolling the climate talks. ' Jakpor also told Tribune Online that 'The finding reinforces the conviction of the climate justice community that the COP has become a jamboree. Or else why will such a huge number of fossil fuels lobbyists get accredited to attend the negotiations when frontline community people practically get none?' Also speaking to Tribune Online at COP27 , Nnimmo Bassey, the Executive Director of the Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF), said: 'The activities of fossil fuel companies are the primary causes of global warming. The lack of progress at the climate talks is also due to the influence of the same companies and other climate deniers. 'They are equally one of the major blocs responsible for the false solutions being promoted rather than real solutions. The false solutions include carbon markets, which African leaders are pointedly aping at COP27 . The false pathways include the voluntary premises of climate action known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). 'The fossil fuel companies are using their oily fingers to push carbon capture and storage and other geoengineering false solutions through their heavy influence on the negotiation texts (especially at Article 6.4).

Download logo UN Egypt Pavilion side events are aligned with COP27 international agenda, with a special focus on the various programs, activities, and initiatives of the UN in Egypt. As part of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, from November 6 to 18, 2022, The UN family in Egypt will be represented at COP 27 by the "UN Pavilion in Egypt" in the conference Blue Zone. Starting from 9 November to 17 November 2022, UN Egypt Pavilion side events are aligned with COP27 international agenda, with a special focus on the various programs, activities, and initiatives of the UN in Egypt, all coming under the theme "One Pavilion for One United Nations in Egypt" to highlight the policy of the UN system in Egypt in dealing with climate issues counting on the pillars of the work of the United Nations in Egypt , are: human capital, key social services, economic development, governance and empowerment of women and girls. COP27 will build on the outcomes of COP26 to deliver action on a range of critical issues to address the climate emergency, including urgently reducing greenhouse gas emissions, strengthening resilience and adaptation to the inevitable effects of climate change, and meeting commitments to finance climate action in developing countries. COP27 aims to renew international solidarity in order to achieve the historic goals of the Paris Agreement for people and the planet. Heads of state, ministers, and negotiators, from governments, regional organizations, and intergovernmental organizations, along with climate activists, civil society representatives and CEOs, will gather in the Egyptian city of Sharm el-Sheikh for the largest annual gathering on climate action. COP27 is the "implementation" COP, focused on moving from words to actions. "Implementation" is also the area where the international climate dialogue can be most relevant to countries&mdash;including Egypt. COP27 will also be concerned in moving from negotiations to "planning for implementation" of all the promises and pledges made. The United Nations Pavilion in Egypt also emphasizes Egyptian national climate and sustainable development issues. The events will include discussions focused on enhancing implementation across priority issues, as well as an opportunity to network with heads of UN agencies, CEOs of private institutions, and civil society representatives to develop practical, impactful, and ambitious solutions to several climate challenges, including mitigation, adaptation, and financing. In addition, stakeholders' voices will be heard, and they will have the opportunity to showcase solutions and effectively engage in critical global dialogue on climate action implementation, with a strong emphasis on a just transition. Media representatives who are interested in participating virtually in the side events are encouraged to join via the UN in Egypt Facebook page; the online Side Events Agenda is now available on the United Nations in Egypt website. The necessary facilities will also be provided for journalists at the conference venue at Sharm Al Shiekh International Conference Center.

In the Holy books of the Abrahamic religions of Christianity and Islam, the Red Sea is symbolic as a place of significant events and the beginning of liberation from oppression. Will the Red Sea town of Sharm El Sheik be recorded in history as a place of significance in the quest of humanity to save our planet from self-destruction and climate justice? Time is perhaps the only answer. The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference or Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC, more commonly referred to as COP27 , ended on a high note on African soil, with some leaders from developing nations giving each other a high fives. But what was the deal in the Red Sea town of Sharm El Sheik, Egypt? Did God path the Red Sea for developing nations to pass through to the promised land? Is it yet Uhuru for developing countries who have been crying for climate change justice given that their contribution to the carbon emission is insignificant, yet they bear the brunt of the devastating effect of climate change? Are the rich industrial countries ready to commit to reducing carbon emissions and work towards the 1.5c temperature limits agreed upon globally as the point that will create a sustainable climate environment for our earth? Developing nations and African countries need concessions on existing debts, benefits on imports of technologies for clean energy innovations and credits on funding for clean-energy research One significant decision made at the Red Sea town was a vague agreement that rich countries should pay poor ones for climate-related 'loss and damage'. This happened after nearly 30 years of back-and-forth and sustained pressure by the global south for climate justice. Still there are many unresolved issues, which may be beset or shaped by politics, diplomacy, science and of course economics. Take, for example, the loss and damage fund, which is the big takeaway of sub-Saharan Africa and other vulnerable countries from the Red Sea, the concerns are when will the transition committee thrash out the finer details ? What framework will be put in place for the generation and management of the fund? And who should pay for damages and on what basis since science has different empirical ways of reaching a decision? Who will benefit from the fund, and on what basis? Will the fund serve as a disincentive or incentive for rich countries to emit more gases? The historical trend points to the fact that these unseen unresolved contentious issues are the basis for why the fund may not see the light of the day nor deliver its desired outcomes, and therefore emerging countries should not celebrate too early, for they are not out of the Red Sea with any substance yet. Developing nations, particularly sub-Saharan African countries, left the Red Sea without asking these pertinent questions. At the Copenhagen summit in 2009, rich countries promised to supply annual climate financing of $100bn to developing countries by 2020 to help them slow climate change and resist its effects. What happened to that pledge? Did developing nations access the funds? The money that has been pledged is paltry: about $260m. And countries have yet to agree on who should pay and receive the cash. Under the bizarre terms of the UN's climate convention, China-after America, the second-largest total emitter in history-would count as a 'developing country' and be a suitable recipient. Another Pyrrhic victory at the Red Sea for African countries is the failure of COP27 to end fossil fuel use, a perceived victory for poor oil-producing nations. Incidentally, it was Russia and Saudi Arabia that mounted a vigorous campaign against ending the use of fossil fuels. Considering that rich western countries had, in the past two centuries, used more than their fair share of fossil energy for industrial power development, which is at the root of the current climate crisis, the pendulum of justice is in favour of poor oil-producing countries. The challenge for Africa is multiple. Our governments are yet to find enough fossil fuels for essential industrialisation. Developing alternative energy sources requires resources that most countries do not have. Yet they now must protect their populations from the adversities of climate change: flooding, excessive heat, deforestation, and higher energy costs. A keen observer would have expected that oil-producing developing countries of Africa that need revenue from oil and gas to transit would have been at the vanguard. What is the implication of the backing for oil and gas production for countries like Nigeria? Is it sustainable in the medium to long term? How can Nigeria and other oil-producing countries that are poor use this period of grace before the inevitable cuts on carbon fuel consumption to transition from reliance on fossil fuel products to a diversified product range for export to the rest of the world? Our transitional dependence on fossil fuel is further justified by the fact that fifty per cent of our people do not have access to power, so the base power is not even there. This is not to discountenance the fact that the days of fossil fuel usage are numbered. Developing nations and African countries need concessions on existing debts, benefits on imports of technologies for clean energy innovations and credits on funding for clean-energy research and infrastructure such as solar and wind energy fields. Climate change hits Africa more than other parts of the world, apart from small island developing states of the Caribbean. Sub-Saharan Africa emits negligible greenhouse emissions, yet we suffer the most from its impact. It affects almost all aspects of our lives, from agricultural productivity, heatwaves, humanitarian crisis, political crisis, and migration issues to population crises. Yet the worst polluting nations are not in a hurry to mitigate its impact on Africans. The multiplier effect of this climate change-induced problem is enormous, given the poor economic conditions of the people affected. With an already poor quality of living in most of sub-Saharan Africa, disaster has multiple impacts and often is damaging to a vast proportion. When faced with similar disasters, rich countries cope better and have the resources to bounce back to normalcy quickly. In developing countries, the impact of such crises lingers for decades, and the human cost remains a constant trauma in the collective minds of those who managed to survive. A few weeks ago, almost a quarter of Nigeria was flooded. This led to a loss of lives and property. Most communities lost all their livelihood, making life miserable for people already poor and struggling even in good times. There is fear that the recent flooding has threatened our food security and led to increased food prices, making an already bad inflationary situation worse. Unfortunately, but true, Nigeria did not access any of the existing climate change funds, whether for mitigation or adaptation, to the best of my knowledge. Part of the reasons is procedural complexities and limited technical knowledge. Building capacity in scientific knowledge, technology and politics of climate change is now urgent. COP27 : The Africa proposal (2) All said, the best scenario for sub-Saharan Africa is for the rich countries to reduce their carbon emission and make the world a better home for all. In addition, multilateral financial agencies like the IMF and World Bank should grant concessions to global south countries seeking assistance for investment in clean energy infrastructure. Africa's response to the challenges of global climate change should be a combination of realism and clear-headed diplomatic engagement. Expecting humanitarian handouts and concessions is a regress to old begging bowl habits. It is time now to look closer at the finer details of the 'loss and damage' agreement and start the process of passing through the red sea. The devil is often in the details. Beyond the soundbites and euphoria of agreeing on' loss and damage funds' lies the reality of mitigating the devastating impact of climate change-induced crisis. Whilst interrogating this reality, developing countries should also ruminate on their energy needs and to what extent they are willing to rely on clean energy, given that, as an emerging country, they need cheap energy to fuel their industrialisation. Emerging countries must not entertain any deal that will hamper this reality. We should remember that the energy consumption of the state of California is more significant than that of sub-Saharan Africa put together. In 2020 California consumed 6,923 trillion Btu whilst sub-Saharan nations consumed about 1570 trillion Btu. We need more energy for production and to improve the quality of life of the people. We must not mortgage the future of our unborn generation for any funds that want to limit our access to cheap energy. These convinced me that we are still at the tip of the red sea, waiting for God to part the sea for us to pass through. We have no choice but to force the hands of God as did Moses or Musa and hope He will part the Red Sea for his people to go. It is not yet Uhuru! \</doc>

Oando Clean Energy Limited, the renewable energy subsidiary of Oando Plc, has said it is attending the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference meeting currently holding in Egypt. As Africa's largest economy and most populous nation, Nigeria is also actively participating in the COP27 It said in a statement that the event themed, 'Delivering for people and the planet', holding in Sharm El Sheik, Egypt, would host more than 45,000 registered COP27 participants. It stated that there would be representatives from the United Nations, regional non-governmental and intergovernmental organizations, businesses, the scientific community, local communities as well as civil society, to jointly enhance and accelerate the implementation of climate action and follow up on collective commitments and pledges. While noting that Africa was no stranger to the disproportionate impact of climate change, it stated that the continent contributes only three per cent to greenhouse gas emissions, but suffered disproportionately from its negative impacts. OCEL said it would join key renewable players across the African public and private sector to reiterate the role the continent was playing in supporting global targets and creating a more sustainable future. OCEL in partnership with the Federal Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, National Council on Climate Change, Renewable Energy Association of Nigeria, and Stratus Consult Limited, would lead two dialogues at the Nigeria Pavilion, the statement said. \</doc>

Minister of Environment, Mohammed Abdullahi, who is the representative of President Muhammadu Buhari at the ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) holding in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, has noted a need for increased funding for the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) to achieve the government's net-zero ambition, while calling for a shift from public to private sources of funding. This way, he stressed, there will be improved sustainability for rural electrification projects. Speaking on Tuesday at a side meeting at the Nigerian pavilion, President Buhari said, 'REA is key to our net-zero ambition. The only way we can do that is to ensure additional funding for REA. 'However, we must begin to shy away from public funding, to private sector funding. We are discussing with our partners at IMF to see how they can structure the next Sovereign Green Bond where they can have a model where the private sector will be involved. 'One is to carry the communities along: to ensure the private sector and the communities are carried along in tariffs determination and to also ensure that there is sustainability. Regrettably, we find out that in some communities where REA has deployed some mini-grids, there are challenges in form sustenance and maintenance. 'So we believe that if the private sector is involved, these kinds of challenges can be cured. This is because the private sector itself will be involved in running the mini-grids. The communities themselves will also be involved. The government itself will provide some kind of funding to get the communities to buy in and pay for the services so that it can be sustainable.' Dr Sanusi Ohiare, the chairman of the Rural Electrification Fund, explained further the need for private funding in addition to government sources. He told Nigerian Tribune that the reason government is involved in the business of rural electrification which is supposed to be like any other business is because of the very nature of rural electrification 'We need government to step in to incentivise for the private sector to come in and invest. You need it to become mature enough for anybody to say I want to come and invest in rural electrification just like any other commodity. 'What government is doing is providing funds by way of capital subsidy to de-risk certain challenges that private investors face in going into rural electrification.' He added that when the private sector finds rural electrification investment comfortable enough, 'they can also raise their own debt and equity and do projects of their own.' He said government was providing funds from the Rural Electrification Fund, the World Bank, African Development Bank, the governments of Korea, Germany and the European Union (EU), and the Rockefeller Foundation.

The 27th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) held in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt was scheduled for November 6 to 18, but ended two days beyond schedule on Sunday, November 20. In the final text of the agreement at COP27 , a decision to establish a fund for addressing 'loss and damage' was made. The inclusion of loss and damage on the COP27 agenda and the agreement to establish a loss and damage facility was seen as a win for Africa and other developing countries. However, according to an environmental activist, Zikora Ibeh of Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA), 'it is not yet uhuru.' Ibeh spoke at a media debrief to discuss the outcomes of COP27 , alongside Akinbode Oluwafemi, Executive Director of CAPPA; and Philip Jakpor, Programmes Director of CAPPA in Lagos on Friday. They were joined virtually by Nnimmo Bassey of Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF) and Chima Williams of the Environmental Rights Action (ERA). These environmental activists at the media debrief gave a bitter-sweet account of COP27 . COP27 final text Prior to the debrief in Lagos, beyond the shores of Nigeria in the UK, Alok Sharma, the president of COP26 that was held in Glasgow in 2021, spoke on what he saw was missing in the COP27 final agreement text. He said, 'Emissions peaking before 2025 as the science tells us is necessary? Not in this text. Clear follow-through on the phase down of coal? Not in this text. A clear commitment to phase out all fossil fuels? Not in this text.' Ani Dasgupta, President and CEO, World Resources Institute (WRI), said: 'While progress on loss and damage was encouraging, it is disappointing that the decision mostly copy and pasted language from Glasgow about curbing emissions, rather than taking any significant new steps. WRI research shows that the world is collectively lagging on climate action across every sector. The only way to avoid even more severe climate impacts and keep 1.5\'b0 C alive is if we rapidly slash emissions this decade. 'New calls to accelerate deployment of renewable energy were very welcome. But it is mindboggling that countries did not muster the courage to call for phasing down fossil fuels, which are the biggest driver of climate change.' What is a COP meant to do? Nnimmo Bassey has attended at least 12 COPs since his first at COP. The veteran environmental activist had this to say about the expectations of civil society from COP27 . 'The COP provides a space for society to meet, to meet with impacted communities, to meet with people from different regions, to share ideas and strategise! 'I see the COP as a catalyst space for civil society to prepare, and to learn and to share strategies. He added that the whole idea of UNFCCC and the conference of parties (COP) that meets every year is to discuss on how nations should act so as to tackle the climate emergency. 'But we are seeing almost every year in recent times that nations that go to the negotiations are more concerned about how to avoid responsibility, how to avoid action, and how to make business out of the conferences. Bassey noted that 'from the COP in Copenhagen, which was in 2009, the COP really shifted in the wrong direction, enthroning the voluntary emissions reduction regime, which was consolidated in the Paris Agreement in 2015.' He said, 'the negotiations were more about how to avoid mentioning the root cause of the problem. And the root cause of the problem, we know, is a dependence on fossil fuels. 'At this COP, there was an expectation in the dying hours that the COP may decide to include in the outcome document a 'phasing out' of all fossil fuels. Now, that didn't come to pass. 'Why didn't that happen? Because of the heavy presence of fossil fuel industry delegates, who constituted themselves to be a larger bloc than even the largest delegation from any country in Africa. 'So clearly, the corridors of the COP was filled with fossil fuel producers whose sole reason for being there is to ensure that their business goes on without anyone interfering and they succeeded. 'The only bright light that came from COP27 was the agreement that the COP should consider loss and damage.' 'Fossil fuel industry lobbyists derailed COP27 outcome' Philip Jakpor, director of programmes at CAPPA, described the presence of fossil fuel lobbyists as having mosquitoes attend a conference on dealing with malaria. He said their overwhelming numbers at COP27 which was higher than in previous COPs successfully derailed proceedings at COP27 . COP27 this time around, it's like you discussing malaria, and you are inviting the mosquito. I think that's the best description of what we saw at COP27 . 'About 636 fossil fuel lobbyists were at the COP. What are the fossil fuel lobbyists doing at the COP? Essentially, it is to help to derail the talks, distract delegates and ultimately ensure that the goal of cutting down on emissions does not happen. 'Even at the end of the COP, further investigations showed that 18 out of the 20 sponsors of the COP were actually fossil fuel industry players. 'It was also disturbing that our own country (Nigeria) even with the flooding we witnessed this year in our pavilion had a roll up banner with partners being the fossil fuel industry. 'We had a lot of people from the affected communities who could not get accreditation to attend and those who did not have the funds to come to the COP in Egypt, supposedly the African COP. But we had the fossil fuel industry in full swing holding meetings, displaying new technologies, evidently to distract us from what the COP is supposed to be all about.' 'Nigerian delegation to COP27 incredibly large' CAPPA Executive Director, Akinbode Oluwafemi, commented on the size of the Nigerian delegation at COP27 COP27 . He said the issue is not to look at the fact that the COP was held on African soil, but to bring to the fore issues concerning Africa. Oluwafemi questioned the size of the delegation from Nigeria, saying: 'It was incredible. I've never seen that large delegation, including people from the corporate banks and the rest of them. 'The absurdity at the Nigerian pavilion was advertising the fact that they were partnering or being sponsored by the fossil fuel industry.' What's next after loss and damage? Chima Williams, who heads ERA, an environmental rights NGO based in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, said 'the discussion on loss and damage can go on and on.' 'This is where strategic litigation becomes the way to go. How do we want to do this litigation? Do we want to do home country or host country litigation? Do we want to do combined where we get a cluster of African countries that are impacted by fossil fuel industry activities that have a visible impact as in the case of Nigeria? We need to discuss this!' Williams, a lawyer, explained that 'Strategic litigation means, most of the time, cases that have never been done before, precedence-setting cases. And that is what we've been doing for the past close to 20 years - starting from the first case on environmental justice that was instituted by Oronto Douglas. 'That was the foundation of environmental litigation in Nigeria, if not in Africa. 'All of us took a cue from that experience, and started to redefine the processes and practice of environmental justice litigation. 'So, when we talk about strategic litigation, it takes creativity of the lawyers - you can't find any single law anywhere. But if you look in depth, you will see some pieces of laws and legislations, declarations, treaties, standards, frameworks that you can apply to ensure that you get it right in the law courts.' Not yet uhuru on loss and damage until... CAPPA's Zikora Ibeh, as mentioned earlier, said it is not yet uhuru regarding the progress made on loss and damage until the funding facility agreed on is operationalised. She described loss and damage as compensation for 'the disruptive impacts of climate change that adaptation and mitigation - which are to cope with climate change - cannot solve,' such as the loss of lives from floods. COP27 , after years of bickering and arguments by developing nations and developed nations on whether loss and damage should be acknowledged or whether it should not. 'It's a big political win for campaigners, for indigenous communities, and for activists. 'But it is not yet uhuru for us, because while loss and damage was able to get on the agenda for COP27 'We know about climate finance and its setbacks. In 2009, developed countries agreed that they are going to pay developing nations $100 billion from 2009 to 2020. But as we speak, that money has not yet been realised!' \</doc>

At the Sharm el-Sheikh - Egypt Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ) November 06 - 18, 2022, there was more than 100 heads of state and an estimated 35,000 representatives, or delegates, from 190 countries in attendance. These countries with their leaders in government, civil society, industry, and finance came together to raise ambition and accelerate action towards achieving the world's collective climate goals as agreed under the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on climate change with five key issues to watch - nature, food, water, industry decarbonisation and climate adaptation. The 27th Conference - builds on the outcomes of COP26 to deliver action on an array of issues critical to tackling the climate emergency - from urgently reducing greenhouse gas emissions, building resilience, and adapting to the inevitable impacts of climate change, to delivering on the commitments to finance climate action in developing countries and preserving Biological diversity. But nature is in crisis. We are recently experiencing severe flooding, droughts, hurricanes, extra-high temperatures, unpredictable weather changes that are threatening up to one million species with extinction. Irreplaceable ecosystems like parts of the Amazon rainforest are turning from carbon sinks into carbon sources due to deforestation. And 85 per cent of wetlands, such as salt marshes and mangrove swamps which absorb large amounts of carbon, have disappeared. Here in the tropics - Nigeria, desertification and unchecked albeit careless human activity is compounding our situation with devastating climate change. Climate change is remotely causing demographic shifts - rural/urban migrations with the consequence of exerting pressures on planned infrastructures of the urban areas, social vices and crimes while on the other end there is massive deforestation for larger farm lands, cutting of timber to provide for shelter, firewood/charcoal for cooking etc. which are disposing animals especially livestock of their natural grazing habitats. Globally, the main driver of biodiversity loss remains humans' use of land - primarily for food production. Human activity has already altered over 70 per cent of all ice-free land. When land is converted for agriculture, some animal and plant species often lose their habitat and face extinction. Climate change has altered marine, terrestrial, and freshwater ecosystems around the world. It has caused the loss of local species, increased diseases, and driven mass mortality of plants and animals, resulting in climate-driven extinctions. On land, higher temperatures have forced animals and plants to move to higher elevations or higher latitudes - in our particular instance, the pastoralists' are moving inwards to hitherto alien lands with far-reaching consequences for the ecosystems. The risk of species extinction increases with every movement and degree of warming has the tendency of reducing food security and the need for intensifying food production thus opening up more lands to meet the growing food demands. COP 27 has taken cognizance of the multiple threats to the feature of the universe and thus amplified high commitment on climate change issues, encouraging parties to speed up the fight against climate emergencies and promote coordinated action to tackle existential climate change effects devastating the world. Nigeria's team to the conference were focused on ensuring that the issue of loss and damage is brought to the fore. This was achieved towards the end even though it looked like it might never happen, but a breakthrough was finally made in Sharm el-Sheikh with 'loss and damage funding for vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters' as the major takeaway. The decision was signed off by nearly 200 countries - from the major polluters and emerging economies to small island states - early on Sunday morning after a marathon overnight session. COP27 has not only created a platform for key stakeholders to shape climate policies, including those on adaptation, mitigation, financing, and all related sectors focused on health, energy, food and agriculture, gender, youth etc. it has also defined a way forward on decades-long conversation on funding for addressing loss and damage. Back here at home, what are we putting in place to preempt the climate challenges? Or do we have to wait to be consumed or wait for the loss and damage funds to be operationalised to make us proactive towards our emerging climate challenges? The floods of this year 2022; the poor farm outputs that may ultimately cause us not to be able to feed our exponential population growth or the climate induce demographic shifts that are now precipitating conflicts across many regions of our country are glaring enough for us. Nigeria's economy is dependent on agriculture and oil, two sectors that are serious contributors to global warming that can severely affect our future, our economy and push us into devastating recession that will make life harder for everyone. To avoid these disastrous outcomes, we must immediately develop a broad national climate change policy to track and ensure implementation of policies that will inevitability address reforestation, carbon sequestration and prices, deployment and use of renewable energy, climate education/advocacy and much more. There are lessons to learn from many African countries that have taken the lead in the fight for climate action. Rwanda has banned polyethylene bags as early as 2008 and in 2019, single use plastics, this in turn fostered the growth of alternative packaging methods and created jobs. Egypt and their recent mass deployment of electrical commercial vehicles, as well as Ethiopia with outstanding record of planting 350,000,000 trees within 24 hours. The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres at the close of COP27 said 'Climate chaos is a crisis; the signs are everywhere. The world still needs a giant leap on climate ambition (...) COP27 concludes with much homework and little time' - he urges governments to work quickly. We need to end the suicidal war on nature that is fueling the climate crisis, driving species to extinction and destroying ecosystems. Let this conference be a spring board for Nigeria to accelerate action and fight its own climate war. \</doc>

By Vivian Emoni The Federal Government on Monday assured that youths, women, vulnerable and other critical stakeholders would be strongly involved on 2022 UNFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), COP27 , in Egypt. The Minister of Environment, Mr Mohammed Abdullahi, gave the assurance at a Pre-COP/Climate Justice Torch Campaign by some groups of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) in Abuja. The Climate and Sustainable Development Network (CSDevNet), in collaboration with Young Digital Activists Volunteer, Gender and Environmental Risk Reduction Initiative (GERRI), Global Initiative for Gender and Environmental Sustainability, (GIGES), organised the campaign. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the COP 27 convention will take place in Egypt from Nov. 6 to Nov. 18, 2022. The aim of the convention is to meet with some environmental experts from other countries to discuss how to combat dangerous human interference with the climate system on environmental issues and how such challenges could be address effectively. Abdullahi said that the involvement of the youths, women and the vulnerable would provide opportunity to discuss and exchange ideas that would support strong implementation of crucial programmes and policies in the sector. "The ministry is assuring that in the COP 27 , the government will welcome the youths and women and other gender related activists to ensure that they make their voices count. "The issues of loss, damage adaptation, climate finance, drought and other environmental challenges are all going to be addressed at COP 27 . "The ministry of environment is driving the COP 27 response from Nigeria this year," he said. Abdullahi said that the campaign by the organisations was actually pushing and energising the ministry to do what was supposed to be done. "We have heard your voices and your advocacies which will be attended to," he said. Mr Stephen Abu, Programme Manager, CSDevNet, said that the essence of the campaign was to ensure the involvement of vulnerable, women and youths at the COP27 . "We have our messages clearly spelt out to the minister that as we head to COP 27 , the climate disaster must be addressed effectively. "The disaster which has damaged many property, claimed lives in Nigeria, ranging from drought in the North, to the issue of flooding in about 21 states must be attended to at the COP 27 . "We are calling on the government that the issue of adaptation, loss and damage and issue of climate finance is critical to us in Nigeria and Africa as well," he said. Mrs Precious Kpenerriber, Executive Director GIGES, said that female gender should not be left behind. "We are asking for justice for women, for the girls, for effective menstrual sanitation and hygiene, they are also affected. "Flood, drought and other environmental issues have really destroyed our environment, thereby affecting the farm land of our poor women farmers. "The impact of the flood is disastrous and most of the people affected are women and youths, leaving them homeless and stranded. "These people deserve justice and compensation for the loss and damage," she said. Also, the Executive Director of GERRI, Mrs Elizabeth Jeiyol, said that flood has stripped most affected children from access to education in the country. "We are calling out to the ministry to give assurance that at COP 27 , the rights and interests of the people at the grassroots communities will be defended. "We also want the voices of these people to be heard and we are demanding justice for them. "They deserve climate justice and need resources to adapt to the impact of the crisis," she said. NAN reports that the organisations presented Climate Justice Torch, which represented light and Final Libreville Communique, which contained vital issues on climate justice, to the minister.

Nigeria, Nov. 3 -- Well-managed youth migration can help Africa adapt to climate change and meet its development goals. By Aimee-Noel Mbiyozo Africa faces a trio of issues that are accelerating youth migration - the youth 'population bulge', high unemployment and mounting climate impacts. The ability of young people to move is an important adaptive response to all three. Youth migration can help Africa adapt to climate change and meet its development goals, if managed well. But if poorly handled, it poses many threats, including persistent unemployment, civil unrest and instability. Africa has the world's largest share of young migrants: a quarter (25%) of Africa's migrant population is under 18, and 16% are aged 15-24. Meanwhile, Africa's child (0-14) and youth (16-29) populations are growing (see graph). Currently, 60% of Africans are under 25 years old. Africa's 'youth bulge' has significant development potential. Increasing the working-age population relative to dependents (children and elders) can free up resources to generate economic growth. This demographic dividend materialises when a country has at least 1.7 working-age people per dependent, but only if the labour force has the health, education and skills to form a productive labour market. Failing to harness this dividend could result in more poverty and unemployment. Despite being more educated, healthier and connected than previous generations, youth are confronting escalating climate impacts and high rates of un- or under-employment. Approximately 16 million youth in Africa face unemployment, and 40% consider their living situations to be very or fairly bad. They overwhelmingly see joblessness as their biggest problem and feel the continent's ageing leaders don't care about their needs. Migration can be a necessary choice among young Africans facing multiple shocks with little or no social protection, including youth. Climate change is both a direct and indirect driver of migration and displacement. As a fragility amplifier, it is difficult to isolate from other social, economic and environmental factors. The compounding impacts of climate change, job scarcity, political apathy and social unrest are significant migration 'push' factors. Migration offers a vital adaptation strategy that allows families and individuals to diversify skills and livelihoods, reduce climate-related risks, and gain exposure to education or new skills. Measures that support safe, voluntary and dignified migration, cheap and accessible remittance channels and strong diaspora engagement will help unlock the development potential of migration. Forced displacement has fewer development benefits and more threats. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts a 200% increase in displacement across Africa at 1.6degC of warming and 600% for 2.6degC degrees of warming. Most of the world's displaced are under 25 years. Children and youth are moving in response to climate hazards, either unaccompanied or with family or friends. Prolonged displacement has severe and lasting effects on children that can continue into adulthood and undermine development. Displacement disrupts education, access to nutrition, healthcare, livelihoods and stability. These disruptions can have lasting repercussions, including physical stunting, health issues, and less economically productive futures. Displaced children are also at higher risk of violence, abuse, exploitation and neglect. Girls face more barriers and risks than boys. Unaccompanied minors and children separated from their families are among the most vulnerable. Young people must be recognised as change agents who can create solutions that unlock youth potential and respond to migration challenges and opportunities. Youth are becoming increasingly mobile and often have different perspectives and priorities than adults, yet are rarely involved in the design and implementation of responses. Africa's youth are already active in driving solutions to complex problems. They are more connected than ever and increasingly vocal about contributing to innovation, community resilience, social progress and political transformation. While many governments and multilateral processes include youth voices, these processes must amount to more than lip service. Youth are keen to be heard and to participate in decision making. Across Africa, they are demanding opportunities to influence climate change and migration policies. African youth representatives have called on governments to protect people fleeing climate change, facilitate free movement and enable accessible and safe migration that can unlock economic development. The issues of adaptation, loss and damage, and a just transition will be front and centre at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), starting on Sunday. The Global Goal on Adaptation was an essential outcome of COP26 and is one of the four goals for the COP27 Presidency. Africa's youth will watch to see if wealthy countries fulfil their financing commitments and prioritise support for the world's most vulnerable communities. Adaptation measures should include mobility solutions that avert and minimise forced displacement and facilitate safe, orderly and regular migration for young people in Africa. These include green skills, livelihoods, infrastructure, and services that generate youth employment. This will require inter-generational dialogue and recognition that youth are already developing solutions ahead of the adaptation curve. Young people's priorities and views differ from adults' and offer innovative perspectives on problems old and new. COP27 - and actions that follow - will be wise to strengthen African youth participation, make mechanisms and texts more accessible to young people, and amplify their voices.

Nigeria, Nov. 6 -- United Nations Climate Change Executive Secretary, Simon Stiell, has said the global body will be holding world leaders and people to account in order to make their policies align with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the Convention. The UNFCCC official disclosed this while delivering his remarks at the opening plenary of the 27th edition of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) in Egypt Sunday. "We will be holding people to account, be they presidents, prime ministers or CEOs, accountability chief to make our policies, our businesses on infrastructure in order for our actions, even personal or the public must be aligned with the Paris agreements and with the convention," Mr Stiell said. He emphasised that the heart of the implementation of climate pledges lies with everybody everywhere in the world, doing everything they possibly can to address the climate crisis. "With the Paris Rulebook essentially concluded thanks to COP26 in Glasgow last year, the litmus test of this and every future COP is how far deliberations are accompanied by action. Everybody, every single day, everywhere in the world, needs to do everything they possibly can to avert the climate crisis," Mr Stiell said. He said: " COP27 Mr Stiell asked governments to focus on three critical areas at COP27 . "The second is cementing progress on the critical workstreams of mitigation, adaptation, finance and loss and damage, while stepping up finance notably to tackle the impacts of climate change," he said. Me Stiell said the third focus of governments across the world is to enhance the delivery of the principles of transparency and accountability throughout the UN Climate Change process. On his part, the Egyptian COP27 President, Sameh Shoukry, said the presidency intends to focus the world's attention on key elements that address some of the most fundamental needs of people everywhere, including water security, food security, health and energy security. He said: "We're gathering this year at a time when global climate action is at a watershed moment. Multilateralism is being challenged by geopolitics, spiraling prices, and growing financial crises, while several countries battered by the pandemic have barely recovered, and severe and depleting climate change-induced disasters are becoming more frequent." The COP is the supreme decision-making body of the Convention. All States that are Parties to the Convention are represented at the COP, at which they review the implementation of the Convention and any other legal instruments that the COP adopts.

Nigeria, Nov. 25 -- A major highlight of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) was to ensure that the voices of young and future generations were considered in climate and environmental conversations. The Children and Youth Pavilion ensured that young people at the summit deepened the conversation by lending their voices to issues around the climate change crisis ravaging communities globally. Two days after the 2022 conference was declared open, the first-ever "Children and Youth Pavilion" in the history of COPs commenced at COP27 Blue Zone axis of the conference. This offered vibrant climate youth advocates in the city of Sharm El-Sheikh the opportunity to express their concerns about climate change negotiations. The UN said the aim of creating a youth-driven pavilion was to contribute to further visibility, engagement, and empowerment of children and youth networks' voices and foster their inclusion in the global climate conversation and policy making. "I depend on your voice. It is your future that we are supposed to be here to guarantee. And it is only through your voices, your advocacy and your inspiration that you will be able to enjoy your right to take full advantage of the earth, the forests and the air and to live a long and prosperous future on our beautiful planet once governments undertake their responsibilities. You are the future and it is your voice that will help deliver it," says COP27 President, Sameh Shoukry, during a visit to the youth pavilion. Throughout the two weeks of the summit, PREMIUM TIMES observed that the pavilion was duly managed by children and youth from across continents at COP27 . Excitement, cheers and important conversations about climate justice and youth inclusion in climate negotiations dominated the conversations. On many occasions, dozens of COP attendees and passersby were attracted by the thrills echoing from the Youths pavilion stands. Sometimes, many stopped to have a feel of the creative exhibitions being displayed by the youths within the pavilion premises and to listen to prominent guests being hosted. These activities attracted the attention of who deployed their mobile phones to capture the unique moments at the youth's pavilion. This year, COP27 assembled more than 46,000 delegations from nearly 200 countries in Egypt for two weeks to drive forward sustainable actions to fight climate change as the world continues to battle with the existential scourge of weather fluctuations driven largely by human activities. Unlike previous COPs, this year's conference was extended after the negotiations stalled over the terms calling for wealthy polluters( developed countries) to provide "loss and damage" funding - a major agenda put forward by the African Group of Negotiators, for countries ruined by climate disasters, as well as over-ratcheting up ambition in tackling global warming. Likewise, the European Union roundly rejected a document shown by Egypt overnight because of concerns it was weak on curbing emissions. But after several hours of negotiations, a historic Sharm El-Sheikh Implementation Plan (SHIP), which established funding for loss and damage, was reached on November 19. The new fund will see donors contribute to a global fund to save lives and livelihoods from climate change-related disasters, the organisers said. The UN said COP27 saw significant progress on adaptation, with governments agreeing on the way to move forward on the Global Goal Adaptation, which will conclude at COP28 and inform the first Global Stock take, improving resilience amongst the most vulnerable. Meanwhile, new pledges, totaling more than $230 million, were made to the Adaptation Fund at COP27 . These pledges, the organisers said, will help many more vulnerable communities adapt to climate change through concrete adaptation solutions. On several occasions all through thematic days at the summit, young people stormed the streets and premises of the summit calling for climate justice, raging against superficial commitments and rallying against political inaction. Likewise, many young negotiators from Africa were also pushing to have a seat at the negotiation table for their concerns and aspirations to be heard and attended to. The UN Climate Change (UNFCCC) Executive Secretary, Simon Stiell, also recognised the vibrant presence and participation of youths at COP27 while delivering his closing remarks at the summit. "Climate advocates - led by the moral voice of young people - have kept the agenda moving through the darkest of days. They must be protected.To all of them, I say we share your frustration. But we need you now more than ever," Mr Stiell said. Unlike the stories from the Sinai peninsula, the UN official said the world cannot wait for a miracle from a mountaintop. "It will take each and every one of us fighting in the trenches each and every day," he said. Over the two weeks of intensive engagement among negotiators, issues around food security, innovative finance, just transition, investing in the future of energy (green hydrogen, climate change and the sustainability of vulnerable communities) and water security took the centre stage at the six roundtables featured at the high-level events of the summit. But climate justice, effective implementation of lingering pledges, and more youth participation in climate change negotiations are the major concerns for many African youths at COP this year. "They cannot be deciding for us, we want to go into negotiations, we want to make the decisions, we want to be involved in policy-making and implementation and we want to be collaborators and co-designers of solutions to the effects of climate change that are facing us," Rose Kobusinge, 26, a Uganda-based climate justice advocate told PREMIUM TIMES in an interview. While the negotiations at COP27 were still on, Ms Kobusinge lamented that she felt a tad discouraged because pledges made at last year's COP were largely unfulfilled. Despite having a first-ever youth pavilion at COP27 , she said there is still not much freedom for youths to demonstrate as they so wish. On his part, Lucky Abeng, a research officer for Climate and Sustainable Development Network, said the climate negotiation space is not as open to young people as they would have expected at COP27 . Also, the co-founder of International Climate Change Development Initiative, Olumide Idowu, who is also one of Nigeria's youth negotiators at COP this year, expressed reservations. He said himself and other youths across the world called for more youth inclusion in the climate discussion and how their government delegations would be speaking on the loss and damage, adaptation and climate finance. That, he said, has been the biggest conversation that shaped this year's summit. "I am not impressed with youth participation in Nigeria," Mr Idowu told PREMIUM TIMES. "We still need a lot of work to do so that we can showcase more climate-driven local action that Nigeria is doing." "Doing such will help young people to have a collaborative experience in making their implementation back home to be more global," he said. Another youth negotiator for Nigeria, Lauritta Boniface, Co-founder of Ecocycle Limited, shared her experience in the negotiations room and plenary as well. She said she saw other youths like herself in the negotiation room at this year's cop tendering their country's position and trying to influence leaders to agree on a human-centred decision where no one would be left behind. Like several other African youths, Patricia Kombo, a Kenyan-based environmentalist, expressed mixed feelings about the COP27 processes. At first as a young Kenyan, she said she is happy with the creation of a youth pavilion at the summit this year because they now have a space where they can share their "experiences" and a safe space where they (youth) don't feel intimidated. However, she said she is heartbroken because leaders come to COP to dish out sweet statements but when the conference is over, nothing is often done to fulfill commitments. "So do I feel it is not worth promising? And I think I am losing hope in the whole process," Ms Kombo said. Similarly, Coordinator of the Children and Youth Pavilion at COP27 , Saad Uakkas (Morocco), said young people at this year's COP are more powerful than in the previous. He said they have more young people in the negotiations room working with different organisations that are amplifying the voices of young people. He said as young people at COP they are demanding more finance and mechanisms for loss and damages. "Our countries are suffering. People at the local level are struggling, so we need climate finance. We need adaptation to be considered so that we can help our brothers and sisters in the local communities and at the indigenous level to cope with the impacts and consequences of climate change," Mr Uakkas said.

For the first time, at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties ( COP27 The provision of a dedicated pavilion was a positive development in the recognition of this group of society in the climate change story. It was also a platform from which their voices began to be heard more clearly at the COP27 negotiations that held from November 6 to 18, in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Young people and children have attended the previous conferences of parties (COPs) where they made an impact on the negotiations. One notable young person at the COPs before COP27 is Greta Thunberg, a Swedish environmental activist who first attended the COP in 2019 at 16 years old. However, for many young people, especially from the Global South, coming to COP27 was not a walk in the park. A number of them shared with the Nigerian Tribune their experiences of how they made it to COP27 . For them, the hardest part appeared to be with getting accreditation from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) itself. Another major challenge was raising funds for airfare, accommodation, and feeding. These systemic and economic hurdles apparently kept an untold number of significant voices who otherwise could have been on the ground in Sharm El Sheikh to make their own contributions at the conference. Elvis Omoit A young Ugandan, Elvis Omoit, is a part of the International Forestry Students Association, which is a global community of students studying forestry-related courses. The first challenge for him was getting accreditation from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). He told Nigerian Tribune that 'this is pretty much what most young people go through if they want to get to a meeting like COP27 . 'You first need to find an organisation that is accredited with the UNFCCC. You can't be accredited as an individual but rather through an organisation that is already accredited. If you don't know an organisation that is accredited, then getting an opportunity to attend an event like COP27 is very small.' Fortunately for him, the International Forestry Students Association is accredited. 'But I know a lot of young people out there who may not know about an organisation that is accredited. They may be involved with an organisation, but it is not accredited,' he added. Having overcome the accreditation hurdle, Omoit said it got trickier for him with funding the trip; that is travel, accommodation, and feeding expenses in Egypt. 'Accreditation is just the first step. The organisation I am involved with is a student organisation. It does not have the capacity to fully fund people to attend events like COP27 . It has some partial funding for some officials of the organisation. 'Speaking as someone from the Global South, even when you are provided with partial funding, you are not able to meet the remaining funding you need. It was quite expensive getting here looking at the costs of flight, accommodation, and feeding.' Omoit said belonging to the Youths in Landscape Initiative, a network of young people that brings together the organisations: Youths for Nature, Young Professionals for Agriculture Development and International Forestry Students Association, was his saving grace in providing the needed fice. He said, 'There was a chance for young people from the Global South to be funded to come to COP27 . That was how I got the opportunity to come to COP27 .' Omoit told Nigerian Tribune that the other difficulty is getting information about the opportunity to be at COP meetings. 'Even getting information about these opportunities is really hard. People don't have access to information about these opportunities that are available for them to attend such events. 'If you don't belong to a network that knows about these events, your chances about getting here are really meagre.' Mana Omar Mana Omar Mana Omar is a climate justice and gender justice activist from Kenya. She said that her journey to COP27 'Accreditation was the hardest part of my journey to COP. We were reaching out as youths to organisations that had accreditation. But they would block us out by telling us they had few slots for their own delegation. 'We were just at crossroads, not knowing what to do.' 'How I got to be here was through Fridays for Future MAPA (Most Affected People and Areas), a movement of youth activists from most affected places. They know us better as a collective and not as individuals. They connected me with organisations that gave me the badge to come to COP. And I can say it was just by chance.' She said, 'It was a traumatic experience for me because I carry the story of people who are most affected by climate change. Carrying such vital voices and having things not work out for you can be traumatic.' She added that 'it is also hard for funders because this place is so expensive. A budget for me to stay here is around $7,000.' Geoffrey Mboya Geoffrey Mboya Geoffrey Mboya is also from Kenya. The climate activist said he came to COP27 'representing London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as a youth advisor on Earth, Children and Cities; Living a Legacy Initiative as country director and Veterinary International as Kenya Communication Liason Officer.' He said, 'This is my first COP and I am excited. However, I am a bit apprehensive about access to accreditation from UNFCCC, because there are fewer organisations from Africa that are accredited. So, having access to accreditation was not easy for me. I really struggled just to be here. 'If I was not doing research with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, then I will not be here. This is because my other organisations were not accredited, which we are working on. 'My call is for future COPs to be more inclusive and take account of African activists to have more meaningful participation.' In terms of raising funds, Mboya said he approached organisations, friends in his network, and his personal savings to fund the trip and stay in COP27 . Lovelyn Andraws Thalkuma Lovelyn Andraws Thalkuma 'At first, I thought because I work for Rise Up Movement founded by Vanessa Nakate and Fridays for Future, it would be easy. But at some point, we were informed that accreditation was low this year, so we had to hustle for it on our own. 'I did not know that I had to have accreditation from UNFCCC. I reached out to a friend who said some NGOs are accredited and that I should reach out to them. I started reaching out with emails and phone calls. But most told me that the spots were given out.' She said however that a friend within the climate movement in Nigeria advised her to write to the Ministry of Environment through the Department of Climate Change. Thalkuma said that after an interview with the director of the Department of Climate Change, she was able to receive UNFCCC accreditation through the ministry. For funding, she said, 'There is this organisation, 'Together for Futures' that funds climate change youth activists so that we can represent our countries and regions as the most affected people. They paid for my flight, accommodation and feeding.' Thalkuma added that Â£ccreditation and funding for the youth should be more accessible so that youths can attend COPs and participate in making policies and negotiations.' Lucky Abeng Lucky Abeng Another Nigerian youth, Lucky Abeng, is with the Commonwealth Youth Climate Change Network. He attended COP26 in Glasgow last year and COP27 in Egypt. He said: 'When I confirmed I was going to COP27 , I reached out to some NGOs in Nigeria that had UN Observer status. At this point, they have the ability to issue accreditation. However, some had exhausted their slots, while some others were asking for ficial payment to issue me accreditation. 'Because I know they don't pay to receive accreditation, I reached out to other organisations and friends outside Nigeria, specifically in Ghana. 'I was able to get accreditation for the first week which I used in processing my visa.' He said to get accreditation for the second week of COP27 , he approached the Minister of Environment for second-week accreditation Â£nd he graciously issued me two weeks party overflow badge which was what I used for my two weeks of participation at the COP.' Abeng noted that 'Accreditation was pretty difficult this year. Maybe due to the crowd-carrying capacity of Egypt. Glasgow was different. We had more people attending last year. 'I know a couple of young people who could not attend this particular COP because of accreditation issues and maybe funding as well which is always a challenge.' A youth from the host country of Egypt, Mohab Sherif, is a campaign coordinator for Mock COP. He said, 'Accreditation was very hard. In Egypt, just one entity had confirmed accreditation since the beginning of the year. The rest did not have accreditation. There were lots of arguments about who would get accreditation and tough government negotiations to get accreditation for Egyptians. Egypt is hosting COP27 and I found it kind of ridiculous.'

The Minister of Environment, Barrister Mohammed Abdullahi has assured that the federal government is totally committed to tackling challenges affecting climate change in Nigeria in order to achieve emission reduction targets. Abdullahi disclosed this at the weekend during a ministerial press briefing on Nigeria's preparation for the 27th Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) Session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which will be held in El Sheikh, Egypt, from November 6 to 18, 2022. The minister noted that the global climate has been changing with devastating effects as a result of human-induced activities causing emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This, he said, is evident through increased temperatures, irregular rainfall patterns, rise in sea level and flooding, drought and desertification, land degradation, more frequent extreme weather events, declining freshwater resources and loss of biodiversity. He added that Nigeria is the worst hit by the impacts of climate change, due to limited adaptive capacity to cope with these impacts. Recently, he said increased flooding has been experienced in Kogi, Nasarawa, Abia, Jigawa states and in some other parts of the country, which is largely due to high intensity of rainfall. Read Also: Nigeria's role in achieving global climate change Abdullahi stated that Nigeria will launch a COP27 national logo, which represents the alignment with the ideals and objectives of COP27 . The hosting of COP27 in the city of Sharm El-Sheikh this year marks the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In these 30 years, the world has come a long way in the fight against climate change and its negative impacts on our planet. We are now able to better understand the science behind climate change, better assess its impacts, and better develop tools to address its causes and consequences. The minister noted that the Glasgow Climate Pact (GCP) adopted at 26th session of the UNFCCC Conference of Parties (COP26) and Outcomes in Glasgow, Scotland, called on countries to submit revised NDCs and long-term strategies by 2050, with the aim of transiting to net-zero emissions around the mid-century, which Nigeria is committed to achieving by 2060 and has commenced its implementation. The minister posited that the sixth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicates that delaying action is a luxury we can no longer afford' and unless countries expeditiously boost climate action and ambition on mitigation and adaptation, we would be facing a future of 2oC or more.' \</doc>

Nigeria\' s inflation surges to a 17-year high The latest report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicates that Nigeria\' s Consumer Price Index (CPI) skyrocketed to a 17-year high of 21.09% last October, a 0.32% point surge from the 20.77 % recorded in September 2022. The CPI is an inflation indicator that measures the percentage change in the price of a basket of goods and services consumed by households. According to the NBS, food inflation rose by 23.72% in October 2022. The high cost of basic food products like bread, cereals, roots and tubers and edible oils triggered inflation. In summary, the rising cost of goods and services has driven household expenditure to an all-time high. The bureau noted that the cost of basic essentials rose by 14.4% compared in H1 2022 to the N49.89 trillion ($1.13 billion) recorded same period in 2021. In terms of economic growth, the GDP growth rate decreased by 1.47% points in Q2\' 22 from the 5.01% recorded in Q2 2021. COP27 prioritises Africa and other emerging economies It\' s a big win for emerging communities at the just concluded United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP27 . The event wound up in Egypt \- where it was held- with a breakthrough agreement to provide  loss and damage funding for vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters. The key takeaway for emerging economies is a $ 3.1 billion climate investment plan to ensure everyone on the planet is protected by early warning systems within the next five years. The fund would help provide warning systems to mitigate impacts in vulnerable countries.  People in Africa, South Asia, South and Central America, and the inhabitants of small island states are 15 times more likely to die from climate disasters, said Ant\'f3nio Guterres, UN Secretary-General.  These disasters displace three times more people than war. And the situation is getting worse. On the sidelines of the conference, Germany committed \â¬ 40 million to the African Development Bank (AFDB) Group\' s Climate Action Window, to support climate adaptation in fragile African states. The Climate Action Window is mobilising up to $13 billion for climate adaptation for some 37 low-income and fragile states, the worst hit by climate change. Amazon joins the  layoff bandwagon However, Amazon promises to continue to work closely with each individual to provide support, including assistance in finding new roles.  In cases where employees cannot find a new role within the company, we will support the transition with a package that includes a separation payment, transitional benefits, and external job placement support, said Dave Limp, Senior Vice President of Devices and Services.  We know people across the organization may be impacted differently by this news and will lead with compassion for all team members, he adds.

Nigeria, Nov. 12 -- As the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) enters its seventh day on Saturday (today), adaptation and agriculture take the centre stage. But Adaptation and Resilience are of crucial importance to all parties, and in particular, developing countries. Reports have identified the changing climate and the devastating consequences that come with it, such as frequent and intense drought, storms, heat waves, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and warming oceans which directly harm animals, destroy their habitat, and wreak havoc on people's livelihoods and communities. As climate change worsens, dangerous weather events are becoming more frequent and severe - evidence has shown that beyond doing everything to cut emissions and slow the pace of global warming, adapting to climate consequences has become important towards protecting communities. The term "adaptation" describes modifications made to systems, procedures, and structures to lessen possible harm or take advantage of opportunities brought on by climate change. In order to respond to the effects of climate change, nations and communities must create adaptation strategies and put them into practise. Since 2011, under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a number of countries have developed National Adaptation Plans. In 2001, at COP7 in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh, countries acknowledged the specific needs of least developed countries as being unable to deal with the adverse effects of climate change and adopted some dedicated decisions to support them. Further at COP 16 in Cancun 2010, Mexico, National Adaptation Plan (NAP) was established as a process to enable Parties to formulate and implement NAPs as a means of identifying medium- and long-term adaptation needs, developing and implementing strategies, and programmes to address those needs. Research has shown that investing in adaptation is more economical and achievable than waiting and trying to catch up later. According to a UN Facts and Action on climate change, it is estimated that a $1.8 trillion investment in early warning systems, climate-resilient infrastructure, improved agriculture, global mangrove protection along coastlines and resilient water resources globally could generate $7.1 trillion through a combination of avoided costs and a variety of social and environmental benefits. So, this makes it important for countries to take adaptation seriously. According to the programme schedule for Saturday (today), about 12 adaptation-focused themes are expected to featured. The sessions include: Food and Agriculture for Sustainable Transformation Initiative, official launch of Initiative on Climate Action and Nutrition Climate Responses for Sustaining Peace (CRSP), a ministerial session on "Shaping the Way Forward on Adaptation Action and Support", a session on how to avert, minimise, and address loss and damage to infrastructure, adaptation solutions and technologies that can be easily transferred to the developing world, among others. According to the UN, the estimated adaptation costs in developing countries could reach $300 billion every year by 2030. But right now, only 21 per cent of climate finance provided by wealthier countries to assist developing nations goes towards adaptation and resilience, which only amount to about $16.8 billion a year. Despite a commitment by wealthier countries to provide $100 billion a year in international climate finance to developing countries, the Paris Agreement, the level of making up the pledge has not been impressive. A recent report showed that of all pledges made at COP26 in Glasgow by developed countries, about 60 per cent still remain outstanding. This has spurred doubts and scepticism within the ranks of leaders from Africa. According to Akinwumi Adesina, President of the Africa Development Bank (AfDB), African countries need to raise an annual average of $124 billion to adapt, but they're getting roughly $28 billion a year". He said nine out of the 10 most vulnerable countries to climate change are in sub-Saharan Africa and that it will cost $600 billion through 2030 to adapt to climate change on the continent. While calling for global support on the need to accelerate access to climate adaptation finance for African countries, Mr Adesina hinted that AfDB was allocating 67 per cent of its climate financing funding to adaptation. At a special session on Friday on "Advancing Adaptation Action in Africa" which was co-hosted by COP27 Mr Kerry said: "We are completely committed to working together with our partners to support vulnerable communities in their efforts to, sadly, have to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Something that everyone whether in developed, developing or emerging economies are impacted by." The discussions around adaptation on Saturday (today) are therefore expected to offer new models for adaptation funding to deal with climate change.

The minister addressed the press at the weekend on preparations by the ministry ahead of the United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of Parties ( COP ) 27 scheduled to be held in Egypt from November 6- November 18. He said the focus would enable Nigeria to acquire sustainable funding that would help drive 'nature-based solutions such as land restoration, reforestation, combating desertification, climate smart-agricultural practices as well as adaptation strategies.' 'Nigeria will also seek collaboration and support on sustainable waste management, renewable and clean energy provision, and finance for loss and damage,' he said. While stressing that Nigeria will push for developed countries to fulfill their financial pledges which would help the country in tackling the climate crisis evident in this year's flooding, Abdullahi said: 'The expected outcomes of Nigeria's participation will include increased partnership building that will help Nigeria achieve its emission reduction targets, address adaptation and mitigation, establish sustainable financing for climate actions, resilience building, poverty eradication, Energy Transition, and sustainable development. 'It is noteworthy to state Nigeria's political will to push for a holistic Climate Agenda that is sustainable and all-inclusive which has been demonstrated by Mr. President's action in assenting to the Climate Change Act and the subsequent appointment of the Director General of the National Climate Change Council and the drive by HE, the Vice President of Nigeria's Energy Transition Plan.

In less than a month, the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ) will take place at the Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. During the two-week conference, government and non-party stakeholders will deliberate about delivering greenhouse gas emission reductions and helping ensure a transition to a net-zero global economy. As representatives of over a billion Africans, I need not remind you that your people's future depends on what you agree with your colleagues. From history, we learn how western colonial powers used blank treaty forms to strip Africa of its resources - we should not allow history to repeat itself. Irrespective of all the talk you will hear about how this is a global initiative to protect the environment, rest assured that each regional bloc will enter the conference to protect its self-interest. So I urge you to be strategic in your negotiations. Before applying your strategy, it is essential to be aware of the tactics likely to be used by the Global North. Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England and Bank of Canada, said the shift toward net-zero emissions would be the 'Greatest commercial opportunity of our time.' However, the question that should be at the back of your mind is: What is the regional distribution of these economic gains? Suppose previous summits and discussions on climate change are to serve as a guide. In that case, the conference will once again be dominated by white economists, white NGOs, white politicians, white media, white philanthropists, white billionaires, white investors, white royalty, white think tanks, white academics, white activists and white celebrities making the critical decisions that affect the rest of the world. You will see the likes of Al Gore, Greta Thunberg, Larry Fink and David Attenborough, the patron saints of conservationism take centre stage while you would be relegated to the supporting cast role. The West's strategy will be to pontificate on the scale of climate change and the need for the world to transition to net-zero. They will not take responsibility for their complicity in causing the climate disaster and would suggest that all hands on deck are required to avert a climate catastrophe. Though they will acknowledge the astronomical cost of the transition to net zero as a manifestation of the white saviour industrial complex, they will offer to help you by giving you loans or aid, which will not compensate Africa for suspending her current economic and industrial model. Read Also: Climate change, Africa's conundrums and COP27 Before entering into any commitment, you must be intentional and strategic. I strongly advise that you work towards decolonising the climate change narrative by amplifying your black and brown voices. It would be best if you don't commit to a target without fully costing its impact on present and future generations of Africans. Please do not buy into every suggestion coming from the West, as it has a track record of changing the goalposts when things don't favour them. Africa must present a united front by embracing the spirit of pan-Africanism to negotiate from a position of strength. Individually, we might be small, but when we combine our 54 voices, the world will have no choice but to sit up and listen. We should have African Union representatives from the 54 member states to represent and negotiate on behalf of the continent. Africa's starting point should be from the premise that the Global North started the crisis and should bear the responsibility for resolving the problem with zero cost to Africa and other countries in the Global South. The West has had over a 200-year head start ahead of the rest of the world by reaching an advanced stage of development by exploiting the earth's resources. Between 1750 and 1850, the West contributed 100% of cumulative Co2 emissions. By 1950, it had contributed to 92.71% of cumulative Co2 emissions. Today, the USA has emitted over 400 billion tonnes since 1751, while Africa's cumulative Co2 emissions as of 1750 and 2020 were 0% and 2.88%, respectively. If you bring up the role the West played in the current crisis, they could attempt to shift attention to the scale of the current problem and the need for countries to move to net -zero targets. It would help if you ask them who bears the cost of this transition. Rather than taking instructions from the Global North, Africa should let the West know that contrary to popular opinion spewed by the western media, the greatest conservationists are not the white NGOs and white environmentalists but people of the Global South. For centuries, we have protected our lands, so we don't need to hear the Global North pontificate about how we are misusing our land. The current discussion regarding financing climate adaptation and mitigation in the Global South is the form of climate finance and aid from the Global North. The most prominent is the $100bn annual commitment made at COP 16 in Cancun in 2010 and at COP21 in Paris in 2015, where developed countries agreed to provide $100bn yearly up to 2025 to developing countries. As of the time of writing, this commitment is yet to be fulfilled. However, this pledge, of which $20bn has been earmarked for Africa, is grossly inadequate, and Africa and the Global South should reject it. The west often implements policies with little consideration of their impact on low-income countries in the Global South. A typical example is a call by western governments and standard setters to end the financing of fossil fuels. If this policy is implemented, countries like Nigeria, which generates 40% of its GDP, and 95% of its foreign exchange earnings from the oil and gas sector, will be economically castrated. We should also be cautious of increasing our debt load to transition to net-zero. According to Oxfam, around $24 billion of the climate finance loans granted to developing countries were offered on strict terms requiring higher repayments from low-income countries. I suggest that climate wealth distribution should be the anchor of your negotiating strategy at COP27 Here is how it will work: If Africa is expected to decarbonise in 30 years by forgoing fossil fuels, in that case, it will be at a competitive disadvantage relative to western countries. Therefore, an option to consider would be implementing a scheme that will compensate the Global South for pursuing a net-zero policy through a climate wealth transfer from the Global North to the Global South. You could calculate the wealth transfer by subtracting the per capita of each developing country from the average GDP per capita for the west (currently $44,107 per capita) and multiplying the differential by the total population. According to the High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People, half of the planet must be kept in a natural state to address the biodiversity and climate crises. To make this a reality, there is a proposal to protect 30% of the planet's land and ocean by 2030 (30x 30) at the forthcoming United Nations Biodiversity Conference in Montreal in December. At face value, the 30x 30 concept seems to be an intergovernmental initiative involving over 100 countries working towards curbing climate change. However, since most of the biodiversity hotspots are situated in the Global South, the protected land scheme could lead to a large-scale land grab in the Global South. According to Land Matrix, Africa is the most targeted region for large-scale land acquisitions in the Global South. Survival International, the London-based charity that campaigns for indigenous rights, argues that the 30X 30 plan will be the 'biggest land grab in history, destroying the lives and livelihoods of those least responsible for environmental destruction.' Carbon offset schemes give large western organisations a licence to pollute while offsetting their carbon emissions with reforestation and conservation projects mainly located in the Global South. This could lead to a race to the bottom to use the protected lands of the global South to fortify their green credentials. According to research by ActionAid, Shell's plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050 by offsetting 120 million tonnes of CO2 from its polluting activities would amount to the acquisition of 12 million hectares of land by 2030, leading to aggressive land grabs in the Global South. Eni, the Italian oil major, announced in 2019 that it planned a 20 million-acre forest project spread across South Africa, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Ghana to offset its emission. African delegates could tell the Global North that rather than using our land for its carbon offsets scheme, it should convert its 4.3 million hectares of western lands to forests and allow the rest of the world to use western land and forests for carbon offsets. \</doc>

Nigeria, Nov. 19 -- The United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, has said the scale of "loss and damage" caused by the devastating impacts of climate change across the globe is undeniable by anyone and that "all parties should show that they see it." The UN official disclosed this while delivering his remarks at the COP27 stakeout event on Thursday, a statement by the organisers said. "No one can deny the scale of loss and damage we see around the globe. The world is burning and drowning before our eyes," Mr Guterres said. He said global leaders cannot continue to "deny climate justice to those who have contributed least to the climate crisis ( Africa) and are getting hurt the most." "Now is a moment for solidarity," he added. At the ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 This, they say, will help to compensate helpless countries in Africa that contribute less than 4 per cent to the global emission to upscale adaptation and mitigation efforts towards coping with the lingering scourge of climate change on the continent. However, as the two-week-long summit is drawing to a conclusion in less than 24 hours, the African negotiators have expressed concerns over lack of progress on loss and damage in the negotiations room. The group said the position of Africans is not a contest for vulnerability, but the COP decisions have recognised Africa, and science alludes to the fact that Africa is a continent plagued by complex overlapping challenges, and many generations of Africans have been left behind and suffer consequences of actions not of their own making. "We are concerned about the lack of progress on various issues of importance to our group, particularly on finance, adaptation and loss and damage. However, with a few days remaining, we believe we can still deliver on all work streams, including on adaptation, loss and damage, mitigation and means of implementation," the group said on Tuesday. According to the African group of negotiators, Africa has the lowest historical and current emissions, noting that AR6 also estimates that adaptation costs in developing countries will reach $127 billion, of which Africa needs up to $86.5 billion annually by 2030," the statement quoted. Amidst these lingering concerns, Mr Guterres said there is clearly a "breakdown in trust" between North and South and between developed and emerging economies. He said: "We are at crunch time in the negotiations. " COP27 The UN boss asked all parties to rise to this moment and to the greatest challenge facing humanity because the world is watching and his simple message to all parties is to "stand and deliver" a meaningful climate action that people and the planet so desperately need. Mr Guterres lamented that the Global emissions are at their highest level in history which is still rising, and that climate impacts are decimating economies and societies. "We know what we need to do - and we have the tools and resources to get it done. And so I appeal to the parties to act in three critical areas," he said. Mr Guterres said the most effective way to rebuild trust is by finding an ambitious and credible agreement on loss and damage and financial support to developing countries. He said the time for talking about loss and damage finance is over. "We need action," he reiterated, urging all parties to show that they see it and get it, and send a clear signal that the voices of those on the frontlines of the crisis are finally being heard. "Reflect the urgency, scale and enormity of the challenge faced by developing countries," Mr Guterres said. Likewise, he appealed to all parties to forcefully address the huge emissions gap. He said the 1.5 global target is not simply about keeping a goal alive but that it is about keeping people alive. "I see the will to keep to the 1.5 goal - but we must ensure that commitment is evident in the COP27 He said: "Fossil fuel expansion is hijacking humanity." "Any hope of meeting the 1.5 target requires a step change in emissions reductions. We cannot close the emissions gap without an acceleration in the deployment of renewables." On the just energy transition moves by parties, Mr Gutterres said partnerships are important pathways to accelerate the phasing out of coal and the scaling up of renewables and that such effort must be expanded. This, Mr Guterres says is essential to keep the 1.5 degree goal within reach and that renewables are the exit ramp from the climate hell highway. The UN Secretary General said parties must act on the crucial question of finance, and that it means delivering $100 billion in climate finance for developing countries. Also, he said it means clarity on how the doubling of adaptation finance will be delivered through a credible roadmap. "They must provide the support developing countries need to embark on a renewable energy and climate-resilient pathway," he added. He said: "We have agreed on solutions in front of us - to respond to loss and damage, to close the emissions gap, and to deliver on finance. The climate clock is ticking, and trust keeps eroding. "The parties at COP27 have a chance to make a difference - here and now. I urge them to act - and act quickly," Mr Guterres said.

Deputy secretary-general of the United Nations (UN), Mrs Amina Mohammed, has commended Nigeria's participation at the just concluded UN Climate Change Conference - COP 27 in Egypt. Mohammed stated this when she paid a courtesy visit to the Ministry of Environment in Abuja, yesterday. While expressing her satisfaction to the minister of environment, Barr Mohammed Abdullahi, she said, "You've just come back from COP 27 and we want to congratulate Nigeria who have joined many other African countries In the Africa COP implementation. It was not a COP that people thought would succeed, it was a COP that was coming out of Glasgow COP 26. "We know that while we got serious leadership to attend COP, we came out with the success of the loss and damage fund, it has to be set up, it has to be financed." The UN deputy secretary-general added that next year's COP 28 will be the stock taking of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and noted that Nigeria must get the SDGs right, as it is an integral part of climate SDG goal 13. She called on the government to look into the SDG framework as one that enhances the climate outcomes in terms of the investments needed in energy, agriculture and the overall climate agenda. Earlier, the minister of environment, Mohammed Abdullahi, expressed gratitude to the UN Scribe for honouring his invitation to pay a visit to the ministry, where she once presided over, and also thanked her for the support she has given to the ministry in setting up the Nigerian Pavilion at COP 27 , which was adjudged as the best. \</doc>

By Usman Aliyu The 2022 Conference of Parties on Climate Change, popularly known as COP 27 , has begun on Sunday in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, with a call on everyone to work toward averting further climate crisis. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that no fewer than 50,000 delegates have so far registered for the annual global climate summit. The annual event, which is holding on the African continent for a second time, after the 2001 in Marrakech, Morrocco, will end on Nov. 18. "Everybody, every single day, everywhere in the world, needs to do everything they possibly can to avert the climate crisis," said UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell. Stiell said COP27 set out a new direction for a new era of implementation, where outcomes from the formal and informal process truly begin to come together to drive greater climate progress. The UN Climate Change executive secretary urged governments to focus on three critical areas at COP27 The first area, he said was a transformational shift to implementation of the Paris Agreement and putting negotiations into concrete actions. "The second is cementing progress on the critical workstreams of mitigation, adaptation, finance and loss and damage, while stepping up finance notably to tackle the impacts of climate change. "The third is enhancing the delivery of the principles of transparency and accountability throughout the UN Climate Change process," he said. NAN reports that the summit is coming up weeks after more than 600 lives were killed and millions of people rendered homeless in Nigeria due to flooding, which many experts blamed on the effects of climate change. COP27 Presidency vision is based on human needs, says Egypt The Egyptian COP27 Presidency has set out an ambitious vision for the conference, the one that will put human needs at the heart of our global efforts to address climate change. Sameh Shoukry, Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs, said the presidency intended to focus the world's attention on key elements that address some of the most fundamental needs of people everywhere, including water security, food security, health and energy security. Shoukry, who is also the COP27 President, said: "We're gathering this year at a time when global climate action is at a watershed moment. "Multilateralism is being challenged by geopolitics, spiraling prices, and growing financial crises. "While several countries battered by the pandemic have barely recovered, and severe and depleting climate change-induced disasters are becoming more frequent. "The COP27 creates a unique opportunity in 2022 for the world to unite, to make multilateralism work by restoring trust and coming together at the highest levels to increase our ambition and action in fighting climate change.

Abuja, Sept. 21, 2022 President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr Akinwunmi Adesina has reiterated commitments made by developed countries to provide 100 billion dollars annually in climate finance for developing countries. In a video posted on the website of the AfDB, Adesina delivered remarks at the second Climate and Development Ministerial Meeting. The meeting was hosted by the United Kingdom and Rwandan governments on Tuesday. It was also held on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. The AfDB president called on developed countries to redeem their commitments ahead of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. 'Africa is suffering, Africa is choking. Africa is in serious financial distress for what it did not cause. 'Therefore, there must be a greater sense of urgency, not in talking, but in doing and in delivering resources that Africa needs. 'What we need is finance. Unfortunately, we have megawatts of talk and zero delivery of financing. 'So if we can be more efficient in that, I think we will be able to solve the problem. I hope that we can land in Sharm El-Sheikh with the 100 billion dollars actually monetised. 'So that we can actually have low-income countries to finally put this to rest. 'We can do it but we have to determine that it has to happen in Sharm El-Sheikh.' He expressed gratitude for the support on the African Adaptation Acceleration Programme, which he said was Africa's Programme to deliver 25 billion dollars of finance to focus adaptation on low-income countries. He further recalled that the African Development Fund (ADF) would introduce a Climate Action Window to mobilise between four billion dollars to 13 billion dollars for climate adaptation for ADF countries. 'We have the African Development Fund, where we decided to open a climate action window, because these countries do not have access to climate finance. 'And need 600 billion dollars by 2030 to be able to adapt to climate change, to get only, what, 18 billion dollars? 'So there is a lot that they have to do. Therefore, the climate action window of the African Development Fund is critical.' According to Adesina, the continent has about 20 million farmers that will have access to climate smart agricultural technologies and weather index insurance to deal with some of the extreme weather patterns. The 2022 UNFCCC would take place from Nov 6 to Nov. 18 \</doc>

As the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) opens on November 6, 2022 in Egypt, the Federal Government, represented by the Federal Ministers of Environment, Power and Trade has recommended a white paper titled: 'Trade, Energy and Climate Change: Harmonising Nigerian and Global Concerns on Climate.' Led by PUTTRU, an Africa's online business facilitation platform that connects energy companies to financiers from all over the world, the white paper is a collaborative effort with the Federal Ministry of Environment, Federal Ministry of Power, Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, Energy Commission of Nigeria and the Office of the Deputy President of the Senate. The objective of the white paper is to inform the international community and Nigeria's trade partners on how the country's national concerns on trade, energy and climate change can be harmonised with global concerns in a manner that ensures that Nigeria's interests are seen as global interests. The white paper posits that given Nigeria's large and growing population, achieving this balance between trade, energy and climate change is a matter of national, continental and global concern. Ultimately, the goal is to strengthen Nigeria's position as a global trade partner in the global supply chain as the world moves towards a net-zero future. \</doc>

Egyptian Foreign Minister, Sameh Shoukry, has been elected President of the Conference of Parties ( COP ) 27 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Shoukry was elected by the parties during the opening plenary on Sunday in the city of Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. COP27 began in the Egyptian city on Sunday and would last until Nov. 18, where issues bordering on how to address the impact of climate change take a front burner. In his address after the election, the newly-elected president called on countries to show faith in multilateralism over the next two weeks as they negotiate to deliver on the goals of the Climate Convention and the Paris Agreement. 'It comes as no surprise to anyone that the COP is being held this year in a world which is witnessing political turmoil that cast a long shadow on all our nations and has resulted in energy and food crises. 'However, these challenges should be no reason for delaying our collective effort to fight climate change. What is COP27 'It is inherent on us all in Sharm El Sheikh to demonstrate our recognition of the magnitude of the challenges we face and our steadfast resolve to overcome it,' Shoukry said to climate envoys and delegates at what is considered to be one of the largest COPs ever in terms of attendance. The Egyptian minister asserted that the host country made sure that COP27 would provide the optimum setting to align and converge multiple views, as well as facilitate transparent, inclusive and fruitful discussion, to ensure the most positive outcome achievable. He acknowledged the challenging economic and geopolitical factors, but noted, however, that external circumstances should not be allowed to negatively affect the negotiating process. The president added that as a COP hosted in Africa, it must consider the needs of the developing countries and ensure climate justice through availing the appropriate finance and other means of implementation. This, he said, is necessary as African countries are the most affected by climate change. The new COP president acknowledged the tireless efforts of his predecessor, COP26 President, Alok Sharma, and commended him and his team for their efforts and dedication with everything they achieved in hosting COP26. He commended the outcomes and agreements their work helped to secure, reiterating the commitment of the Egyptian Presidency to deliver on an impactful and inclusive COP. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the conference of the parties adopted its agenda, and for the first time since the adoption of the UN climate convention, parties agreed to introduce loss and damage funding as an agenda item at the climate conference. Loss and damage refer to the destructive impacts of climate change that cannot be avoided either by mitigation or adaptation. (NAN) \</doc>

With the growing climate uncertainties and mounting financial needs for climate adaptation and mitigation, member countries across the Commonwealth are keen to see businesses take up a greater role in the fight against climate change. An official side event co-organised by the Commonwealth Secretariat and the Governments of Saint Lucia, Namibia and Zambia at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) was held in Egypt this week on 10 November to tackle the issue. Senior government officials, international experts and members of the business community discussed ways to &ldquo;unlock&rdquo; private sector finance to bolster climate action in small and other vulnerable countries. The Commonwealth Secretary-General, the Rt Hon Patricia Scotland KC, outlined the challenge: &ldquo;To address the impacts of climate change and meet ambitious targets to reduce carbon emissions to net-zero, we will need an estimated US$4 trillion each year by 2030. This includes unprecedented investment for the deployment of technologies to speed the energy transition. &ldquo;Yet climate finance flows in 2021 reach around US$632 billion: just a sixth of what is required. We cannot fill this gap without the private sector.&rdquo; In his remarks, the Minister of Education, Sustainable Development, Innovation, Science, Technology and Vocational Training of Saint Lucia, Hon. Shawn Edward, highlighted the devastating climate disasters that small island states recurrently face &ndash; and the vast amounts of debt that governments must accrue to finance recovery efforts. He said: &ldquo;To deal with the impacts of climate change, small island developing states (SIDS) like Saint Lucia have to go out and search of resources on a continuous basis. Hundreds of millions of dollars in climate finance have been pledged and promised by developed countries. Those monies are not forthcoming. Consequently, we SIDS have to borrow to deal with our climate change issues, creating a situation where we are saddled with debt that is not sustainable.&rdquo; The Minister of Green Economy and Environment of Zambia, Hon. Collins Nzovu MP, emphasised that while vulnerable countries are responsible for just 4 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, they are the most affected by climate change. Many are also charged above-average interest rates on loans, due to their &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; classification, leading to further debt-distress. Hon. Nzovu added: &ldquo;At the same time, many of these countries are endowed with abundant natural resources, which represent huge investment opportunities. So we are not only interested in concessional funding and soft loans; we are also looking at the private sector. How can international firms come to our countries to work with us in public-private partnerships, where we can work with you to de-risk those investments?&rdquo; The event featured presentations by the Director of the Eswatini Meteorological Services at the Ministry of Tourism and Environmental Affairs, Duduzile Nhlengethwa-Masina on the work undertaken by the Commonwealth Climate Finance Access Hub in the Government of Eswatini to develop a private sector engagement strategy for climate action, as well as the Executive Director of the Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance, Karen Sack. This was followed by a panel discussion that highlighted the role of multinational companies in raising climate finance, the opportunities and challenges for green investments in developing countries, as well as innovative financing solutions, such as debt-for-nature swaps. Speakers such as Veronica Jakarasi of the Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund underlined the importance of trusting businesses in Africa and investing in them to enable growth. Young entrepreneur and co-ordinator of the Commonwealth Sustainable Energy Transition (CSET) Youth Action Group, Christopher Chukwunta, called for more engagement of young people &ndash; who make up 60 percent of the combined population of the Commonwealth &ndash; in the mobilisation, allocation and deployment of climate finance. Other panel members included: CEO of Caribbean Climate Smart Accelerator, Racquel Moses; CEO of the Environmental Investment Fund of Namibia, Benedict Libanda; Manager of the Climate and Environment Finance Division of the African Development Bank, Gareth Philips; Manager of the Coral Reefs & the Blue Economy and the Building Back Blue Programme at UNDP, Vineil Narayan; Head of the Independent Evaluation Unit at the Green Climate Fund, Andreas Reumann; and Head of Oceans and Natural Resources at the Commonwealth Secretariat, Dr Nicholas Hardman-Mountford. The session ended with a statement by Head of Climate Change at the Commonwealth Secretariat, Unnikrishnan Nair, who shared a five-point agenda on engaging the private sector in the work of the Commonwealth Finance Access Hub (CCFAH). The CCFAH supports small and other vulnerable states to raise funding for climate projects. Working directly with line ministries in member governments, the CCFAH has helped to secure around US$53 million in climate finance for at least 12 countries, and trained more than 2000 government officials in developing robust funding proposals \</doc>

Nigeria, Nov. 28 -- In the Holy books of the Abrahamic religions of Christianity and Islam, the Red Sea is symbolic as a place of significant events and the beginning of liberation from oppression. Will the Red Sea town of Sharm El Sheik be recorded in history as a place of significance in the quest of humanity to save our planet from self-destruction and climate justice? Time is perhaps the only answer. The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference or Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC, more commonly referred to as COP27 , ended on a high note on African soil, with some leaders from developing nations giving each other a high fives. But what was the deal in the Red Sea town of Sharm El Sheik, Egypt? Did God path the Red Sea for developing nations to pass through to the promised land? Is it yet Uhuru for developing countries who have been crying for climate change justice given that their contribution to the carbon emission is insignificant, yet they bear the brunt of the devastating effect of climate change? Are the rich industrial countries ready to commit to reducing carbon emissions and work towards the 1.5c temperature limits agreed upon globally as the point that will create a sustainable climate environment for our earth? One significant decision made at the Red Sea town was a vague agreement that rich countries should pay poor ones for climate-related "loss and damage". This happened after nearly 30 years of back-and-forth and sustained pressure by the global south for climate justice . Still there are many unresolved issues, which may be beset or shaped by politics, diplomacy , science and of course economics. Take, for example, the loss and damage fund, which is the big takeaway of sub-Saharan Africa and other vulnerable countries from the Red Sea, the concerns are when will the transition committee thrash out the finer details ? What framework will be put in place for the generation and management of the fund? And who should pay for damages and on what basis since science has different empirical ways of reaching a decision? Who will benefit from the fund, and on what basis? Will the fund serve as a disincentive or incentive for rich countries to emit more gases? The historical trend points to the fact that these unseen unresolved contentious issues are the basis for why the fund may not see the light of the day nor deliver its desired outcomes, and therefore emerging countries should not celebrate too early, for they are not out of the Red Sea with any substance yet. Developing nations, particularly sub-Saharan African countries, left the Red Sea without asking these pertinent questions. At the Copenhagen summit in 2009, rich countries promised to supply annual climate financing of $100 billion to developing countries by 2020 to help them slow climate change and resist its effects. What happened to that pledge? Did developing nations access the funds? The money that has been pledged is paltry: about $260 million. And countries have yet to agree on who should pay and receive the cash. Under the bizarre terms of the UN's climate convention, China - after America, the second-largest total emitter in history - would count as a "developing country" and be a suitable recipient. Another Pyrrhic victory at the Red Sea for African countries is the failure of COP27 to end fossil fuel use, a perceived victory for poor oil-producing nations. Incidentally, it was Russia and Saudi Arabia that mounted a vigorous campaign against ending the use of fossil fuels. Considering that rich western countries had, in the past two centuries, used more than their fair share of fossil energy for industrial power development, which is at the root of the current climate crisis, the pendulum of justice is in favour of poor oil-producing countries. The challenge for Africa is multiple. Our governments are yet to find enough fossil fuels for essential industrialisation. Developing alternative energy sources requires resources that most countries do not have. Yet they now must protect their populations from the adversities of climate change: flooding, excessive heat, deforestation, and higher energy costs. A keen observer would have expected that oil-producing developing countries of Africa that need revenue from oil and gas to transit would have been at the vanguard. What is the implication of the backing for oil and gas production for countries like Nigeria? Is it sustainable in the medium to long term? How can Nigeria and other oil-producing countries that are poor use this period of grace before the inevitable cuts on carbon fuel consumption to transition from reliance on fossil fuel products to a diversified product range for export to the rest of the world? Our transitional dependence on fossil fuel is further justified by the fact that fifty per cent of our people do not have access to power, so the base power is not even there. This is not to discountenance the fact that the days of fossil fuel usage are numbered. Developing nations and African countries need concessions on existing debts, benefits on imports of technologies for clean energy innovations and credits on funding for clean-energy research and infrastructure such as solar and wind energy fields. Climate change hits Africa more than other parts of the world, apart from small island developing states of the Caribbean. Sub-Saharan Africa emits negligible greenhouse emissions, yet we suffer the most from its impact. It affects almost all aspects of our lives, from agricultural productivity, heatwaves, humanitarian crisis, political crisis, and migration issues to population crises. Yet the worst polluting nations are not in a hurry to mitigate its impact on Africans. The multiplier effect of this climate change-induced problem is enormous, given the poor economic conditions of the people affected. With an already poor quality of living in most of sub-Saharan Africa, disaster has multiple impacts and often is damaging to a vast proportion. When faced with similar disasters, rich countries cope better and have the resources to bounce back to normalcy quickly. In developing countries, the impact of such crises lingers for decades, and the human cost remains a constant trauma in the collective minds of those who managed to survive. A few weeks ago, almost a quarter of Nigeria was flooded. This led to a loss of lives and property. Most communities lost all their livelihood, making life miserable for people already poor and struggling even in good times. There is fear that the recent flooding has threatened our food security and led to increased food prices, making an already bad inflationary situation worse. Unfortunately, but true, Nigeria did not access any of the existing climate change funds, whether for mitigation or adaptation, to the best of my knowledge. Part of the reasons is procedural complexities and limited technical knowledge. Building capacity in scientific knowledge, technology and politics of climate change is now urgent. All said ,the best scenario for sub-Saharan Africa is for the rich countries to reduce their carbon emission and make the world a better home for all. In addition, multilateral financial agencies like the IMF and World Bank should grant concessions to global south countries seeking assistance for investment in clean energy infrastructure. Africa's response to the challenges of global climate change should be a combination of realism and clear-headed diplomatic engagement. Expecting humanitarian handouts and concessions is a regress to old begging bowl habits. It is time now to look closer at the finer details of the "loss and damage" agreement and start the process of passing through the red sea. The devil is often in the details. Beyond the soundbites and euphoria of agreeing on" loss and damage funds" lies the reality of mitigating the devastating impact of climate change-induced crisis. Whilst interrogating this reality, developing countries should also ruminate on their energy needs and to what extent they are willing to rely on clean energy, given that, as an emerging country, they need cheap energy to fuel their industrialisation. Emerging countries must not entertain any deal that will hamper this reality. We should remember that the energy consumption of the state of California is more significant than that of sub-Saharan Africa put together. In 2020 California consumed 6,923 trillion Btu whilst sub-Saharan nations consumed about 1570 trillion Btu. We need more energy for production and to improve the quality of life of the people. We must not mortgage the future of our unborn generation for any funds that want to limit our access to cheap energy. These convinced me that we are still at the tip of the red sea, waiting for God to part the sea for us to pass through. We have no choice but to force the hands of God as did Moses or Musa and hope He will part the Red Sea for his people to go. It is not yet Uhuru! Dakuku Peterside is a policy and leadership expert.

Nigeria, Nov. 15 -- President Muhammadu Buhari has said Nigeria lacks funding to urgently finance its energy transition and climate action agenda due to debt distress in the country. The president, who was represented by the Minister of Environment, Mohammed Abdullahi, disclosed this while addressing the high-level segment of the 27th edition of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt on Tuesday. At COP26 in Glasgow last year, the minister announced Nigeria's commitment to net-zero by 2060 on the basis of a detailed Energy Transition Plan (ETP). He described the plan as the first of its kind in Africa and that it highlights the significant scale of resources required to attain both development and climate ambitions by 2060. ".However, the public finance urgently needed to fund energy transitions and climate action is lacking - a situation compounded by debt distress affecting many low- and middle-income countries," he said. The minister recalled that at COP26 last year President Buhari had said: "For Nigeria, climate change is not about the perils of tomorrow but what is happening today." Nigeria is currently grappling with devastating effects of terrible flooding which has affected 3.2 million persons, over 600 lives lost, over 100,000 persons displaced and over 300 hectares of farmlands destroyed. "Nigeria and indeed the rest of Africa, from the Sahara to the Cape, is living with increasing fear of food insecurity as a result of the floods," the minister said. Amidst all of these challenges, the minister explained that the country is taking bold steps to pioneer innovative climate finance instruments such as debt for climate swaps; and championing the development of the African carbon market initiative. "In support of this, Nigeria has enacted the climate change law alongside the initial governance framework and launched the Nigeria Emission Trading Scheme (ETS)," he added. To signal investment readiness, the minister said Nigeria has made significant progress in creating the enabling policies and incentives to advance a shortlist of priority projects, including Renewable Solar Independent Power Plants (IPPs), scaled Decentralised Renewable Energy (DRE) projects and gas flare commercialization opportunities, to name a few. "We are hopeful that investors in the global community will recognize the immense investment opportunities and potential for impact," he said. This year, a major agenda being put forward by developing countries, mostly on the African continent, is the "loss and damage finance," to assist helpless countries to cope with the impacts of climate change that cannot be adapted to, and where losses are permanent as in the case of floods, disaster and sea level rise. The minister said the economic cost of "Loss and Damage" for Africa is estimated at almost $2 trillion excluding non-economic losses, and that developed nations must not ignore the demand from developing nations to establish a Loss and Damage finance facility to help developing nations recover from the adverse effects of climate change, particularly the devastating floods, worsening desertification, and rising sea levels. As the largest economy in Africa, the minister said we are engaging the G7 to request the inclusion of Nigeria in the G7's Climate Partnerships List for the co-creation of a Just Energy Transition Partnership. He said: "Africa contributes about 3 per cent to the global emissions but is left to cope with the devastating impacts of climate change." He noted that Nigeria has spearheaded initiatives aimed at recovering degraded land for the Sahara and the Sahel such as the Great Green Wall and that there is a dire need to expand existing adaptation acceleration programmes for developing countries.

In response to the devastating impacts of climate change affecting vulnerable people all over the world, Egypt - the host country of COP27 in partnership with the UN Climate change High-Level Champions and the Marrakech Partnership has launched the Sharm-El-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda. The Sharm-El-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda outlines 30 adaptation outcomes to enhance resilience for four billion people living in the most climate-vulnerable communities by 2030. The launch is coming at a time when research has warned that nearly half the world's population will be at severe risk of climate change impacts by 2030, even in a 1.5-degree world according to the analysis published by the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change AR6 WG II report. Sameh Shoukry, COP27 president and Egypt's minister of Foreign Affairs said the Sharm-El-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda is a critical step at COP27 . 'We are determined to develop a governance arrangement that secures continuity in scope, priorities, and reporting while increasing action on the ground that accelerates system interventions, and the adaptation and resilience outcome targets identified by the High-Level Champions,' Shoukry said. 'During our Presidency, we look forward to The Marrakech Partnership, the High-Level Champions and specialized UN agencies working together to ramp up an agenda of global adaptation action by following up on the implementation of the Sharm El-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda.' Read also: COP 27 Also, Mahmoud Mohieldin UN Climate Change High-Level Champion for COP27 : 'The Outcomes were identified jointly with a broad range of active stakeholders, reflecting existing and new global targets based on science along with local knowledge and initiatives.' 'At the core of the outcomes is the recognition that adaptation is often locally-driven and globally relevant, while simultaneously needing to address equity, diversity and justice.' This agenda will accelerate the race to resilience global goal of making four billion vulnerable people more resilient by 2030. According to him, $140 to $300 billion needs to be mobilised across both public and private sources annually with a minimum target of 50 percent for adaptation, as called by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. 'As the growing number of climate emergencies throughout the world clearly shows, focusing on adaptation is a crucial, pressing necessity.' 'The Adaptation Agenda outlines multiple actions and combines the commitments of governments and non-Party stakeholders into a joint vision and a joint plan. We need all stakeholders on board to deal with current and future impacts of climate change, and this is a prime example of how that can happen.' The Agenda emphasises the urgency for counting with evidence-based, actionable adaptation plans for all actors, making climate risks visible and accessible, and deploying the locally-led adaptation principles. \</doc>

Although African delegates had marginal success in placing the continent's unique needs and circumstances on the agenda of COP27 , the ultimate deal to create a 'loss and damage' fund is a huge boost to tackle climate change. The proposed dedicated fund will provide a framework for developed countries to compensate developing countries that have suffered the impact of climate-related damage to infrastructure. It promises to benefit Africa, a continent, disproportionately afflicted by the effects of climate change. Even as delegates from across the world, drawn from government, private sector, not-for-profits, young people, civil society, indigenous peoples, and local communities congregated to discuss the solutions, there was the backdrop of severe droughts and floods in different parts of the continent, defining the urgency. The challenge for Africa now lies in sustaining the momentum to address 'loss and damage' by setting in motion the proposed fund. We need to lock in the details that will operationalise the fund, for it to begin paying out compensation to unlock its benefits, for inclusive and sustainable development that leaves no one behind. There is a great onus on the international community to turn the agreement into action in the spirit of 'follow through' that COP27 was about. Additionally, consideration needs to be given to widening the net of contributors to the fund beyond the developed countries to draw in the private sector, including through innovative mechanisms, such as sustainable smart finance. Besides the opportunity presented by the 'loss and damage' fund, there were other glimmers of hope in advancing climate change action at COP27 . These too need to be consolidated and pursued. One such opportunity is food systems, featuring prominently in COP27 for the first time in such gatherings. We cannot win the fight against climate change unless attention is paid to holistically transforming food systems. Having it on the negotiation floor is a crucial first step in this direction. This focus needs to be sustained and explore scaling resilient systems while tackling emissions across the value chains. In addition to this, indigenous voices were significantly represented at COP27 . This needs to be built on and strengthened, knowing communities are good custodians of nature. Nature is our climate defender and we need communities to unleash this potential if we are to effectively tackle the climate crisis. We have to link the mega commitments to action at the grassroots by investing in nature-based solutions. All these are opportunities to re-energize the fight against climate change. Africa cannot afford to relent and take its foot off the pedal. Efforts need to be sustained to scale up urgent climate action. More importantly, the continent has to continue working together to fight climate change and biodiversity loss. Now more than ever before, collective response to the climate crisis is key, to unlock investments in technology transfer, capacity building, and financial resources. We all have to work together for a better future by pursuing the opportunities unlocked by COP27 . COP 27 reaches breakthrough agreement on compensation fund for vulnerable countries As we tackle the climate change crisis, nature-based solutions must remain a core part of our ammunition. Natural habitats have the ability to absorb and store vast amounts of carbon. It is projected that protection, restoration, and better management of our lands and wetlands reduce up to a third of the emissions needed to limit global warming and keep the climate within safe boundaries. Natural solutions not only restore and protect vulnerable ecosystems but also positively impact the livelihoods of communities. Nature-based solutions require more climate funding, beyond the current less than 10% percent globally. In this regard, The Nature Conservancy will continue providing the expertise and the science for governments and other actors. As Africa looks ahead to COP28 next year, delegates must prepare well to secure a more ambitious mitigation outcome. The continent needs to secure a robust global goal on adaptation and the scaling of funding to move faster and further, beyond pledges and commitments towards effective climate action. Ajagbe is the regional managing director, Africa, at The Nature Conservancy \</doc>

The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has announced that it would convene local, national and global actors in its quest to seek solutions that would transform agri-food systems and make them more efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable to ensure that no one is left behind in the efforts to eradicate hunger and malnutrition. In a statement obtained from its website, the UN food body said that it would be having its first ever food and agriculture pavilion jointly hosted with the Rockefeller Foundation at COP 27 that is scheduled to hold from November 6 to 18 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The FAO Director-General, Mr. QU Dongyu, said: "We are proud to have our first ever Food and Agriculture Pavilion at COP27 , which is timely with the launch of the two new thematic FAO Strategies on Climate Change, and on Science and Innovation, to be implemented in synergy." As world leaders gather for COP27 , communities around the world are grappling with the compounded impacts of a global pandemic, growing pressures from the climate crisis, high energy and fertilizer prices, and protracted conflicts, which have disrupted production and supply chains and dramatically increased global food insecurity, especially for the most vulnerable. The Executive Managing Director, CGIAR, Claudia Sadoff, said: "Supporting the transformation of food, land and water systems in a climate crisis is CGIAR's mission and the stakes have never been higher. Millions more people are on the brink of food insecurity and threats to the livelihoods of smallholder farmers are increasing. We are honored to collaborate with FAO and The Rockefeller Foundation to ensure that these important issues are firmly on the agenda of this year's COP." On his part, the President of The Rockefeller Foundation, Dr. Rajiv J. Shah, said: "Climate change is a singular threat to humanity, and we cannot fully address it without building equitable, resilient, and sustainable food systems that nourish both people and planet. Good ideas and actions for transforming our food systems can come from anyone, and we are proud to support a space where knowledge can be shared." \</doc>

From\\xa0November 6\\xa0to 18 of this year, the world shall gather in the Egyptian city of Sharm El-Sheikh for the 27th session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, otherwise known as the United Nations Climate Change Conference . This year's edition is very significant, not just because it is being hosted in Africa, but because climate change has particularly left a painful mark on the continent this year. Nigeria is still reeling under the debilitating blow of a nationwide flooding that has, so far, killed more than 600 citizens, while displacing about 1.3 million others. Other African countries that have been so flooded in varying degrees are Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, The Gambia, and Uganda. Interestingly, as if God had prepared them for such a time as this, in January 2022, a small group of African women, mostly advocates with long-lasting engagement with the women and gender constituency, had started the "African Feminists Taskforce for COP27 " with the aim of mobilising African feminists ahead of COP27 to ensure African women's voices and demands, aspirations, and vision are centered in COP27 processes and outcomes. In April 2022, a public call was made to expand representation and ensure inclusivity of the taskforce, thereby upgrading to 150 members in the taskforce. Then on October 11, the body officially launched the African Women's and Girls' Demands for COP27 , in an event that simultaneously held in hybrid format in Nigeria (Abuja), Burundi, Cameroon, Republic of Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Mozambique, Central African Republic, Senegal, Uganda and Sao Tome and Principe. This is significant because, historically, women's actions usually turn the tide. Africa has contributed negligibly to climate change but has been among the hardest hit by climate impacts. More so, these are trying times for the continent, when we are battling multiple crises: Climate change, economic crunch, fallout from COVID-19 pandemic and now the Russia-Ukraine war. Surely, it is time for the global community to prioritise the needs of the region. The women's 27 demands are presented under six categories. The first is on representation, leadership and participation; where they demand the inclusion of women and young people in the national and UNFCCC decision-making processes. Therein, they demand equal representation and meaningful engagement of women, girls, people with disabilities, Indigenous Peoples, and youth in their diversity, at all climate change processes at global and national levels; knowledge and skills development opportunities for women, girls, and young people related to the climate processes, to aid their engagement in national delegations and global policy processes; and the prioritisation of investment in implementation and monitoring of the UNFCCC Gender Action Plan, including support to National Gender Climate Change Focal Points. The second category is the demand for a just and equitable transition from fossil fuels, for all. Here, they demand that developed countries commit to immediately halt all new investments in fossil fuels and nuclear energy, with a clear and urgent shift from a fossil fuel-based economy to a sustainable, just and feminist economy centering gender-responsive use of renewable energies. In addition, that developed countries, particularly the European Union, pull out of the Energy Charter Treaty and stop its expansion to other countries \- as the ECT allows coal, oil and gas corporations to obstruct the transition to a clean energy system. They also demand a targeted, multi-dimensional approach to supporting the poorest and most vulnerable countries through investments in safe and clean energy to cut greenhouse gas emissions, create jobs, and strengthen local economies; while ensuring that renewable, safe and clean energy projects that reduce the burden of unpaid care work, which women and girls spend up to 75 per cent of their time engaged in. The third category is climate finance, wherein there is demand for the provision of adequate, accessible, affordable, flexible, and human-rights-centered climate finance as a matter of justice and equity; while calling for increased transparency and accountability for pledges made and public funds delivered by developed countries. Following it, they demand the creation of a dedicated, debt-free finance facility for "loss and damage" to urgently support developing countries currently dealing with multiple losses and damages caused by the climate crisis; the delivery in full of $100bn climate finance per year; and the scaling up of adaptation finance by prioritising grants as opposed to loans. They also demand reassessment of funding modalities by financing institutions and mechanisms in order to ensure flexible funding to fit different contexts and funding needs of distinct groups especially women, youth, and Indigenous Peoples; and meaningful engagement and inclusion of women, girls, and young people in the development of funding criteria and allocation for climate change initiatives, including adaptation, mitigation, technology transfer, and capacity strengthening at all levels. They request that governments and climate funding facilities make funding available to support the work of National Gender Climate Change Focal Points and gender-transformative climate change programmes; while strengthening government capacities for gender budgeting for climate change initiatives. The fourth category is on agriculture and land rights, which demands expanded women's access to and control over land, productive resources, and debt-free, flexible funding for ecological agricultural production and food sovereignty efforts; protection of the rights of women small-scale farmers and food producers, artisanal fisheries, pastoralists, and Indigenous Peoples from losses and damages caused by climate change, eviction, abuse, and violence; respect for communities' rights to full control of their agriculture and indigenous seed and food systems, as well as traditional farmers' rights as espoused in the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. The fifth category is on technology, which demands an immediate halt to the practice of "biopiracy" (the unauthorised appropriation and commercial exploitation of knowledge and genetic resources from farming and Indigenous communities by individuals or institutions seeking exclusive monopoly control through patents or intellectual property); and that private sector investments in mitigation and technology are not used as replacements for public investments. They call on the world to defund false solutions and untested, unsustainable and imposed technological fixes that prove to be nothing more than to spur profit generation schemes for foreign private investment. The sixth category is on intersectionality and linkages with other work programmes, and demands gender mainstreaming in national policies, programming, and budgets related to climate change and disaster risk reduction that address gender-based violence and strengthen the provision of sexual and reproductive health and rights services. It also calls for the development of national climate learning strategies that are gender-transformative and recognise the importance of youth leadership by prioritising civic engagement, green skills, life skills, policy processes, and activism, and meaningfully engage girls and young women in the development of these strategies; while centering human rights and enhancing the safety and security of women human rights and climate justice defenders, especially in conflict areas, by reducing the proliferation of firearms and denouncing militarism. This also demands for the protection of water sources and watersheds such as natural forests to ensure water security for communities and the spin-off benefit of reducing the workload of women and girls; preservation of the oceans and coastal ecosystems\\xa0\\xa0by developing effective adaptation and mitigation measures to address harmful impacts of climate change and environmental pollution; strong coherence with other international policy frameworks; and a shift away from neoliberal capitalist economic models that excessively, unjustly, and unsustainably exploit natural resources and women's bodies to fuel the greed of a few individuals and countries at the expense of sustainable development for many developing countries and the health of the planet. \</doc>

Download logo The EIB ( HYPERLINK https://www.EIB.org https://www.EIB.org The European Investment Bank (EIB) Group will convey the urgency of mobilising massive resources for global warming mitigation and adaptation at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, from 6 to 18 November 2022. The EU bank will affirm its unwavering commitment to deploying its full range of financial tools in support of the swift decarbonisation of our economies. The EIB Group (European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund) will launch new initiatives under its Climate Bank Roadmap, supporting a just transition to climate neutrality globally, and a framework to promote environmental sustainability. In addition, the EIB will team up with partners to announce new green financing projects and initiatives. EIB President Werner Hoyer commented: "Russia's war against Ukraine is a catastrophic human tragedy. It has also exposed the world's vulnerability and dependence on fossil fuels. Decarbonisation has now become a prerequisite not just for saving the planet from climate disaster, but also for energy security and safeguarding cohesion at a global level. This is why our response to the crisis must focus on renewables, energy efficiency, and innovative technologies that will power sectors such as heavy industry, shipping and aviation. I therefore call on the COP27 conference to put partnerships to support new technologies at the centre of its discussions. The EIB stands ready to work with all our partners to finance the green solutions of the future." EIB Vice-President Ambroise Fayolle added: "To meet the Paris goals we must halve global emissions by 2030. To do so, we must get climate finance right and make sure we support those countries and communities that find it hardest to make the green transition a success. At COP27 , the EIB will report progress on the implementation of its Climate Bank Roadmap and launch new initiatives to support environmental sustainability. Through our dedicated arm for operations outside the European Union, EIB Global, we are stepping up our efforts to support green energy projects globally, with a special focus on Africa." EIB Vice-President Gelsomina Vigliotti said: "We have worked closely with Egypt as the incoming COP27 The EIB boosts clean energy financing in support of REPowerEU Plan The EIB Group will support the European Commission REPowerEU Plan ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3DsLGJ8 ) with an additional &euro;30 billion in loans and equity financing over the next five years. The additional funds from the EIB Group will be directed to renewables, energy efficiency, grids and storage, electric-vehicle charging infrastructure, and breakthrough technologies, such as low-carbon hydrogen. The package of new, targeted financing approved by the EIB's Board of Directors on 26 October is expected to mobilise up to &euro;115 billion of new investment by 2027, thus making a substantial contribution to the REPowerEU objective of ending dependency on Russian fossil fuels. It is a supplementary envelope, on top of the EIB Group's already robust support for the energy sector in the European Union, averaging around &euro;10 billion of financing per year over the past decade. Just transition everywhere The EIB pledges to expand its range of financing tools for projects aimed at supporting a just transition to a climate-neutral economy across the world. At COP27 , the EIB will release a statement to offer financing and advisory services in regions that combine carbon-intensive production with socioeconomic fragility. Moreover, in the context of a just resilience strategy, the EIB will pledge to support adaptation actions explicitly addressing the needs of population groups most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Environment framework At COP27 , the EIB will launch its environment framework to support environmental sustainability projects globally, thereby pursuing a green, resilient, equitable and inclusive development approach. The EIB will support operations helping to reduce pollution and protecting health and human well-being, the sustainable use and protection of water resources, and the development of a sustainable blue economy protecting marine and coastal resources. The EIB will also help speed up the shift towards a more circular world and increase its contribution to supporting the reversal of the global trend of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. Accelerating gender-smart climate finance The full participation of women as leaders, employees, entrepreneurs and consumers is essential for climate finance to be effective and tackle the climate crisis at the speed and scale necessary. The EIB, together with its partners, will at COP27 call for urgent action to improve gender equality in climate finance. On gender day, 14 November, the EIB will co-host a high-level event with the Council of Europe Development Bank and Hivos to discuss avenues for accelerating gender-smart climate investments, from enhancing access to quality green jobs and leadership opportunities for women to developing inclusive low-carbon infrastructure. The EIB Climate Survey The EIB has launched the fifth edition of the EIB Climate Survey ( https://bit.ly/3T3Hbua https://bit.ly/3T3Hbua ), a thorough assessment of how people feel about climate change. Conducted in partnership with market research firm BVA, the EIB Climate Survey aims to inform the broader debate on attitudes and expectations in terms of climate action. More than 28 000 respondents from the EU27, the United States, China and the United Kingdom participated in the survey in August 2022, with a representative panel of people aged 15 and above for each of the 30 countries polled.

Africa's agriculture sector, which accounts for the most jobs across the continent, remains largely rain-fed, and thus highly vulnerable to climate change. Incidents of famine and floods across Africa are rising owing to rising global temperatures, with consequences for agricultural production and food supply. In fact, about 80 million will join the growing number of the global food insecure by 2050, according to the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), albeit mostly in the global south. The consequences of drier lands extend beyond nutrition to security as well, as the intractable violence from terrorism, kidnapping, banditry, and civil war across an even more arid Sahelian West Africa show. Ironically, a lot of African countries are recording better progess on climate goals despite these challenges relative to their rich counterparts, which face almost none of these troubles, but do not hesitate to ask for more sacrifices for the greater good from developing countries. In the face of these climate change threats, which are the consequences of the rich world's industrialisation, Africa remains largely agrarian, as almost all countries in the region barring South Africa are yet to industrialise. While industrialisation and climate action are not necessarily mutually exclusive, the stage of development does matter for the pace of making the transition to greener energy sources. If it took China 70 years to industrialise with fossil fuels, it can best be imagined how much longer African countries will require to do similarly after many false starts and failures with fossil fuels thus far, talk less with renewable energy sources that are still not versatile and scalable enough as yet. The drift here is not about an abandonment of a green path to industrialisation for Africa, but rather a recognition that a continent so under-developed as Africa is at the moment, should not be realistically expected to make such a huge leap without due consideration for its myriad challenges and ever elusive developmental aspirations. Africa's energy transition to net zero emissions will have to be gradual and balanced - one that allows it to use its existing energy resources for development as it taps its abundant renewable energy resources in a manner and pace that lead to a sustainably rich and green future. It is thus na\'efve for African leaders to simply join rich countries in abandoning fossil fuels without tangible assistance from them to enable African economies successfully make the transition to net zero carbon emissions on time, nor should they have expectations that rich countries will ultimately do the heavy lifting for them. Read also: COP27 In other words, African leaders must not only own the continent's energy agenda, they must also ultimately plan to fend for themselves as their rich counterparts are. Consequently, it is farfetched to suppose Africa will be able to transition to greener energy sources at the same pace as its developed counterparts. The 5-year continental green recovery action plan for 2021-2027 launched by the AU Commission in July 2021, which emphasises support for renewable energy, energy sufficiency as well as a just energy transition, remains a robust framework for driving the continent's climate action measures. There is agreement in this regard across most stakeholders in the continent's public and private sectors, as well as civil society. To articulate Africa's case ahead of COP27 , for instance, the Mo Ibrahim Foundation facilitated a forum of experts in May 2022 that recommended similarly as follows: Africa must negotiate to secure concessions that balance net zero emission goals, energy access, and energy security for the continent, with gas as a transition fuel in tandem with renewables. In the same vein, the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the Atlantic Council facilitated a forum of experts in July 2022 to discuss how to make a robust case for a just energy transition for Africa at COP 27 with similar recommendations.

Led by a 13-member steering committee of African leaders, CEOs, and carbon credit experts, the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI) was launched today with the aim of dramatically expanding Africa's participation in voluntary carbon markets. The initiative was inaugurated at COP 27 in collaboration with The Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP), Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), and the UN Economic Commission for Africa, with the support of the UN Climate Change High-Level Champions - Dr Mahmoud Mohieldin and Nigel Topping. According to a press release by the COP27 media team, issued on behalf of the COP26 and COP27 High-Level Climate Champions, ACMI announced a bold ambition for the continent to reach 300 million credits produced annually by 2030. This level of production would unlock 6 billion in income and support 30 million jobs. By 2050, ACMI is targeting over 1.5 billion credits produced annually in Africa, leveraging over $120 billion and supporting over 110 million jobs. Commenting on ACMI's ambition, Damilola Ogunbiyi, the CEO of SEforALL and a member of the ACMI's steering committee, said, 'The current scale of financing available for Africa's energy transition is nowhere close to what is required. Achieving the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative targets will provide much-needed financing that will be transformative for the continent.' Multiple African nations including Kenya, Malawi, Gabon, Nigeria and Togo shared their commitment to collaborating with ACMI to scale carbon credit production via voluntary carbon market activation plans. Together, these 7 countries have a maximum potential to generate ~300+ MtCO2e. Even capturing 25% of this potential, 75 MtCO2e would be double the total credits issued across the entire continent in 2021. Commenting on the announcement, Vice President of Nigeria and ACMI steering committee member, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo said, 'Carbon markets can deliver tremendous benefits for Nigeria and for Africa-creating jobs, driving green investment, and reducing emissions. Nigeria is putting the groundwork in place today so that in subsequent years, carbon credits become a major industry that will benefit our people.' Carbon markets offer an incredible opportunity to unlock billions for the climate finance needs of African economies while expanding energy access, creating jobs, protecting biodiversity, and driving climate action. However, Africa currently produces only a tiny percentage of its carbon credit potential. Crucially, ACMI is committed to supporting high-integrity credits where an equitable and transparent distribution of revenue goes to communities. ACMI steering committee member and USAID Chief Climate Officer Gillian Caldwell noted, 'The African voluntary carbon market will only succeed if people trust that African credits are driving real climate action and having a positive human impact. As the VCM scales in Africa, USAID and ACMI will ensure that it does so with integrity as a core pillar.' To stimulate the production of high-integrity credits, the ACMI is collaborating with global integrity initiatives like the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (IC-VCM) and the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMI), as well as other regional carbon market platforms. ACMI released Africa Carbon Markets Initiative, Roadmap report: Harnessing carbon markets for Africa at the initiative's COP 27 launch event. The report identifies 13 action programs to support the growth of voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) on the continent. Although voluntary carbon markets are already growing quickly-retirements of African credits have grown by an average of 36% annually over the past five years-aggressive action will be required to maintain this level of growth over the coming decades. ACMI is also working with major carbon credit buyers and financiers, such as Exchange Trading Group, Nando's, and Standard Chartered, to set up an advance market commitment for hundreds of millions of dollars for high-integrity African carbon credits. \</doc>

Antonio Guterres, the United Nations Secretary-General, has called for a Climate Solidarity Pact between developed and emerging economies in which all countries make an extra effort to reduce emissions this decade in line with the 1.5-degree goal. In a speech at the opening session of COP 27 in Egypt on Monday, he called for a pact in which wealthier countries and international financial institutions provide financial and technical assistance to help emerging economies speed up their own renewable energy transition. 'A Pact to end dependence on fossil fuels and the building of coal plants - phasing out coal in OECD countries by 2030 and everywhere else by 2040,' he said. 'A pact that will provide universal, affordable, sustainable energy for all. A Pact in which developed and emerging economies unite around a common strategy and combine capacities and resources for the benefit of humankind.' He said the United States and China have a responsibility to be part of this pact as the choice before the world appears stark. He said: 'Today, some three-and-a-half billion people live in countries highly vulnerable to climate impacts. 'In Glasgow, developed countries promised to double adaptation support to $40 billion a year by 2025. We need a roadmap on how this will be delivered. And we must recognize that this is only a first step. Adaptation needs are set to grow to more than $300 billion dollars a year by 2030. Half of all climate finance must flow to adaptation.' He said international financial institutions and multilateral development banks must change their business model and do their part to scale up adaptation finance and better mobilise private finance to massively invest in climate action. 'Countries and communities must also be able to access it - with finance flowing to identified priorities through efforts like the Adaptation Pipeline Accelerator,' he said. This year's COP 27 is bringing together tens of thousands of participants and more than 100 heads of state to discuss efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions and ways to cope with a changing climate. It will run from Nov. 6-18 in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh. COP27 aims to build on the Glasgow climate deal created at last year's summit, as well as 2015's Paris Agreement, but attendees face a sobering reality. 'We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator,' Guterres said. 'We are in the fight of our lives. And we are losing. Greenhouse gas emissions keep growing. Global temperatures keep rising. And our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible.' Reports published in the run-up to COP27 show the world is on course to warm between 2.6 and 2.8\'b0C (5.04\'b0F) by the end of the century unless further emissions cuts are achieved. Officials have urged countries to commit to plans to further reduce emissions and meet the Paris targets of limiting warming levels to 'well below' the 2\'b0C mark, with an aspirational target of 1.5\'b0C. Scientists have warned that warming beyond 1.5\'b0C would have calamitous consequences, such as the potential disappearance of warm water coral reefs worldwide, flooding, desertification, and other troubles. At this year's COP holding on African soil, many developing countries are calling for more attention and financing to be channelled to measures that can help countries cope with the effects of climate change that are already present, such as creating warning systems for worsening extreme weather event. Guterres acknowledged that the war in Ukraine, conflict in the Sahel, and violence and unrest in so many other places are terrible crises plaguing today's world but climate change is on a different timeline and a different scale. 'It is the defining issue of our age. It is the central challenge of our century. It is unacceptable, outrageous, and self-defeating to put it on the back burner. Indeed, many of today's conflicts are linked to growing climate chaos,' he said. He said the war in Ukraine has exposed the profound risks of our fossil fuel addiction. 'Today's urgent crises cannot be an excuse for backsliding or greenwashing. If anything, they are a reason for greater urgency, stronger action, and effective accountability.' The UN chief blamed human activity responsible for climate change and said human action would be the solution. 'The science is clear: any hope of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees means achieving global net zero emissions by 2050. But that 1.5-degree goal is on life support - and the machines are rattling. We are getting dangerously close to the point of no return,' he said. To avoid that dire fate, he said all G20 countries must accelerate their transition now - in this decade and developed countries must take the lead. \</doc>

By Muhyideen Jimoh Lorraine Chiponda, Facilitator, 'Dont Gas Aftica", a Civil Society Organisation (CSO) has called on Nigeria and other African countries to stop oil production and focus on renewable energy. Chiponda disclosed this to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Sharm El-Sheikh at the sidelines of the 27th Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 27 ). The climate activist said Africa should be focusing it's expertise on building robust renewable energy infrastructure rather than expanding oil exploration. "We are faced with a life threatening crisis, that is the climate crisis, which is caused by global warming, which is caused by burning of fossil fuels. "So we should be closing down fossil fuel pipelines rather than allow African people to continue to die because of climate disasters. "Renewable energy is the way to go, it has become cheaper in terms of investment and it's going to create more cleaner jobs," Chiponda said. She also stressed the need for the multinational oil companies (mainly from Europe, U.S) to be held accountable for the damage caused to the environment in Africa. The activist maintained that these oil companies continue to exploit Africa for business profits while going green in their home countries. " Oil companies need to transition themselves,. they need to be accountable for the climate impacts that they have caused. " They have devastated the environment, they need to be held accountable and rehabilitate the environment that they have damaged," she said. Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy, Climate Action Network also highlighted the need for developed countries to address the issue of climate "loss and damage" in Africa. NAN reports that world leaders and representatives from 198 countries and more than 30, 000 delegates are attending the COP27 . COP27 begins near the end of a year that has seen devastating floods and unprecedented heat waves, severe droughts and formidable storms, all unequivocal signs of the unfolding climate emergency. At the same time, millions of people throughout the world are confronting the impacts of simultaneous crises in energy, food, water and cost of living, aggravated by severe geopolitical conflicts and tensions. In this adverse context, some countries have begun to stall or reverse climate policies and doubled down on fossil fuel use. COP27 is also taking place against the backdrop of inadequate ambition to curb greenhouse gas emissions. According to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, CO2 emissions need to be cut 45 per cent by 2030, compared to 2010 levels to meet the central Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. This, the UN said, is crucial to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, including more frequent and severe droughts, heatwaves and rainfall. A report published by UN Climate Change ahead of COP27 shows that whilst countries are bending the curve of global greenhouse gas emissions downward, efforts remain insufficient to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Since COP26 in Glasgow, only 29 out of 194 countries came forward with tightened national plans. The summit which started on Sunday will end on Nov. 18.

Frontline community activists, local and international civil society groups, development experts and government representatives will converge in Abuja on September 29 and 30, 2022 for the National Conference on Climate Change, COP27 and Beyond, organised by Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA). According to a statement made available to Tribune Online, signed by Philip Jakpor, Director of Programmes of CAPPA, the conference comes a month away from the climate conference scheduled for Egypt in November. The statement added that the conference is intended to enrich the existing pool of information and resources needed to upscale inclusive climate change programming in Nigeria and, by extension, Africa. Jakpor explained that the discussions will be robust as the conference participants are drawn from the diverse spectrum that is relevant to articulating a common climate change agenda for COP 27 with emphasis on just energy transition. A special guest at the conference is Nigeria's vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo while the keynote address on 'Nigeria, COP27 and The Quest for Real Solutions' will be delivered by Dr Nnimmo Bassey, former chair of Friends of the Earth International, and current Executive Director of Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF). The panel session will include topics such as Highlights of Nigeria's Climate Response Policy Environment, Nigeria 2021 NDC, the Facts and the Fallouts, Pushing Back Fossil Fuels and False Solutions: Pathway to a Just Transition for Africa, Ukraine, Russia War and Renewed Scramble for Oil in Africa, and Unmasking Carbon Politics and Carbon Economy, among others. Civil society participants will also issue a communique at the end of the conference. \</doc>

Nigeria, Nov. 17 -- The Centre for Journalism Innovation and Development and PREMIUM TIMES Thursday released a documentary that shows the "loss and damages" due to the recent flooding disaster in Nigeria. At the ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 This, they say, will help to compensate countries in Africa that contribute less than 3 per cent to the global emission to improve adaptation and mitigation efforts towards coping with the lingering scourge of climate change on the continent. For instance, in 2022, Nigeria experienced one of its worst flood disasters ever. Over 26 of the 36 states in the country were affected by floods, resulting in the death of hundreds of citizens and the destruction of houses. Also, expansive hectares of farmland were ruined, and roads and bridges were washed off. This nature's rage, believed to have been aggravated by the existential climate change effects and poor government attention, sparked humanitarian tragedies as fears of worsening food insecurity linger. Funded by the Centre for Investigative Journalism, London, the documentary highlights the wanton destruction of livelihoods, houses and farmlands by the flooding incident across the worst hit states (Kogi, Delta, Bayelsa and Adamawa) in Nigeria with some of those affected recounting their ordeals. The initiative is one of the many interventions by the centre on the recent flooding in Nigeria. At the height of the disaster, CJID and PREMIUM TIMES deployed a team of investigative journalists to investigate the various loss and damages in 10 of the worst-hit states in Nigeria. Seven of the field reports published so far have shown the flooding's impact on businesses - industrial, textile, food and gas - education, agriculture, vulnerable persons in IDP camps as well as women and children. Also, more than 82,053 houses have been totally destroyed, rendering over 1.4 million people homeless and over 2,407 persons badly injured within this period. At the last minute, shortly before the commencement of COP27 in Egypt, and following the official announcement of Sameh Shoukry as the new COP27 President, "loss and damage" made it to the agenda items during the procedural opening of the annual conference. Ahead of COP27 , the item (loss and damage) was still uncertain but it finally crept into the agenda after being put forward by negotiators (including developing countries) after robust discussions among the 194 parties to the UNFCCC. At the plenary, the COP27 president said this year's deliberations on climate issues must consider the needs of developing countries (Africa) because they are least responsible for emissions and are the most affected by the global impact of climate change. "As a COP hosted in Africa, it must consider the needs of the developing countries and ensure climate justice through availing the appropriate finance and other means of implementation, as countries that are the least responsible for emissions are the most affected by climate change," Mr Shoukry said. Dozens of African countries and other developing countries are clamouring to see actionable commitments made towards loss and damages in this year's summit.

Experts and analysts have urged Africa to forge a common position and make an assertive case for a just transition that supports the continent's efforts to deal with climate emergency. The advice was issued at the recently held virtual seminar to facilitate effective dialogues on COP 27 COP 27 ), dubbed Africa's COP. According to them, the event was an opportunity to make the rest of the world to fully address Africa's concerns and back up previous and future commitments with actual action. The keynote address at the seminar was delivered by the Commissioner for Agriculture, Rural Development, Blue Economy, and Sustainable Environment of the African Union Commission, Josefa Sacko. She stressed that Africa faces several existential threats, including climate change, the impact of Covid-19 and conflict in Europe, which have placed millions of people at risk of hunger and poverty. Related News Experts to discuss growth options at economic summit Experts advise youths at conference Cooperatives can resolve poverty problems, say experts &ldquo;Africa must speak with a single voice in shaping how the world responds to the challenge of climate change. There has to be a focus on efforts to forge a common position before the conference,&rdquo; Sacko said. She tasked African nations and institutions to demand accountability at COP27 and devise mechanisms to ensure that long-standing promises made to the continent are delivered. &ldquo;Since the signing of the Paris Climate Agreement, there has been little done to increase funding for climate action in Africa, contrary to what was promised in the run-up to the agreement,&rdquo; she pointed out. Her address was followed by a discussion with the UN Climate Change High Level Champion for Egypt, Dr Mahmoud Mohieldin; and the Vice-President for Power, Energy, Climate at the African Development Bank, Dr. Kevin Kariuki. It was moderated by UN Assistant Secretary General and Director General of the African Risk Capacity Group, Ibrahima Cheikh Diong. \</doc>

Download logo The Presidential Climate Commission (PCC) will hold a Special Sitting today, Friday 4 November 2022, at which President Cyril Ramaphosa will set out Government's priority investment and financing interventions under the Just Energy Transition Investment Plan. Cabinet and the Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Just Energy Transition Partnership recently agreed that there may now be broader consultation on the investment plan. South Africa has entered into a Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) with Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union to support South Africa's phasing-out of coal and reduce potentially negative consequences on workers, communities and the economy. The President will update the Commission in his capacity as Chair of this independent, statutory, multi-stakeholder body established to oversee and facilitate a just and equitable transition towards a low-emissions and climate-resilient economy. Today's engagement forms part of South Africa's preparation for the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , more commonly referred to as Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC, or COP27 , which will take place in Sharm El Sheikh from 6 November. President Ramaphosa will travel to the Summit next week as leader of the South African Government delegation. Under the Just Energy Transition Partnership South Africa ahead of COP27 requires a financing package that is aligned to the country's fiscal realities and demands; upholds the development and climate finance principles and obligations that are due to developing countries, and is inclusive and just. The Presidential Climate Commission is focused on creating a social partnership around a just transition; defining a vision for a just transition, and means of achieving that vision, covering the necessary sectoral shifts, technological innovation, employment opportunities, and climate finance, as well as conducting independent analysis into climate change impacts on jobs, the economy, and policy. To these ends, the Commission engages with a wide range of stakeholders, including all spheres of government, business, labour, academia, communities, and civil society. Today's session will take place on a virtual platform from 16h00 to 17h30 online to receive and consider an update on the Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JETIP).

As the African continent battles with the adverse effects of climate change, Nigeria's Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo has tasked the continent's leaders to look towards private-sector-led, voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) as they hold major to accelerate economic development and simultaneously curb greenhouse gas emissions. He spoke ahead of the November 2022 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP27 hosted by the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt. He noted that African countries face a major challenge in financing in terms of transforming their economies, even as dependence on financing from the Global North remains more of a promise than a reality. He, therefore, charged the continent's leaders to take thoughtful and deliberate action toward addressing the challenges of global warming. He said, "One of the key challenges for Africa in confronting the climate challenge is how to finance the necessary transformation of regional economies. Flows of climate finance from the Global North on the scale required remain more of a promise than a reality. "Part of the solution, as obtained in other climes, is to unlock the vast potential of carbon markets. The realisation is dawning across Africa that private-sector-led, voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) represent a major opportunity to accelerate economic development and simultaneously curb greenhouse gas emissions. But seizing this opportunity will take thoughtful and deliberate action, including by African governments. "That's why we are excited to be taking part in a new initiative to be launched at the COP 27 climate summit at Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The African Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI) seeks to support a dramatic increase in the production of African carbon credits while ensuring that carbon credit revenues are transparent and equitable and create good jobs. Crucially, these must be high integrity credits that are used to supplement direct decarbonization and which deliver real climate action." Vice President Osinbajo noted that Africa has not maximised its potential in terms of VCMs in the face of the global demand for VCMs, and urged the governments of Africa to do more. He further said, "Global demand in VCMs has nearly quadrupled in the last five years, driven principally by companies buying credits to help meet their climate pledges. Demand for African credits is also increasing, but from a low base, and the continent currently produces only a small proportion of its potential." \</doc>

From November 6 to 18, El Sheikh, Egypt, will host the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , often known as COP27 . This will be the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference . During the last conference (Cop26), which was held in Glasgow, Scotland, very few Africans attended due to COVID-19 and vaccination issues. This edition however is a profound opportunity for the continent, which is already devastated by climate change to make a collective bargain. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) needs assessment estimated that developing countries need $6 trillion by 2030 and that Africa will particularly require $2.5 trillion by 2030 to effectively deal with climate change issues. Africa, with a population of 1.4 billion people (about 17 per cent of the world's population) contributes less than 5% of the global greenhouse emission but it is the most affected and the least informed about climate change issues. At the just concluded Pre- Cop27 Media Conference in Kigali, Rwanda, organised by Kenyan-based think-tanks (Power Shift Africa and MESHA) and Rwanda Media Commission, which was designed to equip journalists to effectively report the event from Africa's perspective, experts said scaling up funding to the continent is central to meeting the target of cutting emissions. At the previous conferences, developed countries that are the highest polluters made a commitment to deliver $100 billion to fight climate change in developing countries but that was never met. Mohamed Adow, CEO of Power Shift Africa, opined that success at COP27 , in the long run, depends on its ability to get funds flowing from "developed countries to developing countries- at the pace and scale required to match the climate challenge." The climate change expert held that a key priority for Africa is to get industrialised countries to "deliver and increase exponentially from the floor of $100 billion amount to at least $150 billion per year until 2025 and fulfil pledges to the Adaptation Fund and new pledges to respond to the increasing adaptation needs." Addressing African Climate Journalists, Mr Adow said Africa has long been the forgotten component of the climate puzzle, but this is intolerable in a year when the continent is hosting COP27 , adding that, "This needs to change, and it needs to happen at the African COP. "If we are to deal with climate change, we need to change our current energy systems as they are failing Africans. Renewable energy has the capacity to meet the needs of Africans and help build resilience to the climate crisis." Daniel Okechukwu Ogbonnaya, Country Representative of Global Green Growth Institute in Rwanda, echoed the voices of other African activists on the need to provide significant funding to deal with the climate crisis, which he argued is responsible for low agricultural productivity, drought and food crisis in Africa. At the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Tuesday, the Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, while sharing the sentiment of developing countries advised world leaders that the rich energy and conglomerates should be obligated to release some dividends from their profits to support victims of climate change and to deal with rising fuel and food costs. He argued that the fossil fuel industry, which emits a significant amount of greenhouse gases, was making "hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies and windfall profits while household budgets shrink and our planet burns." However, climate change activists like Mohamed Adow and a host of others fear that Africa may have a problem because many fossil fuel companies investing across the continent may weaken the collective resolve of the governments to speak with a unifying voice on renewable energy, mitigation and adaptation, and if that happens, the continent will be in trouble. Nigeria at crossroads Nigeria is beset by the numerous debilitating effects of climate change and the realities it brings. Despite taking meaningful actions to combat climate change by contributing their share to the lofty targets of preserving global temperature levels at 1.5 degrees Celsius agreed upon at COP26, effort towards achieving renewable energy away from fossil fuel lacks vigour. Currently, desertification inches closer in the northern fringes of the country, erratic rainfall/drought affecting agricultural productivity across the country and flooding since 2012 have now become a national headache and in a scale never witnessed in history; yet, commitment has not been in a pace to commemorate climate change. With regard to the current state of carbon emission in the country, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) captures the Nigeria situation thus: "In 2020, Greenhouse Gases (GHG) in Nigeria totalled 126.9 million tons. The energy sector accounts for the largest source of GHG emissions (60% of total emissions). In 2017, Nigeria's GHG emission per capita (including land use) was 3.37 tons of CO2 equivalents, far below the global average of 7 tons. GHG emissions for Nigeria in 2030 are estimated to be 435 million tons of CO2 equivalents, representing a 31% increase in total emissions between 2018 and 2030." In 2021, President Mohammadu Buhari signed the 2021 Climate Change Act, which provides a structure for climate change response at the country level. The new Climate Change Act built on previous climate change policies is said to be comprehensive climate change legislation in the West Africa sub-region. Under the Climate Change Act 2021, the Federal Ministry of Environment is tasked with developing the country's budget. The budgets, which typically have a five-year cycle, are set in place to ensure that Nigeria meets its net-zero carbon emission targets between 2050 and 2070. Without funding, experts say the target might well be a mirage. \</doc>

Daniel Kanu In continuation of efforts to engender the alignment of country climate ambitions with the demands of frontline communities, the Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA) and a host of climate justice groups attending the 27th Session of the Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh have shared their recommendations, demanding that big Polluters pay debt owed to developing countries Also, CAPPA and her allies are demanding that African governments leverage Green Economic Opportunities including increased demands for electric vehicles, solar panels, batteries, etc. which are produced with critical minerals some of which are sourced from Africa places. In a release made available to Sunday Sun, signed by CAPPA Director of Programmes, Philip Jakpor, it noted that African climate activists among others demand that big Polluters and countries of the Global North pay the debt owed to developing countries and commit to no further infractions by cutting emission at source. "While the frontline communities report reinforces the fact that Africa is not immune to climate impacts despite contributing the least to climate change, the assessment report identifies barriers to a just energy transition in Africa and makes recommendations on how to address them. "African governments are also encouraged to remove barriers to renewable energy technologies in Africa such as import tariffs to make renewable energy accessible and affordable to most of the energy-poor African population. "They must also withdraw support for heavy-carbon projects such as the Dangote refineries and petrochemicals and Uganda's East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) which will lock Africa into fossil fuel trap, among others".

By Usman Aliyu Bill and Melinda Foundation has said its new commitment of 1.4 billion dollars to Africa, including Nigeria is to spur the region-led innovation to build a pipeline of climate-smart agriculture projects for smallholder farmers. Mr Enock Chikava, Interim Director, Agricultural Development of the foundation stated this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt at the sidelines of the ongoing UN Conference on Climate Change . While 2. 1 million dollars is meant for research and development in agriculture sector in Nigeria, Chikava said that the foundation would mobilise 9 million dollars for technologies that would help the region make a difference in livestock and crop. "Our focus is 100 per cent on smallholder farmers. If you look at the impact of climate change over the years, which I am sure in your own country, last year there was a severe drought and this year floods. "So if you look at that, there are so many things which are against the people livelihood, because a 50 per cent of your people depend on agriculture and if the 30 per cent of your economy is driven by agriculture, it means you need to protect it. "Now, there is that very platform that is responsible for lifting people out of extreme poverty is under huge threat because of climate change and because we focus 100 per cent on smallholder farmers, we are going to be spending $1.4billion to make sure that we do much better work. "By that we mean crops like cassava. We need cassavas that can tolerate draughts and floods. In Nigeria, flood has been the issue. In the research pipeline, the draught genre was never part and rarely a game, but now, we have draught and likely we are going to have more frequent draught. "So we need to be improving cassava in Nigeria not only for today, but also for the future. So we do that and we focus on crops like cowpea. In cowpea, Nigeria's worth is 4. 9 hectares, and that is a source of protein for the majority of the farmers. Related News "By introducing new varieties, which are climate resilient, we are going to make sure that smallholder farmers have access to them," he said. On performance of Africa in various interventions, the Gates official said some countries where making progress while others are lagging behind. "There is a biannual preview looking at every country, the progress it is making because there are certain indicators. "If you look at those indicators, you will see which countries are doing well, which countries are lagging behind. "There is Maputo/Malabo declaration that states 10 per cent of budget must be for agriculture, but Nigeria commits less than 2. 5 per cent. "You can't be successful without focusing on research and development. Do you know palm tree, its states of origin is Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone and Liberia. "Now two countries Malaysia and Indonesia produce 98 per cent of the global palm. Do you know the biggest importer? Nigeria. "The difference is R and D and that can happen in cassava; it can happen in any other one. That is why it is super important that we focus on research and development," said Chikava.

Download logo National Assembly House Chairperson for Committees, Oversight & ICT, Mr Cedric Frolick, has called for the reform of multilateral lending institutions and their lending policies to increase access to finances to address the climate crisis. Mr Frolick leads SA Parliamentary delegation attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP27 ) currently taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, until 18 November. He was addressing the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) meeting for legislators yesterday organized jointly with the Egyptian House of Representatives in Sharma El-Sheik  We need to reform multilateral lending institutions and their lending policies. As things stand the current policies have the potential to bind developing countries on the African continent and elsewhere into long term loans that will result in a debt trap for future generations, said Mr Frolick, while addressing delegates from more than 150 countries attending themeeting. He called on fellow MPs from developed countries to hold their Executives accountable to honour their commitments made at previous COP conferences. As an example, he emphasized that the current financial package of $ 8.5bn from the US, EU, UK, France and Germany to South Africa consist of 97% loans and only 3% grants.  This places multilateral support out of reach for most developing countries due to its onerous costs and conditionalities. It will result in making the attainment of the Paris Agreement very difficult and unimplementable, said Mr Frolick. The meeting adopted an outcome document that emphasizes the need for concrete action by governments and Parliaments around the world to address the urgency of the climate crisis. Discussions focused, amongst others, on climate action and sustainable development, prioritizing accountability for climate justice and Parliaments\' role in sustainably powering our future. In his closing address the Secretary-General of the IPU, Mr. Martin Chungong, made reference to House Chairperson Frolick\' s input that questioned the speed at which developed countries pass emergency budgets for war but are reluctant to meet their financial commitments to combat climate change.

Temitope Ponle The Government of the United Kingdom (UK) has promised to provide 200 million pounds to the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group's Climate Action Window. According to a statement issued on the website of the AfDB, the window is a new mechanism set up to channel climate finance to help countries adapt to the impacts of climate change. The statement quoted the British Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly as saying the UK would provide 200 million pounds to the AfDB Group's Climate Action Window. Cleverly spoke alongside African leaders at the ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP27 , in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. "Climate change is having a devastating impact on some of the poorest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa but historically they have received a tiny proportion of climate finance. "This new mechanism from the African Development Bank will see vital funds delivered to those most affected by the impacts of climate change, much more quickly,'' he said. The UK foreign secretary also said that access to climate finance for emerging economies was a central focus at COP26 in Glasgow. "I am pleased to see tangible progress being made, supported today by 200 million pounds of UK funding. " According to the statement also, Glasgow Climate Pact included a commitment from donors to double adaptation finance between 2019 and 2025. Related News Similarly, the statement also quoted the UK Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak as saying that the UK would surpass that target and triple adaptation funding from 500 million pounds in 2019 to 1.5 billion pounds by 2025. "This funding package provided to the African Development Bank will be 100 per cent earmarked for adaptation. '' The prime minister also confirmed that the UK was delivering on the target of spending 11.6 billion pounds on International Climate Finance (ICF) between 2021/22 and 2025/26. Meanwhile, the President of the AfDB Group, Akinwumi Adesina has welcomed the additional funding from the United Kingdom. "I applaud the UK government for this major contribution toward the capitalisation of the Climate Action Window of the African Development Fund. "As it seeks to raise more financing to support vulnerable low-income African countries that are most affected by climate change. "This bold move and support of the UK will strengthen our collective efforts to build climate resilience for African countries. "With increasing frequencies of droughts, floods and cyclones that are devastating economies, the UK support for climate adaptation is timely, needed, and inspiring in closing the climate adaptation financing gap for Africa." Adesina also said the support of the UK had given hope. "I came to COP27 \</doc>

Climate finance was one of the many sticky points hotly debated at the COP27 and this was why. Climate finance is money set out from the public and private sector to help developing nations mitigate climate change and essentially to help cut their greenhouse gas emissions and transition to cleaner energy sources. That's mitigation, adaptation. It is the same principle of money from developed to developing countries but this time to help them adapt to the consequences of climate change. Who should pay for impacts of climate change? Of course, tensions are rising between the North and Global South over the crisis considering the enormous damage to climate change. Expectedly, rich nations have pledged to mobilise $100billion yearly to developing countries. But so far, the closest they have come is $80billion. The money is meant to be a piggy bank for climate-induced extreme weather events. It's an insurance mechanism for developing nations that have been hit by climate-related disasters. Hurricanes, floods or slow onset events like rising sea levels. We are talking about financial reparations for disasters developing nations cannot adapt to. We are very far from the billions of dollars the NGOs say would be needed in order to properly compensate developing nations. And that's because rich countries continue to resist calls to loosen purse strings as they don't want to set a precedent and potentially expose themselves to a string of claims from other countries. For example, in Pakistan, the recovery cost of the recent deadly flood could rise to $30billion. Leaders at COP27 will inevitably discuss if the west should be held accountable for such damages. But with climate disaster becoming more frequent, and more severe, it's costs that they are reluctant to take on. Clearly, this question of global solidarity and climate justice was at the heart of discussion at the COP27 . COP27 Discussions within the roundtable, co-chaired by HE Charles Michel, President of the European Council and HE Cyril Ramaphosa, President of South Africa, emphasised the need for strategies, policies, mobilisation of appropriate finance at scale, technology, capacity building and major investment to ensure a just transition for the affected communities. The massive scale of the challenges requires major efforts exerted by not just by governments and the energy sector but also from international financial institutions and donors, as well as multilateral development banks and other non-state actors. Participants underscored that transition must be just and inclusive, leaving no one behind. The affected communities must be brought along, own the transition processes and being part of the solution. While some best practices exist, there is no one-size fits all approach and financial support and capacity building need to be adjusted to specific needs and each country's contexts. They also discussed opportunities for job creation arising from new economic activities that require establishing mechanisms that would allow for forms of training, capacity building, forms of reallocations of resources, including creating social protection systems that support transition. Several participants stressed on the importance of finance as a key component in implementing a just transition, as public finance can provide the right conditions for private financing to achieve the scale required, such as reducing investment risk. Others emphasized that the multilateral financial architecture plays a crucial role in mobilising public and private finance, which can unlock the barriers developing countries are facing. During the discussion, participants discussed the role of digital transformation in the transition towards a low-carbon economy and the need to take that into account while designing climate and social policies in support of the transition. Several solutions were demonstrated to deliver on finance and committing to pledges through different approaches such as partnerships or by leveraging existing partnerships, provisions of grants, provisions of concessional loans, or debt reliefs, in particular, for developing and middle income countries. These means can also be used to assist those who are impacted adversely by the transition or to lower the capital costs and unlock private finance to achieve a just transition. Making a case for Africa In her submission, Dr. Zainab Usman, a senior fellow and director of the Africa Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C, justified the need for Africa's participation in the process, noting that it is in the interest of the continent to get as much concession as possible given its propensity to suffer some unmitigated disasters fueled in part by the environment. Ms Usman fields of expertise include institutions, economic policy, energy policy, and emerging economies in Africa gives her enough latitude to engage in discourse analysis, said 'One main reason, perhaps, why African priorities barely make it to the top of the agenda is that the continent's researchers are severely underrepresented in the science that underpins global climate policy and debate. 'Not only are African voices missing from influential climate science publications, but 78% of global funding for climate research on Africa goes to researchers in North America and Europe, while only 3.8% goes to researchers on the continent, according to this IPCC Sixth Assessment Report.' To help address the problem of underrepresentation of African voices in climate science, policy and debate, Usman said her organisation came up with the African Climate Research Organisations Database. 'Expanding on an initiative we started in 2021, the database is an interactive website that compiles a list of Africa-based research organisations working on climate-related technical and policy issues. We have tracked at least 154 Africa-based organisations working on various climate change-related areas.' UK largesse to tackle climate change in Nigeria The funding, according to its Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, will support more than four million people, including two million women, to increase productivity while reducing emissions. Announcing the support at the COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, Cleverly disclosed that the investment is part of the efforts on tangible action to deliver on the commitments made at COP26 in Glasgow and support developing economies to tackle the impacts of climate change. The statement reads: 'The Prime Minister is expected to make a raft of adaptation-related announcements at the conference later today, including that the UK will triple funding for adaptation programmes from \Â£3500 million in 2019 to \Â£31.5 billion in 2025. 'Cleverly will also argue that long-term prosperity depends on taking action on climate change and ramping up investment in renewable energy across the world, pointing to the impact of Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine on the global economy. 'The Foreign Secretary will announce today that the UK will provide \Â£320.7 million in Disaster Risk Financing to support countries which face climate-related disasters, helping them to afford insurance and to access reliable funding, more quickly, after a disaster. 'As an example, this funding will allow the World Food Programme to insure food supplies for almost 5 million people across 23 vulnerable countries in cases of climate-related disasters and will help small island developing states build resilience to extreme weather events. 'This support is part of the commitment made in 2021 at the UK G7 in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, to spend \Â£3120 million on Disaster Risk Financing. 'The UK will also announce several new funding allocations to support countries to adapt to the impacts of climate change over the longer term. The UK will spend \Â£313 million to support vulnerable countries to adapt to climate impacts, and towards efforts to avert, minimise and address loss and damage, including through new funding for the Santiago Network, an organisation set up to support vulnerable countries to access technical assistance. 'In Nigeria, the UK will provide a \Â£395 million investment to support the development of climate-resilient agriculture programmes, for example through scaling up heat-tolerant crop varieties. The funding will support more than four million people, including two million women, to increase productivity while reducing emissions. 'Under the UK's COP Presidency, almost all developed country climate finance providers made new, forward-looking climate finance commitments, with many doubling or even quadrupling support for developing countries to take climate action.' Lifeline from Bill and Melinda Gates The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation echoed African leaders' calls for countries to rapidly scale-up finance for climate adaptation and pledged to invest $1.4 billion to help smallholder farmers address the immediate and long-term impacts of climate change. CEO Gates Foundation Mark Suzman announced this at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 'The effects of climate change have already been devastating, and every moment the world delays action, more people suffer, and the solutions become more complex and costly,' said Suzman. 'Our commitment will help smallholder farmers adapt today and build resilience for the future. It is essential for this climate summit to produce bold commitments that address immediate and long-term needs. Leaders must listen to the voices of African farmers and governments to understand their priorities and respond with urgency.' The foundation's commitment will fund immediate action and long-term initiatives over four years to help smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia build resilience and food security. Funding will focus on spurring African-led innovation to build a pipeline of climate-smart agriculture projects, new applications of digital technologies, climate-smart innovations for smallholder livestock farming, and support for women smallholder farmers to capitalise on their untapped potential. 'Women in rural Africa are the backbone of their food systems, but they have never had equal access to the resources they need to reach their full potential or build resilience to looming climate threats,' said Melinda French Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 'As the climate crisis accelerates, women's vital role in their economies is too important to overlook. With the right financing and marketing support, women smallholder farmers could earn more in a day than they currently earn in a month, ultimately transforming these regional food systems and unlocking a healthier, more sustainable, and more prosperous future for families and communities across the continent.' To improve the livelihoods of rural women in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the foundation is deepening its ongoing partnership with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The goal is to scale up initiatives that empower women farmers, support innovations at the nexus of gender and climate adaptation, and increase climate finance that gives rural women better access to the climate-smart resources they need to strengthen food systems. To accelerate the development of new adaptation innovations, the foundation is continuing to work with a coalition of partners to double the budget for the CGIAR agriculture research system. The CGIAR Excellence in Agronomy initiative partners with African research institutes, local businesses, and farmer organizations. Together, they are using big data, analytics, and digital platforms to deliver insights that can boost incomes, food security, and ecosystem health in smallholder farming communities. 'The climate crisis is causing enormous harm every day as it jeopardizes entire regions of people and economies,' said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 'More funding is necessary to ensure agricultural and technological innovations are widely available to vulnerable communities, helping them to adapt to climate change, save lives and increase economic growth.' \</doc>

Nigeria, Nov. 4 -- Ahead of the annual convergence of stakeholders across the globe for the Conference of Parties ( COP ), 27 in Egypt, the Centre for Journalism Innovation and Development (CJID) has launched a climate change reporting handbook. With funding support from the Open Climate Reporting Initiative (OCRI) of the British Centre for Investigative Journalism, London, the reporting guide for journalists and researchers was according to the organisation aimed at guiding journalists who would be attending the conference to have a clearer understanding of reporting the event. According to the centre, the handbook became necessary following the outcome of an earlier survey deployed to understand the skill set of journalists reporting climate change in Africa. "The survey, which ran for a month, was deployed to 14 countries in Africa with a total of 319 responses. The findings from the survey revealed some gaps that need to be filled when it comes to climate change reporting, hence the need for the reporting handbook," said Akintunde Babatunde, the CJID Deputy Director of Development Practice. Mr Akintunde added that because of the crammed schedule at the conference, "many journalists are often not clear on what to focus on and what not to." "This handbook aims to drive quality reporting regarding climate change and environmental sustainability in Africa. It captured the mandate of COPs, the African agenda and the important topics to cover during COPs," he added. CJID noted that the document was made public on Wednesday, 2 November and that copies could be accessed on the link. COP stands for Conference of the Parties, with "Parties" referring to the 197 nations that agreed to the United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992. The UNFCCC is a body tasked with the responsibility of supporting global response to climate change. The UNFCCC is a parent treaty to the Kyoto protocol and the Paris Agreement. These treaties aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere to "prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system, in a time frame which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development," according to a statement by UNFCCC. For nearly three decades since its establishment, the COP has been bringing together almost all the world's countries to discuss global climate change issues. The last event was held in Glasgow in November 2021, when the world leaders agreed on measures to reduce global carbon emissions to tackle the devastating effect of climate change. This year will make it the annual 27th summit, hence the name COP 27 , and will take place in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, from Sunday to 18 November.

SIR: About 112 heads of states and over 46,000 delegates including CSOs, scientists, policy makers, oil companies and the private sector as well as other stakeholders gathered at the Red Sea Resort, Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt from November 6-18, for the 27th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, COP27 . A few takeaways from COP reflect some successes and disappointments. On the credit side, parties agreed a facility on loss and damages. For about 30 years or more, developing countries have been demanding that the developed countries take responsibility for loss and damages being the result of skyrocketing emission largely from developed world, the biggest culprits being the US, China and EU. For the same period, the big polluters have resisted the move. Two of the many instances cited at COP27 to support the agitations for loss and damage had already been flagged by the CSOs sign on statement ahead of the COP. These were the devastating floods that happened in Pakistan affecting 33m people and causing over USD15bn (estimate) in damage. The ravaging floods that killed 612 Nigerians, impacted 3.2million citizens and rendered 1.4million homeless, damaging livelihoods and property worth billions of dollars. On the debit side, over 600 fossil fuel lobbyists were granted access to the COP27 climate talks which was 25% more than their participation at COP26. This did not go down well with climate justice activists who insisted that the UN needs to kick the big polluters out if it is serious about delivering climate action. The big one was that, there was a refusal to accept that fossil fuels are driving the climate crisis and must be phased out. At the end, 1.50C emission reduction target managed to remain without a plan on how to re-engineer efforts at country level to get there. COP27 ended with gains and disappointments, so, it was not entirely 'lost and damaged'. Going forward, we expect growing civil society and diplomatic pressure for a phase-out of all fossil as attention shifts to Dubai, UAE, for COP28, where over 80,000 delegates are expected to participate. \</doc>

Civil Society Organisations from Africa have called for attention on finance adaptation issues for Africa, ahead of the 27th Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) in Egypt. Dr Mithika Mwenda, Executive Director, Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), said this on Sunday ahead of the official opening of COP 27 in Sharma El- Sheikh, Egypt. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Conference, which began on Sunday, will end on Nov. 18. At a side event, the CSOs under the umbrella of PACJA, stressed the need for focus on issues of financing adaptation, loss and damage and honour of climate finance pledges to Africa. Loss and damage refer to permanent loss or repairable damage caused by the manifestations of climate change, including severe weather events, sea level rise and desertification. It is used in international climate negotiations to highlight the need to give priority to climate-vulnerable countries (including Africa) due to the severe climate effects they are experiencing. Vulnerable countries have argued that developed countries that cause the bulk of climate change with their historical emissions should pay for these effects. Mwenda said the position of the African CSOs will be handed over to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat and delegates from the developed countries. "We have outlined our expectations. It is up to the delegates to decide on the nature this COP should take. "But for us as Africans, issues we have highlighted and placed before the UNFCCC Secretariat will mean success or failure of this Climate Summit holding in Egypt," Mwenda said. The chairperson of Africa group of negotiators, Mr. Ephraim Shitima of Zambia, said they have been briefed from its interactions with the CSOs and other stakeholders about the African agenda at COP. "After several meetings in Zambia, Ethiopia and Egypt, Africans are of one voice; saying Africa needs recognition as the continent with special needs and circumstances. "They need financing of adaptation and loss and damage," Shitima said. He also emphasised the need for the Africa Group of Negotiators to advance the African agenda, which includes the continued demand by the continent for the G20 countries to deliver on the US$ 100 billion a year pledge that has yet to be honoured. "Only by the developed countries honoring climate financing will countries in Africa be able to implement the national determined contributions plans which runs into billions of dollars beyond the capacities of most of our governments," he said. NAN reports that world leaders and representatives from about 198 countries are attending the summit. President Muhammadu Buhari will be represented by the Minister of Environment, Mohammed Abdullahi, where he will deliver Nigeria's National Statement at plenary, attend bilateral and side meetings on Nigeria's Energy Transition Plan, amongst other engagements.

Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has said that Lagos State requires the sum of $8 billion to build a climate-resilient city. The governor of Lagos said this on Wednesday while addressing participants at a side event organised at the Nigeria pavilion at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Sanwo-Olu, who gave a virtual address, noted that the $100 billion pledge for climate finance by developed countries to assist developing countries had not been fulfilled. He said that the hindrances to this money being released, namely planning and political will, have been addressed by the Lagos State government. One such plan, according to him, was the Lagos Climate Action Plan under which Lagos aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Sanwo-Olu said the existence of a plan by the Lagos State government was a demonstration of political will. He said that with the state's climate action plan, his government would build resilient infrastructure, protect vulnerable groups in society and anticipate and improve its response to the crisis if it occurs. 'Since then, we have taken an evidence-based approach to understand the impacts of climate change on Lagos and have estimated over $30 billion of socioeconomic losses due to impacts on lives, loss of livelihoods, and infrastructure damage; this impact is more than 10 times the city's budget for the year 2022. 'In response to these climate concerns, we have decided to construct a portfolio of initiatives with the following objectives: build resilient infrastructures and public spaces, ensure resilient communities and protect vulnerable groups, and predict risk and improve crisis response. 'We predict that our portfolio of climate resilience initiatives will require over $8 billion in grants, low-cost public funds, and commercial investments to support our resilience journey. The investments will allow us to complete our adaptation planning, execute feasibility studies on projects requiring them, and initiate the implementation of projects that are ready to be implemented.' \</doc>

Civil Society Groups (CSOs) have solicited funding to aid developing countries like Nigeria which have been devastated by extreme climate events like the current floods being experienced in the country to build resilience, mitigate and adapt to the impacts of such occurrences. According to a press release by Christine Mbithi of 350Africa.org issued on Monday, the deadly flooding in Nigeria underscores the need for adaptation finance for developing nations to build resilience against climate impacts. She quoted Landry Ninteretse, Regional Director of 350Africa.org, to have said: 'We are concerned about the devastation caused by the flooding in Nigeria, which the government has attributed to heavy rains and climate change. We stand in solidarity with our partners and communities affected by this disaster. African nations on the frontlines of the climate crisis are demanding greater urgency applied to measures aimed at mitigation against and adaptation to climate change. COP27 , which starts in a few weeks, must define a concrete operationalisation plan to implement the Global Goal on Adaptation adopted last year in order to meaningfully support countries like Nigeria in their efforts to strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate impacts. 'We expect that developed nations will scale up funding for mitigation and adaptation, as well as prioritise compensation for climate-induced losses and damage suffered by the nations most affected by the climate crisis.' The release also quoted Dr Michael Terungwa, Executive Director, Global Initiative for Food Security and Ecosystem Preservation (GIFSEP), who champions the Coal-Free Nigeria campaign, to have said: 'The heavy rains and resultant flooding currently being experienced in Nigeria is evidence of the extreme climate impacts primarily driven by fossil fuels, making our homes uninhabitable, endangering lives, health and livelihoods. 'This is a signal that it is time for the world to move away from fossil fuels, as rapid and deep emission cuts are needed to avoid catastrophic climate impacts. As our country plans to implement an energy transition plan, we urge the government to prioritise clean renewable energy and not false solutions such as fossil gas that will lead us down a perilous path.' \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt 7 November 2022\\xa0-/African Media Agency (AMA)/-\\xa0Today, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation echoed\\xa0African leaders' calls\\xa0for countries to rapidly scale-up finance for climate adaptation and pledged to invest $1.4 billion to help smallholder farmers address the immediate and long-term impacts of climate change. The announcement was made by Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 ). For many regions, climate change is a food and economic crisis without precedent. More than 2 billion people depend on smallholder farms for food and income, yet less than 2% of global climate finance is devoted to helping these farms adapt to climate change. Food and economic crises will last longer and become more severe as climate threats escalate and further threaten food security by limiting smallholder farmers' yields and resilience. "The effects of climate change have already been devastating, and every moment the world delays action, more people suffer, and the solutions become more complex and costly," said Suzman. "Our commitment will help smallholder farmers adapt today and build resilience for the future. It is essential for this climate summit to produce bold commitments that address immediate and long-term needs. Leaders must listen to the voices of African farmers and governments to understand their priorities and respond with urgency." The foundation's commitment will fund immediate action and long-term initiatives over four years to help smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia build resilience and food security. Funding will focus on spurring African-led innovation to build a pipeline of climate- smart agriculture projects, new applications of digital technologies, climate-smart innovations for smallholder livestock farming, and support for women smallholder farmers to capitalize on their untapped potential. "Women in rural Africa are the backbone of their food systems, but they have never had equal access to the resources they need to reach their full potential or build resilience to looming climate threats," said Melinda French Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. "As the climate crisis accelerates, women's vital role in their economies is too important to overlook. With the right financing and marketing support, women smallholder farmers could earn more in a day than they currently earn in a month, ultimately transforming these regional food systems and unlocking a healthier, more sustainable, and more prosperous future for families and communities across the continent." To improve the livelihoods of rural women in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the foundation is deepening its ongoing partnership with the\\xa0International Fund for Agricultural Development\\xa0(IFAD). The goal is to scale up initiatives that empower women farmers, support innovations at the nexus of gender and climate adaptation, and increase climate finance that gives rural women better access to the climate-smart resources they need to strengthen food systems. To accelerate the development of new adaptation innovations, the foundation is continuing to work with a coalition of partners to double the budget for the CGIAR agriculture research system. The CGIAR\\xa0Excellence in Agronomy\\xa0initiative partners with African research institutes, local businesses, and farmer organizations. Together, they are using big data, analytics, and digital platforms to deliver insights that can boost incomes, food security, and ecosystem health in smallholder farming communities. "The climate crisis is causing enormous harm every day as it jeopardizes entire regions of people and economies," said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. "More funding is necessary to ensure agricultural and technological innovations are widely available to vulnerable communities, helping them to adapt to climate change, save lives and increase economic growth." Additional investments included in the commitment announced today will support: The\\xa0Africa Adaptation Initiative\\xa0(AAI) to quickly build a pipeline of climate-smart agriculture projects across 23 countries in Africa. Funding will provide targeted support for the technical capacity, planning, and project development required to implement programs. The development of new applications of digital technologies to ensure smallholder farmers can anticipate and respond to climate threats. This includes an innovative weather intelligence platform developed through a new partnership between the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) and TomorrowNow, which provides climate-smart agriculture strategies to farmers in East Africa via text messages. African-led innovations to develop climate-smart options for improving livestock health and productivity while also reducing their climate footprint. This will be done in partnership with\\xa0Canada's International Development Research Center\\xa0(IDRC). This funding builds on more than a decade of investments and the foundation's recent announcement during the United Nations General Assembly of $100 million in funding to help alleviate the current food crisis in Africa and South Asia and address its underlying causes. It also builds on funding commitments focused on agriculture adaptation made at previous climate summits: 2021 at COP26:\\xa0Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Pledges $315 million to Support Innovations That Help Smallholder Farmers Adapt to Climate Threats 2017 at One Planet Summit:\\xa0Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Commits $300M (&euro;255M) to Help Farmers in Africa and Asia Cope with Climate Change Distributed by\\xa0African Media Agency (AMA)\\xa0on behalf of The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

About 112 heads of state and over 46,000 delegates including ministries, scientists, civil society organisations, policymakers, oil companies and the private sector as well as other stakeholders gathered at the Red Sea Resort, Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt from November 6-18, 2022, for the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. A major item on the agenda for discussion was financing for loss and damages to support frontline countries. This was against what happened at COP26 in Glasgow where developed countries tactically dodged the issue. At COP27 , developing countries positioned themselves to demand huge financing from the developed countries. This was in line with African Network for Environment and Economic Justice and CSOs' demand as reflected on the signed statement launched at COP27 , endorsed by 87 signatories comprising 80 organisations and seven individuals. World leaders arrived one by one and made statements for the first two days, negotiations and side events started on November 9, 2022. It was estimated that developing countries would require more than $2tn annually by 2030 for loss and damage. The government of African countries urged the developed countries and big polluters to do more as Africa is bearing the brunt. A lot of African countries were not happy because the big countries were not showing enough commitment to solving the climate crisis which is having a greater impact on the global South. On Friday, November 18, 2022, when COP27 was expected to end officially, there was no concrete agreement on the issue of loss and damage, developed countries were more interested in sustaining previous commitments on reducing emissions and upholding the 1.5 degree Celsius. There was a deadlock which made the authorities to push the event into an extra day to enable parties to reach a concrete agreement. Amidst the deadlock, CSOs and environmental justice activists sustained their rallies and protests outside the negotiation arena, insisting that parties must reach a reasonable agreement. The COP27 was then extended by one day to enable parties to reach a conclusion on the issues. By the end of COP27 , parties at least reached some level of agreement. A few takeaways from COP27 reflect some successes and disappointments. On the credit side, parties agreed to a facility on 'loss and damage.' For about 30 years or more, developing countries have been demanding that developed countries take responsibility for loss and damage, being the result of skyrocketing emissions largely from the developed world with the biggest culprits being the United States, China and the European Union. In line with this victory, parties requested the UNFCCC secretariat to conduct two workshops in 2023, with the participation of a diversity of institutions, relevant to addressing loss and damage associated with climate change impacts. They also requested the secretariat to prepare a synthesis report on existing funding arrangements and innovative sources relevant to addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change. They invited international financial institutions to consider, at the 2023 Spring meetings of the World Bank Group and the IMF, the potential for such institutions to contribute to funding arrangements, including new and innovative approaches, responding to loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change. A transitional committee on the operationalisation of the new funding arrangements for responding to loss and damage and the associated fund was set and given with clear terms of reference containing mandates, composition and modalities of work. On the debit side, over 600 fossil fuel lobbyists were granted access to the COP27 climate talks which was 25 per cent more than their participation at COP26. This did not go down well with climate justice activists who insisted that the UN needed to kick big polluters out if it was serious about delivering climate action. The big one was that there was a refusal to accept that fossil fuels are driving the climate crisis, and must be phased out. In the end, the 1.5 degree Celsius temperature target managed to remain without a plan on how to re-engineer efforts at the country level to get there. COP27 ended with gains and disappointments as it was not entirely 'lost and damaged.' Going forward, we expect more pressure from the civil society for a phase-out of fossil fuels as attention shifts to Dubai, United Arab Emirates for COP28, where over 80,000 delegates are expected to participate.

As world leaders gather in Egypt to once again seek solutions to climate change challenges, EDIDIONG IKPOTO writes on the imperativeness of addressing the delivery of the $100bn climate fund promised to developing economies by developed countries in one the previous conferences On Sunday, November 6, 2022, world leaders, for the 27th time, gathered in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to proffer solutions to climate change challenges. While conversations surrounding climate change in 2022 have been somewhat pushed to the backstage due to more pressing global concerns such as the Russia-Ukraine war and economic downturn, this year's edition of the climate event still holds a great deal of significance, particularly in the light of recent climate-related events around the world. This year, the worst drought in 500 years was experienced in Europe. In the US, it was the worst in a thousand years, while China recorded its worst in history. Elsewhere, a third of Pakistan is under water, while Nigeria recorded its worst flood in decades. In the light of these stark realities, the cascading risks are very clear, according to the United Kingdom's representative at the Cop 27 , Alok Sharma. So, this year's conference is expected to be about concrete actions as the pressure on migration due to climate crisis becomes almost unimaginable. Indeed, a cursory examination of recent climate-related global tragedies would indicate that humanity is still a far cry from achieving its goal of 1.5 degree temperature, despite this annual event geared towards ensuring this target. But what exactly is the source of this paradox? Why has this target remained elusive despite numerous deliberations on the need to embrace renewable energy and phase out carbon emissions by 2050? Thirteen years ago, at a United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen, Denmark, some wealthy nations made a significant pledge. Their promise was to channel $100bn a year to developing nations, by 2020, to help them adapt to climate change and mitigate further rises in temperature. However, 13 years down the line, this promise has never been fulfilled. According to data sourced from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an intergovernmental body made up mostly of rich countries, wealthy nations contributed $80bn in climate finance to developing countries in 2019. This was the highest contribution to climate finance ever since the pledge was made. The data also indicated that in 2013, about $53bn contribution was made. This represented a 47 per cent shortfall from the overall target. In 2014, $62bn was realised, and this once again missed the mark. The 2015 witnessed the worst default rate, as wealthy nations contributed only about $45bn to climate finance, missing the mark by more than 50 per cent. The OECD said most of the funds came from public grants or loans, transferred either from one country to another directly, or through funds from multilateral development banks (MDBs). A fraction is said to come from private finance that the public funds are said to have mobilised, such as loan guarantees and loans given alongside public funds. But notwithstanding the fact that the OECD's figures are a far cry from expectations, some analysts have faulted the figures, describing them as inflated. In a 2020 report, the international-aid charity organization, Oxfam, estimated public climate financing at only $19bn\- $22.5bn in 2017\- 18, which is one-third of the OECD's estimate. Oxfam's argument was based on the fact that, besides grants, only the benefit accrued from lending at below-market rates should be counted, not the full value of loans. Indeed, quite a number of low- and middle-income countries have sided with Oxfam. In 2015, India's ministry of finance contested the OECD's estimate of $62bn of climate finance in 2014. According to them, the figure realised was only $1bn. Antigua and Barbuda's climate-change ambassador and a former lead climate negotiator for a group of low-lying coastal and island nations, Diann Black-Layne,\\xa0 called the Alliance of Small Island States and accused wealthy nations of deliberately inflating their climate aid. With climate change implicated in many natural disasters experienced this year, it goes without saying that the time for deliberation is over, and the big players must step up to the plate to save the planet from imminent disaster. Speaking on the imperativeness of urgent action, the United Nations Secretary-General, Ant\'f3nio Guterres, on Monday, said that the global climate crisis had degenerated to alarming levels and now required urgent response to save humanity from imminent doom. Guterres, who was addressing the conference during his opening speech on Monday, said that the world was now on "a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator." "The clock is ticking. We are in the fight of our lives. And we are losing," Guterres said as he addressed world leaders at the 2022 United Nations Climate Conference ( COP27 ). The UN Chief, who warned that emissions were at an all-time high and rising, said the world could not afford any more delays. He said the collective commitments of G20 governments were coming far too little and far too late, and that the actions of the wealthiest developed and emerging economies simply didn't add up. He said, "Taken together, current pledges and policies are shutting the door on our chance to limit global temperature rise to two degrees Celsius, let alone meet the 1.5-degree goal. "We are in a life-or-death struggle for our own safety today and our survival tomorrow. There is no time for pointing fingers  or twiddling thumbs. It is time for a game-changing, quantum level compromise between developed and emerging economies." According to him, every government, every business, every investor or institution must step up the concrete climate actions for net zero, as failure to act on loss and damage would lead to more loss of trust and more climate damage. On finance, he noted that the world needed clarity from developed countries on where they were this year on the delivery of their $100bn a year promise to support climate action in developing countries. "We need to see evidence of how they will double adaptation finance to at least $40 billion dollars in 2025, as agreed in Glasgow. Funding for adaptation and resilience must represent at least half of all climate finance. And the Multilateral Development Banks \- including the World Bank  must raise their game," Guterres added. COP27 President, Sameh Shoukry, while addressing the gathering, enjoined delegates to double down on the implementation of the promises already made. Shoukry added the $100bn promised for adaptation by developed countries to developing countries should be delivered, just as finance must be at the front burner of the conference. "The negotiations [during the next two weeks] will hopefully be fruitful. I urge all of you to listen carefully and commit to implementation and to turn political commitments into agreements and understandings and texts and resolutions that we can all implement," he said. Warning that "zero-sum games will have no winners," Shoukry noted that the outcome of the conference would affect the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the world suffering the impact of climate change. In the same vein, the President of the African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina, while speaking on the sidelines of the Africa Investment Forum earlier this week, had said that it was time for the world to "walk the talk." Adesina added that the idea of achieving global climate expectations would continue to remain a mirage unless the richer nations make tangible contributions to helping the continent adapt to the devastating effects of climate change. He said, "In Africa, our own challenge is how to adapt to climate change, but the money to do that is really not there. Africa will need between now and 2030, at least $125bn a year just to adapt to climate change. But how much does Africa get? Africa gets about $13bn. "At the African Development Bank, we committed that we are going to put in 30 per cent of our financing to climate. Today we are at 41 per cent of our financing. "My message going into COP 27 is, we don't need megawatts of talk, megawatts of talk that lead to zero financing, that's not what I am talking about. We need to have a sense of urgency and realise that Africa is suffering, realise that Africa's growth is being stunted by what Africa did not cause. So, what are my expectations as we go to COP? Walk the talk." As Alok Sharma, the UK's representative at the COP 27 succinctly put it, "We have reached a point where finance makes or breaks the programme of work that we have ahead of us." Sharma, who said some progress had been made on the $100 billion climate finance, agreed that more must be done by governments and by the multilateral development banks. \\xa0Quote: In Africa, our own challenge is how to adapt to climate change, but the money to do that is really not there.

Issues on Climate Change and how they affect humankind in different parts of the world and how to mitigate them would be the major preoccupation of world leaders who have converged on the ancient city. The United Nations Conference of Parties 27 ( COP27 ) meeting continues today in Sharma El-Sheikh, Egypt. It began yesterday and will end on November 18. President Muhammadu Buhari will be represented at the meeting by the Minister of Environment, Mohammed Abdullahi. There, he will deliver Nigeria's National Statement at plenary and attend bilateral and side meetings on Nigeria's Energy Transition Plan, among other engagements. Probably, part of his presentations would be the country's experience in this year's flooding that has killed many people and destroyed property worth billions of Naira. Yesterday, a civil society organization, the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), urged African countries to focus on finance adaption for the continent ahead of the official opening of the Conference of Parties 27 ( COP27 ). Mwenda also emphasised the need for the Africa Group of Negotiators to advance the African agenda, which includes the continued demand by the continent for the G20 countries to deliver on the US$ 100 billion a year pledge that has yet to be honoured. Why was the Conference of Parties established? At the 21st Conference of the Parties in Paris in 2015, parties to the UNFCCC reached a landmark agreement to combat climate change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable low-carbon future. The Paris Agreement is built upon the Convention and brings all nations into a common cause to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects, with enhanced support to assist developing countries to do so. As such, it charts a new course in the global climate effort. Majorly, the Paris Agreement's central aim was to 'strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.' On Earth Day, 22 April 2016, 175 world leaders signed the Paris Agreement at United Nations Headquarters in New York. This was by far the largest number of countries ever to sign an international agreement on a single day. There are now 191 countries that have ratified the Paris Agreement. Read Also: What is COP27 and why is it important? In continuation of its efforts to tackle this menace, world leaders have continued to strive for a better environment. For instance, last year, world leaders converged on Glasgow, the United Kingdom for the COP26 where countries made bold collective commitments to curb methane emissions, to halt and reverse forest loss, align the finance sector with net zero by 2050, ditch the internal combustion engine, accelerate the phase-out of coal, and end international financing for fossil fuel. The COP26 climate summit in Glasgow made some significant progress in a number of areas, which though experts say 'were not enough; as the world still remains off-track to beat back the climate crisis.' In recognition of the urgency of the challenge, ministers from all over the world agreed that countries should come back this year to submit stronger 2030 emissions reduction targets with the aim of closing the gap to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F). Ministers also agreed that developed countries should urgently deliver more resources to help climate-vulnerable countries adapt to the dangerous and costly consequences of climate change that they are feeling already-from dwindling crop yields to devastating storms. According to environmental experts, despite significant headway on several fronts, national climate and financing commitments still fell far short of what is needed to come to grips with the climate challenge. To build on the successes of COP26, world leaders are in Egypt for the 27th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties. The leaders would appraise the successes of the Glasgow meeting and, if need be, 'put promises into practice now to achieve a zero-carbon future for all.' This year's conference 'will bring together leaders in government, civil society, industry, and finance from around the world to raise ambition and accelerate action to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.' Expectations at the COP27 This year's conference comes at a critical moment in the fight against climate change. It is expected that the world's most influential leaders would understand the plight of developing countries and approach issues in a bid to save them from ravaging natural disasters. They should, as a matter of urgency commit to and take steps to develop the next generation of innovative clean energy and climate solutions; centre the development needs of the Global South and support those on the front lines of climate change; move from ambition to action, accountability, and implementation and reduce carbon emissions and methane emissions simultaneously. What are its aims? The overall objective of COP27 is to halve global greenhouse emissions by 2030 and reach 'net zero' by 2050 to keep warming below 1.5\'b0C as recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). COP26 in Scotland's port city of Glasgow saw a flurry of pledges that ultimately still left the world on track to hit 2.4\'b0C (4.3\'b0F), according to the Climate Action Tracker. 'Government officials at this year's meeting will tackle some of the weightiest issues currently keeping the world on track to disastrous heating. 'Developing countries experiencing the worst effects of climate change will aim to obtain financial help from industrialised nations responsible for the biggest share of emissions, which have yet to deliver on promises of regular finance for both adaptation and mitigation efforts. Egyptian Foreign Minister tasks participants Egyptian Foreign Minister, Sameh Shoukry has been elected as the President of the Conference of Parties ( COP ) 27 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). He urged countries to show faith in multilateralism over the next two weeks as they negotiate to deliver on the goals of the Climate Convention and the Paris Agreement. Shoukry said: 'It comes as no surprise to anyone that the COP is being held this year in a world which is witnessing political turmoil that cast a long shadow on all our nations and has resulted in energy and food crises. 'These challenges should be no reason for delaying our collective effort to fight climate change. 'It is inherent in us all in Sharm El-Sheikh to demonstrate our recognition of the magnitude of the challenges we face and our steadfast resolve to overcome it.' He addressed climate envoys and delegates at what is considered to be one of the largest COPs ever in terms of attendance. The Egyptian minister asserted that the host country made sure that COP27 would provide the optimum setting to align and converge on multiple views, as well as facilitate transparent, inclusive and fruitful discussion, to ensure the most positive outcome achievable. He acknowledged the challenging economic and geopolitical factors but noted that external circumstances should not be allowed to negatively affect the negotiating process. The president added that as a COP hosted in Africa, it must consider the needs of the developing countries and ensure climate justice by availing the appropriate finance and other means of implementation. This, he said, is necessary as African countries are the most affected by climate change. The conference of the parties adopted its agenda, and for the first time since the adoption of the UN climate convention, 'parties agreed to introduce loss and damage funding as an agenda item at the climate conference. Loss and damage refer to the destructive impacts of climate change that cannot be avoided either by mitigation or adaptation.' \</doc>

Download logo President Cyril Ramaphosa has accepted an invitation by the President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, His Excellency Mr Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, to participate in the Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Implementation Summit scheduled from 07-08 November 2022 in the Arab Republic of Egypt. The 2022 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP27 , will be held from 06 to 18 November 2022 at the Sharm El-Sheikh International Conference Centre. With COP27 taking place in Africa, it presents an opportunity to advance African priority issues, namely.  Recognition of Africa's special needs and circumstances;  Raising the ambitions on mitigation, adaptation and support to developing countries.  Advance financing arrangements for loss and damage.  Build on progress made in Glasgow on the importance of Just Transitions.  Advance discussions on the special needs and circumstance of Africa. Climate Summits provide a platform to make announcements of new climate ambition, political direction and momentum for the UNFCCC negotiations, as well as to address broader issues related to climate change mainly to guide climate change negotiators (beyond the mandate and scope of the UNFCCC negotiations). The programme for the participation of Heads of State and Government(HOSG) will include an official opening ceremony, high-level round tables, delivery of national statements and high-level side events organised by World Leaders. During the summit, the Government of Egypt will convene 6 high-level Round Tables on Just Transition; Food Security; Innovative Finance and Climate Development; Investing in Future of Energy; Climate Change and Sustainability of Vulnerable Communities and Water Security. These roundtables will be attended by the HOSG, Heads of observer organisations and specially invited guests. President Ramaphosa will on 07 November 2022 Co-Chair the High Level Roundtable on Just Transition, which will allow discussions on innovative approaches to addressing climate change in the context of Just Transition, inspired by the South African Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP). President Ramaphosa yesterday during the special sitting of the Presidential Climate Change Commission(PCC) unveiled government's Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET-IP) outlining government's comprehensive priority investment and financing interventions required to achieve decarbonisation commitments and ensuring an equitable and just transition. On 08th November 2022, the President will deliver a national statement during the high-level segment of the summit. The Summit further provides a platform for discussing how climate actions can be supportive of broader Just Transitions imperatives, highlighting the need for the COP to agree on a Just Transition Financing Framework under the mitigation work programme as a potential model for supporting energy transition in middle income countries. The high-level segment for Heads of State and Government during the summit signifies the importance for World Leaders to implement and transform key climate related decisions into concrete actions and credible plans, continue raising ambition, building up from previous Conference of the Parties, including the Glasgow COP 26 outcomes. The segment also keeps the high level commitment on climate change issues, with an aim to fight back climate emergency and promoting coordinated action to tackle climate change. South Africa's UNFCCC negotiating positions on climate change, are fully aligned to the African common position, as adopted by the African Union's Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC) and the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN). The President will be supported by the Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Ms Naledi Pandor; Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, Ms Barbara Creecy. President Ramaphosa's Programme at the Summit will be as follows: 07 November 2022 12h15-13h30 Opening Ceremony of the United Nations Climate Change Conference 07 November 2022 13h30-15h30 President Ramaphosa Co-Chairs the High-Level Roundtable on Just Transition 08 November 2022 12h00-12h30 Press Conference by President Cyril Ramaphosa at the Sharm El Sheikh International Conference Centre, Press Conference Room 1-Cairo 08 November 2022 13h00-18h00 President Ramaphosa delivers a National Statement The proceedings of the summit open to media will be live streamed on HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/cop27#events https://unfccc.int/ HYPERLINK cop27 #events and on all PresidencyZA digital platforms.

Daniel Kanu After taking a critical review of all that transpired at the COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, stakeholders and activists, gave a damning verdict that not much was achieved. They submitted that the gathering was more of a jamboree that failed below expectation towards providing solution to the numerous challenges of global warming, climate change financing, climate debt and reparations, particularly for African countries. They agreed that although there was agreement to consider loss and damage cases, it's yet to be operationalised as developed countries remain hypocritical, avoiding genuine commitment towards climate financing and eradication of fossil fuel. During a press conference in Lagos at the weekend, the stakeholders including Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA), Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF) and Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN) submitted that although big polluters dominated the meeting " the agreement to consider loss and damage is a big takeaway and a good place to start the struggle". Speaking at the briefing, Dr Nnimmo of HOMEF Bassey said he was not expecting much from the COP27 conference but that it presents a catalyst space for the Civil Society to share ideas. Nnimmo said developing nations and African countries need concessions on existing debts, benefits on imports of technologies, for clean energy innovations and credits on funding for clean-energy research and infrastructure but that the advanced countries of the North are playing politics, and applying diplomacy to shy away from genuine commitment. Nnimmo said advocates of fossil fuel were only interested in their commercial gain than the health of Africans. Akinbode Oluwafemi( CAPPA boss) said that CSOs and Africa must form a united front on the loss and damage payment, stressing that COP27 in Egypt was carefully planned to ignore the needs of Africa. Oluwafemi said it's sad that Africa is at the receiving end of climate change eventhough they contribute less than 3 percent of global warming. Also, ERA/FoEN Executive Director, Chima Williams, said that the best option to the attitude of the Global North was to call for a strategic litigation option. Williams, a legal practitioner, said that there was the need to put the law to test on COP27 neglect on Africa, stressing that such was necessary to avoid re-colonisation of Africa by the Global North. Williams, advocated for a united collaboration of CSOs to fight the big polluters. In his contribution, Phillip Jakpor, Director of programmes and publicity, CAPPA, said climate action ought to focus on communities unlike what obtains at the moment. In her own presentation, Zikora Ibe of CAPPA, expressed concern on grey areas that was not properly addressed, insisting that unless they become operationalised the conference would be more of a talk shop than a solution platform. She said it was sad that developed nations have refused to fully pay up the 100B Dollar to vulnerable countries, including Africa agreed since 2009. \</doc>

By Henry Uche, Lagos Still worried by the level of human insensitive and reckless actions and inactions towards the environment, a frontline Civil Society Organization, Human & Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA Resource Centre) is calling for climate Justice for Nigeria and Africa at large. In preparation for the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , commonly referred to as COP27 , which will be the 27th United Nations Climate Change conference , to be held from 6 to 18 November 2022, in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, HEDA took the streets of Lagos over the weekend to create awareness on the need for Africa to stand out ( regarding the climate change) in the conference. The roadshow which took place in Maryland, Ikeja and other strategic locations of Lagos saw some concerned young men and women in branded T. shirts and placards and other forms of display designed to draw public attention towards the unfortunate environmental realities which citizens themselves have advertently created. With different inscriptions like: "What's going on here?", "The world is changing "We are killing the ecosystem", "Trees are the lungs of the earth, let the earth breath, plant a tree today", "Climate change is natural", "Climate change is man-made", "The climate is changing because you and I refuse to change", "We pollute the environment", "We block drainages", "We demand climate Justice," etcetera, the environmental justice and sustainability advocate (HEDA) called for caution and restrain in the way and manner people relates with the environment and its inhabitants including plants, animals, water and other creatures. Speaking shortly after, the Executive Secretary of HEDA, Mr Arigbabu Sulaimon, said the world is changing but not in the best interest of mankind- due to human (individuals and corporate organiwations) unfriendly activities towards the environment, urging Nigerians and Africans at large to shun any practice capable of destroying the environment. According to him, what Africa deserves among other salient needs is climate Justice: "Africa is in drought. Animals are dying. People are suffering. Farm produce is shrinking. Most parts of Nigeria including the food basket of Nigeria is overflooded due to the failure of water and dams management system," HEDA's scribe decried the level of Nigerians' reactive response towards ugly incidents which were oftentimes predicted by NiMet and other organisations earlier, saying, "When the alarm is raised over an impending doom, like NiMet did since February on the flood which has destroyed lives, property and farm produce worth billions, we need to be proactive and take frantic actions to prepare for such days like this. "Howbeit, on the side of the government, it's not enough to raise the alarm, we need action, people especially farmers need to be mentally equipped with professional advice, for instance, they (farmers) need to know the kind/ varieties of seeds to plant and how to go about it the farming system for that particular season," By extension, he added that Africa needs money to adapt to climate change and meet up to its obligations in the international community. Howbeit, proper management of available resources like ecological funds and other foreign aids must be prudently utilised and deployed maximally. "We understand that corruption is still eating deep into the fabrics of most African countries, that is why everyone must rise now and do something worth doing to mitigate the effects of climate change. As you may see, we are all affected by the calamity the floods have caused, because we all interdependent on one another for one exchange for the other, like food, and roads network among others. "Olams and other large farmers lost investments worth billions in Nassawara state. Across every state, you see people affected by one act of natural phenomena or the other which has always been there, but the sad thing is that we keep falling victim of their recurrence because of failure to plan by the government across the board. "All hands must be on deck to preserve the environment, especially the government which gives policy direction and controls the financial resources. As friends of the environment, we are not leaving any stone unturned to see that we let people be aware of the dangers of treating the environment indiscreetly. Civil society organisations also should rise now and act in this regard before things get out of control," he charged. \</doc>

- Says Africa risks being a stranded continent Mkpoikana Udoma Port Harcourt - The Health of Mother Earth Foundation has expressed disappointment that the just concluded Conference of the Parties, COP27 in Egypt ended with no clear-cut efforts or call to phase out fossil fuels exploration and exploitation. Dr. Nnimmo Bassey Director of HOMEF, Dr. Nnimmo Bassey, expressed concerns on the time wasted on non-solutions such as the promotion of unproven and risky technologies including geoengineering, saying that COP27 ended without any significant shining light besides the 'loss and damage' proposal. Bassey urged Nigeria and other African nations to realize that the 1.5degrees celsius temperature target set in the Paris Agreement was on track to be exceeded judging from the Emissions Gap Report issued by UNEP, noting that to close that gap, the world will ultimately exit the petroleum era. According to him, now is the time to get off the fossil train rather than risk stranded fossil fuel assets by the coming decade, hence Africa cannot afford to be a stranded continent loaded with stranded fossil assets. The environmentalist further said that 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature increase above pre-industrial levels will be disastrous for Africa as the continent has temperatures above global averages, warning that this reality makes taking climate caption more urgent for Africa. "The campaign for climate debt has been campaigned for by civil societies for years. This demand is in line with historical and current harms being suffered by vulnerable nations and regions due to climate change triggered by actions by industrialised nations. "Rather than recognize and pay the climate debt, the COP had proposed a Green Climate Fund at COP15 and acceded to payments for Loss and Damage at COP27 . Hopes for the recovery of damaged environment were shattered by the usual lack of seriousness in the discussions COP27 did not rise up to even the weak attempts to call it an African COP. "The outcome confirmed that this was just another COP with nothing substantial in terms of reparations for centuries of harms and ongoing ones. COP27 could not be termed African COP because of its mere geographical location, as Africans could not attend due to diverse restrictions while the corridors of COP27 were filled with fossil fuels promoters who attended to block decisions that would rescue the world from the clutches of the industry. "As an organization, we saw the COP as mainly provides space for civil societies to meet, prepare and share ideas on the way forward. Although the COP27 ought to find ways to stop climate change, it has become a carbon trade fair where false solutions including carbon trading and carbon capture and storage are being promoted. " COP27 Nature made in the guise of fighting global warming. "If we must have a livable future, the COP must be bold to act, especially with regard to phasing out fossil fuels. This is not even being discussed! Rather than opening doors to false solutions. COP has transformed itself into a platform for avoidance of climate action. We have come to an inescapable moment when avoidance of real climate action can no longer be accepted. Pay the Climate debt and leave the fossils in the ground." HOMEF further said that the loss and damage agenda should not considered as charity but as reparations for centuries of ecocide and damaging activities. "Nigerian negotiators should see COP28 holding in the United Arab Emirates as a moment to press industrialized nations and polluting entities to accept liability for the climate catastrophe and to make adequate annual payments for it. This should be addressed as a climate debt and in clear terms." SweetCrude Reports 2022. \</doc>

According to information gleaned from PreventionWeb, Nigeria's climate has been changing. These changes, it said, manifest in an increase in temperature; variable rainfall; rise in sea level and flooding; drought and desertification; land degradation; more frequent extreme weather events; affected freshwater resources and loss of biodiversity. The durations and intensities of rainfall have increased, producing dangerous flooding in many areas of Nigeria. Economic sectors such as agriculture, fishery and forestry are more predisposed to the adverse effects of climate change. The federal ministry of environment says at the UN climate change conference, Nigeria's priorities will be on seeking climate finance and partnerships that will focus on emission reduction. But what would be Nigeria's focus at COP27 ? Reports quoted the Minister of Mohammed Abdullahi, as having said that the Federal Government will 'walk the talk at COP27 .' The minister further said that at the UN climate change conference, Nigeria's priorities will be on seeking climate finance and partnerships that will focus on emission reduction. He said: 'The country's COP27 priorities will focus on exploring options for climate finance and building partnerships that will drive the country's emissions reduction ambitions, adaptation, and climate change mitigation. 'The focus will be on a sustainable funding mechanism that drives nature-based solutions such as land restoration, reforestation, combating desertification, climate smart-agricultural practices, as well as adaptation strategies. Over 40,000 participants expected in Egypt for COP27 'Nigeria will also seek collaboration and support on sustainable waste management, renewable and clean energy provision, and finance for loss and damage. Nigeria will push for developed countries to fulfil financial pledges to aid in tackling the climate crisis. 'The expected outcomes of Nigeria's participation will include increased partnership building that helps Nigeria achieve its emission reduction targets, address adaptation and mitigation, establish sustainable financing for climate actions, resilience building, poverty eradication, energy transition and sustainable development.' Abdullahi also added that Nigeria will collaborate with other African countries to drive action on issues affecting the continent. According to the report, he said Nigeria will not take a position of 'know it all but will align with the West Africa region's identification of the thematic issues faced by the continent and the group's interim position on each which includes doubling adaptation finance by 2025. He was said to have also listed other focus areas as 'clarification on the support arrangements to address loss and damage; closing the climate financing gap; scaling up Africa's mitigation ambition and implementation; strengthening the linkage between technology and financial mechanisms; the global stocktake on progress on the Paris Agreement; transparency; gender and climate change; agriculture; Article 6 and carbon pricing and Africa's unique needs and particular circumstances.' 'Nigeria will also seek collaboration and support on sustainable waste management, renewable and clean energy provision, and finance for loss and damage. Nigeria will push for developed countries to fulfil financial pledges to aid in tackling the climate crisis. 'The expected outcomes of Nigeria's participation will include increased partnership building that helps Nigeria achieve its emission reduction targets, address adaptation and mitigation, establish sustainable financing for climate actions, resilience building, poverty eradication, energy transition and sustainable development,' he was quoted as saying. \</doc>

While echoing the demands of African leaders for countries to swiftly scale-up investment for climate adaptation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) has offered to invest $1.4 billion to assist smallholder farmers face the immediate and long-term implications of climate change. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference , Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman made the news ( COP27 ). More than two billion people depend on smallholder farms for food and income, but less than 2% of global climate money is allocated to helping these farms adapt to climate change, according to Suzman, who added that this is a food and economic catastrophe without precedent for many countries. He observed that as climate threats intensify and further endanger food security by lowering smallholder farmers' yields and resilience, food and economic crises will last longer and become more severe. He stated: "The effects of climate change have already been devastating, and every moment the world delays action, more people suffer, and the solutions become more complex and costly. Our commitment will help smallholder farmers adapt today and build resilience for the future. It is essential for this climate summit to produce bold commitments that address immediate and long-term needs. Leaders must listen to the voices of African farmers and governments to understand their priorities and respond with urgency. "The foundation's commitment will fund immediate action and long-term initiatives over four years to help smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia build resilience and food security. Funding will focus on spurring African-led innovation to build a pipeline of climate-smart agriculture projects, new applications of digital technologies, climate-smart innovations for smallholder livestock farming, and support for women smallholder farmers to capitalize on their untapped potential." Melinda French Gates, Co-Chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, The backbone of the food systems in rural Africa is women, but they have never had equal access to the resources required to realize their full potential or increase their resilience to looming climate threats. Women's crucial contribution to their economies is too significant to be ignored as the climate crisis worsens. Women smallholder farmers could make more money in a day than they do now in a month with the right financing and marketing assistance, ultimately changing these local food systems and opening the door to a healthier, more sustainable, and more prosperous future for families and communities across the continent. The foundation is intensifying its continuing relationship with the International Fund for Agricultural Development to better the livelihoods of rural women in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (IFAD). The objective is to scale up programs that promote innovations at the intersection of gender and climate adaptation, support initiatives that empower women farmers, and improve climate finance so that rural women have better access to the climate-smart tools they need to strengthen food systems. \</doc>

From Fred Itua, Abuja Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,\~ yesterday, in Cairo, Egypt, echoed African leaders' calls for countries to rapidly scale-up finance for climate adaptation and pledged to invest $1.4 billion to help smallholder farmers address the immediate and long-term impacts of climate change. The announcement was made by Gates Foundation boss, Mark Suzman at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ). The Foundation said for many regions, climate change is a food and economic crisis without precedent. "More than two billion people depend on smallholder farms for food and income, yet less than 2% of global climate finance is devoted to helping these farms adapt to climate change. Food and economic crises will last longer and become more severe as climate threats escalate and further threaten food security by limiting smallholder farmers' yields and resilience," a statement released by the Foundation and made available to newsmen read. "The effects of climate change have already been devastating, and every moment the world delays action, more people suffer, and the solutions become more complex and costly," said Suzman. "Our commitment will help smallholder farmers adapt today and build resilience for the future.

"As the climate crisis accelerates, women's vital role in their economies is too important to overlook. With the right financing and marketing support, women smallholder farmers could earn more in a day than they currently earn in a month, ultimately transforming these regional food systems and unlocking a healthier, more sustainable, and more prosperous future for families and communities across the continent," Gates noted. "The climate crisis is causing enormous harm every day as it jeopardizes entire regions of people and economies," said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. "More funding is necessary to ensure agricultural and technological innovations are widely available to vulnerable communities, helping them to adapt to climate change, save lives and increase economic growth," she said. \</doc>

Nigeria will focus on a sustainable funding mechanism that will drive nature-based solutions to mitigate the impact of climate change at the forthcoming Conference of Parties 27 in Egypt, the Federal Government has said. It said the funding mechanism would focus on solutions such as land restoration, reforestation, combating desertification, climate smart-agricultural practices as well as adaptation strategies. The Minister of Environment, Mohammed Abdullahi, who disclosed this at a press briefing on Nigeria&rsquo;s preparations for COP27 , said the country would also seek collaboration and support on sustainable waste management, renewable and clean energy provision, as well as finance for loss and damage. "Nigeria will push for developed countries to fulfill financial pledges to support Africa in tackling the climate crisis," he stated. Abdullahi said the expected outcomes of Nigeria&rsquo;s participation would include increased partnership to help Nigeria achieve its emission reduction targets, address adaptation and mitigation, and establish sustainable financing for climate actions, among others. He said Nigeria would not take a position of &lsquo;know it all&rsquo;, but would align with the West Africa region&rsquo;s identification of the thematic issues faced by the continent. Related News IBM named technology partner for COP27 COP27 : Nigeria, other African nations insist on hydrocarbon exploitation The minister stated that the country would also align with the group&rsquo;s interim position on doubling adaptation finance by 2025; clarification on the support arrangements to address loss and damage; and closing the climate financing gap. Others include scaling up Africa&rsquo;s mitigation ambition and implementation; strengthening the linkage between technology and financial mechanisms; the global stock-take on progress on the Paris Agreement; transparency; gender and climate change; and agriculture. Abdullahi said there was no doubt that Nigeria&rsquo;s participation at COP27 in Egypt would demonstrate the country&rsquo;s continued commitment to addressing the challenges of climate change at both national and sub-national levels.

No fewer than 40,000 delegates from around the world are to participate in the 2022 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), otherwise known as COP27 . COP27 The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the convention is scheduled to hold at the North African City of Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, between Nov. 6 and 18. 'Diverse representation will include around 100 heads of states and governments, and tens of thousands of delegates, civil society, media and all other relevant stakeholders,' said the media team in a copy of the statement obtained by NAN. The delegate will engage with climate and other overlapping global challenges at various levels such as the Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Implementation Summit (SHICC), thematic days, flagship initiatives and Green Zone activities. Speaking ahead of the conference, Amb. Wael Aboulmagd, Special Representative to the COP27 President, said: 'The Egyptian Presidency team has worked tirelessly to create an enabling environment that is conducive to successful negotiations. Climate change, Africa's conundrums and COP27 'As the hosts of the COP, we are keen on bringing representatives of nations and stakeholders from across the world and to provide the required momentum to address the required actions for urgent and at-scale implementation of climate commitments and pledges.' Details by the communication team suggest that The Sharm El-Sheikh International Convention Centre would form the overall Blue Zone for COP27 . The Blue Zone is where all negotiations amongst delegates are set to take place as well as a long list of dynamic events that will be organised by Governments and accredited observers, including youth advocates and scientists. A 22,500 square metre Green Zone is, however, where the business community, youth, civil society, academia and artists from all over the world will have additional space to be present and participate. The arrangement, the organisers said, was aimed to promote inclusive and dynamic dialogue and engagement among climate actors via events, exhibitions, workshops, cultural performances and talks. Meanwhile, the Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Implementation Summit has been slated to take place from Nov. 7 to 8, bringing together all participating heads of state and government. The media team said several roundtables would be held to focus on six key topics: Just Transitions, Food Security, Innovative Finance for Climate and Development, Investing in the Future of Energy, Water Security, and Climate Change and The Sustainability of Vulnerable Communities. This, it said, was in addition to the thematic days that would centre on panel pledging opportunities, discussions and roundtables, among other side events. \</doc>

Nigeria, Dec. 7 -- Women are disproportionately impacted by climate change due to gender inequalities and gender roles and responsibilities. They are 14 times more likely than men to die in a climate catastrophe and make up 80% of people displaced due to climate change. The international community has made strides in recognising that climate action must consider gender equality. But this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) was another missed opportunity to advance meaningful gender participation. Despite bearing the brunt of climate change effects, women comprised less than 34% of the COP27 negotiating teams. Of the 110 heads of state attending, only eight were women. At COP26 in 2021, women comprised 38% of delegates (the highest yet) but accounted for only 24% of the speaking time. While a Gender Action Plan was discussed at COP27 , the final text was watered down, lacked proper resourcing and continued to leave women and girls on the margins. Climate change exacerbates vulnerabilities and exposes underlying discrimination. Gender inequality makes women and lesbians, gay people, bisexual people and transgender people more vulnerable to climate change impacts. Gender inequality causes women to be poorer, have less education and face more health risks than men. Labour markets are heavily gender-segregated, and women are employed primarily in low-paying and insecure occupations. They carry a disproportionate unpaid work burden and rely more on natural resources and climate-sensitive sectors for their livelihoods than men. In Sub-Saharan Africa, women are responsible for 80% of food production, and more than 60% of all employed women work in agriculture. Despite their essential roles, women are less likely to own land or other productive assets. They typically access land through male relatives as labourers. Giving women land rights would significantly reduce the risk of displacement and increase crop productivity. And landowners are more likely to invest in improvement and have access to credit. Approximately 250 million Africans live under extreme water stress. Women are most affected because water access is core to daily household labour, including cooking, washing and caring for the ill, children and elderly. Globally, women and girls spend almost 200 million hours collecting water each day. In water-scarce situations, they must travel further, which restricts their access to education, livelihoods and safety. Women and girls have been exposed to sexual violence while walking long distances to access water, firewood or other fuels. Because they suffer most from climate change, women are often at the forefront of developing effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. Across Africa, they have emerged as leaders in coming up with solutions such as drought-resistant seeds, better soil management or guiding reforestation and restoration efforts. Women still have less autonomy over their decision making, including migration choices. Gender norms and family responsibilities play a role, and women also have less access to resources and information than men to inform these decisions. In family situations, men are most likely to migrate to earn an income, leaving women to carry the household burden. This involuntary immobility puts women at risk of climate change impacts because they are trapped while caring for households and children. Yet, migration and urbanisation can be effective adaptation measures that empower women. They can increase autonomy, mastery, remittances and social standing and disrupt gender norms. While women have comprised a steady share of migrants for decades, the number moving independently for work, education or to meet their families' needs has grown significantly. The number of female international migrants in Africa increased from 6.2 million in 1990 to 10.5 million in 2020. Despite all of this, women remain underrepresented in or excluded from decision-making processes on migration and climate change responses. There is growing recognition that gender equality is necessary for effective climate action, and most multilateral climate funds now have gender plans. Climate finance that targets gender inequalities is also growing, but it isn't enough. Gender-responsive climate finance in Africa has increased from an average of US$80 million in 2010 to US$1.6 billion in 2019. Despite this, over three-quarters of total climate development finance in Africa throughout the decade failed to consider gender. Without gender equality in policies, interventions and financing, climate mitigation and adaptation will be compromised. Women and men experience the outcomes of climate change differently. Gender-neutral approaches will miss the mark and fail to benefit from women's valuable contributions. While the inclusion of mobility and gender considerations in climate change policy has progressed well, Africa needs to step up on gender equality. More must be done to increase gendered data, involve women in decision making and project design, and improve access to gendered finance that includes mobility considerations.

Daniel Kanu Against the backdrop of revelations at the ongoing climate change meeting in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, Climate Justice groups at the event have observed that justifiable gains were not made in checkmating industry distraction and delay of the climate negotiations. This is as they rate COP27 low. While Corporate Accountability insists that industry lobbyists dominated the list of sponsors of the negotiations, Friends of the Earth International, in a press briefing on November 18, said the most important demand of developing countries on the frontlines of the climate crisis such as loss and damage was still in limbo. Meena Raman of Friends of the Earth Malaysia said that developed countries led by the United States still failed to take responsibility for their historical role in the global climate crisis which has caused devastations in Africa and other Global South countries. She noted that it was hypocrisy for instance, for Germany to return to coal projects that it had planned to phase out after Russia cut off gas to Europe in the wake of the sanctions imposed on her by the European Union (EU), just like the US dilly dally on the Loss and Damage Finance. On the new dimensions of the industry lobby at the COP27 , an analysis by Corporate Accountability and Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO),18 out of 20 of the sponsors of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) directly support or partner with the fossil fuel industry. The talks that have already been mired by revelations of corporate interference and influence, such as the COP Presidency retaining a notable PR firm for Big Oil and the presence of more than 636 fossil fuel lobbyists. "As if it weren't bad enough that lobbyists for corporations like Shell, BP, and Chevron were walking the halls of COP27 . Now the revelation that the entire conference is being bankrolled by corporations with close industry ties? After 30 years of allowing polluters to upend progress, governments need to finally put an end to the madness and kick big polluters out," said Pascoe Sabido, a researcher and campaigner for CEO. "Corporations shouldn't sponsor climate talks, let alone support the deadly agenda of those with ties to the very industry responsible for the climate crisis. Making the primary global forum for averting climate catastrophe a greenwashing platform for polluters undermines the UNFCCC and all its aspirations. This isn't a trade show, it's our near final chance to save millions of lives and ensure a livable planet for all," said Rachel Rose Jackson, director of climate research and policy at Corporate Accountability. "PR by a firm that shills for the fossil fuel industry? More fossil fuel lobbyists than the combined delegations of 15 African countries combined? A who's who of polluters, fossil fuel financiers, and industry enablers bankrolling the COP? To a malaria conference, you don't invite the mosquitos," said Philip Jakpor, Director of Programs, Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa. \</doc>

The Conference of the Parties () of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held at Sharm el Sheikh in Egypt from November 2 - 19 but had to be extended for a few days because of deadlock and acrimony in moving forward in the progress on COP 26 held in Glasgow Scotland last year and to chart the way forward to reversing the heating of the global environment as a result of carbon and methane emissions caused primarily by human activities otherwise known as anthropogenic climate change. The issue of the rise in global temperature first came to the fore when Gro Harlem Brundtland, former prime minister of Norway chaired the World Commission on Environment and Development and issued its report in 1987 known popularly as (OUR COMMON FUTURE) and suggested that if the world was to survive, it must embrace sustainable development paradigm by which it was pointed out that the old system of carbon fuelled industrialisation must be mitigated by among other things, preservation of the world's forest, developing appropriate technologies to drastically reduce carbon emissions, and taking measures to preserve natural diversity of plants and animals and stopping pollution of the oceans which were carbon sinks but were rapidly reaching a level of saturation. Since the Rio de Janeiro conference known as the EARTH'S SUMMIT of June 1992, there have been several conferences on the same issue in 1995, 1997, 2003, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2021, to mention the most notable ones before the one in Paris leading to virtually all countries in the world signing the Paris Protocol of 2015 after COP 21. The Paris Protocol signed by 196 countries including our country Nigeria, committed to a binding agreement to reverse emissions of greenhouse gases to manageable levels and ensure that global temperature does not exceed more than1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial level which was an agreement already enshrined in the Kyoto protocol of 1997 which entered into force in 2005 because of the complex nature of signing on to it by parties to the protocol. It committed signatories to substantial and radical reduction of carbon dioxide, methane, Nitrous oxide, Hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur-hexafluoride. In simple terms, the Kyoto protocol committed industrialised countries and economies in transition to limit and reduce greenhouse gasses emissions in accordance with agreed individual targets. The reduction of these greenhouses gases was left in in the hands of individual countries without any form of international enforcement. It was also said that the cost of the Kyoto protocol outweighed its advantages. These issues were then supposedly tackled in the Paris agreement. But the big industrial nations of the European Union, the United States, China and countries like Australia and India were still reluctant to make wholehearted commitment to measures necessary to enhance the global environment and abate climate change. The Glasgow COP26 reaffirmed the commitment of the Paris protocol and most countries committed themselves to adopting clean, presumably, green energy latest by year 2050. To most climate activists, this did not demonstrate that the leaders of the world know the enormity and seriousness of the problem. Reactionary forces in the West particularly in the United States continued to challenge the scientificity of climate change and to pin climate change on self-correcting cycles. When President Donald J. Trump became president of the United States in 2016, he withdrew from the Paris Accord arguing that the cost to the United States was unfair. With his action, the action to save the global environment became hostage to internal politics in the most polluting countries like the USA, China, Australia, India, the European Union and Brazil. Many of the developing countries began to argue that since they did not contribute to the emissions of greenhouse gases due to industrialisation, they should be spared the cost of reversing the damage and began to suggest a 'polluter pays principle' which has now metamorphosed into 'loss and damage' principle during the COP27 discussion in Egypt. In the final document of COP 27 , a Loss and Damage Fund is to be set up to assist countries that are threatened by climate change. The problem is how much will the rich world contribute to this fund and the mechanism of appropriation is yet to be worked out. What contributions will be made by non-governmental bodies such as industrial corporations will be critical to how the world moves on from now. The problem of how rapidly green energy to replace the dirty hydrocarbons will be developed is still left to industrial bodies. In the meantime, countries are still going to continue to burn hydrocarbons to generate much needed energy in the industries and homes of the temperate climatic environment of the world to avoid people freezing in winter. Those countries in the warmer part of the world and even those who need air conditioning in summer depending on hydrofluorocarbons in their freezers and air conditioning system will continue with the old practice until replacements are found for these environmental pollutants. In the meantime, the damage continues and according to the Secretary General of the United Nations, we may be reaching a tipping point of climatic irredeemability. The Putin war on Ukraine has also slowed down global efforts to save the world's climate because well laid down plans of energy use have now been disrupted by sanctions on Russian gas and oil and the war has damaged nuclear power stations in Ukraine which provided cleaner energy than hydrocarbons. The COP 27 It was also agreed to reduce carbon emissions and Methane emissions simultaneously. If the major countries of the world particularly the USA, China, India, Japan and the European Union key into the action to reverse the abuse of the environment and change their industrial processes, the world may still reach its goal of reducing global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius but certainly not more than 2 degrees Celsius. The good thing is that the unreasonably high temperatures all over the world, the bush fires in the Americas particularly north and South America including 'the lungs of the earth 'in the Amazon basin, the flooding all over the world, hurricanes, tsunamis, tornadoes and heavy and early precipitation of snow are more than enough to convince doubters that global warming and climate change is real. The problem really is how to harmonise development and living standards of people with sustainable climate health. If the world cannot answer this question then the world is doomed. Serious abatement measures will not be taken until these problems pose existential problems to mankind and one hopes it may not be too late by them. The problem is really the eternal question of absence of a 'world government 'since the United Nations has been reduced to a mere talking shop. For us in Nigeria and as a party to the UNFCCC, we have to take local actions about stopping of felling of what is left of our tropical forests. We have to build more hydroelectric power stations and possibly nuclear power stations and move away from gas and diesel and coal fired turbines. We must discourage firewood burning to cook our meals and rely more on gas. It should be clear to everybody that the excitement over the new petroleum discovery in Bauchi is not worth celebration because the world is moving away from hydrocarbons and if we don't join the world in saving the environment, we may be forced to do so. We must impose the attachment of catalytic converters to all vehicles on our roads and retire all gas belching vehicles polluting our environment. We may have to reduce the heads of cattle we have to reduce their emissions of methane into the air. Our government has its task cut out for it if it must remain a responsible member of the global community aware of the common existential threat to humanity. \</doc>

The UN climate change conference, COP27 , takes place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt from November 6-18. COP stands for Conference of the Parties, and the summit is open to countries that signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) - a treaty that came into force in 1994. The conference is usually attended by world leaders, ministers, negotiators, representatives from civil society, business, international organisations, and the media. The COP is hosted by different countries annually and the first meeting - 'COP1' - took place in Berlin, Germany in 1995. Each of these meetings produce set of decisions which are given different names. Last year (COP26), it was called the Glasgow Climate Pact. The most popular COP was the third (COP3), in 1997. It established the Kyoto Protocol: a set of commitments to achieve the decarbonisation of society and limit the damage from climate change. Another particularly important COP was COP21, held in Paris in 2015. This year's COP has been tagged as the 'African COP' because it will involve concrete actions and commitments for the development of African continent and it will also focus on how African countries are facing more damage from climate change. Each day of the COP will deal with different workshops, side events, discussions, plenary meetings on finance, energy, adaptation, loss and damage, others - which serve as focus for events and discussions. Importantly, Egypt's goals for this year's COP are mitigation, adaptation, finance, and collaboration COP27 comes at a critical moment in the fight against climate change. It provides the critical opportunity for business and government leaders to double down on their climate goals, forge new collaborations, and achieve innovative solutions together. This year, COP27 Discussions on chance of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees, global emissions must halve by 2030 and reach 'net-zero' by 2050, will top the agenda This year's COP is seen as the one that will bring concrete actions and commitments on emission reductions and also on the financing of losses and damages resulting from climate change to the global south. In order to deliver on the goals, developed countries are usually tasked to make good on their promise to mobilise at least $100 billion in climate finance per year by 2020, and the conference would provide an opportunity to interrogate how this will be done. At the last COP, the most significant commitment was that made by all nations to come back with enhanced emission-cutting pledges but COP27 takes place as the world is watching Ukraine. One of the side effects of the Russian invasion is an energy crisis. Russia's war in Ukraine has stifled progress, as many countries that promised climate action have been unable to take any steps. So, the agenda at COP27 will principally be focused on climate change and solutions, scene-setting for which has been provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports over the last year. All eyes are on this year's COP, will it be a springboard to action or series of statements of intent? Time will tell. Alao is a 2022 Fellow, \</doc>

Members of the Egyptian COP27 Presidency Team and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have held an all-day consultation ahead of the convening. Facilitated by the Centre for Multilateral Negotiations (CEMUNE), the workshop discussed how COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh will engage with, and advance, the many climate and economic challenges that are currently underway. A statement from Egypt's COP27 Presidency stated that along with the UNFCCC and COP27 Presidency members, also present to offer their expertise were 14 speakers including COP20 President Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, COP26 Lead Negotiator Archie Young, Tomasz Chruszczow (former High-Level Climate Champion for COP24), Dr Hakima El Haite (former High-Level Climate Champion for COP22), and Kaveh Guilanpour (Former Co-lead Negotiator on Climate Change for the EU). Group sessions discussed how best to ensure that global political leadership can further guide the process and identified the risk of existing and evolving challenges impacting on COP27 , more so than at previous editions. With the current situation in Ukraine, high energy prices, and predicted economic recession, attendees acknowledged possible factors that could affect the long- and near-term ambitions that the world agreed upon under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. Eliminating roadblocks to productive dialogue and eventual agreement were central points discussed. The COP27 Presidency Team and other attendees worked to put in place the right framework to facilitate global consensus focused on the implementation of existing commitments, and how best to enhance that ambition. COP President Designate H.E. Sameh Shoukry said, 'The role of the COP Presidency is to align and converge multiple views, and facilitate transparent, inclusive, and fruitful discussion, while consistently advocating for more progress, ambition and solidarity.' 'Sound substantive and organizational preparation is essential to ensure that COP27 results in the most positive outcome possible. This workshop gathered several experts and resource persons with extensive experience in climate action and climate conferences, and allowed for useful sharing of best practices and lessons learned,' added Wael Aboulmagd, COP27 Special Representative. COP27 will take place from 6 to 18 November 2022 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt \</doc>

Berlin on Sunday accused Egypt of not living up to its human rights obligations as the country prepares to host global leaders for the closely-watched COP27 climate talks. The German government's human rights commissioner, Luise Amtsberg, urged summit host Egypt to release jailed dissident Alaa Abdel Fattah, currently on hunger strike, and his lawyer Mohamed al-Baqer. "The fact that people who want to express their opinions freely and stand up for that right are punished with long prison sentences  sometimes under inhumane conditions  is unacceptable," Amtsberg said in a statement. "Assuming global responsibility also means, above all, assuming responsibility for the protection of human rights," Amtsberg said. "However, the human rights situation in Egypt does not do justice to this." Releasing Abdel Fattah and other political prisoners would send "an important signal" that Egypt takes its human rights responsibilities seriously, she added. Cairo has faced frequent criticism over its human rights record since it was announced as COP27 host last year, a move rights groups said "rewards the repressive rule" of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Rights groups estimate that some 60,000 political prisoners are behind bars in Egypt, many of them in brutal conditions and overcrowded cells, accusations Cairo rejects. Fifteen Nobel laureates last week joined calls for Egypt to free Abdel Fattah, a major figure in the 2011 revolt that toppled longtime president Hosni Mubarak. The Egyptian-British writer and philosopher is serving a five-year sentence for "broadcasting false news", having already spent much of the past decade behind bars. He is currently on hunger strike and his relatives have warned that if he is not released during the climate conference, he will probably die in prison as he is due to stop drinking fluids from Sunday, the opening day of COP27 . \</doc>

Africa deserves the highest priority attention at the United Nations climate conference, COP 27 to be held in November this year, panel members discussing the African Development Bank's ( HYPERLINK http://www.AfDB.org www.AfDB.org ) African Economic Outlook 2022 ( HYPERLINK http://bit.ly/2Z1dRwt http://bit.ly/2Z1dRwt In a video message during one of the sessions, president and Chief Executive Officer of Bezos Earth Fund, Andrew Steer, urged African and world leaders to think bolder and work more creatively together as they prepare for COP 27 , which will take place in Egypt. Steer, a former World Bank Special Envoy for Climate Change believes that COP 27 gives the world an incredible opportunity to think big about Africa. "We need to make it Africa's COP. So, what the African Development Bank and the Atlantic Council are trying to do to raise awareness is exceedingly important." He described the 2022 African Economic Outlook as Â£n excellent report.' "It lays out beautifully this sobering time for Africa in particular, but actually for the whole world - a slowing world economy, the perfect storm of rising food prices and energy prices, interest rates, and shocking increases in the impact of climate change and green vulnerability at a time that international resources are not what they need to be." In a presentation on the report, Acting Chief Economist Urama called for policy coordination and a more holistic approach to tackling climate change. "We have been losing 5% to 15% of GDP per capita growth in Africa because of climate change, and that is in addition to other issues that climate change is driving on the continent," Urama said. "Amid these difficulties lie opportunities for innovation. Let's think big, act big, and save the planet." "As we prepare for COP 27 , honoring the 2009 $100 billion yearly climate finance commitment that high-income countries promised to developing countries will help to restore confidence that we are serious about climate change, even though it is not enough." Deputy Assistant Administrator for Africa at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Tyler Beckelman, said the African Economic Outlook "cogently and convincingly captures the very real and urgent challenges to realizing a just energy transition in Africa." "Make no mistake- the crisis is already here," Beckelman cautioned. "Four failed rainy seasons in the Horn of Africa- with a fifth likely to occur this summer- is a direct result of a warming climate, and sadly, it may become the norm." He said the United States would ensure that its African partners have the ability and resources to develop the foundation for a sustainable and low-carbon economy that provides ample energy for growth. He added: "While the challenges are enormous, we see plenty of reasons to be optimistic. Sustained investments in adaptation and mitigation, through renewable energy and climate-smart land use practices, will help provide a pathway for African countries to develop innovative ways, building a more just and equitable future for people across the continent." Senior Director of the Atlantic Council, Africa Centre, Rama Yade, observed that it has become more important to look at Africa and climate change. The event featured a panel discussion on the report, comprising Anthony Simpasa, Acting Manager of the African Development Bank's Macroeconomic Policy, Debt Sustainability and Forecasting Division; Ayaan Adam, Senior Director and CEO of AFC Capital Partners at the Africa Finance Corporation; Jeffrey Krilla, Vice President for Global Public Policy and Government Affairs, Kosmos Energy; and Queen Quinn, Founding Partner at Kupanda Capital.

Nigeria, Nov. 6 -- Sameh Shoukry, President of the 27th Conference of Parties ( COP27 ), on Sunday emphasised the need to urgently implement climate change pledges and commitment. "That is why we have constantly called for moving from negotiations and pledges to an era of implementation as a priority as well as the acceleration of implementation of what we have agreed upon with the UNFCCC promoted in the parties accord and the work programme while stating the importance of scaling up ambitions and aligning them to country's capacities and resources," he said. He said this at the opening ceremony of the global climate change conference which is taking place in the city of Sharm El Sheikh from 6-18 November with more than 100 world leaders, including President Joe Biden and Rishi Sunak, due to attend. ".it is clear to all of us that our conference this year is held amidst political tensions that left a deep impact on all our countries.," Mr Shoukry said. "I invite you all to show the whole world that we are aware of the challenges awaiting us and we have the political will to counter it." He congratulated parties who have updated their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) while also calling on countries who have yet to update theirs, to do so. Of 194 countries signed up to the UNFCCC, only 26 countries have updated their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) despite agreeing at Glasgow to revisit and strengthen their commitments by 2022. Of the 24, Australia, Norway, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates submitted stronger targets; Brazil, the UK, Indonesia, Egypt and Brazil did not increase their targets. A total of 14 countries including Sudan, the Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Uganda, Gabon, Serbia, Bolivia and others submitted new NDCs. "The current level of ambition is not up to the Paris goals.For the sake of an efficient implementation of pledges and commitments, we need more efficient and wider participation by all relevant parties.," he pleaded. Furthermore, he noted that climate change-related efforts over the past decades were remarkably polarised which has slowed down the progress of the negotiations. Current mobilisation efforts raise many concerns, he said; the $100 billion yearly pledge has yet to be implemented, also the financing currently available focuses on curbing emissions and not adaptation efforts and most of the financing is based on loans. "I believe that you agree with me that we do not have the luxury of continuing this way, we have to change our approaches to this existential threat, we have to work diligently and honestly and listen to one another," Mr Shoukry said. Wealthy nations have failed to meet their financial obligations; they had promised a yearly $100 billion in financing since 2009 but have yet to make good on this promise. Mr Shoukry was elected president of COP27 at the opening ceremony by acclamation. Alok Sharma, Mr Shoukry's predecessor, in his remarks warned that the world is currently not on the path to keeping the global temperature at the required 1.5c. "How many more wake-up calls do world leaders actually need?" he asked, citing cases of floods in Nigeria, and earthquakes in Pakistan among other climate-related disasters. The conference must be about concrete actions, he said. He added that he hopes world leaders joining the conference will explain clearly what their countries have achieved last year and how they would go further. He expressed his willingness to support the Egyptian presidency of the COP. Speaking on the $100 billion yearly financing, he said, "I hear the criticisms and I agree that more must be done by governments and the multilateral development banks including on doubling adaptation and finance by 2025 and establishing a post-2025 goal." However, he remains hopeful given where the world was before and where it is at the moment. "With thanks to all of you, the UK's presidency ends as a demonstration that progress is possible, it is happening and it is continuing. Yes, we need to accelerate that progress in the remainder of the decisive decade but I believe fundamentally that we can; we know what we need to do to keep 1.5c alive, we know how to do it and Sameh, you and your team have our full support. So now friends, let us make sure we deliver, let us make it happen," Mr Sharma said. UNFCCC Executive Secretary, Simon Steill, in his remarks said COP 27 marks the beginning of a new era and "we begin to do things differently." He said while other COPs gave the world a plan and an agreement, Sharm El Sheik shifts parties to implementation. "No one can be a mere passenger on this journey. This is a signal that times have changed." "We will be holding people to account, be they presidents, prime ministers or CEOs. An accountability chief if you may because our policies, businesses, infrastructures, our actions, be they personal or public must be aligned with the Paris agreement and with the convention," Mr Steill said. The heart of implementation is everybody doing everything they can to address the climate crisis. He emphasised the need to not allow positioning to block progress as everyone has to act and the conference in Egypt provides the opportunity. "I want you to focus on three critical lines of action; we must demonstrate this transformational shift to implementation, putting negotiations into concrete actions, every corner of human activity must align with our Paris agreement and pursuing efforts to limit temperature rise to 1.5c," he said. He added that "we must cement progress on these critical work streams; mitigation, adaptation, finance and crucially loss and damage. What is set in these negotiation rooms have to reflect in what is happening outside." He urged parties not to rescind their commitments. "Stick to your commitments, build on them here in Egypt. I will not be a custodian of backsliding." Mr Steill added that as the world pivots to implementation, women and girls have to be placed at the centre of climate decision-making and action. The Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Hoesung Lee, reiterated that the world is not on track to limit global warming to 1.5c, hence now is the time for collective action. According to Mr Lee, the IPCC report of this year shows that we have the technology and know how to tackle climate change but are limited by the availability of financing models. "With increasing warming, losses and damages will increase and additional human and natural systems will be pushed to adaptation limits. Therefore the prerequisite to a successful adaptation is ambitious mitigation to keep global warming within limits," he said. He added that adaptation gaps especially in developing countries are particularly driven by widening disparities between the cost of adaptation and financing available for adaptation. The annual summit rotates among the five UN classified regions: Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, central and eastern Europe, and western Europe. This is the fifth time Africa is hosting the conference; Morocco (twice), South Africa and Kenya have hosted it. There are 11 thematic areas for this year's COP. These are Finance day, Science day, Youth and Future Generation day, Gender day, Decarbonisation day, Adaptation and Agriculture day, Water day, Ace and Civil Society day, Energy day, Biodiversity day and Solution day. The Egyptian presidency structured the COP27 action agenda with a focus on implementation, aiming to mobilise collective efforts for ambitious emission reductions from different sectors, enhance the transformative adaptation agenda on the ground, enable flows of appropriate finance and deliver on the ground on time and at scale.

By Usman Aliyu The 27th Session of the Conference of Parties on United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), otherwise known as COP27 , ended in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, on Sunday with Parties agreeing on historic fund for loss and damage. The fund formed part of the Sharm El-Sheikh Implementation Plan on climate change after loss and damage included in the agenda for the first time. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the fund is meant to support developing countries, including Nigeria, that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. The establishment will see donors contributing to a global fund to save lives and livelihoods from climate change related disasters such as floodings, droughts and earthquakes, among others. The Agreement also called for multilateral development banks and international financial institutions to reform practices and priorities to ensure simplified access to climate finance. The deal saw Parties recommit to keeping the 1.5\'b0C target for global temperature rise intact and significant progress made across the board on climate issues. The agreement comes despite the significant economic and geopolitical challenges of the last year and follows negotiations that ran into extra time and saw the Presidency and Parties locked in detailed discussions around the clock. Speaking at the closing plenary, COP27 President, Sameh Shoukry, said: "The work that we've managed to do here in the past two weeks, and the results we have together achieved, are a testament to our collective will, as a community of nations, to voice a clear message that rings loudly today, here in this room and around the world. "That multilateral diplomacy still work, despite the difficulties and challenges of our times, the divergence of views, level of ambition or apprehension, we remain committed to the fight against climate change. He noted that despite the initial hiccups in the negotiations, the parties were united and worked for one aim in the end, which he said was one higher purpose and common goal. "This was not easy. We worked around the clock. Long days and nights. Strained and sometimes tense, but united and working for one aim, one higher purpose, one common goal that we all subscribe to and aspire to achieve. In the end we delivered." Shoukry added that: "The agreement saw considerable advancements across board and pledges by developed countries in relation to Mitigation, Adaptation, Finance, Loss and Damage for developing countries in line with the Egyptian COP27 Presidency's vision for the COP." NAN recalls that the issue of loss and damage was, for the first time, central to the agenda at the event and progress on its financing is a pivotal part of COP27 's success. "We heard the calls, and we responded. Today, here in Sharm El-Sheikh, we established the first-ever dedicated fund for loss and damage, a fund that has been so long in the making. "It was only appropriate that this COP, the implementation COP in Africa, is where the fund is finally established. "Millions around the globe can now sense a glimmer of hope that their suffering will finally be addressed, swiftly and appropriately. "The agreement and pledges made on loss and damage aim to unlock greater ambitions for mitigation and adaptation," Shoukry said. During COP27 , financial pledges were made for loss and damage from multiple countries, including Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, and New Zealand, joining Denmark and Scotland that had made pledges previously.

UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres has decried the breakdown of trust between the global North and South at the ongoing 27th session of Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) on Climate Change in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Guterres in his remark at COP27 briefing on Thursday, said the breakdown in trust between North and South, and between developed and emerging economies was a recipe for mutually assured destruction. "This is no time for finger pointing. The blame game is a recipe for mutually assured destruction. "I am here to appeal to all parties to rise to this moment and to the greatest challenge facing humanity. The world is watching and has a simple message: stand and deliver," said the UN scribe. Guterres urged the parties to deliver the kind of of meaningful climate action that people and the planet so desperately needed; as global emissions were at their highest level in history and still rising. "Climate impacts are decimating economies and societies and growing. We know what we need to do and we have the tools and resources to get it done. "And so I appeal to the parties to act in three critical areas. First, the most effective way to rebuild trust is by finding an ambitious and credible agreement on loss and damage and financial support to developing countries. "The time for talking on loss and damage finance is over. We need action. No one can deny the scale of loss and damage we see around the globe. "The world is burning and drowning before our eyes and I urge all parties to show that they see it and get it. "Send a clear signal that the voices of those on the frontlines of the crisis are finally being heard. Reflect the urgency, scale and enormity of the challenge faced by developing countries. "We cannot continue to deny climate justice to those who have contributed least to the climate crisis and are getting hurt the most. Now is a moment for solidarity, said the UN chief. He also appealed to all parties to forcefully address the huge emissions gap, noting that the 1.5 target was not simply about keeping a goal alive, but it's about keeping people alive. "I see the will to keep to the 1.5 goal \- but we must ensure that commitment is evident in the COP27 outcome. Fossil fuel expansion is hijacking humanity. "Any hope of meeting the 1.5 target requires a step change in emissions reductions. We cannot close the emissions gap without an acceleration in the deployment of renewables. "The Just Energy Transition Partnerships are important pathways to accelerate the phasing out of coal and the scaling up of renewables. This effort must be expanded," he said. Guterres also called for the delivery of the $100 billion in the climate finance for developing countries by the developed world. The parties, he said must act on the crucial question of finance as it meant clarity on how the doubling of adaptation finance will be delivered through a credible roadmap. "We have agreed solutions in front of us to respond to loss and damage, to close the emissions gap, and to deliver on finance. The climate clock is ticking, and trust keeps eroding. "The parties at COP27 have a chance to make a difference here and now. I urge them to act  and act quickly," the UN boss appealed. (NAN) \</doc>

The United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned global leaders on the dangers of climate crisis saying the fight for a liveable planet will be won or lost in this decade. Guterres stated this at Climate Change implementation Summit opening at the ongoing COP27 UN Climate Summit in Egypt. He said: 'We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator. 'Our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible. Read Also: COP27 'We need urgent Climate Action. The impacts of climate change are here now, and the loss and damage they cause can no longer be ignored. # COP27 \~must agree on a clear, time-bound roadmap reflective of the scale and urgency of the challenge. It's a moral imperative and a question of solidarity and climate justice.' Guterres said the world had the tools it needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in clean energy and low-carbon technology. 'A window of opportunity remains open, but only a narrow shaft of light remains,' he said. 'The global climate fight will be won or lost in this crucial decade - on our watch. One thing is certain: those that give up are sure to lose.' \</doc>

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation echoed African leaders' calls for countries to rapidly scale-up finance for climate adaptation and pledged to invest $1.4 billion to help smallholder farmers address the immediate and long-term impacts of climate change. CEO Gates Foundation Mark Suzman announced this at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 'The effects of climate change have already been devastating, and every moment the world delays action, more people suffer, and the solutions become more complex and costly,' said Suzman. 'Our commitment will help smallholder farmers adapt today and build resilience for the future. It is essential for this climate summit to produce bold commitments that address immediate and long-term needs. Leaders must listen to the voices of African farmers and governments to understand their priorities and respond with urgency.' The foundation's commitment will fund immediate action and long-term initiatives over four years to help smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia build resilience and food security. Funding will focus on spurring African-led innovation to build a pipeline of climate-smart agriculture projects, new applications of digital technologies, climate-smart innovations for smallholder livestock farming, and support for women smallholder farmers to capitalize on their untapped potential. 'Women in rural Africa are the backbone of their food systems, but they have never had equal access to the resources they need to reach their full potential or build resilience to looming climate threats,' said Melinda French Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 'As the climate crisis accelerates, women's vital role in their economies is too important to overlook. With the right financing and marketing support, women smallholder farmers could earn more in a day than they currently earn in a month, ultimately transforming these regional food systems and unlocking a healthier, more sustainable, and more prosperous future for families and communities across the continent.' Read Also: # COP27 The goal is to scale up initiatives that empower women farmers, support innovations at the nexus of gender and climate adaptation, and increase climate finance that gives rural women better access to the climate-smart resources they need to strengthen food systems. To accelerate the development of new adaptation innovations, the foundation is continuing to work with a coalition of partners to double the budget for the CGIAR agriculture research system. The CGIAR Excellence in Agronomy initiative partners with African research institutes, local businesses, and farmer organizations. Together, they are using big data, analytics, and digital platforms to deliver insights that can boost incomes, food security, and ecosystem health in smallholder farming communities. 'The climate crisis is causing enormous harm every day as it jeopardizes entire regions of people and economies,' said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 'More funding is necessary to ensure agricultural and technological innovations are widely available to vulnerable communities, helping them to adapt to climate change, save lives and increase economic growth.' Additional investments included in the commitment announced will support: The Africa Adaptation Initiative (AAI) to quickly build a pipeline of climate-smart agriculture projects across 23 countries in Africa. Funding will provide targeted support for the technical capacity, planning, and project development required to implement programs. The development of new applications of digital technologies to ensure smallholder farmers can anticipate and respond to climate threats. This includes an innovative weather intelligence platform developed through a new partnership between the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) and TomorrowNow, which provides climate-smart agriculture strategies to farmers in East Africa via text messages. African-led innovations to develop climate-smart options for improving livestock health and productivity while also reducing their climate footprint. This will be done in partnership with Canada's International Development Research Center (IDRC). This funding builds on more than a decade of investments and the foundation's recent announcement during the United Nations General Assembly of $100 million in funding to help alleviate the current food crisis in Africa and South Asia and address its underlying causes. It also builds on funding commitments focused on agriculture adaptation made at previous climate summits: \</doc>

Cairo, Egypt - Private investment opportunities to support climate change adaptation against floods and droughts in Africa could reach a total of $100 billion by 2040, according to an IFC study published today. Covering 43 of Africa&rsquo;s 54 countries, the study, "Adapting to Natural Disasters in Africa: What&rsquo;s in it for the Private Sector?", assessed commercially viable investment opportunities that will strengthen the continent&rsquo;s climate resilience and support development and job creation. It found that many of the most promising opportunities lie in Africa&rsquo;s lower-income countries, including Eswatini, Malawi, Namibia, Niger, and Mauritania. Specific opportunities include investing in weather-resistant crop varieties, crop insurance for farmers, irrigation systems to protect against drought, climate data and information systems, and building dikes to protect against coastal flooding. "Extreme weather events are occurring with greater frequency and severity in Africa, with floods and droughts being particularly devastating. However, governments alone cannot finance the investments needed to respond. The private sector will play a key role in providing the investments that will contribute to the climate agenda," said S&eacute;rgio Pimenta, IFC Vice President for Africa. "This study shows the abundance of opportunities out there for investors that will help Africa adapt to the new climate reality and that support economic development." Despite being collectively responsible for less than four percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, African countries are some of the most vulnerable to climate change, in part because of their heavy reliance on rain-fed agriculture and a limited capacity to respond and adapt to shocks. Between 1990 and 2019, Africa suffered 1,107 floods and droughts, leading to nearly 44,000 deaths and at least $14 billion in damages, the study found, using data from the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters&rsquo; Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT). The study also found that since 1990, droughts and floods have lowered African countries&rsquo; GDP by an average of 0.7 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively. The study measured the upfront investments needed in each country to offset droughts and floods-induced losses, assuming unchanged severity and frequency of these events over the next 20 years. Since these disasters are likely to become more frequent and severe in the future, investment needs are likely to be even greater, according to the study. The study comes as the United Nations climate change conference , COP27 In fiscal year 2022, IFC delivered $4.4 billion in climate finance globally and mobilized an additional $3.3 billion from other sources, with $2.1 billion supporting Africa&rsquo;s green transition. IFC IFC-a member of the World Bank Group-is the largest global development institution focused on the private sector in emerging markets. We work in more than 100 countries, using our capital, expertise, and influence to create markets and opportunities in developing countries. In fiscal year 2022, IFC committed a record $32.8 billion to private companies and financial institutions in developing countries, leveraging the power of the private sector to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity as economies grapple with the impacts of global compounding crises.

Many Nigerians at the ongoing international climate change conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt may cut short their participation due to the high cost of accommodation. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday reports that hoteliers and landlords in the Red Sea city of Sharm El Sheikh increased rates as more than 50,000 participants travelled to the country for the conference. A check on the hotels in the city shows a rise of more than 400 per cent in room rates. Dare Akogun, a Nigerian journalist who was at the city to cover the 14 - day event told NAN that he could only afford to stay a week because of the accommodation cost. Akogun said that he had paid close to 500 dollars for accommodation in less than a week that he came to Egypt. Read Also: COP27 : Climate activist tasks oil coys on Niger Delta clean up 'I arrived at the city on Nov. 5 and went straight to the hotel I checked online and saw 40 dollars per night which is N34,000. 'I couldn't, however, book online with my Naira card because of the limit on international transactions. 'Surprisingly, when I got to the hotel to pay, the receptionist told me it is 175 dollars per night,'' he said. Akogun said that he was shocked, but because it was already late, he had no option than to pass the night there. 'I had to move into an apartment shared by other delegates from Uganda, Mali and Nigeria who are also in the same category,'' he said. Another delegate of a non-governmental organisation from Nigeria, Israel Kingsley shared a similar experience. Kingsley said that when he could not afford the cost of hotel accommodation, he opted for private apartment, which he said was also expensive. 'I tell you sincerely that I pay 40 dollars per night where I sleep now. 'It is too much and I think the people of Egypt are deliberate about it. They exploit the delegates unnecessarily. Kingsley said that some of the delegates also put up in the nearby city of Dahab, some 90 kilometres away from Sharm El Sheikh without a direct daily bus service. 'Partner organisations that have supported CSOs to attend COP27 had to set up shuttles to and from the COP27 venue at the rate of 15 dollars daily,'' he said. Another COP attendant, who resides in Dahab, Jumoke Alade an environmental activist also complained of cost of accommodation and commuting daily to and from the venue. 'Aside the accommodation issue, Nigerian participants also complained about the food, which they said, did not come close to the staples in Nigeria,' Alade said. But one of the merchants, who spoke with NAN at the Naema Bay market, Omar Ibrahim said things were generally costly in Sharm El Sheikh. 'This is Sharm and you can't compare it with other cities in the country,'' said Ibrahim, who operates a supermarket at Naama Bay market. NAN reports that the apex meeting on climate change in the world will end on Nov. 18. (NAN) \</doc>

Nigeria, Nov. 20 -- After two weeks of intensive conversations around issues of climate change at the 27th United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ), the Parties have reached a deal. The deal was reached at the final plenary Sunday morning and is called Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan (SHIP). It saw parties recommit to keeping the 1.5degC target for global temperature rise intact while significant progress was also made across the board on climate issues. As part of the SHIP, parties agreed to the establishment of a historic loss and damage fund on climate change after loss and damage was included in the agenda for the first time. The new fund will see donors contribute to a global fund to save lives and livelihoods from climate change-related disasters. Speaking during the closing plenary, COP President Sameh Shoukry said: "The work that we've managed to do here in the past two weeks, and the results we have together achieved, are a testament to our collective will, as a community of nations, to voice a clear message that rings loudly today, here in this room and around the world: that multilateral diplomacy still works." "Despite the difficulties and challenges of our times, the divergence of views, level of ambition or apprehension, we remain committed to the fight against climate change.. we rose to the occasion, upheld our responsibilities and undertook the important decisive political decisions that millions around the world expect from us," he added. The agreement also saw considerable advancements across the board and pledges by developed countries in relation to Mitigation, Adaptation, Finance and Loss and Damage for developing countries. The issue of loss and damage was, for the first time, central to the agenda at COP and progress on its financing is seen by many as a pivotal part of the successes recorded at COP27 . At the conference, financial pledges were made for loss and damage from multiple countries including Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, and New Zealand, joining Denmark and Scotland, which had made pledges previously. The work of the High-Level Champions in implementing the Five-Year Plan for the Improved Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action for Enhancing Ambition, was also welcomed. In particular, the Sharm El-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda, regionalisation of climate action and advancing investment and access to finance in developing countries were particularly commended. The COP further encouraged the High-Level Champions to continue enhancing their engagement with non-state actors, in alignment with the new emerging priorities from COP27 , and to follow up on the implementation of their initiatives launched in the year. Speaking further, COP President Shoukry said, "This was not easy. We worked around the clock. Long days and nights. Strained and sometimes tense, but united and working for one aim, one higher purpose, one common goal that we all subscribe to and aspire to achieve. In the end, we delivered." Speaking about the year ahead, Mr Shoukry said: "We leave Sharm El-Sheikh with renewed hope in the future of our planet, with an even stronger collective will and more determination to achieve the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. "We've just adopted the landmark Sharm El-Sheikh Mitigation Ambition and Implementation Work Programme that will hugely contribute to keeping 1.5 within reach, and I trust that we all know what needs to be done to safeguard 1.5 and ensure that we never go beyond."

United Kingdom (UK) has announced an investment of \Â£395 million on climate resilient and sustainable agriculture in Nigeria. COP ) 27 on Climate Change going on in Sharm El Sheikh City of Egypt. The Propcom+ is a UK International Climate Finance (ICF) programme, which aims to support the transformation of Nigeria's rural economy. The new investment, according to the UK senior official, is set to enhance productivity, adapt and build resilience, and protect and restore Nature. The commitment to Nigeria formed part of the UK support worth over \Â£3100 million to developing countries to deal with climate change. Details of the support noted that at least 4 million Nigerians, including 2 million women will benefit, to increase productivity and adapt to the effects of climate change while at the same time reducing emissions. "This new programme is also set to help address key barriers to sustainable agricultural development in Nigeria. "It will support the development of climate-resilient agricultural policies, actions, and investments that deliver nutrition, increase productivity, adapt and build resilience while reducing emissions, and protect and restore natural ecosystems. "For example, through the adoption and scaling of practices such as heat and flood tolerant crop varieties and integrated soil fertility management. "The new Propcom+ programme involves supporting inclusive and resilient growth by promoting the progressive transformation of Nigeria's rural economy. "The new programme will build the capacity of small-scale farmers and rural communities in climate smart agriculture. "It will work with Nigeria's vibrant private sector on agriculture to increase productivity, improve nutrition and food security, enhance climate resilience, pursue lower emissions and halt and reverse biodiversity loss, as well as helping to tackle some of Nigeria's underlying drivers of conflict and insecurity," revealed the details obtained by NAN in Sharm El Sheikh. In his remark, Cleverly said: "the Glasgow Climate Pact gave the world the tools to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees and build a secure and sustainable future. "Now is the time for all countries to step up their action on climate change and deliver the tangible change needed. "The UK will continue to play a leading role in this mission. The funding we have announced will support countries which are facing the devastating impact of climate change, to adapt effectively." Justifying the support, UK Deputy High Commissioner in Lagos, Nigeria, Ben Llewellyn-Jones said Nigeria was extremely vulnerable to climate change and land degradation. "Climate risks are increasing, diminishing productive capacity, and contributing to worsening food insecurity. "Farmers are on the front line and highly dependent on seasonal rainfall making them increasingly vulnerable to the changing and unpredictable climate. "Tackling climate change and biodiversity loss is a key UK international priority and we remain committed to supporting inclusive and climate resilient growth in Nigeria through the Propcom+ programme which will build on the successes and lessons from previous engagement and deliver on adaptation and resilience, and on nature for climate and people," said the UK deputy high commissioner in Nigeria. \</doc>

Download logo UN-Habitat, in cooperation with Nestle Waters, Diageo, Arcadis IBI Group and Development Inc. organized a side event during the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) under the title "Transitioning towards a circular economy: Innovation in plastic and glass waste recycling", addressing the challenges and solutions of solid waste management in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. During the session, moderated by Dr. Laila Iskandar, Former Minister of Environment and State for Urban Renewal and Informal Settlements in Egypt and Founder of CID Consulting, experts from UN-Habitat and the partner organizations showcased the achievements of the "Plan Zero" and "Dorna" initiatives in advancing innovative solutions in plastic and glass waste recycling to support the transition towards a circular economy. "UN-Habitat is committed to taking transformative measures towards creating a circular economy and raising awareness of the social, economic and environmental benefits of reducing, reusing and recycling glass and plastic waste" said Dr. Erfan Ali, UN-Habitat Regional Representative for the Arab States. Each partner presented its efforts, all moving toward more sustainable and greener approaches through glass and plastic collection and recycling, as well as protecting, renewing and restoring natural resources. "We're proud to be all setting bolder and ambitious targets to help us transition towards a circular economy and more sustainable world," Ziad Karam, Diageo Corporate Relations Director, MENA, commented. "What we can reuse we will reuse and what we can't reuse we will recycle. Our collaboration and partnership in Plan Zero help us accelerate our executions and scale to create best practices and positive consumer and customers experience with our packaging and glass." The "Plan Zero" initiative is a regional alliance that aims at reducing carbon footprint in the targeted countries - Lebanon, Jordan, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt- by diverting packaging waste from landfills, water bodies and the environment, through retrieving recyclables and non-recyclable plastic, fiber, glass and metal packaging material. In Lebanon and Jordan, water bottles are being collected from consumers through reverse vending machines. In Egypt, the "Dorna" initiative undertakes the collection, recovery and recycling of post-consumer plastics through tracking and documenting the movement of material along the value chain to the final manufacturing point. "It is time that the construction industry fully embraces and takes the circular economy seriously. At the core of our designs is sustainability, so naturally Arcadis IBI Group is excited to further enhance and infuse into design the innovative Rejects of Glass and Plastic (ROGP) technology and not only into buildings but also across critical engineering designs. From the pipes and engineering systems to the places we live in and the furniture we sit in, there is an opportunity to re-use these resources and truly achieve a circular economy," Hassan Ktaech, Associate, Built Environment of Arcadis IBI Group, said. In 2016, the MENA region generated 129 million tons of waste of which only 9% are being recycled and the vast majority disposed of in open fields and dumpsites. The region is expected to double its waste generation by 2050. Glass and plastic waste comprise almost 15 percent of the total waste generated in the region. "The packaging problem has proved to be one of the most pressing environmental issues the world is facing. We are happy that we are working with the producers and UN-Habitat to sort this issue out in an impactful way in Lebanon and Jordan and soon in Egypt and more MENA countries," Mohamed Daoud, CEO of Development Inc, stated. "Development Inc's role is to design and implement the project towards this target using out of the box impactful methods, while maintaining a flawless traceability for the operations. We are grateful to the opportunity that was given to us by UN-Habitat to implement these methods around the targeted areas." The COP, which is the main decision-making body of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is held every year, to assesses the measures of the parties to limit climate change. This year COP27 is held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, from 6 to 18 November. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of UN Habitat. Load-Date: \~November 18, 2022 \</doc>

Dayo Israel, the national youth leader, of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), has tasked the world leaders, especially Europe and America, on the need to show serious commitment to climate funding obligations in Africa if the continent must meet the goals set on emissions and other actions identified to address the problem of the harmful increase in the temperature of the planet. He issued the challenge during a session at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 Stressing the grave importance of addressing the challenge of climate change to protect the future of young people and achieve sustainable development, Israel lamented a situation where words have replaced action and those primarily responsible for the problem are dragging their feet on making the required investments for meaningful progress. He added: 'Africa, including my home country Nigeria, has contributed so little to this problem but we are left to bear the worst brunt. We are witnessing record droughts, flooding and other environmental disasters all linked to the warming climate. : Labour Party is the party to beat in 2023 general elections, says Nnamani 'On top of that, we are asked to sacrifice growth opportunities and neglect satisfying pressing national needs in the interest of the planet even if those making the demand, the same people with a more significant share of responsibility for the problem, are dodging their obligations, especially financing the gaps the shifts they are demanding will cause.' Israel maintained that the APC appreciates the impact of climate change on the future and sustainable development, particularly as Nigeria continues to count the loss of the devastating floods witnessed in several parts of the country this year due primarily to worsening rainfalls and weather conditions. According to him, 'I have been to numerous states in Nigeria where climate change has resulted in devastating floods to witness, first-hand, the extent of the damage recorded. 'Many farmers have lost their means of livelihood and other families are now displaced because their homes are submerged in water. 'This is a challenge we take seriously as a ruling party in charge of the government. We understand that solving it is crucial to our ambition to guarantee our youths a safe and prosperous future.' In addition to the efforts carried out by the Muhamamdu Buhari administration to provide succour to areas and citizens of the country suffering the negative effects of climate change, Israel noted that the party's presidential candidate in the 2023 general elections, Bola Tinubu, has also demonstrated his commitment to renewable energy and other innovations to keep the country on a positive track as far as the issue is concerned. He stressed that much is hinged on the West taking its obligation seriously, including the $100bn annual investment promised by the bloc to fund climate actions in Africa. 'The West must take the lead on this issue. That's the quickest and most effective path forward. We share the objective of protecting the planet and bequeathing to the future generation a safe and livable world. 'But we must not be made to pay the biggest price for a problem we didn't cause. Not when those making the demands and setting the targets are quick to resort to the same actions they condemn when they feel an energy pinch. He who comes into equity must come with clean hands,' he said. \</doc>

The Federal Government is pushing for funding to the tune of $400bn to help implement Nigeria's Energy Transition Plan. The Minister of Environment, Mohammed Abdullahi, said the push was being made at the ongoing the 27th Conference of Parties, also known as COP27 , holding at Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt. He disclosed this in his address on the Federal Government's expectations at the ongoing conference, which was made available to our correspondent by the Federal Ministry of Environment in Abuja on Tuesday. Abdullahi said, "Part of what we will do is to galvanise the action plan for Africa to push for a positive climate funding action from the developed countries. "That is why the Nigeria Energy Transition Plan is aligned to ensuring that we get the requisite funding for smooth transition to renewables, without which it will be very difficult to deploy infrastructure to support our mini-grid, deployment of solar and support bio-fuel." The News Agency of Nigeria reported from Egypt that the minister said the amount being pushed for by Nigeria for the implementation of the country's Energy Transition Plan was $400bn. In his speech that was made available in Abuja, Abdullahi stated that "African countries and developing nations indeed understand that funding is important in whatever position COP27 will take." "We are focused on ensuring that we bring the issue of loss and damage to the fore and we are already making progress in this regard," he added. The minister said Nigeria was using the opportunity to call the attention of developed countries on the impact of their industrialisation on developing countries and the need for them to mitigate this. Abdullahi said, "In addition, Nigeria, as the leader of the Pan African agency for the Great Green Wall, will focus on climate finance to support its activities in the Sahel Region. "This is particularly in the most endemic Northern states described as the front line states, where desertification is fast approaching and, of course, wetland drying up. These and others are huge issues that we will be focusing on." He said the government would also engage with private sector investors who could support the energy transition plan of Nigeria, as a number of bilateral meetings and engagement had been arranged to discuss funding from development partners and the private sector. Abdullahi expressed confidence that he and his team of negotiators would return to the country with a strong, dependable and bankable commitment from the development partners and other investors. \</doc>

However, he stressed that much is hinged on the West taking its obligation seriously, including the $100bn annual investment promised by the bloc to fund climate actions in Africa. 'The West must take the lead on this issue. That's the quickest and most effective path forward. We share the objective of protecting the planet and bequeathing to the future generation a safe and livable world. 'But we must not be made to pay the biggest price for a problem we didn't cause. Not when those making the demands and setting the targets are quick to resort to the same actions they condemn when they feel an energy pinch. He who comes into equity must come with clean hands,' he stated. \</doc>

Download logo Egyptian authorities have arrested dozens of people for calling for protests and restricted the right to protest in the days leading up to the COP27 climate summit, threatening its success, Human Rights Watch said today. The authorities have added security measures in Sharm El-Sheikh, the resort town where the conference will be held, including mandating the installation of cameras in all taxis, allowing security agency surveillance of drivers and passengers. The authorities also imposed an unduly complicated process for registration for the so-called Green Zone outside the COP venue, which at previous summits was open to the wider public to engage on climate issues and allow interaction with summit participants. "As participants are arriving for COP27 , it is becoming clear that Egypt's government has no intention of easing its abusive security measures and allowing for free speech and assembly," said Adam Coogle, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. "Egyptian authorities should not be extending its human rights crackdown into the summit space." On November 1, 2022, Egyptian media reported that since the beginning of October, Egyptian authorities had arrested dozens of people for calling for anti-government protests on November 11, during the conference. Some of those arrested reportedly face charges of "misusing social media" and "joining a terrorist group." The number of those arrested is rising every day, local media reported. On October 31, Egyptian authorities detained an Indian climate activist, Ajit Rajagopal, as he set off on an eight-day walk from Cairo to Sharm El-Sheikh to call attention to the climate crisis. The authorities released him the next day after international outcry. According to local media, in recent days the authorities stepped up police checkpoints in downtown Cairo and around vital streets in the city, arbitrarily stopping people and forcing them to give up their phones for unconstitutional checks into their social media content. The authorities have repeatedly set up such checkpoints around major events in recent years, resulting in dozens of arbitrary arrests. The authorities also announced substantial limitations on public protests and marches. On October 22, during a TV interview, South Sinai Governor Khaled Fouda said that public protests around COP would be allowed only in the designated area set aside for protests, confirming what Egypt's foreign minister announced in March. In the recorded video interview with the governor, the local Sada al-Balad channel broadcast footage of what appeared to be the protest area inside the Green Zone. "No one will be allowed except those registered," the governor said. Prior to the start of the conference, the COP27 website published guidelines on protests and demonstrations that require organizers to provide notification 36 hours in advance and disclose the purpose of the protest or demonstration, its date, the organizing entity, and a designated focal point with a copy of the conference badge. The protest or march can only take place between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. during the site's operating hours. For marches anywhere else, in Sharm El-Sheikh, organizers must provide notification 48 hours in advance along with other details. The authorities also announced sweeping surveillance plans. During the same TV interview, the governor said that the authorities are installing surveillance cameras in all 800 taxis in Sharm el Sheikh, claiming this measure was needed to "monitor the driver's behavior" with tourists and visitors, and "not to surveil people." He said that by early November, 500 taxis would already be monitored by the cameras which keep audio-video recordings of what happens inside the taxi and are connected to a "security observatory" run by Egypt's notorious Interior Ministry. He did not indicate how long these recordings could be kept and what laws regulate such massive surveillance, which would appear to violate the international human right to privacy. On October 24, the Egyptian government released a smartphone application for COP27 attendees that requires users to provide personal information, including their passport numbers. Based on an initial analysis by two local rights groups, the application requires access to the phone's camera, microphone, location, and Bluetooth connection. All information gathered by the application can be shared with third parties. The wide-ranging information raises further surveillance and privacy concerns. The authorities have also announced plans that would in effect restrict access for the general public to climate discussions in Sharm El-Sheikh. On October 24, the Egyptian government announced an online registration process for the "Green Zone." The registration process requires an applicant to provide personal information including passport numbers and cite an affiliation to a participating group, effectively closing it off from interested people who are not affiliated with media or any participating group. Human Rights Watch and a dozen other organizations have warned that the years-long restrictions on assembly, association, and independent work by the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi would effectively hinder meaningful participation by nongovernmental groups and journalists during COP, preventing a successful and ambitious outcome of the climate summit. About 1,400 groups from various regions and public figures from 80 countries have signed a petition drafted by 12 Egyptian organizations to lift the restrictions. On October 7, five United Nations special rapporteurs said in a statement that Egypt "must ensure the safety and full participation of all parts of civil society" at COP27 after "a wave of government restrictions on participation raised fears of reprisals against activists." International law guarantees everyone the right to free, active, and meaningful participation in public affairs at international, national, regional, and local levels. The right to participate is inseparably linked to other human rights such as the right to peaceful assembly and association, and freedom of expression. "Arresting Egyptians merely for calling for protests a few days before COP is not just a violation to freedom of expression and assembly, but it is also a direct message to COP participants to stay in line," Coogle said.

The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP27 , is dubbed 'African COP' as the impact of climate change on African countries will be a key theme of discussions. Agriculture and food systems will also be a critical focus of COP27 , with Saturday, 12 November, dedicated to both themes, in addition to adaptation. Also high on the climate agenda is the role of the youth, as 10 November is dedicated to their participation. Ahead of COP27 The webinar titled, Are Climate-Smart and Digital Agriculture Solutions the Silver Bullet to Attract Youth, highlighted the potential of climate-smart and digital agriculture in attracting young people and thereby rejuvenating an aging global agricultural sector. Dr. Kevin Kariuki, African Development Bank's Vice President for Power Energy, Climate and Green Growth, pointed out the challenges the agriculture sector faces due to the changing climate change. "Agriculture across most of sub-Saharan Africa is still predominantly rain-fed and therefore extremely vulnerable to both short-term fluctuations and long-term changes in climate conditions. It is the most exposed sector with estimates indicating that climate change will cause a decrease in yields of 8 - 22% for Africa's rain-fed staple crops over the next 20 years," Kariuki said. Dr. Beth Dunford, African Development Bank's Vice President for Agriculture, Human and Social Development, noted that while agriculture holds tremendous potential for job creation in Africa, its current traditional form is not attractive to young people for various reasons, including negative perceptions. "Who wants to wear overalls, dig the field with a hoe or drive a tractor when we can do it in a suit and dust coat, right? However, technology makes agriculture cool enough to motivate them to use tech-enabled enterprises to be part of agricultural value chains," Dunford said. Prof. Anthony Nyong, Senior Director for Africa at the Global Centre on Adaptation, said: "There is a gap in the agriculture sector in Africa, and that is in the use of digital solutions." AAAP's Climate Smart Digital Technologies for Agriculture and Food Security Pillar is scaling up access to digital technologies and associated data-driven agricultural and financial services for at least 30 million African farmers. In the African Development Bank's Program to Build Resilience for Food and Nutrition Security in the Horn of Africa (BREFONS) ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3SBjvx8 ), currently ongoing in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan, the AAAP is facilitating the integration of climate-smart digital technologies for adaptation and resilience. "The project will increase the productivity of crops and livestock by 30%, reaching about 1.3 million farmers and pastoralists using climate services such as index insurance. About 55,000 additional jobs will be created for youth and women," said Oluyede Ajayi, Africa Program Lead, Food Security and Rural Well Being, Global Centre on Adaptation. Panelists said the youth must utilize their digital skills to accelerate the transformation of the agricultural sector, which forms the central pillar of Africa's economy. They urged participants to contribute to solutions that enhance market linkages to promote agribusiness. "Africa's significant youth population faces rising unemployment with myriad negative consequences. These challenges are further exacerbated by climate shocks, skill gaps & limited preparedness to address the effects of climate change," said Andre-Marie Taptue, Principal Economist at the African Development Bank's Jobs for Youth program. AAAP's YouthAdapt program ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3D5JqqT https://bit.ly/3D5JqqT Last year, the first set of ten young African entrepreneurs and Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3zcerZb https://bit.ly/3zcerZb HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3f0JkZP ) 20 enterprises across Africa will each receive up to $100,000 in addition to mentorship and coaching to support their climate change adaptation innovation. Panelists included Claude Migisha from the African Development Bank, Dr. Fleur Wouterse, and Aramide Abe from the Global Center of Adaptation. They shared their views on how AAAP was shaping and adding value to the Bank Digital Agriculture Flagship program, ways to accelerate investor engagement in agriculture adaptation, and how the YouthADAPT was moving the needle on entrepreneurship, unlocking finance and job creation. Gislaine Matiedje Nkenmayi from Mumita Holdings, a recipient of the 2021 YouthADAPT Challenge award, shared her experience on how the $100,000 grant transformed her enterprise. "With the grant, we were able to reach out to more than 10 cooperatives with a total of 257 smallholder farmers, to whom we offer free advisory services, low-cost greenhouses and solar-powered irrigation systems. We have been able to expand production from 100kg to 1000kg of fresh vegetables weekly," Nkenmayi said. In her concluding remarks, Edith Ofwona Adera, Principal Regional Climate Change Officer and AAAP coordinator at the Bank stressed the need to strengthen adaptation and resilience measures and expedite mainstreaming climate adaptation for transformation at scale. She called for the engagement of the private sector, given the role they can play in adapting to climate change, financing adaptation, and supporting others through products and services for resilience.

The memory of the late Nigerian environmental activist, Ken Saro-Wiwa, came alive again on Friday at COP27 in Egypt as the Oilwatch group celebrated him, 27 years after his execution. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Oilwatch group include Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF), Nigeria; Earthlife Johannesburg, Johannesburg; CAPPA, Africa; Kabetkache Women Development Centre, Nigeria and the Centre for Environmental Justice, Togo. Saro Wiwa was executed on Nov. 10, 1995, alongside eight others by the then military government as a result of environmental activism over the oil exploration in Ogoni area of the Niger Delta. Nnimmo Bassey, an Environmental Activist and the Director of HOMEF, said the spirit of the late activist lived on; and the struggle they led continued to inspire the resistance to ecological crimes by extractive companies in Nigeria and around the world. "Today, we remember Ken Saro-Wiwa and the eight Ogoni leaders who were wrongfully executed by the Nigerian state on Nov. 10, 1995. "We also call to mind the several earth and human rights defenders who have been martyred across the world by, or for, fossil fuel and mining corporations. "Blood has flown, our lands have been polluted, and the world is heating. We demand justice for our heroes. "A halt to dependence on fossil fuels -- the real climate action-- and a restoration of all polluted lands and reparation for ecocide," he said Related News Makoma Lakelakala of Earthlife on her part said, "as the world discusses the deteriorating climate concerns at the ongoing COP27 , the need to shift away from dirty energy has never been more urgent. "In honour of climate protectors whose lives were brutally cut short, the UNFCCC needs to have a clause in the negotiated climate convention that ensures protection of those upholding the rights of nature, planet and people." Celestine Akpobari, Team Leader at Peoples Advancement Centre, Nigeria, said the occasion was meant to remind the world that the situation of things in Ogoni was far worse than they were in the days of Ken Saro-Wiwa. "It has been said during this climate change conference that the world is on a speed lane to climate hell, but I want to say that Ogoni people have been there all these years," said Akpobari. He noted that the planned resumption of oil operations in Ogoniland should be halted as it was capable of provoking conflict, saying the group resisted the new scramble for African oil and gas. Emem Okon, Director, Kabetkache Women Development and Resource Centre, Nigeria, noted: "As we remember Ken Saro-Wiwa and other martyrs today, we pledge to carry on with their messages." She stressed the need for all polluted areas to be cleaned up and polluters held accountable for their ecological crimes in communities across the world. (NAN) \</doc>

Download logo A new series of country cards on climate change from Afrobarometer ( HYPERLINK http://www.Afrobarometer.org www.Afrobarometer.org Released just ahead the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), the country cards provide at-a-glance insights into Africans' awareness of climate change, their experiences with deteriorating weather conditions, and their expectations of a response to the crisis. Country cards are available for 20 African countries surveyed in the ongoing Round 9 (2021/2022) of Afrobarometer, the go-to source for reliable data on what Africans are thinking. Cards for additional countries will be released as Round 9 is completed. The cards show that significant proportions of citizens are experiencing worsening droughts and floods. While awareness of climate change varies widely across the continent, a majority of those who have heard of climate change say it is making their lives worse. Most want their governments to take immediate action to address the crisis, even if it comes at a high cost. Few citizens are satisfied with the efforts to date of governments, business and industry, developed countries, and ordinary citizens in fighting climate change, and most demand "a lot more" from these stakeholders. All the climate cards can be accessed on the Afrobarometer website's climate change country card page ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3t1tQrO https://bit.ly/3t1tQrO Highlights of Afrobarometer country cards on climate change: Majorities in eight of the 20 countries report that droughts have gotten more severe over the past decade. Large majorities see worsening drought in Madagascar (86%), Niger (72%), and Tunisia (69%).Basotho (73%), Mauritians (68%), and Nigeriens (64%) express the greatest concern about worsening floods. On average across 20 countries, only half (51%) of citizens are aware of climate change. Awareness is as high as 74% in Malawi, 73% in Mauritius, and 70% in Gabon, whereas only two in 10 Tunisians (22%) are aware of climate change. Among those who are aware of climate change:Most say it is making their lives worse. This perception is especially widespread in Madagascar (91%), Lesotho (88%), Mauritius (86%), Malawi (86%), and Benin (85%). Most citizens are not satisfied with the efforts of various stakeholders in fighting climate change and its effects, and demand "a lot more" from their governments, business and industry, developed countries, and ordinary citizens. Afrobarometer surveys Afrobarometer is a pan-African, non-partisan survey research network that provides reliable data on African experiences and evaluations of democracy, governance, and quality of life. It aims to share and amplify ordinary African citizens' views to ensure their voices inform policy- and decision-making processes that affect their lives.

Some fear that this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference - to be held at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, from 6 to 18 November - will be an unintended casualty of the geopolitical tensions and economic problems the world is facing. I believe the opposite: COP27 represents a unique and timely opportunity for the world to come together, recognise our common interests and restore multilateral cooperation. The human cost of climate change is making headlines almost daily. Global warming is no longer a distant or theoretical threat, but an immediate material one - a phenomenon that affects each of us, our families, and our neighbours. No society has been left unscathed by more frequent and intense droughts, wildfires, storms, and floods. Millions of people are already battling for survival. And that is with temperatures having risen by just 1.1\'b0C, relative to pre-industrial levels. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has made clear, every additional tenth of a degree makes matters worse. But there is reason for hope. In my discussions with delegations around the world, I see their determination to make COP27 a success. Already, societies are starting to act. Climate adaptation and new forms of collaboration are gaining traction, and investment in climate tech is booming. This includes new carbon-removal technologies, electric transport solutions, and renewable energies. As a result, clean-energy prices continue to fall: almost two-thirds of renewable power added in G20 countries in 2021 cost less than the cheapest coal-fired options. My country, Egypt, is on track to produce 42% of its energy from renewable resources by 2035. At the same time, civil society is devising mechanisms for holding companies and governments to account, guarding against greenwashing and ensuring a just transition. There is a new focus on restoring nature. The question for those of us who will participate in COP27 is straightforward: how can we seize the opportunity the conference offers to create a sense of common endeavour, prevent backsliding and inspire an approach based on science, trust, justice, and equity? At its heart, climate action is a bargain. Developing countries have agreed in good faith to help tackle a crisis they did not cause, on the understanding that support - particularly financial support - would be provided to complement their own efforts, which are often limited because of scarce resources and competing development needs. Nigeria's role in achieving global climate change Telegram On the mitigation front, we must move from rhetoric to action in cutting our greenhouse-gas emissions and removing carbon from our atmosphere. All countries must embrace more ambitious nationally determined contributions, and then translate those pledges into programmes. We must act now to ensure appropriate resources are available to developing countries to unlock their potential. At the same time, we must craft a transformative adaptation agenda, so that people - especially in climate-vulnerable regions - can protect themselves from the effects that are already unavoidable. The bill for this agenda must be divided fairly. To date, a disproportionate share of climate finance has been directed toward mitigation, leaving developing countries largely to fend for themselves in financing adaptation investment. But even the finance provided for mitigation is far from sufficient and has not been delivered with the appropriate instruments. In 2009, developed countries pledged to provide $100-billion annually for climate action in the developing world by 2020. This is only a small portion of the more than $5.8-trillion that is needed (up until 2030), according to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's Standing Committee on Finance. And yet this amount has not been delivered. We need an increase in the scale of finance pledges - especially for adaptation - at COP27 , compared to those made at COP26 in Glasgow. Developed countries must also honour the pledge they made last year to double adaptation finance by 2025, and they should provide the assurances needed for the Green Climate Fund's new replenishment. And the time has come to address the loss and damage suffered by countries that did not cause the climate crisis. This remains contentious, but I believe that we can approach it constructively, guided by the priorities of developing countries, for the benefit of all. A just transition must account for the needs of various regions. For example, African countries are committed in principle to adopting renewable energy and refraining from exploiting their fossil-fuel resources. But 600 million people in Africa - 43% of the continent's population - lack electricity, and about 900 million don't have clean cooking fuels. The climate-action bargain demands that this be addressed, and the continent's broader development needs be met, in sustainable ways. All of these imperatives must be pursued together, with a carefully designed package of actions, rather than through piecemeal measures. They are the pillars of a just transition. If one is missing, the entire edifice collapses. Ahead of the 2015 COP in Paris, few believed that an agreement would be reached. Yet delegates from all over the world came together, and through skill and perseverance, reached a ground breaking deal. In 2022, we face even higher hurdles, so we must work even harder to clear them. If we do, we will usher in a new age of clean energy, innovation exchange, food and water security, and greater climate justice. As daunting as this challenge is, we have no choice but to confront it. We must negotiate with one another, because there can be no negotiating with the climate. - \</doc>

Download logo Amnesty International's Secretary General Agn&egrave;s Callamard will attend the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh between 6-18 November 2022 and is available for interviews about the need to centre climate decisions in human rights and Egypt's ongoing human rights crisis. In addition to urging meaningful, coordinated, global action addressing the climate crisis, Amnesty International is calling on world leaders to publicly demonstrate their solidarity with Egypt's embattled civil society and put pressure on Egyptian authorities to end their years-long assault on human rights. Ahead of her visit, Agn&egrave;s Callamard said: COP27 is a key opportunity to reverse this course and must not be wasted in a theatre of empty promises and greenwashing. "While action on climate change will require significant planning and coordination, the negotiations must not get bogged down in technocratic details and lose sight of the human beings on the frontlines of the climate crisis. "Climate change is a human rights crisis and fulfilling all human rights, including the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association, is key to securing a rapid and just transition to zero-carbon economies and resilient societies. "No state can claim to be a credible player in addressing the climate crisis while continuing to tighten its chokehold on civil society. The Egyptian authorities have committed a litany of crimes under international law, including torture, unlawful killings and enforced disappearances. Nearly all independent and critical voices have been silenced in the country." During her time in Egypt, Agn&egrave;s Callamard will call on COP27 delegates to: Put human rights, including labour rights and the rights of Indigenous peoples, at the centre of all COP27 negotiations and decisions. Protect 1.5 by reviewing and updating 2030 emissions targets to ensure they are fully aligned with the 1.5&deg;C imperative. Commit to a rapid and equitable fossil fuel phase out rather than relying on carbon markets and carbon removal mechanisms. Create a clear plan for wealthy states to increase contributions to financing climate change mitigation and adaptation. Establish a financial facility to provide timely support and remedy to people and communities whose human rights have been violated as the result of loss and damage caused by the climate crisis. Stand in solidarity with Egyptian human rights organizations and reiterate their COP27 Petition calls to release all those arbitrarily detained and open civic space in Egypt. Amnesty International will be closely watching the Egyptian authorities' policing of protests as well as their treatment of, and any reprisals against, environmental activists and human rights defenders during and after COP27 .The organisation has sought meetings with the Egyptian authorities and requested access to prisons where thousands are being held for politically motivated reasons. Amnesty International is urging state delegates to raise human rights concerns with the Egyptian authorities in line with the demands of independent Egyptian human rights groups in this petition. Background COP27 is taking place amid concerns over the Egyptian authorities and UNFCCC' failure to accredit independent Egyptian human rights groups for COP27 . Additional barriers for the meaningful participation of a wide range of stakeholders include mandatory registration processes for access to the Green Zone, unaffordable hotel prices and increased surveillance and security checks. Authorities have ordered workers without security clearance to leave the city or observe severe restrictions on movement. The recent arrests of at least 118 individuals as of 31 October in Cairo alone in connection to calls for protests during COP27 and the proliferation of random police stops and illegal phone searches for critical content serve as a grim reminder of the pervasive repression of civil society in Egypt.

Nigerian Government has said that it was pushing for 400 billion dollars commitments from developed countries and partners on climate change to finance its Energy Transition Plan (ETP). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that implementable negotiations continues on Tuesday at Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, venue of the global conference on climate change otherwise known as COP27 . Minister of Environment, Mohammed Abdullahi, disclosed this to NAN on the sideline of the annual global event. Abdullahi, who led the Nigeria delegation to the climate change conference, said that the country expected very positive affirmative commitment when it came to funding to mitigate the challenge arising from climate change effect. 'We expect very positive affirmative commitment from partners and developed countries. We intend to push that in our discourse and engagement virtually with every party and our partners. 'It depends on which sector we are talking about. If it is ETP, we are looking at $400 billion. If it is loss and damage, we are looking much more than that because it affects the entire developing countries. 'When it comes to other specifics like our efforts in the Sahel to do with the Great Green Wall, we are looking towards 18.5 billion Euros that was pledged by President (Emmanuel) Macron (of France) under the One Planet Summit. Read Also: # COP27 The leader of the delegation, however, noted that Nigeria would not just abandon oil and gas under the global energy transition demand. 'We are not abandoning oil and gas; that is why we have the energy transition plan. The energy transition plan envisages first and foremost that fossil fuels, Nigerian gas will be transition energy between now and 2035. 'So what we are doing essentially is not just that we are abandoning our oil and gas, but we have to have a plan that considers all garments of energy available to the country.' On compensation for loss and damage arising from the climate change impact, Abdullahi explained that it was an agenda of the developing countries and not Nigeria alone. 'We are looking at loss and damage as a developing countries agenda and not Nigeria alone. What is happening in most part of developing countries is an outcome of industrialisation, and the use negatively of the industrial priorities at the detriment of African country as well as the developing. 'So we are saying loss and damage, they should bear the quantum of this damage we are going through. They should bear the financial burden so that they can mitigate what we are going through. 'So we are looking at between $500 billion to $1 trillion to support developing countries to face the challenges of loss and damage. 'So this recent flooding you see in Nigeria and other parts of the continent is as a result of the activities that are not related to any African countries,' he said. \</doc>

Godwin Oritse Lagos - A group of African negotiators have decried the fact that developed nations are not just leaving Africa behind in the Global Goal for Adaptation to Climate Change, they are also flying too far away from their own commitments. In a statement released a few hours to end of negotiations at the ongoing 27th Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) otherwise known as COP 27 African Group of negotiators expressed fear that developed nations will reignite some of their decommissioned coal plants as the world reels in new energy crisis triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Climate finance Reacting to the development, Alioune Ndoye, the President of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) who is also Minister of the Environment, Sustainable Development and Ecological Transition of Senegal while speaking to the press on behalf of the Chair of the African Group of negotiators said the situation will mean more devastations for Africans and their environment.  That means more devastation for Africa. We now understand that some of the commitments are not being met because of geopolitical reasons. Because we believe the developed countries have the means for adaptation. Some of our Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) need support, Ndoye said. The group has indicated that developed countries are backtracking on their own commitments on the global adaption goal of providing USD 100 billion for adaptation per year for developing countries by 2020. The facility remains on paper with no actual delivery. Ndoye says real progress for Africa from COP27 is in  the implementation of the several commitments that have been agreed on adaptation finance, mitigation, loss and damage, Finance and mitigation ambitions. The world is working with 70 percent chance of limiting the net global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius if and only if all the updated nationally determined contributions are fully implemented. The African group says without financing, planet earth risks being left with 40 percent chance, and effectively putting the temperature rise to about 2.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial era (1850 -1900). COP27 Recall that on Tuesday, the African group addressed the Media stating that they are very concerned about the  lack of progress on various issues of importance to the group particularly on finance, adaptation and loss and damage. The group stated that with few days left to the end of COP27 , the Continent is walking a tight rope to reach consensus on adaptation, loss and damage, mitigation and means of implementation.  We note that intensive technical work was undertaken throughout the year and last week on the Global Goal on Adaptation. We call on all Parties to work constructively for reaching an agreement on a framework to enable the achieving and assessing progress towards the Global Goal on Adaptation. The statement read to the press states. The Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that Africa will be impacted more than any other continent despite the continent only contributing less than 4% of the world's total emissions. The report estimates that adaptation costs in developing countries will reach $127 billion, and Africa needs up to $86.5 billion annually by 2030. In a continent that is already food insecure, Africa has suffered a 34% decline in food production and loss & damage to agricultural productivity, according to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change (IPCC) otherwise known as the IPCC AR6. It is now a matter of hours for Africa to find out whether COP27 has delivered on the key thematic areas by increasing ambitions from the developed nations. Firing Up Coal Power Plants Alioune Ndoye says  this is why the African Group is urging the developed countries to move quickly to renewable energy. They have the means and the technical capacity. And they must also come to Africa for the Continent to effectively contribute to the 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature goal. Engr. Collins Nzovu, the Zambian Minister of Green Economy and Environment told the press that  we expect COP-27 to result in tangible outcomes which reflect people's aspirations, including Africa's special needs and special circumstances. Earlier, the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), Africa's main Civil Society Coalition stated that the first week of talks ended up in frustrations without tangible outcome for Africa following the dropping of the agenda on the  Continent's Special Needs and Circumstances. PACJA executive director, Dr. Mithika Mwenda, urged the Africa negotiators at COP27 not to relent in putting forward Africa's interests because according to him,  this is a fight for our livelihoods and for our lives. Later that week, Kenya's President William Ruto, who attended the Conference of Parties as his first as head of state, spoke on behalf of Africa calling on the West \- widely considered the most responsible for the highest greenhouse gas emissions to act right and pay up. In the background, Kenya then signed a deal related to green energy with the UK of about KES500 billion. SweetCrude Reports 2022. \</doc>

Nigeria, Oct. 5 -- Egypt's ambassador to Nigeria, Ihab Awab, in an interview with PREMIUM TIMES, said Africa will prioritise its development and growth aspirations at the upcoming United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, otherwise known as COP27 . COP27 is scheduled to take place in Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt from 6 to 18 November. It will usher in Egypt's presidency of COP, taking over from the UK. According to Mr Awab, Africa is a developing continent which contributes the least (three per cent) to global carbon emission and should not be made to bear the same burden as continents that contribute the most. Africa is among the worst hit by the effects of climate change in the world today, exacerbated by existing infrastructural deficits. A report by Mo Ibrahim Foundation, a public governance think-tank in Africa, revealed that about 40 million additional people in sub-Saharan Africa could be pushed into extreme poverty by 2030 due to climate change. It said the ten most climate-vulnerable countries globally are in Africa. Mr Awab noted that the conference would create an avenue to bring Africa's voice to the forefront of the discussions on what can be done to combat the impact of climate change, especially because "the whole narrative around climate change has been developed outside Africa." "Africa's voice needs to be very clear that we are all in the same boat and it is essential for there to be joint effort to combat climate change. But at the same time, we have our development aspirations and this is something I believe the Egyptian presidency during its Pre-COP consultations within Africa and with the rest of the world has been very clear about," the ambassador added. Egypt sees the COP27 as the implementation conference, he said. Many of the pledges made in previous conferences regarding support to developing countries, especially in Africa, are yet to materialise. "The aspect of financing some of the projects is a key priority for the incoming Egyptian presidency of COP27 and it is something that all African countries agree that COP27 should and must actually come out with practical actions. There are competing priorities for finance all over the world. "If we are serious about combating climate change and also equally serious about achieving the SDGs then this is the conference and this is the kind of discussion that needs to take place in Sharm El Sheikh." So far, the continent has only received $18.3 billion annually, leaving a financing gap of $108 billion. With this, experts say, the continent may never achieve its NDCs. Speaking about the role of the media, especially media in Africa, Mr Awab said the media plays a major role in putting forward the accountability dimension of what can be achieved whether in Sharm El Sheikh or in the following conferences. "I think this is where the media can be able to highlight the ending poverty, combating climate change and how they should not be in conflict and what that really means for human commitments." He added that Egypt is working with big economies in Africa to mobilise and synergise efforts. "It is very important that countries such as Nigeria, Egypt, Kenya, Senegal, Morocco, Algeria and many of the big economies in Africa are able to really mobilise within their respective subregions but also to be able to speak with one and to be very vocal about the priorities of Arica," Mr Awab said.

Nigeria, Oct. 27 -- A new report from the United Nations Climate Change secretariat has indicated that the current commitments will still increase emissions by 10.6 per cent by 2030, and will spell doom for humanity if more efforts are not made by the concerned parties. When compared to 2010 levels, the report, however, noted that the current pledges constitute an improvement over 2021 assessment, but are still not enough to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. The new commitments, it says, have shown that countries were on a path to increase emissions by 13.7 per cent by 2030, compared to 2010 levels, which it noted were higher. Titled: "Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement," the report has shown that the combined climate pledges of 193 Parties under the Paris Agreement could put the world on track for around 2.5 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century. In a 2021 analysis, it showed that projected emissions would continue to increase beyond 2030 but this year's analysis shows that while emissions are no longer increasing after 2030, they are still not demonstrating the rapid downward trend science says is necessary this decade. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 2018 report had indicated that Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions needed to be cut 45 per cent by 2030, compared to 2010 levels. The latest science from the IPCC released earlier this year uses 2019 as a baseline, indicating that greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut 43 per cent by 2030. This, the report noted, is critical to meeting the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of this century and avoiding the worst impacts of climate change, including more frequent and severe droughts, heatwaves and rainfall. "The downward trend in emissions expected by 2030 shows that nations have made some progress this year," said Simon Stiell, Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change, who added that; "But the science is clear and so are our climate goals under the Paris Agreement. We are still nowhere near the scale and pace of emission reductions required to put us on track toward a 1.5 degrees Celsius world. "To keep this goal alive, national governments need to strengthen their climate action plans now and implement them in the next eight years." UN Climate Change analysed the climate action plans - known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) - of 193 Parties to the Paris Agreement, including 24 updated or new NDCs submitted after the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26) up until 23 September 2022. Taken together, the plans cover 94.9 per cent of total global greenhouse gas emissions in 2019. "At the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow last year, all countries agreed to revisit and strengthen their climate plans," said Mr Stiell, adding; "The fact that only 24 new or updated climate plans were submitted since COP 26 is disappointing. Government decisions and actions must reflect the level of urgency, the gravity of the threats we are facing, and the shortness of the time we have remaining to avoid the devastating consequences of runaway climate change." This is UN Climate Change's second such report, providing a critical update to last year's inaugural NDC synthesis report. While the overall findings of the report are stark, there are said to be glimmers of hope. The report indicated that these countries' greenhouse gas emissions could be roughly 68 per cent lower in 2050 than in 2019, if all the long-term strategies are fully implemented on time. Current long-term strategies (representing 62 Parties to the Paris Agreement) account for 83 per cent of the world's GDP, 47 per cent of the global population in 2019, and around 69 per cent of total energy consumption in 2019. This is a strong signal that the world is starting to aim for net-zero emissions. The report notes, however, that many net-zero targets remain uncertain and postpone into the future critical action that needs to take place now. Ambitious climate action before 2030 is said to be urgently needed to achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. With the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) just around the corner, Mr Stiell called on governments to revisit their climate plans and make them stronger, in order to close the gap between where emissions are heading and where science indicates they should be this decade. " COP27 The UN official urged national governments to come to COP27 to show how they will put the Paris Agreement to work in their home countries through legislation, policies and programmes, as well as how they will cooperate and provide support for implementation. He also called for nations to make progress at COP27 in four priority areas: mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, and finance. " COP27 COP27 President-Designate. The minister added; "The report from UN Climate Change and before that from the IPCC is a timely reminder for all of us. Raising ambition and urgent implementation is indispensable for addressing the climate crisis. This includes cutting and removing emissions faster and at a wider scope of economic sectors, to protect us from more severe adverse climate impacts and devastating loss and damage." "The synthesis report is a testimony to the fact that we are off-track on achieving the Paris Climate Goal and keeping the 1.5 degrees within reach," added Mr Shoukry. "This is a sobering moment, and we are in a race against time. Several of those who are expected to do more, are far from doing enough, and the consequences of this are affecting lives and livelihoods across the globe. I am conscious that it is and should be a continuum of action until 2030 then 2050, however, these alarming findings merit a transformative response at COP27 ." COP27 ." COP27 ) will take place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, from 6 to 18 November. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Premium Times.

The UK Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly, has said at least four million Nigerians will benefit from the \Â£395m Propcom+ investment aimed at increasing productivity and adapting to the effects of climate change while at the same time reducing emissions. Cleverly, revealed this at the COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. In a statement made available by the British High Commission on Tuesday, the new \Â£395m Propcom+ programme is set to help address key barriers to sustainable agricultural development in Nigeria. It would support the development of climate-resilient agricultural policies, actions, and investments that deliver nutrition, increase productivity, adapt and build resilience while reducing emissions, and protect and restore natural ecosystems. According to the statement, the new Propcom+ programme involves supporting inclusive and resilient growth by promoting the progressive transformation of Nigeria's rural economy. It stated, "The new programme will build the capacity of small-scale farmers and rural communities in climate-smart agriculture. It will work with Nigeria's vibrant private sector on agriculture to increase productivity, improve nutrition and food security, enhance climate resilience, pursue lower emissions, and halt and reverse biodiversity loss, as well as helping to tackle some of Nigeria's underlying drivers of conflict and insecurity." Cleverly said, "The Glasgow Climate Pact gave the world the tools to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees and build a secure and sustainable future. Now is the time for all countries to step up their action on climate change and deliver the tangible change needed. The UK will continue to play a leading role in this mission. The funding we have announced will support countries that are facing the devastating impact of climate change, to adapt effectively." UK Deputy High Commissioner in Lagos, Nigeria, Ben Llewellyn-Jones said Nigeria is vulnerable to climate change. Llewellyn, however, noted that the UK is committed to supporting climate resilient growth in Nigeria. \</doc>

This year's Africa Climate Week (ACW 2022) ended last weekend in Libreville, Gabon, having helped build important regional momentum in the fight against climate change ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference COP27 in Egypt in November. According to a statement by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the event brought together more than 2,300 participants from governments, multilateral organizations, the private sector and civil society in person, with many more joining the over 200 individual sessions virtually. The meeting explored two key themes that are critical for Africa and indeed the world - striving for a global average temperature rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius and attaining a resilient future. The opening session featured a ministerial dialogue on the challenges of mobilizing and accessing climate finance at scale to spur the implementation of countries' Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and priority national climate plans and strategies. According to the African Development Bank, Africa will need as much as $1.6 trillion between 2020-2030 to implement its climate action commitments and NDCs. Egypt's Foreign Minister and COP27 President-Designate, Sameh Shoukry, said: 'The discussions at Africa Climate Week have reiterated the need to further accelerate climate action on all fronts, namely in adaptation, loss and damage, climate finance, and adopting more ambitious mitigation measures to keep the 1.5-degree target within reach. The geopolitical realities and energy crisis confronting the world have opened the door for backtracking on climate commitments and we must do everything to ensure this does not happen. COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh will strive to continue the vital dialogue needed to move from ambition to action. Working with all parties to deliver implementation that will see a just and managed transition to a new and sustainable economic model to save lives and livelihoods.' Lee White, Gabon's Minister of Water, Forests, the Sea, and Environment, said: 'Here in Libreville, we have truly seen the powerful potential of regional collaboration to create credible and durable responses to climate change. As we head towards COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in just a few weeks' time, regional collaboration needs to be stronger than ever. COP27 must be the implementation COP, where we show how the Paris Agreement will be achieved through policies and programmes, through innovation and transformation.' \</doc>

As the actual negotiations begin this week at the 27th Session of the Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh, a civil society organisation, Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA) and a host of climate justice groups, have shared their recommendations with African delegations at the negotiations including Nigeria and Cameroon. This is in continuation of efforts to align the climate ambitions of African countries with the demands of frontline communities. Other groups that shared their reports include Gender CC South Africa, Friends of the Earth Togo, Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN), ONG 350 Cote d' Ivoire, Connected Advocacy, the Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF), and US-based Corporate Accountability among others. In a statement, Philip Jakpor, Director of Programmes at CAPPA, said that the reports include 'Impacts of Climate Change in Frontline Communities in Africa: Case Study of Nigeria, Cameroon, Togo, and South Africa', 'Assessing Climate Change, COP26 Commitments in Africa: Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda', and an 'African brief on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.' He said, 'Impacts of Climate Change in Frontline Communities in Africa: Case Study of Nigeria, Cameroon, Togo, and South Africa was written by CAPPA, Friends of the Earth Togo, Africa Centre for Advocacy (ACA) and Gender CC South Africa. 'The Assessing Climate Change, COP27 Commitments in Africa: Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda report was written by the Africa Institute for Energy Governance (AFIEGO) in Uganda, the South Africa Climate Action Network (SACAN) and CAPPA, while the African brief on Article 6 written by CAPPA and the Corporate Accountability Africa Regional Director, Neima Hellen.' Delegations that received the reports are those from Nigeria, South Africa, Cote d \'cdvoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Economic Community of West Africa (ECOWAS). Togo, Namibia, and Uganda. The African Union (AU) representatives also received the reports. Jakpor explained that the thrust of the research which culminated in the reports is to get those who can advance policy recommendations to address the climate crisis in Africa the requisite resources and facts that can aid their work at the COP27 . The climate activist added that 'In the recommendations, CAPPA and its allies are demanding that African governments leverage green economic opportunities including increased demand for electric vehicles, solar panels, batteries, and so on, which are produced with critical minerals some of which are sourced from Africa. This puts Africa at a vantage point to renegotiate its position on the global stage while stimulating inclusive economic growth. 'They are also encouraged to remove barriers to renewable energy technologies in Africa such as import tariffs to make renewable energy accessible and affordable to most of the energy-poor African population. 'They must also withdraw support for heavy-carbon projects such as the Dangote refineries and petrochemicals and Uganda's East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) which will lock Africa into a fossil fuel trap, among others. 'The reports also demand that Big Polluters and countries of the Global North pay the debt owed to developing countries and commit to no further infractions by cutting emissions at source.' \</doc>

GE Power has signed a framework agreement with the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) at recent climate talks - COP27 in Egypt to support climate change and energy security. The agreement was signed by Francesco La Camera, director-general, IRENA, and Roger Martella, chief sustainability officer of GE. Through this collaboration, GE and IRENA have agreed to cooperate across several specific pillars including decarbonization, thought leadership, adoption and sustainable use of all forms of renewable energy. According to a statement, COP27 provides the right context and platform for the agreement to move forward. Francesco said: 'Any near-term shortfall in action will further reduce the chance of keeping 1.5\'b0C within reach. 'We are acutely aware that scaling up renewable energy investments and decarbonization technologies is more important today than ever.' According to IRENA's director-general, IRENA's collaboration with GE underlines how partnerships within the industry can - and must - serve our mission of supporting countries in their transition to a sustainable energy future. Private sector adoption of clean energy key to climate targets - PPC 'Together with forward-looking multinationals such as GE, we hope to accelerate progress and fuel global ambitions to achieve net zero,' he said. For Roger, GE knows that partnership is critical to solving climate change and energy security. 'We are thus honoured to partner with IRENA as a key stakeholder to achieve the shared goal of a just and ambitious energy transition,' he said. 'As a company whose equipment helps generate one-third of the world's electricity, GE is rising to the challenge of innovating technology to decarbonize the energy sector while making energy more reliable, affordable, and sustainable for the 750 million people who lack access.' Geoffrey Pyatt, the US department of state's bureau of energy resources assistant secretary, said: 'The US strongly supports private sector-led industrial decarbonization efforts, and we look forward to working closely with GE and other cutting edge industry players to advance these initiatives.' Following the signing of the agreement, GE and IRENA will explore how to jointly support decarbonization efforts in critical markets and sectors, including onshore and offshore wind, bio-energy with CCUS, hydro, green hydrogen, energy storage, electrification, and the latest grid modernization technologies. Also, the organisations plan to collaborate on identifying thought leadership, events, and knowledge exchange opportunities with strategic stakeholders and partners to promote the continued growth of the renewables sector. Speaking on the agreement, Mohammed Mijindadi, President, of GE Nigeria said 'This agreement is a welcome development for Nigeria with its ambition to diversify the nation's energy mix. 'GE's Renewable Energy business is providing technology and services that can help enhance the country's renewable energy generating capacity, improve and optimize the grid infrastructure, as well as leverage its advanced digital service offerings for cutting edge transformation.' According to the statement, the partners will also consider technical cooperation, exploring collaboration on technical solutions and capacity-building that support regional and country-level stakeholders. 'This agreement demonstrates GE and IRENA's commitment to achieving climate change goals while focusing on the three pillars of the energy trilemma -reliability, sustainability, and affordability,' the statement said. \</doc>

The World Bank's Global Director for Climate Change, Jennifer Sara, has said that the World Bank is indifferent about ownership of the water supply infrastructure in any country it deals with as long as it is clean, safe and delivered Â£t an affordable price.' She said this while interacting with journalists at an interview session on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Sara was responding to a question about whether the World Bank has a hand in the recurring Water Resources Bill currently before the National Assembly. The bill among other provisions seeks to privatise water. The bill has passed first reading at the House of Representatives. The bill has been introduced three times in five years: in 2017, 2020 and in 2022. The latest introduction was done by Honourable Sada Soli, a member of the House of Representatives from Katsina State. On July 26, 2022 the Nigerian Governors Forum in a statement signed by Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti stated that the re-introduced bill 'does not adequately address the interests of the states and is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.' Nigerian civil society members and unions have alleged that World Bank is in support of the Water Bill and subsequent water privatisation in the country. Philip Jakpor of Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA), said: 'The bill has the fingerprints of the World Bank all over it. It wants to ensure that national legislation opens the door for public-private partnerships. 'The most insulting part of the whole process is that there is no room for citizens to be part of the process, from its formulation to debate. It was shrouded in secrecy. It's unacceptable in a democracy.' The Brettonwoods Project in a March 2021 report states that Â£s early as 2014, a $495 million World Bank-funded irrigation project called for 'movement toward a National Water Resources Bill' as a 'demonstration of borrower commitment.' The Bank's June 2019 Systematic Country Diagnostic for Nigeria also pushed for the bill to be given greater priority.' A report by The Guardian of UK in January 2015, stated that the International Finance Corporation (IFC) 'the private arm of the World Bank, which has lent more than $75bn for water and sanitation projects around the world since 1995, has been in secret talks for more than a year with the city's private water company (Lagos State Water Corporation) about funding another possible private-public partnership (PPP) scheme.' Responding to the question on World Bank's involvement in water, Sara said, 'Now on water privatisation: We are completely agnostic. If it's publicly delivered, privately delivered, all we want is that water is delivered to people clean, safe water at an affordable price, that you have a utility functions, that's autonomous that is not manipulated by political will. 'You have a tariff for those who can pay pay the right amount, and a social tariff for those who can't afford it. 'So you need really well functioning credit worth utilities, and you need a government who gives a regulation and oversees it, because water is a monopoly. It is a public monopoly, because you can have so many different providers in the same place. 'So, what's important is if government decides we're going to do it through private sector, public sector, but it has to be an oversight. If the provider is public or private, again, we don't care, because the most important thing is that you deliver services efficiently. Now, there's some very good examples of private operators, especially in West Africa, I mentioned like Benin, Niger and Senegal. It's not that this is privatised, but there's a concession with the private provider, because they're doing it more efficiently than government.'

By Vivian Emoni The Federal Government on Friday inaugurated COP27 National Logo and listed top expectations and priorities to achieve from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Minister of Environment, Mr Mohammed Abdullahi, inaugurated the Logo while briefing newsmen in Abuja, on the preparation for 27th session Conference of Parties ( COP27 ). Abdullahi said that the conference would be hosted in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, from Nov. 6 to 18, 2022, adding that Nigeria as a signatory is expected to actively participate. He said that the inauguration of the Logo represented alignment with ideals and objectives of COP27 but distinctively projecting national priorities as a country. He said that the COP27 was a rare opportunity for parties and observers to come together and grapple with a challenge that is impacting humanity. He said that the conference is also to showcase unity against an existential threat that can only overcome through concerted action and effective implementation. The minister said that the top priorities and expectations by Nigeria from the conference include the provision of National Pavilion at the COP27 venue. He said that the pavilion would serve as a base for hosting all activities by the Nigerian delegation during the conference to hold bilateral meetings. He said that it would as well provide a place for networking with potential investors and related opportunities for Nigerians. According to him, arrangements to host side events at the Nigeria pavilion by interested stakeholders are being processed. "The side events to be hosted in the pavilion will relate to showcasing Nigeria's best practices and exchanges with international communities. "The side events will also engage on dialogues and green investment forums toward tackling climate change and moving Nigeria to a low carbon development pathway. "Nigeria will participate in a world leader-level summit with other nations to co-launch the 'Forest and Climate Leaders Partnership." Abdullahi said that the leader's partnership is being championed by the UK government through Alok Sharma, the President of COP26. He said that Nigeria would, under the auspices of UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), host a high-level side meeting. He said that the meeting is a follow up to President Muhammadu Buhari's session at the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) (COP15) conference in Abidjan in May 2022. He said that the meeting expected to draw notable global leaders and funding from development partners to focus on climate finance to address desert encroachment, desertification and drought devastating member states, "as well as exploit the funding window under the auspices of the Great Green Wall Accelerator, where European countries pledged about 18 billion euros to support activities of member states. "Nigeria will continue to push for a softening of conditions as it relates to access and draw-down from the fund to make it accessible to member states," he said. Abdullahi said that the priorities and expected outcome would also focus on exploring options for climate finance and building partnerships to drive emissions reduction ambitions, adaptation and climate change mitigation. According to him, the focus will be on sustainable funding mechanism that drives nature-based solutions such as land restoration, reforestation, combating desertification, climate smart-agricultural practices and adaptation strategies. He said that Nigeria would seek collaboration and support on sustainable waste management, renewable and clean energy provision, and finance for loss and damage. He added that Nigeria will push for developed countries to fulfill financial pledges to aid in tackling the climate crisis. "The expected outcomes of Nigeria's participation will include increased partnership building that help Nigeria achieve its emission reduction targets. "They will address adaptation and mitigation, establish sustainable financing for climate actions, resilience building, poverty eradication, energy transition and sustainable development. "Nigeria, will not take a position of 'know it all' but will align with the West Africa region's identification of the thematic issues faced by the continent and the group's interim position on each. Abdullahi said that the issues includes doubling adaptation finance by 2025; clarification on the support arrangements to address loss and damage; closing the climate financing gap; scaling up Africa's mitigation ambition and implementation. He added; "strengthening the linkage between technology and financial mechanisms; the global stock take on progress on the Paris Agreement; transparency; gender and climate change; agriculture." The minister said that the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management would hold a side meeting to showcase the impact of climate change on migration and livelihoods of the people affected by conflict, including people that lost agrarian habitat around the Lake Chad Region and the arid landscape of the Northern Nigeria, coastal flood and erosion in the southern part of the country". He said that accreditation of Nigerian delegates to the event has also been concluded. According to him, delegates include, representations from the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (ICCC), high-level representation from the Presidency and National Assembly, as well as non-governmental groups, ministries, scientists, academia, experts, Civil Society Organisations, private sector entities, women, youths and the media," he said.

With just two months to the commencement of the 27th edition of the Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) - the supreme decision-making forum of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) - Nigeria has continued to grapple with a plethora of challenges on addressing climate change crises in tandem with its final report of the updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) submitted to the UNFCCC on July 30, 2021. In Nigeria's updated NDC, the government proposed to mitigate four greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), as against the three GHG (CO2, CH4 and N2O) proposed in the previous NDC submitted. Observers have continued to watch with mixed feelings how Nigeria has struggled with implementation of the Climate Change Bill President Muhammadu Buhari signed into law on November 17, 2021. The Climate Change Bill sponsor, Chairman, House Committee on Climate Change, Sam Onuigbo, falls among those who have called for implementation of the Act despite moves for amendment. Onuigbo noted it forms part of Nigeria's COP27 priorities. The Act which followed Buhari's proclamation on November 2, 2021 at COP26 that Nigeria will attain net zero GHG emissions by 2060, offers a clear path if implemented with its provision for carbon budgeting and a National Action Plan to enforce the carbon budgets. Notably among the growing concerns include Chairman, Steering Committee of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Associations (REEEA) Alliance, Dr. Immamudeen Talba, who recently reckoned the need to properly coordinate the laws and policies ahead of COP27 holding in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, between 6 to 18 November, 2022. The energy expert stressed that the Climate Change Act, the energy transition policy, the Nigerian energy efficiency policy, the national renewable energy policy and other instruments should be properly synergised. He spoke at a forum where stakeholders in the Nigerian renewable energy sub sector moved to harmonise the divergent policies in the ministries, departments and parastatals of government in view of the renewed discussions on the impending transition to cleaner fuels. 'We want to harmonise all these commitments and come up with a framework and we want to see a situation where Nigeria goes back to the COP27 coming up in Egypt, with a presentation on what it has achieved vis-\'e0-vis the commitments,' he noted. 'At the end of the day, there will be no delivery because there's no target or goals. You see that nothing has been achieved but money has been spent. That's why the alliance decided that there's the need to carry everybody along,' he pointed out. To buttress Talba's concern about data, Climate Action Tracker (CAT)'s study found that Nigeria set a net-zero target between 2050-2070 but did not provide information on the target's emission coverage, its intention to cover international aviation and shipping, and its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net-zero target. On the architecture target, the study noted: 'Nigeria provides no information on its intention to communicate separate emission reduction and removal targets. It is also not its intention to establish a review cycle for its net-zero and intermediate targets.' On transparency, the research shows that Nigeria provided no information on its intention to communicate transparent assumptions on domestic carbon dioxide removals to meet its net-zero target. Taking about seven months to approve the appointment of Dr. Salisu Mohammed Dahiru as Pioneer Director General and Chief Executive Officer of the National Council on Climate Change (NCCC) does not in any way convince observers that Nigeria is set to achieve its net-zero emissions target. According to a press release signed by Saghir el Mohammed, Director, Press Federal Ministry of Environment, the appointment took effect from 25th July, 2022. Dahiru will lead NCCC to implement policies and projects toward mitigating the impact of life-threatening climate change crises on Nigerians. Nigeria, seen as the giant of Africa cannot afford to take the back seat in the scheme of things. It must lead the charge as expectations continue to grow that African countries' exposure to some of the most severe impacts of climate change will be front and centre of the discussions at COP27 . \</doc>

Nigeria, Nov. 6 -- President of the 27th edition of the United Nations Conference of Parties ( COP27 ), Sameh Shoukry, has said that this year's deliberations on climate issues must consider the needs of developing countries (Africa) because they are least responsible for emissions and are the most affected by the global impact of climate change. Mr Shoukry made this statement while delivering his remarks after he was elected as the COP27 President by the Parties at the opening plenary in Egypt on Sunday. "As a COP hosted in Africa, it must consider the needs of the developing countries and ensure climate justice through availing the appropriate finance and other means of implementation, as countries that are the least responsible for emissions are the most affected by climate change," Mr Shoukry said. He emphasised that despite the challenging economic and geopolitical factors, external circumstances should not be allowed to negatively affect the negotiating process. The COP27 president called on countries to show faith in multilateralism over the next two weeks as they negotiate to deliver on the goals of the Climate Convention and the Paris Agreement. The COP is the supreme decision-making body of the convention. All States that are parties to the convention are represented at the COP, during which they review the implementation of the convention and any other legal instruments that the COP adopts. At this year's conference being held at Sharm-El-Sheikh, Egypt, more than 50,000 attendees are registered so far, organisers said, representing the largest in terms of attendees recorded in the history of the conference. The attendees are expected to participate in the plenary's Blue Zone and thousands of others at the Green Zone. At the meeting, the parties will take decisions necessary to promote the effective implementation of the convention, including institutional and administrative arrangements to transform climate negotiations into actions. With 198 parties, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has near universal membership and is the parent treaty of the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement. According to the UNFCCC, the main aim of the Paris Agreement is to keep a global average temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius and to drive efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Speaking about challenges, the COP President said: "It comes as no surprise to anyone that the COP is being held this year in a world which is witnessing political turmoil that cast a long shadow on all our nations and has resulted in energy and food crises." However, he noted that these challenges should be no reason for delaying global efforts to fight climate change. "It is inherent on us all in Sharm El Sheikh to demonstrate our recognition of the magnitude of the challenges we face and our steadfast resolve to overcome it," Mr Shoukry said. In his remarks, Mr Shoukry's predecessor, Alok Sharma, said parties must be clear in their action towards meeting their NDC targets. "We must be clear, as challenging as our current moment is, inaction is myopic and can cause climate catastrophe. We must find the ability to focus on one thing at once," Mr Sharma said. He said having more "Wake Up Calls" is what the world leaders need to plan effectively to mitigate Pakistan's underwater, the worst flooding in Nigeria in a decade, the worst drought in 500 years in Europe, and other climate-related issues in China and other parts of the world.

Nigeria, Nov. 15 -- The second week of conversation at the ongoing Conference of Parties on climate change started on Monday with over 40,000 people from around the world and over 100 global leaders displaying their plans on how to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees and aim for 1.5 degrees. COP started last week with the world leaders summit on Monday and Tuesday. After two days of roundtables and country statements, more than 100 heads of state raised their voice by pledging commitments to support the world's vulnerable communities. Six roundtables were convened to address the most pertinent climate challenges, including food, water, and energy security, as well as innovative finance mechanisms for climate and development. Afterwards, as with previous COPs, the remaining days featured discussions on various themes such as finance, science, youth and future generations, decarbonisation, adaptation and agriculture, gender, water, civil society, energy, biodiversity and solutions. Monday ushered in new rounds of negotiations by country negotiators in a bid to finalise a workable communique that would shape climate actions before the next COP in 2023. The programme schedule has water and gender as the talking point for Monday. This included side events and panel discussions on the role of women in dealing with all aspects of the climate change challenge. This day will bring together women leading climate at global, regional, country and local community levels to discuss matters of gender within the climate agenda. The day was also scheduled to feature a discussion on the climate impacts on water and the linkages to wider, cross-cutting impacts on development and livelihoods. Tuesday, however, will be Civil Society and Energy Day. Civil Society is an indispensable partner in the global effort to combat climate change, and as a result, CoP27 has set out Tuesday to engage Civil Societies and to ensure their views and perspectives are integrated in a meaningful manner. Participants will have a platform for sharing best practices and identifying challenges, as well as networking and developing multi-stakeholder partnership opportunities, it will showcase the role and contribution of civil society in this area and across the board in different forms of climate action and policy response. The Energy Day would deal with all aspects of energy and climate change, including renewable energy and energy transformation, with a specific focus on just transition in the energy sector, and green hydrogen as a potential energy source for the future. On Wednesday, Biodiversity will take the centre stage. The day will feature discussions about the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and the means to mobilise global actions towards the challenges to halt biodiversity loss and reduce the impacts of climate change and pollution. The discussions would also include the impacts of climate change on oceans, endangered species, coral reefs, the sustainability of protected areas to deliver ecosystem services to human, impacts of plastic waste on the aquatic ecosystems and species, ecosystem-based solutions and their link to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Thursday will be Solutions day - a day to discuss possible solutions for the broad array of climate change challenges that range from holistic, cross-cutting solutions such as the greening of national budgets, sustainable cities, multilevel action and sustainable transport, to sectoral solutions like waste management, alternatives to plastic and green building. More specific solutions emanating from the private sector and start-ups bringing creativity and innovation to the effort to deal with climate change will be appraised. Final negotiations will take the main engagement on Friday where it is expected that COP27 , the "implementation COP" will produce a clear implementation framework that will guide the world to deliver on the goals of the Climate Convention and the Paris Agreement.Monday ushered in new rounds of negotiations in a bid to finalise a workable communique that would shape climate actions before the next COP in 2023.

Despite positive progress at COP26, current country pledges and commitments, even if fully implemented, still do not put the world on a trajectory to limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C. If the world is to have even a 50 percent chance of meeting that objective, COP27 must act as a catalyst to turn broad national commitments into specific actions and pave the way to more forceful measures to phase-out coal and end deforestation, according to a new report by the Energy Transitions Commission (ETC). The report stated that the economic and political situation ahead of COP27 is highly challenging, in addition to lingering pressures resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions. According to the report, the world now faces record energy and high food prices in many regions resulting from the war in Ukraine, stating that together these are leading to high inflation, lower growth, and risks of recession in many countries. Speaking on the report, Adair Turner, chair of the Energy Transitions Commission, said despite the current global economic and political challenges, we must keep focused on the global crises presented by climate change. Every 0.1 \'b0C rise above 1.5\'b0C will have a hugely significant impact. 'Many of the actions needed to build greater energy security could also drive a faster transition to a more resilient and stable low-carbon economy. Both full implementation of COP26 commitments and further progress at COP27 are therefore essential if the world is to have a 50-50 chance of limiting global warming', Turner said in a statement. Read also:'We and #8217;re fighting unemployment, environmental pollution through solid waste recycling, conversion' There is a danger that energy security and short-term economic pressures, together with geopolitical tensions, will divert national and international attention from climate change-related issues, said the report, however, many of the actions needed to build greater energy security could also drive a faster transition to a low-carbon economy. Despite the global geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds, there is some evidence of progress on climate commitments, it added. Keeping 1.5\'b0C on the table Some voices are challenging whether a 1.5\'b0C trajectory is still feasible. However, every 0.1\'b0C rise above 1.5\'b0C will have hugely significant climate change impacts. The world must continue to aim for this target and to ensure that any overshoot of it is as low as possible. Both full implementation of COP26 commitments and further progress at COP27 are therefore essential if the world is to have a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0C. 3 priority areas for accelerated progress Against this backdrop the ETC's new report Degree of Urgency: Accelerating Action to Keep 1.5\'b0C on the Table highlights three priority areas for accelerated progress: Closing the ambition gap More ambitious country targets, with strengthened NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions) which reflect both country-specific actions and the potential impact of sectoral commitments agreed at Glasgow and subsequently. Closing the implementation gap Targeted policies and company actions to drive further real-world progress across six critical sectors (methane, deforestation, power, road transport, heavy industry, and energy efficiency). Closing the financing gap In particular to support middle and low-income countries to peak and then reduce emissions as soon as possible; in total at least $300 billion per annum could be required to support early coal phase-out, and end deforestation, and carbon dioxide removals in a scenario where sufficient action from policy and industry isn't taken. This funding should come from corporations in voluntary carbon markets, philanthropic capital, hybrid payment, and investment instruments, and intergovernmental transfers of climate-related funding from developed to developing countries. 'The developed countries must seize the opportunity created by Lula's election, providing the financial support which can enable Brazil to end deforestation fast: this is a deal waiting to be done at COP27 , 'said Turner. Progress at COP26 but still an ambition gap Despite positive momentum at COP26, an Â£mbition gap' remains - current country pledges (NDCs) and commitments do not yet put the world on a 1.5\'b0C trajectory. The formal country pledges (NDCs) and net-zero targets coming out of COP26 put the world on a pathway to above 2\'b0C of warming. Although since then 24 countries have submitted updated NDCs, only Australia's makes a material impact on closing the emissions gap in 2030. COP26 also produced a series of sector agreements - including across deforestation, methane, and coal phase-out - by countries and private participants that, if fully realised, could put the world on a pathway towards 1.8\'b0C. However, the vast majority are yet to translate into formal country commitments, and critical agreements such as ending deforestation by 2030 are severely underfinanced. Positive developments but still an implementation gap Despite encouraging developments in policy and technology, the world is also facing an 'implementation gap' between pledged targets and on-the-ground progress. This year there has been substantial policy action in the EU, US and China which has started to bridge the implementation gap, with ambitious targets (and strong prospects for implementation) set out in the REPowerEU package, the US Inflation Reduction Act, and China's 14th Five-Year-Plan. Keeping 1.5\'b0C Alive - what can be done The world has a dwindling carbon budget of 1.5\'b0C (500 Gt from 2020, 420 Gt from the beginning of 2022), so the time to act is running out. Despite the good news on the developed country and China's commitments and implementation, the current numbers do not add up to 1.5\'b0C - under a full implementation trajectory, developed countries, China and India alone would likely overshoot the carbon budget needed to 'keep 1.5\'b0C alive'. To square the objectives of global emissions reductions and economic development needs in emerging and developing economies, it will be necessary that all countries - but in particular the developed economies and China - at the very least achieve and ideally overachieve or increase emissions reduction commitments. Doing this will drive technological progress which will reduce mitigation costs across the world. 'The ETC highlights critical actions for nations and companies if the world is to stand any chance of limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0C,' said Nigel Topping, the UN Climate Change High-Level Champion for the UK. Across all areas, ambitious policy action can lead the way, but we identify two key additional drivers of action: The need to tackle emissions from agriculture, forests, and other land-use sectors, and in particular methane emissions and CO2 emissions from deforestation which result from red meat consumption: fixing these will require either a shift in diet or technological changes such as the development of synthetic meat. And the need for a large scale-up in financing to phase-out coal, end deforestation and develop large-scale carbon dioxide removals soon. 'In the year since COP26 where national priorities have appeared to drift away from climate, a stocktake of progress on the ground reveals a mixed picture,' said Mike Hemsley, deputy director, ETC. 'Rollout of renewables and electric vehicles is rapid and rising, and there is also optimism around progress in heavy industry and progressing energy efficiency.' However, this alone is not enough and progress is urgently required in reducing methane emissions, early coal phase-out and ending deforestation.' Whilst both high-income and developing countries can do more to accelerate their own emissions reductions, two further options exist that can accelerate progress: Flows of funding in the form of investments and payments from the public and private sectors enable lower income countries to move faster than technology and policy sharing alone would enable. Faster scaling and increased contribution of negative emissions solutions alongside rapid and deep cuts to emissions, as highlighted by the ETC in a previous report. Sumant Sinha, chairman, founder and CEO of ReNew Power stated that 'It is vital that countries around the world continue to move ahead and face the global challenge of climate change together.' 'Urgent action is required to meet the dual objectives of emissions reductions and economic development needs in emerging and developing countries. Speedy deployment of zero-carbon power supported by the right policy environment is key to ensuring a real economic transition that will benefit the planet.' \</doc>

In line with changing the narrative about Africa, through strategic shifts, Catalyst 2030 held the Africa Forward event for October on Tuesday the 25th of October with a focus on climate actions and steps necessary to be taken by Africa ahead of the COP27 Conference in Egypt. Speakers at this month's session were Dr Richard Munang, Deputy Director United Nations Environment Programme in Africa; Dr Philip Osano, Centre Director of SEI Africa; and Karishma Ansaram Co-ordinator of the Finance and Market Working group at Youngco while the event was moderated by Olumide Idowu the co-founder of International Climate Change Development Initiative. Africa Forward was launched on the 11th of May, during Catalyst 2030's Catalysing Change week, with the sole purpose of rewriting the narrative about Africa. Its strategic shifts are comprised of 5 critical pillars: (1) Narrative Shift, (2) Ecosystem Development, (3) Funding, (4) Job Creation and Career Counseling and (5) Training and Capacity Development. With emphasis placed on tackling the climate narrative in Africa, Dr Philip Osano highlighted the need to invest in technological solutions, citing that "technology is a very important part of the climate narrative". He gave the example of Kenya's investment in Solar energy solutions to explain this. Describing Africa as a continent that has demonstrated global leadership in climate action, Dr Richard Munang called for an active movement to address issues of climate loss by projecting opportunities that come with addressing the losses building climate change resilience in the process. He also insisted that Africa's approach to addressing its climate concerns at COP27 has to be tailored and localized to fit each region. &lsquo;Africa's response to climate change has to be executed in the African context and not as in other regions' says Munang. According to Karishma Ansaram, &lsquo;We have identified that Africa has a gap in climate finance. Therefore, there is a need to educate the youth on how to unlock and access climate finance." She also stressed that Africa is the youngest continent and we need to leverage the young population by capacity building and empowering youths with the tools needed to unlock climate financing. The Africa Forward monthly series is intended to inspire and charge social entrepreneurs on the best ways to change the narrative about Africa. The next session holds on November 2022.

Africa Adaptation Summit outlines 5-point 'Adaptation Delivery Breakthrough' for the key UN climate conference in Egypt ( COP27 ) this November and $55 million of new funding to mobilize over $5 billion in climate adaptation action projects for Africa ROTTERDAM, Netherlands, September 6, 2022/ - African and global leaders joined the Africa Adaptation Summit at the Global Center on Adaptation, outlining the most critical elements of the global community's response to the climate crisis that heavily affects Africa as the world's most exposed region, two months ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt ( COP27 ). 'Africa is unstoppable. But Africa is ground zero for the global climate breakdown. Nobody benefits if Africa fails to tackle it. Climate fallout in Africa cannot be contained so adaptation action can and must scale at breakneck speed across the continent. The world has to double down on adaptation at the UN climate summit in Egypt just weeks away.' He added that 'We need an adaptation delivery breakthrough for Africa at COP27 . That means adaptation finance visibly flowing in Africa. It means the financial ask on wealthy nations for the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program and its Upstream Financing Facility is delivered by COP27 . If we fail, all the progress of Glasgow's COP is at risk.' The Summit's five-point Communique highlighted that Africa was at a tipping point due to being most exposed to the food crisis triggered by the Ukraine conflict as well as the frontline of the global climate breakdown. It underscored that Success at COP27 will depend on whether the needs of Africa, the world's most climate-vulnerable continent, are met, with finance flowing into key country-led adaptation programs such as the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP). Macky Sall, President of Senegal and Chairperson of the African Union said: 'You have to adapt or die. We do not have the choice. Our time to act is coming to an end. Africa must prioritize adaptation. Africa needs to invest massively in adaptation and resilience. As Chairperson of the African Union, I urge Africa's development partners to fully fund the AAAP and make it an exemplary model of what is possible when we collaborate. This impact will be enhanced through your support to the AAAP Upstream Financing Facility and the African Development Bank's Climate Action under the ADF Replenishment. The AAAP is what delivers on the vision of the Africa Adaptation Initiative.' 'COP26 marked a breakthrough thanks to your determination to put adaptation on the global agenda by doubling adaptation finance. Now, with your help, we must keep that promise. With your support, the AAAP can make this vision a reality,' concluded President Macky Sall. The Summit highlighted that Africa is warming faster than other regions. Its underlying socio-economic vulnerabilities also mean that nine out of ten of the world's most vulnerable countries are in Africa, where food expenses make up 75% of the income of the continent's poorest groups when more than a fifth of all Africans are already food insecure. The number of Africa's poorest nations at high risk of debt distress has also tripled in the past decade. President Akufo Addo of Ghana and Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) said: 'If we want Africa to thrive, we must adapt to climate change. Africa must close the adaptation financing gap. We cannot wait. I look forward to the swift implementation of the AAAP. The fate of our continent and the planet depends upon it.' President Akufo Addo also highlighted adaptation priorities for COP27 including calling for Â£ standalone implementation plan of the COP26-agree doubling of adaptation funding by 2025. It's time to turn words into deeds and ambition into action. Crucially, we expect progress and we expect to see how funds will flow into country-led programs like the AAAP.' President Felix Tshisekedi of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and co-host of the PreCOP27 said: 'We are here because we believe the AAAP is needed not just for Africa, but for the world. When Africa wins, the world wins. We cannot let Africa be held back and undermined by the climate crisis. We need partnership to forge a resilient future. With an African COP this year, we cannot miss out on a win for Africa on climate. To secure that win, we need to at minimum see the AAAP Upstream Financing Facility mobilized, positioning the AAAP to drive the full $25 billion in adaptation projects on the ground.' He added that 'our Pre-COP meeting in Kinshasa next month aims to springboard the priorities of Africa and the most vulnerable nations to center-stage at COP27 . As a part of the Pre-COP we will also host the CVF's high level Forum of Vulnerable Nations event because this is the voice that matters the most in the climate crisis.' Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Amina Mohammed, said: 'The Glasgow decision urges developed countries to collectively double adaptation funding by 2025. This must be delivered in full, as a base line. Developed countries need to provide, by COP27 , a clear roadmap of how and when they will deliver on this commitment.' The Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations also underscored that delivery on adaptation finance will be a 'litmus test' for countries honouring their end of the Glasgow Pact, and joined the call for COP27 to deliver a breakthrough on implementation for adaptation. The Summit at the GCA's floating headquarters in Rotterdam harbour announced US$55 million in new contributions from the United Kingdom ($23m), Norway ($15m), France ($10m), Denmark ($7m), among other supporters to the AAAP Upstream Financing Facility managed by the GCA, whose 1:100 leverage ratio will influence over 5 billion in climate adaptation investments across Africa. The Upstream Financing Facility was described by GCA Chair and 8th Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon as the 'transmission belt' for the best global and regional knowledge and innovation directly to large-scale investment projects in Africa. Donors announcing new funding commitments to the AAAP Upstream Financing Facility at the Summit further commented, as follows: President of COP26 Alok Sharma: 'COP26 was an important milestone for adaptation, but we have to pick up the pace and turn commitments made in the Glasgow Climate Pact into urgent action if we're to protect those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. As agreed at COP26, developed nations need to at least collectively double climate adaptation finance to developing countries by 2025. Public finance will not be enough, which is why initiatives such as the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Programme are key to mobilising private sector engagement and investment for adaptation.' Anne Beathe Tvinnereim, Minister of International Development, Norway: 'Norway has committed to double our climate finance and at least triple support to adaptation by 2026. For Norway, GCA is a key partner in advancing the climate adaptation and food security agenda. We welcome GCA's cooperation with the African Development Bank on the AAAP. AAAP's objectives are fully in line with our priorities. How can we - together - minimize the risk of climate disasters? How can we make food systems more resilient - making the most vulnerable better placed to cope with the next drought, flood or plague? How can we - at the same time - create much needed jobs, especially for the youth? AAAP is definitely an important part of the answer. I would therefore encourage more partners to join our efforts.' Chrysoula Zacharopoulou, Minister of State for Development, Francophonie and International Partnerships, France: 'France remains highly committed to tackling climate change and supporting adaptation in African countries. On behalf of President Macron, I am proud to announce our decision to invest 10 million euros in the AAAP's Upstream Financing Facility. This effort should leverage a total of 1 billion euros of adaptation investments, and support concrete local improvements in environmental quality and resilience.' Mette Frederiksen, Prime Minister of Denmark, : Over seventy leaders from the international climate and development community attended the Dialogue which concluded with a Communique adopted in the presence of the Dialogue's Co-Conveners, Chair of the GCA Board, Ban Ki-moon; CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation, Professor Patrick Verkooijen; African Union President Macky Sall of Senegal; Climate Vulnerable Forum Chair President Akufo Addo of Ghana; PreCOP27 host President Tshisekedi of the Democratic Republic of the Congo; and Co-Chair of the GCA Board, Feike Sijbesma. The following are the five points of the Africa Adaptation Summit's Communique: Africa at a tipping point: The international community needs to reckon with the multiple economic, climate and health crises that are pressuring Africa. Most vulnerable continent: Africa is the most vulnerable continent to the consequences of the climate crisis. Adaptation Finance Doubling Implementation: Progress and transparency on the COP26 agreement to doubling international finance for adaptation by 2025 through delivery into the country programs of the most vulnerable will be central to the success of COP27 . COP27 is the opportunity for the international community to show solidarity with the bold adaptation efforts of the world's most vulnerable continent by closing in on the outstanding resourcing need for the African Development Fund (ADF) climate action window. Delivering the AAAP Upstream Facility: Making available the AAAP Upstream Financing Facility's full resourcing needs by COP27 positions the AAAP itself to drive its full ambition into adaptation projects on the ground across Africa, a headline deliverable for the 'African COP.' In closing remarks Feike Sijbesma, Co-Chair of the GCA, noted: 'Investments in global climate adaptation cooperation are a big opportunity for countries like the Netherlands to share some of our best innovations with those who need them the most. The AAAP will be a crucial vehicle for triggering far greater business investment across Africa into green and resilient solutions. This is a collective effort, we need every sector, every contribution possible to see off the climate crisis in Africa, and the private sector, in particular, has a massive role to play.' \</doc>

Gabon's President Ali Bongo Ondimba, among other experts, have called for continuous collective efforts and urgent action to safeguard the\~ African continent from climate change. In a statement from the Communication and External Relations Department, African Development Bank (AfDB) on Thursday, Ondimba made the call at the 2022 Africa Climate Week which opened in Libreville, Gabon on Monday. "For more than 10 years, we have intensified our efforts to protect our remarkable forestry heritage and build a low-carbon economy. "Consequently, Gabon, which has already achieved the objectives set by the Paris Agreement, is considered the most carbon-positive country in the world." Also speaking, Patricia Janet Scotland, Secretary-General of the Commonwealth of Nations, said the continent should be able to respond to the situation of climate change. "If we choose, we can be the solution we need, Africa can be the answer. And this is our time. "We are the first generation to suffer the consequences of climate change but we are the last generation able to do anything about it." Egyptian Foreign Minister, Sameh Shoukry said that Africans should work to secure the climate, given the disproportionate impact climate change was projected to have on Africa as compared to other regions Shoukry is also the designated president of COP27 , Furthermore, the African Union's Commissioner for Rural Economy and Agriculture, Josefa Sacko, urged African countries to maintain a common stance as the continent tackled the impacts of climate change to achieve its long-term goals. Also, Kevin Kariuki, AfDB Group Vice President for Power, Energy, Climate and Green Growth, said a just transition was about "greening the economy". "In such a way that it is fair and inclusive, and that ensures the costs and benefits of the transition to low carbon and climate-resilient development are shared across the entire economy." A representative of the youth, Omnia El Omrani, however, said that commitments to climate action in Africa needed accelerating. "It's time for real action. Let this generation be the last generation to face the climate crisis," El Omrani said. The Africa Climate Week, which had more than 1200 delegates, provided a crucial platform for the continent to address social inequalities and invest in development to advance climate action and safeguard people and ecosystems. The opening session featured a ministerial dialogue on the challenges of mobilising and accessing climate finance at scale to spur the implementation of countries' Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and priority national climate plans and strategies. According to the statement, Africa Climate Week is taking place under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and is a crucial step on the road to COP27 , which will be held in Egypt in November. It is also one of a series of regional climate weeks, which gave a voice to a range of actors and partners: civil society, women, local communities and financial institutions. The event offers a forum for discussion on how to contribute most effectively to COP27 and achieve the Paris agreement objectives. The 2022 UNFCCC would take place from Nov. 6 to 18 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. (NAN) \</doc>

The inclusion of 'loss and damage' on the agenda at COP 27 could become the litmus test for the success of the conference as the concept compels rich nations to pay compensation to vulnerable states hit by disasters connected with climate change largely caused by them. COP 19 established the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage but this is the first time ever in the UN climate negotiations that loss and damage finance has made it into the agenda. Small island nations as well as African countries that have been raising this issue for over three decades would count it a win that it made the agenda at all. 'We must acknowledge a harsh truth, there is no adapting to a growing number of catastrophes causing enormous suffering around the world,' said Antonio Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations. 'The deadly impacts of climate change are here and now. Loss and damage can no longer be swept under the rug.' Directly related to climate justice, the concept of paying compensation to developing countries by rich nations for industrial activities that has depleted the ozone layer and increased greenhouse emissions has rankled rich nations to no end. Rich nations who made pledges to increase financing for adaptation by contributing $100 billion yearly to a common fund have largely reneged. Since 2020, when the agreement only about a quarter of the sum has been raised. Russian aggression has roiled oil markets and kicked energy security on the priority list of rich countries, displacing climate concerns. The bulk of climate funding so far has gone to cutting carbon dioxide emissions in an effort to curb climate change, while about a third of it has gone toward projects to help communities adapt to future impacts, otherwise known as mitigation. Rather than mitigation, loss and damage funding goes directly to compensating costs that countries can't avoid or Â£dapt' to. However, there is no agreement yet over what should count as 'loss and damage' in climate disasters. Loss and damage arising from the adverse effects of climate change can include those related to extreme weather events but also slow onset events, such as sea level rise, increasing temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat and related impacts, salinization, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity and desertification says the United Nations. Some of the losses are easily determined but most are hard to value including disruptions to natural ecosystems. This would form the critical component of the negotiations at COP 27 . Read also: Africa must oppose measures at COP 27 that restricts its fossil fuels 'At long last, providing funding to address losses and damages from climate impacts is on the agenda of the UN climate negotiations. With climate impacts devastating communities all around us, the international community can no longer avert its eyes from the deadly and costly consequences of a warming world,' said Ani Dasgupta, President and CEO, World Resources Institute, a global research firm. Dasgupta said vulnerable nations have tirelessly appealed for help to cope with the alarming and damaging climate impacts that they hold little responsibility for causing. She said countries have now cleared an historic first hurdle toward acknowledging and answering the call for financing to address increasingly severe losses and damages. 'It is encouraging that countries agreed to a verbal statement that notes this process will reach a conclusive decision on funding arrangements within two years. Now negotiators need to set clear markers to ensure this process moves quickly, ideally concluding by next year given the urgency of the crisis. 'Of course, getting funding to address loss and damage on the agenda is only the first step. We still have a marathon ahead of us before countries iron out a formal decision on this central issue for CO27. It is critical that all countries work together in good faith to get this done,' she said. \</doc>

Rich countries have resisted the notion of compensation for their part in emitting greenhouse emissions responsible for the losses and damages vulnerable countries suffered but at this year's COP, that resolve is weakening. Scotland, Austria, and Ireland are among countries that have made pledges towards paying for loss and damage - the concept compels rich nations to pay compensation to vulnerable states hit by disasters connected with climate change largely caused by them COP 19 established the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage but this is the first time ever in the UN climate negotiations that loss and damage finance has made it into the agenda. Small island nations as well as African countries that have been raising this issue for over three decades were encouraged when funding arrangements for loss and damage made it into the agenda on Sunday after initial negotiations about the agenda. At COP 26 in Glasgow, only Scotland the host nation contributed $2.2million for loss and damages with other countries refusing to pay up. In the face of mounting opposition by developing nations, especially African leaders who say their countries could not afford the cost of adapting to climate change and managing the disasters that accompany it, on Tuesday, some rich nations announced new pledges. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, on the sidelines of the COP 27 in the resort city of Sharm el-Shiek pledge an additional $5.7 million. 'The Global South still feel that they're having to come and plead with the rich countries to acknowledge, let alone address the issue of loss and damage for example,' Sturgeon said at a New York Times event on the sidelines of COP 27 . 'There is a real need to make tangible progress.' Earlier, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, endorsed the idea of new funds for poor nations being impacted by climate change. 'The COP must make progress on minimizing and averting loss and damage from climate change,' she said while addressing other world leaders. 'It is high time put this on the agenda.' Shortly after Von der Leyen's remarks, Micheal Martin, prime minister of Ireland, said his country was pledging $10 million to a new effort 'to protect the most vulnerable from climate loss and damage.' 'The burden of climate change globally is falling most heavily on those least responsible for our predicament,' he said. 'We will not see the change we need without climate justice.' Austria joined in, with the country's climate minister saying it would pay 50 million euros, or around $50 million, to developing countries struggling with climate impacts. The United Nations has yet to publically state how much it would contribute towards the loss and damage fund but John Kerry, the President's envoy on climate change said he would take up the discussion with the Biden administration. Some European leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron urged the United States to revise its policy to support the fund. Some estimates put the amount of money required for loss and damage anywhere from $290 billion to $580 billion a year by 2030, rising to $1.7 trillion by 2050, according to a study. The contribution so far is only a drop in a bucket. However, there is no agreement yet over what should count as 'loss and damage' in climate disasters. Loss and damage arising from the adverse effects of climate change can include those related to extreme weather events but also slow onset events, such as sea level rise, increasing temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat and related impacts, salinization, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity and desertification says the United Nations. Some of the losses are easily determined but most are hard to value including disruptions to natural ecosystems. \</doc>

Download logo COP27 President Shoukry announces the Sharm el-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda - a comprehensive, shared agenda to rally global action around 30 adaptation outcomes that are needed to address the adaptation gap and achieve a resilient world by 2030. To take stock of progress, the High-Level Champions will publish the Yearbook of Global Climate Action 2022. The COP26 and COP27 Presidents, the UNFCCC Executive Secretary and the UN Climate Change High-Level Champions for COP26 and COP27 , Nigel Topping and Dr. Mahmoud Mohieldin, will open the Global Climate Action Agenda at COP27 with their event &ldquo;Making Good On Promises.&rdquo; Forming part of the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Summit, the COP27 High-Level Event on Climate Action includes Sameh Shoukry, COP27 President, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Arab Republic of Egypt; UN Climate Change Executive Secretary, Simon Stiell; as well as industry, cities and civil society leaders, such as Sophia Kianni and Yuriko Koike. At the event, COP27 President Shoukry will announce the Sharm el-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda to enhance resilience for 4 billion people living in the most climate vulnerable communities by 2030. The Adaptation Agenda is the first comprehensive global plan to rally both State and non-State actors behind a shared set of 30 Adaptation Outcomes that are required by 2030 across food and agriculture, water and nature, oceans and coastal, human settlements and infrastructure systems as well delivery across key enablers of as planning and finance. In step with COP27 The latest edition of the Yearbook demonstrates that there are signals of change, despite the finding that the world is nowhere near on track toward a 1.5&deg;C goal. Action by businesses, investors, cities, states, regions and civil societies continues to increase, with 34 Race to Resilience partners from 139 countries taking action to build the resilience of 2.9 billion people, while 26 Race to Zero partners have mobilised more than 11,000 non-State actors from 116 countries taking action to halve global emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero by mid-century at the latest. What's more, there is evidence that climate action is becoming better distributed across the globe, with the Global Climate Action Portal recording a jump of 78% in actors from Asia-Pacific and of 67% from Africa. These figures have been boosted by this year's three Regional Climate Weeks, which attracted approximately 8,000 participants after a return to an in-person format in 2022. To drive regional action deeper, the Champions will also use their opening event to preview results from the five Regional Finance Forums, organized by the COP27 Presidency, UN Regional Commissions and the Champions, to accelerate finance to projects in developing economies that reduce emissions,adapt to the impacts of climate change, build climate resilience, and advance the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. A full analysis of the 100+ projects presented at the Forums will be launched tomorrow to coincide with Finance Day, but key findings will be presented in today's event of what is already a $120 billion investment opportunity, and which is growing exponentially. If this COP is about implementation, it must also necessarily focus on accountability, in order to fully address the finance and implementation gaps at the speed and scale required. Today's Yearbook - capturing the vast array of non-State action under the Marrakech Partnership - is one way of holding all actors to account for the promises they have made. Accordingly, it will serve as a vital contribution to both the Global Stocktake and the work of the two High-Level Expert Groups on Net-Zero Emissions Commitments of Non-State Entities and the High-Level Expert Group on Climate Finance. UN Climate Change Executive Secretary, Simon Stiell, said: &ldquo;Building the confidence in a faster pathway to solutions means raising ambitions, scaling projects and channelling more money to developing nations. I am delighted therefore to see that this Yearbook of Global Climate Action highlights what needs to happen to reach the 1.5 &deg;C Paris goal, and its goal of resilience.&rdquo; UN Climate Change High-Level Champion for COP26, Nigel Topping, said: &ldquo;Businesses, investors, cities, states, regions and civil society are powering rapid changes in the real economy and already seeing the benefits, the imperative to go faster has never been stronger. Governments should be encouraged by this progress and respond by creating the conditions to collaborate with non-State actors so we can all go further. While the progress is extraordinary, especially when we look at the transformation of the energy and transport sectors, non-State actors must double down and deliver in response to heightening impacts.&rdquo; UN Climate Change High-Level Champion for COP27 , Dr. Mahmoud Mohieldin, said: &ldquo;It is imperative to accelerate global climate action through emissions reduction, scaling-up adaptation efforts and enhancing flows of appropriate finance. This has to occur within a more comprehensive agenda for sustainable development that addresses poverty, hunger, unemployment, and enhances women empowerment. The implementation of urgent, ambitious, impactful and transformative action is necessary to support vulnerable communities, achieve a resilient future and carbon neutral transformation, in the context of just transition.&rdquo; The Governor of Tokyo, Yuriko Koike, said: &ldquo;There is truly no time to lose when it comes to climate change. All actors, including the national government, local governments, and companies, must immediately accelerate concrete actions. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government is accelerating its efforts to halve carbon emissions by 2030 and to reach zero emissions by 2050, including the mandatory installation of solar power generation equipment and promoting the broader use of green hydrogen. Time to act. Let's walk together toward a sustainable future for cities and for the world.&rdquo; Distributed by APO Group on behalf of The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). \</doc>

Download logo Small-scale farmers from developing countries produce one-third of the world's food, yet they only receive 1.7 per cent of climate finance even as they are forced to cope with droughts, floods, cyclones and other disasters. This sentiment echoed through dozens of pavilions and conference rooms in Sharm el-Sheikh on Saturday as COP27 turned its attention to the vital issues of adaptation, agriculture and food systems in the context of climate change. "We need to help rural populations build their resilience to extreme weather events and adapt to a changing climate. If not, we only go from one crisis to the next. Small scale farmers work hard to grow food for us in tough conditions," Sabrina Dhowre Elba, Goodwill Ambassador for the UN International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), said during a press conference. As a Somali woman, Ms. Dhowre Elba said this issue was personal: as COP27 got underway her country had experienced four consecutive failed rainy seasons, a climatic event not seen in 40 years. "I can't stand idly by while mothers, families and farmers are suffering across the Horn of Africa as it experiences its most severe drought in recent history," she explained, urging developed countries to mobilize political will and investments. "Trillions of dollars were made available to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences. The same is needed for climate change. The same is needed for sustainable agricultural support. It's crucial to the well-being and the food security of us all," she added. Funds for adaptation must be delivered Dina Saleh, the Regional Director of IFAD, explained that failure to help rural populations to adapt could have dangerous consequences, leading to longer poverty, migrations and conflict. "This is why today we are calling on world leaders from developed nations to honour their pledge to provide the $100 billion a year in climate finance to developing nations and to channel half of that to have that amount to climate adaptation," she underscored. Thirteen years ago, at COP15 Copenhagen, developed nations made a significant pledge. They promised to channel $100 billion a year to less wealthy nations by 2020, to help them adapt to climate change and mitigate further rises in temperature. That promise, however, was not kept. Ms. Saleh cautioned that there is a "narrow window" to help rural poor people to survive and protect their communities, and that crop yields could reduce by as much as 50 per cent by the end of the century. "The choice is between adapting or starving," she warned, urging COP27 to be about action, credibility and justice for the invisible and the silent. A new initiative Precisely to address these issues, the COP27 Egyptian Presidency launched on Friday the new initiative Food and Agriculture for Sustainable Transformation or FAST, to improve the quantity and quality of climate finance contributions to transform agriculture and food systems by 2030. The cooperation programme will have concrete deliverables for helping countries access climate finance and investment, increase knowledge, and provide policy support and dialogue. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), along with other UN agencies, will be the facilitator of this initiative, which, according to Zitouni Ould-Dada, Deputy Director of the agency's Climate and Environment Division, puts agriculture at the heart of efforts to tackle climate change. "The message really is to recognize that agriculture must be an integral part of the solution to the climate crisis," he told UN News. The importance of investing in innovation At the same time, while the agricultural and food sector is profoundly impacted by climate change, it also contributes around a third of global greenhouse emissions, from production to consumption, Mr. Ould-Dada explains, saying that there must be a transformation of the agri-food systems. "We can't continue with the current model of producing food and then degrading the soil, declining biodiversity, affecting the environment. No. It must be sustainable," he notes. The expert highlights that if the right choices are made, agriculture can be an important part of the solution to fight the climate crisis by sequestering carbon in soil and plants and promoting adaptation and resilience. "We can't produce the food to feed and nourish a growing population with the current model, with the threat of climate change. We can't." The first thing the world should be tackling, he says, is addressing food waste, which is responsible for 8 per cent of global gas emissions.

Civil society calls for finance, economy transformation UN representatives were not the only ones underscoring the need for countries to invest in transformation and deliver their climate finance promise. A massive protest led by a coalition of environmental, women, indigenous, youth and trade union organizations took over the roads and pathways between the pavilions at COP27 . "Right to territories, rights to resources, human rights, indigenous people rights, loss and damage must be in all the negotiation texts . 1.5 is not negotiable that is what we are here standing for," said Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, Chadian environmentalist and SDG advocate. The activist stated that her people are dying because of floods, droughts, while some indigenous communities in the Pacific are losing their homelands. "We want to have justice. Justice for our people, for our economies for loss and damage. We are losing our culture, our identity, our life, and these are not payable, but climate finance needs to be delivered," she shouted amid hundreds of protesters.

With over 600 million people currently lacking access to electricity and 900 million people without access to clean cooking solutions, coupled with the fact that Africa as a continent faces the worst effects of the climate crisis, there has never been a more pressing time to invest in Angolan oil and gas. For its part, the country's resources hold the key for widespread electrification, climate mitigation and sustainable economic growth, and with accelerated investment in these resources, not only Angola but Africa has the potential to both develop and thrive as an economy. It is within this context that the Angola Oil & Gas (AOG) conference and exhibition emerges. Scheduled to take place in Luanda from November 29 to December 1, the third edition of the event will see AOG 2022 emerging as not only the biggest energy conference in the country but the biggest to take place in Africa post- COP27 . Its significance, therefore, cannot be understated, and at a time when urgent investment is needed in Angola, the event is set to lay the foundation for robust discussions, lucrative deals and new capital commitments that will transform Angola's energy landscape for the better. Building on the theme of \' Promoting an Inclusive, Attractive and Innovative Oil and Gas Industry in Angola,' AOG 2022 will awaken new opportunities for partnerships and dialogue, thereby making a strong case for Angolan investment while setting the tone for other energy-related discussions across other African events in 2022 and beyond. Its role as a forum comes not only from its position as the country's premier energy event but as the first and biggest energy conference taking place post- COP27 . Taking place merely a week after COP27 concludes, AOG 2022 represents the platform of choice for policymakers, energy leaders and public and private sector executives to discuss the impacts of decisions made during the climate summit. With this year's summit placing more emphasis on the role fossil fuels play in the world's energy future, and African representatives delivering a strong argument for the development of these resources for the good of Africa, AOG 2022 will build on while strengthening this narrative, placing oil and gas investment and development at the center of all discussions. Why Angola? To date, Angola's proven oil reserves stand at 8.5 billion barrels of oil while its proven natural gas reserves stand at 11 trillion cubic feet, and while significant progress has been made to develop these resources, much more needs to be done from both an investment and participatory standpoint. With the aim of unlocking the true potential of the country's oil and gas sector, the Government of Angola, through the national oil company Sonangol and the national regulator, the National Agency for Oil, Gas and Biofuels (ANPG), has introduced a six-year licensing round in 2019, offering 50 up for exploration in the hopes of accelerating upstream activities; implemented a series of structural and policy reforms to reawaken new investment in the already competitive market; while offering new rules of engagement, reductions in E&P approval timelines and petroleum tax revisions to secure the participation of a range of international companies. "Under the leadership of both the President, Jo\'e3o Louren\'e7o, and the Minister of Mineral Resources, Oil and Gas, Diamantino Azevedo, the country continues to witness unprecedented growth across the entire energy value chain, owing largely to the efforts undertaken by the minister and president to establish both and enabling an increasingly competitive environment for investment." NJ Ayuk, the Executive Chairman of the AEC "Now, in 2022, the country has emerged as the destination of choice for project developers and financiers, and leveraging the significant untapped resources available, Angola is set to awaken a new era of investment and development, all thanks to President Louren\'e7o and Minister Azevedo's strong development drive." Concluded Ayuk Building on the reforms implemented, AOG 2022 will provide insight into the country's regulatory and legal landscape, paving the way for heightened collaboration between local and global stakeholders while unlocking new levels of investment across the entire energy value chain. In partnership with the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Petroleum and the African Energy Chamber, the event welcomes the participation of a suite of local, regional and international stakeholders. As the country's official gathering for energy stakeholders and the biggest energy event on the continent post- COP27 , AOG 2022 represents a not-to-be-missed energy event. Secure your participation at AOG 2022 and be part of the conversation on Angola's energy future.

Nigeria, Oct. 5 -- As the 27th Conference of State Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) draws near, African leaders are speaking with perhaps the loudest voice on why Africa's needs should be prioritised given the unprecedented effects of climate change on the continent in spite of its inconsequential contribution to global carbon emissions. In this interview with PREMIUM TIMES, Egypt's Ambassador to Nigeria, Ihab Awab, outlines the several strategies being put in place by Egypt which will host the COP in November. PT: COP27 is nicknamed Africa's COP. What should Africa expect from Egypt, given that it is playing host, in terms of putting Africa's interest first? Mr Awab: It is true that the Sharm El-Sheikh Conference of State Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, otherwise known as COP27 , is Africa's COP. It is taking place at a very significant juncture of our worlds, of course, with all the challenges facing the world now, economically, recovery efforts from the Covid19 pandemic; the implications of the conflict in Ukraine and also the very clear indications that the world is not doing enough to combat climate change. But at the same time, the whole narrative around climate change has been developed outside Africa, it is time now to use the Sharm El-Sheikh conference to bring Africa's voice to the forefront of the discussions on what can be done in order to combat the impact of climate change on the future of our continent. Our continent is basically the least contributor to carbon emission, not more that four per cent, and at the same time it is a continent that is developing, that is growing, a continent that has adopted and took upon itself to implement and achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and Agenda 2030 on sustainable development and the road is very long; the challenges to meet those goals are enormous. Some of them must be prioritised vis-a-vis other commitments in climate change, simply because since we as a continent are not the primary contributor, then we should not be taking up extra commitment on ourselves that might stifle or hinder our development aspirations. So this is basically the main tenet of how Egypt's incoming presidency of COP27 is thinking about Africa's stance. Africa's voice needs to be very clear that we are all in the same boat and it is essential for there to be joint effort to combat climate change. But at the same time, we have our development aspirations and this is something I believe the Egyptian presidency during its Pre-COP consultations within Africa and with the rest of the world has been very clear about. The other thing about the Sharm El-Sheikh conference is that we will like to call it the implementation conference. Many of the pledges made in previous conferences regarding support to the developing countries especially in Africa, or how the transition to renewable energy for example should take place without undermining our development/growth aspirations, is yet to materialise. The aspect of financing some of the projects is a key priority for the incoming Egyptian presidency of COP27 and it is something that all African countries agree that COP27 should and must actually come out with practical actions and we at the same time do realise that the moment may be a little challenging because of the cost of the conflict in Ukraine, the incomplete recovery of the global economy after covid19. There are competing priorities for finance all over the world. If we are serious about combating climate change and also equally serious about achieving the SDGs, then this is the conference and this is the kind of discussion that needs to take place in Sharm El Sheikh. So that is why we believe in the opportunity for Africa to speak with one voice on the issues that matter the most for the future of Africa and for the issues that challenge Afrca in terms of climate and economic development. PT: You said Africa needs to speak with one voice and Egypt by virtue of being the next COP president, has assumed a leadership position. How is Egypt mobilising and organising other African Heads of State to make sure we are speaking with one voice? Mr Awab: The consultations at different political levels have been ongoing as well as consultation at the technical level. First of all, Africa has a group of negotiators that have been established a long time ago to participate and represent Africa's common position at the expert technical level. This group has been mobilised and through that group, we go a step up to the African Council of Ministers of Environment, which is also the higher political level of ministers of environment which is also a very important configuration to discuss what is coming out of the expert level. President El-Sisi of Egypt has invited other African leaders to a segment of the Sharm El-Sheikh conference called the leaders summit. He has prioritised inviting African leaders to be present at COP27 to the extent possible in big numbers and in order for the concerns of Africa to be voiced not only jointly in one meeting but also in the various bilaterals that are expected to take place around Sharm El-Sheikh. World leaders will be there and African leaders will be there. And of course there is hope that we synchronise and synergise our messages at that highest political level so that the message does not come only in declarations that we are planning to put together but also in the messages of the various leaders and ministers among themselves and other ministers and leaders all over the world. So this is how we try to mobilise/formulate the message. There are levels of formulating the messages, putting the priorities and the leaders will be there, hopefully in numbers, to make sure that those messages come across at the highest political level. PT: At the Africa Adaptability Summit in Rotterdam, we saw that leaders of western countries did not show up at the meeting. How does that impact climate action? Mr Awab: As I mentioned, we do recognise the challenging moment that the world is living in. Our preparations and close coordination with the outgoing presidency -UK- is focusing on the fact that, despite the fact that there are various challenges, the world cannot afford not to act. We still have a few weeks until COP27 , we are receiving indications that world leaders, especially from developed countries and industrial countries, they do recognise that we cannot walk back from the commitments we have made in previous conferences. Most recently, there was an IPCC report that said the world is in a very serious situation when it comes to emission and there was a lot of doubt on whether we will be able to reach the target of reducing emission and also temperature. That came as a wake up call to all of us, that while we are experiencing these challenges, there is no turning back. So we do hope and we are confident that world leaders will still show up but not showing up only, which is a sign of commitment itself, but hopefully they are also showing up with readiness to make commitments and pledges for the implementation of previous commitments that were made. There are diplomatic efforts ongoing to make sure we are able to get the best outcome in these circumstances. PT: Are there specific roles other big players in Africa can play at COP27 ? Mr Awab: Absolutely. And this is a very good segue to highlight the important role of Nigeria. Nigeria has been very vocal about the tenet of the African position and interest especially in the particular area of just energy transition. There is no development without energy and there is no development without access to energy and it is one of the 17 SDGs. Nigeria has been very vocal about it; President Buhari is a major champion of how Africa should mobilise itself to maintain its fair share of energy access and how access to energy and combating climate change should not necessarily be two contradictory goals for humanity. Nigeria plays a major role within Africa, thanks to President Buhari's very vocal and very clear position but also Vice President Osinbajo who has been very vocal; his writings in major publications, his most recent visit to the US and his presentation in Washington. He is one of the champions to one of the most important African positions and aspirations which is just energy transition and this is shared widely across Africa and it is very important that countries such as Nigeria, Egypt, Kenya, Senegal, Morocco, Algeria and many of the big economies in Africa are able to really mobilise within their respective subregions but also to be able to speak with one and to be very vocal about the priorities of Arica and that is why we work very closely with Nigeria and there is a very good synergy on many of the main priorities before Sharm El Sheikh. PT: Could you quickly outline some of these priorities aside from just the energy transition which of course is very important. What other priorities are we looking at Africa speaking to with one voice? Mr Awab: The question of adaptation, how developing countries could adapt to the transition to green economies, green energy, and renewable energy. This is a very important aspect. We do recognise as Africa that this is a goal that we need to achieve. But at the same time, we know that this is going to cost. the international community has the responsibility to aid Africa in its transition to this kind of energy which is still not very affordable to all the economies. So the technology needs to be available and there is a lot of effort, commitment and political will that needs to be demonstrated by the international community in that particular direction. It is not only the adaptation of energy, it is how our economies can be transformed into a green economy. It is not a button that you are going to push and you all of a sudden transform social and economic traditions and realities. We are talking about clean cooking in Africa; how are we going to make a transformation to clean energy for the regular household in the villages and small towns of Africa. These are breaks for the future of the continent, the developing world and the global economy itself. If the majority of the population of the world that lives in the developing world is unable to make that transformation, then our goal towards combating climate change but also towards ending poverty will not be attained. So we are very clear that ending poverty and attaining the goals for preserving our earth and combating climate change should not be in contradiction. PT: What specific demands should we look out for at the negotiation table at COP27 ? Mr Awab: As I mentioned, it is not only government to government that will be solving our problems. The role of the private sector and business to business investment in that transformation is going to be key. If the larger title is financing, and the issue of financing is key because developing countries cannot do it alone and also I need to remind that developing countries are not the largest emitters especially African countries. We are talking about financing that will have to come from governments, international financial institutions, investment funds, but also private sector and companies that are able to transfer the technologies needed at a cost effective rate. This is the main asks that will be presented at Sharm El-Sheikh that cuts across the various aspects of the agenda of the conference from adaptation to mitigation to compensation to risks and all of the agenda items. PT: What role can the media play in spotlighting, highlighting and sending out the African message? Mr Awab: I think there is a very important role for the media. By virtue of the several participations expected at COP27 , it is not just about what the government says or agrees to. This is about how all levels of our society is able to achieve together and this is where the media's role is key; synthesising societies; synthesising business; putting forward the accountability dimension of what we can achieve, whether in Sharm El Sheikh or in the follow conferences. I think this is where the media can be able to highlight the ending poverty, combating climate change and how they should not be in conflict and what that really means for human commitments. Beyond governments in the developed countries, there are people in those countries who really care about the future of our earth and the more the media is able to present the kind of challenges we are facing in order to be part of our common drive. This is a major role the media can play. This is the first of the two-part interview. In the second part, the ambassador talks about the 2013 unrest in Egypt, fighting terrorists, trade between Nigeria and Egypt and other matters. Stay with PREMIUM TIMES for the second part.

By Usman Aliyu Egypt and Norway have launched the first phase of a project to establish a major green hydrogen plant in Egypt's Ain Sokhna on the Red Sea, with a capacity to produce 100MW. President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi of Egypt and the Norwegian Prime Minister, Jonas Gahr Stare at the launch of the project on Tuesday, said the launching was part of the 2022 UN Climate Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) holding in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. This event took part of the final day of the Climate Implementation Summit, with more than 100 heads of state and government gathering on the opening days of the conference to work towards the implementation of existing climate agreements. El-Sisi hailed the project, which will be implemented in cooperation with the Norwegian energy giant Scatec. The Egyptian president sad it provides "a practical model of investment partnership that stimulates sustainable economic development with a focus on the role of the national and foreign private sector besides the government's role, working side by side in this fruitful sector." Scatec has been a major developer at Egypt's massive Benban solar park in Upper Egypt's Aswan, one of the largest solar parks worldwide with a total capacity of 1. 8 GW. Related News The Green Hydrogen Plant is part of Egypt's wider green hydrogen strategy, which has a vision to produce green hydrogen at the cheapest price worldwide. The strategy, implemented in cooperation with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Arab Union for Sustainable Development and Environment, seeks to help Egypt contribute to eight percent of the global hydrogen market, Egypt's cabinet said in a statement on Saturday. El-Sisi said: "Green hydrogen has become one of the most important solutions on the way toward a green economy during the coming years. "It is an example where developing countries, including Egypt, are taking great steps. "However, we still have to face challenges resulting from the tendency of some countries to back local green hydrogen in a way that decreases their production cost. "This causes imbalance in the global hydrogen market and contributes to undermining the competitiveness of the green hydrogen produced in developing countries compared to the developed countries," the president added.

Africa has been urged to invest in infrastructure resilient to climate change, which has pushed countries to spend almost 5 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) in adapting to its impacts, according to Antonio Pedro, acting executive secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), on the margins of COP27 . The executive secretary noted that the Africa Climate Resilient Investment Facility (AFRI-RES) was a boost to climate proofing infrastructure in Africa. 'There is an urgent need to close Africa's infrastructure deficit at scale and at speed if the continent is to meet its development objectives - as stipulated in various national development plans, the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and Agenda 2063,' said Pedro. The executive secretary noted that closing the infrastructure development gap means investing up to US$170 billion per year in sectors such as energy, transport, water, sanitation, urban, and ecosystems. These sectors are sensitive to the adverse impacts of climate change, including more frequent and intense floods, droughts, and heat waves. 'Against a background of increasing climate change impacts that are already costing Africa on average 5 percent of GDP per year, it is important to boost the confidence that the infrastructure investments will deliver services and return on investments in both today's and tomorrow's climate,' the Executive Secretary noted. A 2015 landmark study on enhancing the Climate Resilience of Africa's Infrastructure (ECRAI) by the World Bank and the ECA has shown that some river basins - such as the Orange River Basin and Congo River Basin - could become wetter under certain scenarios of global emissions pathways. In addition, some river basins such as the Zambezi River Basin could become drier and lose up to 60 percent of hydropower production potential with resulting huge increases in energy costs. Pedro stated that in 2016 the Kariba dam on the Zambezi - which supplies most of the electricity consumed in Zimbabwe and Zambia - almost shut down as the volume of water in the reservoir dropped to about 12 percent of capacity because of the unusual El Nino and La Nina events of 2015/2016 attributable to climate change. The findings of the report led to the establishment of the Africa Climate Resilient Investment Facility - AFRI-RES - supported by the Nordic Development Fund. The AFRI-RES facility supports countries, regional entities such as river basin commissions, and projects developers with the capacity and tools to integrate climate resilience in investments in key sectors. AFRI-RES is a joint initiative of the ECA, the African Union Commission (AUC), and the African Development Bank. During its first phase, the ECA and the AUC have led the component of training and advocacy and also the development of a climate knowledge and information portal. 'Africa can take advantage as a late comer in infrastructure development to make sure that it builds quality climate resilient infrastructure,' said Pedro, highlighting that the capacity and tools provided by AFRI-RES are critical inputs in the development agenda for Africa. \</doc>

National Youth Leader, All Progressives Congress (APC), Hon. Dayo Israel, has urged youths of Nasarawa State to make good the claim that the state is home of the ruling party by mobilizing friends and families, particularly at the grassroots, to deliver a comprehensive victory to APC, come 2023 General Elections. This was just as Israel reiterated the commitment of the youth within the fold to ensuring that APC claimed the lion's share of the youth votes which would determine the outcome of the election, saying that they would knock on every door, explore every approach, and do everything to propagate the ideals of APC and 'the vision of its presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu so Nigerians can back his emergence as the next president.' The APC youth leader made the call at the weekend as he opened the Nasarawa leg of his nationwide tour with a visit to the private residence of the National Chairman of the party, Sen. Abdullahi Adamu, who was a two-term governor of the state. He arrived in the state to continue his nationwide mobilization tour, after urging serious commitment to climate financing at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ) in Egpyt. Israel briefed the APC National Chairman, Adamu, on the nationwide tour which had seen him engage young voters in over 10 states, including Bauchi, Yobe, Borno, Adamawa, Anambra, Kaduna, Katsina, Jigawa, Plateau, and Enugu, even as he also presented a photo album showcasing the success of the youth wing in organizing a first-ever progressive youth summit which had in attendance prominent leaders of the party and outstanding youth figures in politics and the private sector. 'Mr Chairman, I want to reiterate our commitment to ensuring that the APC claims the lion's share of the youth votes which will determine the outcome of the election. We are not relenting. We will knock on every door, explore every approach, and do everything we can to propagate the ideals of our party and the vision of our candidate Asiwaju Bola Tinubu so Nigerians can back his emergence as the next president. 'From the Progressive Youth Summit which was attended by over 5000 youths alongside governors, ministers, and other leaders of our party, to this nationwide mobilization tour during which I am jolting the youth base of our party into action by impressing on our grassroots mobilizers their critical importance to our victory next year, the youth wing of the party is both ready and able to meet and exceed your expectations of us,' the party chieftain assured. Israel thanked the APC National Chairman for his support and leadership, without which the initiatives embarked on by the youth wing would not have been possible. The party boss, Sen. Adamu, in his response, praised Israel for his dynamic leadership and total dedication to the victory of the party, stressing that young people had a special responsibility in bringing about a prosperous and secure Nigeria through support for the APC, among other means. Meanwhile, Isreal also met with several youth grassroots groups in Keffi and Kokona LGAs before proceeding to Lafia. He urged some of the groups, including the Jagaban Mandate Group, APC Youth Canvassers for Good Governance, and others, to take seriously their task of mobilization, noting that their success would determine the party's fate in 2023. 'We have a responsibility to our party, candidates, and to the nation. There is no doubt that of all the candidates who have put themselves forward for the presidency, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu represents the best opportunity for young people to acquire lasting empowerment and occupy even more seats at the table where the future of the nation is decided,' he said. He later paid homage to the Emir of Lafia, HRH Hon. Justice Sidi Bage Mohammed, whom he praised as Â£n inspirational figure and great patriot' for his contributions to the growth of the country's judiciary before his elevation to the throne through which he continued to 'offer impactful leadership and guidance, particularly to young people.' \</doc>

From Aloysius Attah, Onitsha Uzoma John Paul Ajugwe, a graduate of Petroleum Engineering at the Federal University of Technology Owerri, Uzoma has made a breakthrough in a new method of crude oil-drilling that is safe and environmentally-friendly, earning publication in the prestigious American Journal of Engineering Research. The research project was titled "Development of Environmentally Friendly Oil-Based Mud Using Almond Oil, Castor Oil and Groundnut Oil". It was co-authored by Chikwe AO Onuh, CH and Nwagbo CA, all of Department of Petroleum Engineering, FUTO, Owerri. In a telephone interview with our correspondent, Uzoma Ajugwe, 24, a former student of Nigeria Navy Secondary School, Port Harcourt, who has just passed out from NYSC posting at the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources Headquarters Abuja, stressed that the benefits of the research were numerous especially in the face of climate change. He emphasised that with increasing environmental degradation and other harmful effects caused by using diesel oil as fluids for drilling crude oil, the project formulated technology of optimising drilling fluids with locally available and environmentally safe plant seed oils like almond, castor and groundnut as substitutes for diesel mud oil which is toxic to the habitat. Mr Ajugwe pointed out that the use of diesel fluids for drilling crude oil in the Niger Delta has polluted the environment. "It is life-threatening to all living things in the ecosystem. Just as hazardous as dumping nuclear waste product in the creek of Niger Delta", the young Researcher reasoned. He said, compared to groundnut, almond and castor oil based muds are more environmentally-friendly, while diesel oil based mud is highly toxic to the environment. Explaining how the system works, he said the extraction of oils from the various seeds (almond, castor and groundnut) is done using a sohlet extractor "The muds are then formulated individually by using a Hamilton beach mixer while adding other additives like barite, bentonite, e.t.c. Various tests are then carried out to ascertain the physical properties of each mud (almond oil based mud, castor oil based mud and groundnut oil based mud) These properties are then compared against the normal diesel oil based mud. He said the whole purpose of the work: "Development of an Environmentally Friendly Oil Based Mud Using Almond Oil, Castor Oil and Groundnut Oil" was to find a replacement for Diesel Oil Based Mud which is dangerous to the environment even as he disclosed that the research was published in the American Journal of Engineering Research Volume 8, issue 12 Pages 88-98. When asked about the relevance of the research work, he said the toxicity results when compared proved that groundnut, almond and castor oil based muds are way more environmentally friendly as opposed to Diesel Oil Based Mud which is highly toxic to the environment. "Therefore, it is essential to consider these seed oils if Nigeria is to meet with their target of cutting carbon emissions to zero by the year 2060, as pledged by President Muhammadu Buhari at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2021. One of his Supervisors, Onuh C.H who also co-authored the work said this about the work: "The relevance of this research cannot be overemphasized. Asides from the positive environmental impact, these Oils are more effective in hole cleaning than Diesel Oil Based Mud which is the standard in the Oil and gas industry today". Ajugwe posited that it is essential to adopt the seed oils technology in drilling crude oil if Nigeria is to meet her target of cutting carbon emissions to zero level by the year 2060 as pledged by President Muhammadu Buhari at the United Nations Climate Change Conference \</doc>

Altering farming methods and addressing critical issues of the food system would cut carbon emissions by 30 percent and help keep global warming under check, experts have said. The experts spoke at a side event on tackling food loss and waste to deliver food security and climate goals said there is evidence that the food system is a major contributor to global warming. 'The food system is part of the problem of global warming and part of the solutions,' Tessa Clark, co-founder, OLIO said. 'One of the most powerful solutions to reducing emissions lies in food waste. It comes above solar power,' she said. She noted that in developed countries half of their food waste occurs in the kitchen, saying that food waste is causing biodiversity loss and problems for everyone. She said the problem of food waste can be addressed with cooperation and partnerships between actors in the food systems. This is the first time that agriculture and food systems would have a day at the cop, action experts say is making the sector rise to the top of climate change. Read also: COP27 The global food system is responsible for more than one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) and is the primary driver of biodiversity loss. It also leads to the degradation of land and water resources. About 22 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions came from agriculture, forestry, and other land use sectors in 2019, according to an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. John Gathungu, executive director of Food Bank, Kenya said reducing food loss and waste help protect the environment and build resilience against shocks. 'Climate change is affecting food security globally and addressing critical challenges in the food system help communities better prepared to withstand shocks,' he said. According to him, to address food waste globally, there is a need to ensure an adequate balance of synergy among all stakeholders, adding that data and interventions measuring are critical to tackling food waste. Also, the experts call for the inclusion of food system climate action in climate financing. 'The climate food and nature crisis is a heavy burden for Africa and we cannot afford to wait.' \</doc>

The United Kingdom (UK) has announced the provision of \Â£395 million to support Nigeria with respect to the development of climate-resilient agriculture programmes. The funding, according to its Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, will support more than 4 million people, including 2 million women, to increase productivity while reducing emissions. Announcing the support at the ongoing COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, Cleverly disclosed that the investment is part of the efforts on tangible action to deliver on the commitments made at COP26 in Glasgow and support developing economies to tackle the impacts of climate change. The statement reads: 'The Prime Minister is expected to make a raft of adaptation-related announcements at the conference later today, including that the UK will triple funding for adaptation programmes from \Â£3500 million in 2019 to \Â£31.5 billion in 2025 'Cleverly will also argue that long-term prosperity depends on taking action on climate change and ramping up investment in renewable energy across the world, pointing to the impact of Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine on the global economy. Read Also: Climate Change: Bill Gates Pledges $1.4b for smallholder farmers 'The Foreign Secretary will announce today that the UK will provide \Â£320.7 million in Disaster Risk Financing to support countries which face climate-related disasters, helping them to afford insurance and to access reliable funding, more quickly, after a disaster. 'As an example, this funding will allow the World Food Programme to insure food supplies for almost 5 million people across 23 vulnerable countries in cases of climate-related disasters and will help small island developing states build resilience to extreme weather events. 'This support is part of the commitment made in 2021 at the UK G7 in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, to spend \Â£3120 million on Disaster Risk Financing. 'The UK will also announce several new funding allocations to support countries to adapt to the impacts of climate change over the longer term. The UK will spend \Â£313 million to support vulnerable countries to adapt to climate impacts, and towards efforts to avert, minimise and address loss and damage, including through new funding for the Santiago Network, an organisation set up to support vulnerable countries to access technical assistance. 'In Nigeria, the UK will provide a \Â£395 million investment to support the development of climate-resilient agriculture programmes, for example through scaling up heat-tolerant crop varieties. The funding will support more than 4 million people, including 2 million women, to increase productivity while reducing emissions. 'Under the UK's COP Presidency, almost all developed country climate finance providers made new, forward-looking climate finance commitments, with many doubling or even quadrupling support for developing countries to take climate action.' \</doc>

Nigeria, Nov. 9 -- The United Kingdom on Monday announced a &#163;95 million investment in climate resilient agriculture in Nigeria. "The Glasgow Climate Pact gave the world the tools to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees and build a secure and sustainable future. Now is the time for all countries to step up their action on climate change and deliver the tangible change needed," UK Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly, said. Mr Cleverly announced the investment at the ongoing climate change summit ( COP27 ) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. "The UK will continue to play a leading role in this mission. The funding we have announced will support countries which are facing the devastating impact of climate change, to adapt effectively," Mr Cleverly added. At least four million Nigerians, including two million women are expected to benefit from this investment to increase productivity and adapt to the effects of climate change while reducing emissions. Named Propcom+, it is set to help address key barriers to sustainable agricultural development in Nigeria. "It will support the development of climate-resilient agricultural policies, actions, and investments that deliver nutrition, increase productivity, adapt and build resilience while reducing emissions, and protect and restore natural ecosystems," the UK said. Propcom+ builds on the UK Government's investment in agriculture through the Propcom Mai-karfi programme in Nigeria. Commenting on the investment, the UK Deputy High Commissioner, Ben Llewellyn-Jones said: "Nigeria is extremely vulnerable to climate change and land degradation. Climate risks are increasing, diminishing productive capacity, and contributing to worsening food insecurity. Farmers are on the front line and highly dependent on seasonal rainfall making them increasingly vulnerable to the changing and unpredictable climate. "Tackling climate change and biodiversity loss is a key UK international priority and we remain committed to supporting inclusive and climate resilient growth in Nigeria through the Propcom+ programme which will build on the successes and lessons from previous engagement and deliver on adaptation and resilience, and on nature for climate and people." The &#163;95 million is part of the over &#163;100 million investments by the UK to support developing economies to respond to climate-related disasters and adapt to the impacts of climate change. UK Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, is also expected to make a raft of adaptation-related announcements at the conference, including that the UK will triple funding for adaptation programmes from &#163;500 million in 2019 to &#163;1.5 billion in 2025.

<Text> The winners are to represent Nigeria at the forthcoming United Nations (UN) Conference of the Parties (COP) on climate Change. Others are Mrs. Samuel-Nwokike, a graduate of mass Communication from the University of Nigeria Nsukka; Mr. Gregory Odogwu, an Environmental Columnist at Punch Newspaper; Idowu Esuku, aka Climate Man, a climate change musician and activist and Hyeladzira James Mshelia, a Climate Change Activist and Programs associate at CODE. Speaking at the ceremony, the Executive Director, CODE, Mallam Hamzat Lawal, noted that the COP, which stands as the supreme decision-making forum of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). COP27 ) will be held in the city of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt from 7-18 November 2022. "This conference could be a chance to turn the Glasgow outcome into action, through implementing climate change adaptation, mitigation, and financial strategies," Lawal said. According to him, CODE's climate change and advocacy level, has been since 2014 when Eni reported 820 spills in the Niger Delta, with 26,286 barrels or 4.1m liters lost. He said, "Since 2011, Shell has reported 1,010 spills, with 110,535 barrels or 17.5 million liters lost. That's about seven Olympic swimming pools. These are huge numbers, but the reality may be even worse. "Due to the injustice in the oil-producing areas of Nigeria, mainly from an environmental and economic perspective, Connected Development (CODE) in partnership with Oxfam implemented a campaign in the Niger-Delta region of Nigeria (Akwa Ibom, Delta and Rivers State) that sought to raise awareness on improving accountability and transparency in the dealings between host communities, oil and gas companies." <P/></Text> \</doc>

Nigeria, Nov. 20 -- In what could be described as a historic moment, especially for Africa and other developing nations, parties at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) have agreed to the establishment of a loss and damage fund as part of the Sharm El-Sheikh Implementation Plan on climate change. 'Loss and damage' only narrowly made it into the list of the agenda for the conference for the first time after African negotiators asserted their influence. Following the development, the new fund will see donors contribute to a global fund to save lives and livelihoods from climate change-related disasters. The agreement saw Parties recommit to keeping the 1.5degC target for global temperature rise intact and significant progress made across the board on climate issues. After days of negotiations, the conference finally created a facility to respond to the devastating impacts of climate change in vulnerable communities. The loss and damage fund was decided at the closing plenary of COP at about a few minutes past 4 a.m. Sunday morning. Before then, COP President Sameh Shoukry called for objections, and none was heard. In his words, "we heard the calls, and we responded. Today, here in Sharm El-Sheikh, we established the first-ever dedicated fund for loss and damage, a fund that has been so long in the making. It was only appropriate that this COP, the implementation COP in Africa, is where the fund is finally established. Millions around the globe can now sense a glimmer of hope that their suffering will finally be addressed, swiftly and appropriately." The agreement and pledges made on loss and damage aim to unlock greater ambitions for mitigation and adaptation. During COP27 , financial pledges were made for loss and damage from multiple countries during the COP including Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, and New Zealand, joining Denmark and Scotland, which had made pledges previously. The Chair of the African Group of Negotiators, Ephraim Shitima, said: "After 30 years of endeavour, on African soil, the world has agreed to establish a new fund and funding arrangements for loss and damage" The creation of the facility symbolises a full operationalisation of the Santigo Network for LossAndDamage - a network created to catalyze the technical assistance of relevant organisations for the implementation of relevant approaches for averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage at the local, national and regional level, in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. With this new fund, the third pillar of climate finance has been created. Activation of the facility will lead to the provision of new financial support under Article 9 of the Paris Agreement (PA), in addition to adaptation and mitigation finance, to developing countries. Previously at COP26 in the UK, the G77 and China proposed a solution to the gap in finance available to address their needs in the form of a Loss and Damage Finance Facility (LDFF). They said the LDFF will be able "to provide new financial support under Article 9 of the Paris Agreement (PA), in addition to adaptation and mitigation finance, to developing countries to address loss and damage." However, an agreement could not be secured for the LDFF's establishment or a process to do so. Instead, the Glasgow Dialogue was established but with no clear milestones and outcomes. Responding to the loss and damage facility, Minister Gaston Browne, the chair of Alliance of Small Island States, said establishing the loss and damage fund signals that the cost and the burden of the climate crisis will no longer be borne solely by the governments and people most vulnerable to the impacts of Climate Change. "It is a step toward climate justice," he said. "On the loss and damage fund, we reaffirm the fund must be an operating entity under the financial mechanism of the UNFCC with new, additional adequate and public finance," the official said. The Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, Simon Stiell, said: "We have established the fund that will form one pillar that will work to assure that loss and damage is addressed." "We have determined a way forward on a decades-long conversation on loss and damage." Speaking about the year ahead, COP President Shoukry said: "We leave Sharm El-Sheikh with renewed hope in the future of our planet, with an even stronger collective will and more determination to achieve the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. "We've just adopted the landmark Sharm El-Sheikh Mitigation Ambition and Implementation Work Programme that will hugely contribute to keeping 1.5 within reach, and I trust that we all know what needs to be done to safeguard 1.5 and ensure that we never go beyond."

Africa's biggest economy has expressed an early interest in the United States carbon offset plan that would allow corporations to fund renewable energy projects in developing countries that are struggling to transition away from fossil fuels. The plan called the Energy Transition Accelerator was announced by John Kerry, US Presidential Envoy for Climate, in partnership with philanthropic groups like the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bezos Earth Fund and will be finalized over the coming year. 'We are interested in the US plan for carbon offset. We are open to supports and partnerships with countries that have already advanced in terms of establishing a functional carbon offset plan,' Salisu Mohammed Dahiru, director general of the Nigeria Climate Change Council, confirmed to BusinessDay at the sideline of an event at COP27 . Kerry had mentioned on Wednesday that Nigeria and Chile are among the developing countries that have expressed early interest in the carbon offset plan. Kerry's announcement came as the world awaited the outcome of the US midterm elections, with climate campaigners hoping Democrat President Joe Biden's $370 billion green energy legislation would not be thwarted even if Republicans take one or both houses. The US carbon offset plan has since received criticism from environmentalists, who said it mirrors a failed offset system created decades ago. They noted that it could funnel billions of dollars from the private sector into the economies of developing countries working to shift to renewable power sources like wind or solar, that would have happened anyway. The environmentalists argued that the proposal lacked details and could ultimately undermine efforts to reduce global emissions. Plans like this would get vulnerable countries like Nigeria to buy in because they want to adapt to the climate change crisis. 'The US carbon offset plan would only ensure that polluters go free. The US is just going out of the support they have mentioned in previous COPs of their $100 billion commitment,' said Adenike Oladosu, an environmentalist and the founder of I Lead Climate Action. 'They should keep up with it rather than come with a plan as an excuse,' Oladosu said. In August, Yemi Osinbajo, Nigeria's vice president, launched the country's Energy Transition Plan (ETP) to establish Nigeria's strategy to reach a net-zero emissions energy system by 2060. The country's energy sector accounts for about 65 percent of Nigeria's total greenhouse gas emissions, according to experts. And since its launch, the ETP has received a commendation from experts and environmentalists. \</doc>

COP27 just like the ones before it, is sounding alarm bells for the end to the use of fossil fuels as energy and power sources. COP, acronym for 'Conference of the Parties' which in turn is a short form of ' United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties' under the watch of UNFCCC secretariat tasked with supporting the global response to the threat of climate change. The ultimate objective of all agreements under the UNFCCC is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system, in a time frame which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development. Fossil fuels are the greatest contributors to the threat of climate change; so the world is uniting to stop their applications; embracing cleaner renewable energies, SUN, WIND and HYDRO. What is Nigeria's position vis-\'e0-vis our abundance deposit of fossil fuels including natural gas? Nigeria is a country plagued by complex overlapping challenges, including Dutch Disease (resource curse). This informs the country's inability to harness our abundant natural gas resource for power generation. Worst is that about 80% of our foreign exchange earnings is from oil and gas sales. So, the idea of world pivoting away from fossil fuels is unsettling us. We should not be in panic mode, and must avoid making irrational decisions. President Muhammadu Buhari has said Nigeria would explore nuclear energy to generate electricity. The President spoke at the just concluded International Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Power in the 21st Century held in Washington DC; between 26 and 28 October 2022 few days before the start of COP27 at Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt on 6th November 2022. Buhari, who spoke through the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Sen. Adeleke Mamora, said like most other nations on the continent, Nigeria, with a population of over 200 million people, had a serious energy supply deficit, making it compelling for the government to critically look towards other energy options that were affordable, more environmentally friendly and sustainable. While Nigeria should aim for diversity in its power sources, nuclear power plants are very expensive to construct and fraught with serious risks; diversification does not start with the most expensive and risky option. There is no perfect energy source. Each and every one has its own advantages and compromises. Nuclear power is once again considered a prominent alternative, because it's now being touted as a more environmentally beneficial solution since it emits far fewer greenhouse gases during electricity generation than coal or other fossil fuel (including gas) burning power plants. Radiation isn't easily dealt with, especially in nuclear waste and maintenance materials, and expensive solutions are needed to contain, control, and shield both people and the environment from its harm. In several respects, nuclear and fossil fuel-burning power plants are similar; they both use heat to generate steam and drive turbines to produce electricity. They mainly differ in where their heat comes from; a nuclear reactor uses radioactive decay, and a fossil-fuel plant burns coal, oil or natural gas. In addition to the technical differences between the two approaches, they affect the environment differently: Fossil-fuel plants are notorious for greenhouse gas emissions, whereas nuclear reactors are known for radioactive waste. All utility scale nuclear power plants simply use the reactor as a 'nuclear boiler' to raise the steam which is then used to drive conventional steam turbine powered generators using the Rankine Steam cycle in much the same way as the fossil fuel. Instead of burning fossil fuel to provide the heat source in the boiler, heat is generated in a nuclear reactor by the controlled nuclear fission of unstable isotopes of heavy metals such as uranium. Back in the 1950s, nuclear power held out the promise of abundant electricity 'too cheap to meter,' or almost free. But today, utilities are encountering something they never expected: Natural-gas-fired power plants are cheaper to run than nuclear units. Nigeria is arguably a gas-resource country with huge gas reserves. It has proven gas reserves of about 184tcf broken into 95tcf associated gas and 89tcf non-associated gas and estimated as the world's 7th largest gas reserves. What is the quantity of our uranium deposit, as major feedstock to nuclear power plants? A nuclear power station is resource-hungry and, apart from the fuel, uses many rare metals in its construction. One nuclear reactor plant requires about 20.5 km2 (7.9 mi2) of land to accommodate the nuclear power station itself, its exclusion zone, its enrichment plant, ore processing, and supporting infrastructure. Secondly, nuclear reactors need to be located near a massive body of coolant water, but away from dense population zones and natural disaster zones. We are better off investing in other energy solutions that are truly scalable, especially gas-powered plants. It is pertinent to note that the developed economies sponsoring COPs are playing double standard and are not quite keen at abandoning fossil fuels. Europe includes natural gas and nuclear in the E.U.'s sustainable energy taxonomy. Europe's taxonomy is its classification system for defining 'environmentally sustainable economic activities' for investors, policymakers and companies. Two of the largest emitters, China and India, plan to increase emissions until 2030. They've argued that their growing economies need the support of fossil fuels, as other wealthier countries have historically done. Nigeria should therefore make the most of what we have, natural gas, to get what we want, steady power supply. We require a solution with a very short lead time, in order to meet our electricity needs and the most viable is natural gas powered plants. The technology is being used extensively all over the world and is readily available. Stations could be erected, depending on required capacity, in a lead time of 1 - 3 years as opposed to the nuclear stations that require 6 - 8 years lead time. By and large, we should embrace other renewable and sustainable energy, especially, SUN, WIND and HYDRO. In the words of Thomas Alva Edison: 'We are like tenant farmers chopping down the fence around our house for fuel when we should be using Nature's inexhaustible sources of energy - sun, wind and tide. - I'd put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don't have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.' \</doc>

Download logo Events, irrespective of their size, are a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and sustainability impacts. With an aim to facilitate eco-friendly events and designed to evaluate events' sustainability performance, the Gulf Organisation for Research & Development (GORD), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) secretariat and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) have developed an online Green Events Tool (GET). This platform was first introduced at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland in 2021. The GET's online portal was unveiled in a virtual ceremony held on 14 September 2022, marked by the presence of representatives from GORD, the UNFCCC secretariat, and UNEP. Dignitaries speaking at the event included Dr. Yousef Alhorr, Founding Chairman of GORD, Ms. Isabella Marras, Senior Programme Officer Interagency Affairs, UNEP, and Mr. Connor Barry, Manager, Engagement sub-division, UNFCCC secretariat. Addressing the audience attending the launch event, Dr. Alhorr said, "Last year at COP26, we together introduced this forward-looking solution to the world. As COP27 draws closer, we are proud to deliver on our promise and offer an end-to-end solution aimed at greening the events globally. Between COP26 and now, GET has undergone extensive road testing from various organizations and event organizers. The fact that the portal is ready in less than a year after initial introduction is a testament to the stakeholders' dedication and commitment to climate action and sustainability. "GET's web portal has been developed through a highly process-centric and transparent approach. And while its planning and development has taken years of research and hard work, GET's intrinsic value lies in simplifying the arduous processes needed to evaluate and improve events' sustainability profiles" Dr. Alhorr added. With the GET online portal now accessible to the public, organizations can work towards their climate mitigation targets by greening their events. The platform helps event organizers systematically evaluate the GHG emission profile and sustainability impacts of the proposed event at planning stage, to design mitigation activities, and to transparently report the actual sustainability impact and GHG emissions resulting from their events. Events supported by the GET go through a comprehensive assessment framework covering aspects related to venue construction, venue operation, flight, ground transportation, communication, audio-visual systems, production and exhibition, accommodation and catering. Mr. Barry from UNFCC said, "Born as a project to help the UN system plan and deliver more sustainable events, the Green Events Tool evolved to become an instrument available to all interested stakeholders globally. We hope that it will contribute to reducing the impact of the events we all deliver, and look forward to users' feedback to keep improving it and expanding it." Ms. Marras of UNEP said, "The UN system has a firm commitment to reduce its climate and environmental footprint and to align with the UNFCCC recommendations to limit Global Warming to 1.5 degrees. Events are a key part of how the UN operates and delivers on its mandates. For this reason, the GET is a vital tool to assist the UN system in meeting its commitments and reporting responsibilities. Beyond increasing environment sustainability, encouraging the use of virtual or hybrid events has the added benefits of increasing inclusiveness, accessibility and gender equality. We are excited this tool is now available for organizations in the UN system and beyond." The core purpose of the GET is to encourage actions to reduce the negative impacts of events, including their carbon footprint, at the planning and implementation stages. This is achieved by documenting activities that impact sustainability aspects and GHG emissions, and the calculation of GHG emissions (carbon footprint). It also allows for transparent reporting of the calculated carbon footprint and actions to address sustainability; third-party verification process (optional but encouraged) to receive a sustainability rating; and recommending the use of high-quality carbon credits to compensate for unavoidable GHG emissions.

Download logo COP27 will be held in Egypt, from 6 to 18 November 2022. While the aim of COP26 in Glasgow was to raise global ambition, in particular regarding the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the United Nations Synthesis Report indicates that the States' commitments are not yet sufficient. COP27 must therefore be a conference to deepen ambitions and implementation, in order to maintain the possibility of limiting global warming to 1.5&deg;C. As it is being held in Africa, this meeting of the Conference of the Parties should also reflect solidarity and cooperation between developed and developing countries. The conclusions of Volumes I to III of the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicate that the rising of the average global temperature is clear, it is accelerating and the signs of warming that have been observed are almost entirely due to human activity. This high-speed global warming increases threats to international prosperity and security. Rising sea levels, more intense and frequent extreme weather events, falling agricultural yields and the proliferation of pathogens are described by the IPCC as direct consequences of climate change. The IPCC does however highlight that there is still a short window to limit warming to 1.5&deg;C, if States swiftly and significantly reduce their emissions by 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by mid-century. To speed up global efforts on emissions reduction, France and the European Union are calling for a robust mitigation working programme to be drawn up at COP27 . France and the EU have committed to reaching climate neutrality in 2050, and presented plans to reduce their emissions that are consistent with this commitment. The European Union has taken the most tangible, operational and committed measures. The European Council meeting of December 2020 committed to reducing net greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990. This target should enable climate neutrality to be reached by 2050, a goal adopted by the European Council in December 2019. In the first half of 2022, various aspects of the European Green Deal, under which these commitments fall, were put in place, in particular the key texts in the legislative package known as "Fit for 55", for the implementation of the European Union's nationally determined contribution (NDC). Trilogues commenced under the Czech Presidency of the EU with a view to concluding a political agreement as swiftly as possible on the texts, for implementation in 2023, of the new European climate framework. The energy crisis exacerbated by the war in Ukraine led to the adoption of the RePower EU strategy, which aims to strengthen the EU's energy independence while accelerating its energy transition schedule. Furthermore, France is active in every area of climate diplomacy and supports multi-stakeholder coalitions (States, local government bodies, civil society, and the private sector), such as the International Solar Alliance, the High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People, and the Alliance for the Conservation of Rainforests. The &laquo; One Planet &raquo; summits, launched at the initiative of the President of the Republic in 2017, have become a forum for the financial commitment of States, local governments, international organizations, businesses, private banks and insurance companies. At COP27 , France is defending its coalitions of private and public financers, supporting the climate and biodiversity, with the ambition of preserving our only planet. France is contributing its diplomacy to help its partners who are the most exposed to the effects of climate change, especially in Africa. International climate finance is a major subject at COP27 . Advanced economies, which are responsible for the majority of past greenhouse gas emissions, have a duty in terms of solidarity with developing countries. Climate finance raised by developed countries for developing countries enables cooperation so that every country may be equipped with the most effective technologies and practices to reduce their emissions and adapt to climate change. For example, France is one of the main contributors to the Just Energy Transition Partnership established with South Africa on the sidelines of COP26. This partnership will enable South Africa to decarbonize its economy in exchange for financial and technical support from several countries. Discussions are underway to replicate this type of partnership with other countries. What is France doing for climate finance? The European Union and its Member States are the main providers of climate finance. France has committed to increasing its public climate finance in developing economies from &euro;3 billion in 2015 to &euro;5 billion in 2020. This objective was reached and exceeded in 2019. Since then, France has stepped up and extended its commitment made at COP21, increasing it to &euro;6 billion per year between 2021 and 2025, a third of which is dedicated to adaptation. France respects its promises: in 2021, it raised &euro;6.1 billion, &euro;2.2 billion of which was for adaptation. Furthermore, in a context where developing countries are calling for enhanced natural disaster response mechanisms, France supports the call of the United Nations Secretary-General to ensure early warning systems are in place in every country in the world: France announced that it would double its contribution to the CREWS initiative, increasing it to &euro;8 million per year. Launched by France at COP21, this initiative has already raised $100 million to create early warning systems in vulnerable countries. The Agence Fran\'e7aise de D&eacute;veloppement (AFD), an agency of the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs, implements a significant portion of France's climate finance, working directly with the most vulnerable countries. It is the first development bank that is 100% aligned with the Paris Agreement, as it ended financing for any project that goes against climate action. France's commitment also involves a major contribution to multilateral climate finance funds. Our country is one of the leading contributors to the Green Climate Fund, the main financial mechanism of the Paris Agreement, and the Global Environment Facility. French financing goes to tangible projects in various countries, such as financing for solar farms, the modernization of electricity networks, building clean public transport, and improving water supply. It also goes to forest conservation and the roll-out of early warning systems for disaster risks. In addition to finance provided by developed countries to developing countries, the alignment of public policies with the goals of the Paris Agreement should direct all public and private financial flows towards achieving the goals to limit global warming and to boost resilience.

By Usman Aliyu Nigerian Government has said that it was pushing for 400 billion dollars commitments from developed countries and partners on climate change to finance its Energy Transition Plan (ETP). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that implementable negotiations continues on Tuesday at Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, venue of the global conference on climate change otherwise known as COP27 . Minister of Environment, Mohammed Abdullahi, disclosed this to NAN on the sideline of the annual global event. Abdullahi, who led the Nigeria delegation to the climate change conference, said that the country expected very positive affirmative commitment when it came to funding to mitigate the challenge arising from climate change effect. "We expect very positive affirmative commitment from partners and developed countries. We intend to push that in our discourse and engagement virtually with every party and our partners. "It depends on which sector we are talking about. If it is ETP, we are looking at $400 billion. If it is loss and damage, we are looking much more than that because it affects the entire developing countries. "When it comes to other specifics like our efforts in the Sahel to do with the Great Green Wall, we are looking towards 18.5 billion Euros that was pledged by President (Emmanuel) Macron (of France) under the One Planet Summit. "So, it depends on the specifics. Funding naturally will focus on specific thematic areas," said the Minister. Related News The leader of the delegation, however, noted that Nigeria would not just abandon oil and gas under the global energy transition demand. "We are not abandoning oil and gas; that is why we have the energy transition plan. The energy transition plan envisages first and foremost that fossil fuels, Nigerian gas will be transition energy between now and 2035. "In other word, in between this period that we are relying on our oil and gas industry, we are also developing pari-passu, an independent energy transition that is aimed at reaching renewable; and majorly also, providing infrastructure for mini solar grids. "So what we are doing essentially is not just that we are abandoning our oil and gas, but we have to have a plan that considers all garments of energy available to the country." On compensation for loss and damage arising from the climate change impact, Abdullahi explained that it was an agenda of the developing countries and not Nigeria alone. "We are looking at loss and damage as a developing countries agenda and not Nigeria alone. What is happening in most part of developing countries is an outcome of industrialisation, and the use negatively of the industrial priorities at the detriment of African country as well as the developing. "So we are saying loss and damage, they should bear the quantum of this damage we are going through. They should bear the financial burden so that they can mitigate what we are going through. "So we are looking at between $500 billion to $1 trillion to support developing countries to face the challenges of loss and damage. "So this recent flooding you see in Nigeria and other parts of the continent is as a result of the activities that are not related to any African countries," he said. \</doc>

Daniel Kanu After critical observation of climate change talks and commitment level indicator, Friends of the Earth International (FoEi) has scored the climate negotiations in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt as low on progress even with more talk by the United States and other rich countries. The federation, in a press briefing on November 18 as the talks drew to a close decried the lack of progress in the Loss and Damage Finance discussion and the crucial climate pledge of $100bn by rich countries that is yet to be met. Speakers at the event included Meena Ramam of Friends of the Earth Malaysia, Tatiana Roa of Friends of the Earth Colombia, Karen Orenstein, Friends of the Earth US, Soumya Dutta, Friends of the Earth India, and moderated by Sara Shaw of Friends of the Earth International. "Dangerous references to carbon removal, ocean geoengineering & nature based offsets have been brought up in talks on #CarbonMarkets. What we've seen from these projects in India & worldwide is devastation of forest, lands & livelihoods for so many people." Tatiana Roa, Friends of the Earth Colombia said: The real and true zero emissions is to leave hydrocarbons and coal in the subsoil. #ClimateJustice & a just energy transition will only be possible with system change that addresses injustices for the most vulnerable people." Karen Orenstein of Friends of the US said: The US is generally not a fair player in the UNFCCC, but here they are outstandingly bad. Even if the US can't contribute to a #LossAndDamage fund, they should not block the rest of the world from setting it up. They must get out of the way!" \</doc>

The UN Climate Change Conference in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt, should shift the world towards implementation of previously agreed plans to tackle humanity's greatest challenge, Simon Stiell, the new Executive Secretary of the UN Climate Convention (UNFCCC), said on Sunday at the opening of COP27 . The UN climate chief said leaders -be they Presidents, Prime Ministers or CEOs - would be held to account for promises they made last year in Glasgow. "Because our policies, our businesses, our infrastructure, our actions, be they personal or public, must be aligned with the Paris Agreement and with the [UN Climate] Convention", he underscored. The UNFCCC convention entered into force on 21 March 1994 to prevent "dangerous" human interference with the climate system. Today, ratified by 198 countries, it has near-universal membership. The Paris Agreement, agreed in 2016, works as an extension of that convention. Deliver what has been promised Acknowledging the current complex geopolitical situation, Mr. Stiell said that COP27 is an opportunity to create a safe political space, shielded from whatever is going on "out there", to work and deliver world change. "Here in Sharm el-Sheikh, we have a duty to speed up our international efforts to turn words into actions", he emphasized. The UNFCCC Executive Secretary underlined three critical lines of action for the Conference: Demonstrate a transformation shift to implementation by putting negotiations into concrete actions. Cement progress on the critical workstreams - mitigation, adaptation, finance and crucially - loss and damage. Enhance the delivery of the principles of transparency and accountability throughout the process. "I welcome detailed plans on how we deliver what we have promised", he told delegates. Mr. Stiell, dubbing himself an "accountability chief", stated that 29 countries have now come forward with tightened national climate plans since COP26, five more since the publication of last week's UNFCCC NDC Synthesis report, but still not a majority. "So here I am now, looking out at 170 countries that are due to be revisiting and strengthening their national pledges this year," he said. He reminded delegates that last year the Glasgow Climate Pact was agreed at COP26, and he expected them not to rescind their word. "Stick to your commitments. Build on them here in Egypt. I will not be a custodian of back-sliding," he said. An inclusive process In words that drew an ovation in the plenary room, the UN climate chief underscored that women and girls must be placed at the centre of climate decision-making and action. "Their empowerment leads to better governance and better outcomes," he said, also highlighting the importance of civil society organizations and the youth in the COP27 process. New Presidency Alok Sharma, President of COP26 representing the United Kingdom, passed the baton officially to the new Egyptian President, Sameh Shoukry, during the opening plenary. Mr. Sharma reviewed the achievements made at Glasgow last year, such as finalising the so-called Paris Rulebook - the the guidelines for how that Agreement is delivered - and making stronger finance commitments. According to the COP26 President, if all commitments made last year, including the net-zero pledges, were to be implemented, the world would be on a path to 1.7 degrees Celsius warming by the end of the century. "Still not 1.5C, but progress," he said, recognising the scale of the challenge that the world is facing. Echoing Mr. Stiell, he urged leaders to act, despite current geopolitical challenges. Egypt urges implementation COP27 President Sameh Shoukry called on delegates to scale up ambition and begin implementing the promises already made. "Moving from negotiations and pledges to an era of implementation is a priority," he said, later commending the countries which have already shared updated national climate plans. Mr. Shoukry added that the $100 billion promised for adaptation by developed countries to developing countries should be delivered, and finance must be also at the centre of discussion. "The negotiations [during the next two weeks] will hopefully be fruitful. I urge all of you to listen carefully and commit to implementation and to turn political commitments into agreements and understandings and texts and resolutions that we can all implement," he underscored. He also warned that "zero-sum games will have no winners" and that the implications of the negotiations will affect the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the world suffering the impact of climate change. "We cannot afford any negligence or shortcomings; we cannot threaten the future of upcoming generations", he emphasised. Loss and damage Also on Sunday, the agenda items that will be discussed over the next two weeks at COP27 were agreed during the procedural opening. 'Loss and damage', an item that was still uncertain ahead the conference, finally made it into the agenda after being put forward by negotiators from the Group of the 77 and China (which essentially includes all developing nations) and after extensive discussions among the 194 parties to the UN Climate Convention. Climate change, through extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones, desertification and rising sea levels, causes costly damage to countries. Because the intensification of these otherwise "natural disasters" is being caused by the rise in greenhouse gas emissions, mostly from rich industrialized countries, developing countries - often the most affected - have long argued that they should receive compensation. The issue of these payments, known as "loss and damage" now will be a major topic of discussion at COP27 Distributed by APO Group on behalf of UN News.

"The Russian war brought an acute food crisis to the world, which hit worst those countries suffering from the existing manifestations of climate change \- catastrophic droughts, large-scale floods." \\xa0 Volodymyr Zelenskyy on November 8, 2022 There is likely to be no person in the world today who would deny not knowing what it feels like to experience an extreme weather event. In whichever part of the globe one resides, there is a painful pinch from Mother Nature. If it is not the cold; it is the heat \- or the floods, or the hurricanes and typhoons, as the case may be. Indeed, climate change is not a stranger to any time zone. That is also the same way the world is fighting climate change \- from every corner of planet Earth. It began in 1992 when the United Nations organised the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, wherein the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was adopted. In this treaty, nations agreed to "stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to prevent dangerous interference from human activity on the climate system." So far, 197 different parties have signed it. Since 1994, when the treaty entered into force, every year, the UN has been bringing together almost every country on earth for global climate summits or "COPs", which stands for "Conference of the Parties." During these meetings, nations have negotiated various extensions of the original treaty to establish legally binding limits on emissions. For example, the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 and the Paris Agreement adopted in 2015, in which all countries of the world agreed to step up efforts to try and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures, and boost climate action financing. This year marks the 27th\\xa0annual summit, or COP27 , and it is taking place in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt, from November 6 to 18. Observers and organisers of COP27 have branded the conference as an "African COP" where the positions of African countries on issues like finance for adapting to climate change or moving to renewable energy sources will be central to the talks. The dream is already coming true, for instance, with the launching of the African Carbon Markets Initiative, just two days into the COP. However, there is something else that Africa, and indeed the world, should be giving more attention to: The environmental fallout of the ongoing war in Ukraine. From all indications, it has worsened the climate crisis while erasing most of the gains from previous COPs. From February 24, 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine and the world stood helplessly and watched, it has been a bloody trail of bad news for the environmental sector. The invasion has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths of people on both sides, and caused Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II. It triggered global food shortages, and brought about an energy crisis that has forced dozens of countries to resume coal-fired power generation in order to lower energy prices for their people. Military emissions of Carbon dioxide (one of the gases that cause climate change) has reached hundreds of million tonnes and undermined the goals of the Paris Agreement. Eastern Ukraine is a highly industrialised area with more than 900 facilities and production centres, including coal mines, oil refineries, chemical labs, steel plants among others. Direct hits and explosions result in leakages of hazardous materials that poison air, water, and soils. According to a report by Joe McCarthy of the Global Citizen, entitled, "How Russia's invasion of Ukraine is harming water, air, soil, and wildlife," as of April 1, 2022, more than 36 attacks were registered on fossil fuel infrastructures, 29 attacks on electricity stations, seven on water infrastructures, and six on nuclear sites. The number of attacks on industrial centres made international observers and the Ukrainian government to identify them as ecocide. For instance, on March 21, ammonia reservoirs at Sumykhimprom were hit. The resultant leakage covered an area 2.5km in radius, and the people of Novoselitsa village were told to hide in shelters. Indubitably, there are other far-reaching areas that the war has impacted. Global food security is threatened as Ukrainian grain supply is cut off. European countries are running helter-skelter, looking for alternative energy sources for their citizens, as the\\xa0winter season approaches. The fight against climate change has almost ground to a halt as world powers revert to dirty fuel sources. In fact, last week, Zimbabwe began coal supply to China. According to preliminary data, it will take Ukraine's nature at least 15 years to rebuild; but certainly it will take the world half a century to recover from the ecological backlash of the Russian invasion. For those that follow climate negotiations, there is a feeling of disappointment because of what the rich nations are doing to adapt to the impacts of the Ukrainian war. These COP signatories, who had pledged to shut down their fossil fuel plants as commitment to the climate treaty, are reopening them. Climate change is a secondary consideration; survival is the first. The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said it all in his speech to the world at the Egypt COP. He asked, "Who will care, for example, about the amount of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere if part of Europe or the Middle East, and possibly Northern Africa, God forbid, are covered by a radiation cloud after an accident in Zaporizhzhia (nuclear plant)?" His conclusion was that there can be no effective climate policy without peace on the Earth because nations are thinking only about how to protect themselves here and now from the threats created as a result of the Russian invasion. Zelenskyy then made a proposal to COP27 : Create a global platform to assess the impact of military actions on climate and environment. Here, I wish to remind everyone that such a platform already exists. What remains is the political will to enlarge its scope and also empower it with enough teeth to be able to enforce global compliance. On November 5, 2001, the United Nations General Assembly declared November 6 of each year as the International Day for Preventing the Exploitation of the Environment in War and Armed Conflict. Fundamentally, the UN recognises that though humanity has always counted its war casualties in terms of dead and wounded soldiers and civilians, destroyed cities and livelihoods, the environment has often remained the unpublicised victim of war. Water wells have been polluted, crops burnt, forests cut down, soils poisoned, and animals killed to gain military advantage. The United Nations Environment Programme has found that over the last 60 years, at least 40 per cent of all internal conflicts have been linked to the exploitation of natural resources, whether high-value resources such as timber, diamonds, gold and oil, or scarce resources such as fertile land and water. Zelenskyy claims that the Russian war has destroyed 5 million acres of forests in Ukraine in less than six months. The question is, does the UN have the force to stop further environmental damage by sanctioning Russia? \</doc>

Nigeria's minister of Environment and ministers from nine African countries will today sign the Africa Sustainable Commodities Initiative Declaration, a single set of principles for the responsible production of agricultural commodities in Africa. The Africa Sustainable Commodities Initiative (ASCI) puts producer countries in Africa at the forefront of defining the principles for the sustainable development of cocoa, rubber, palm oil, coffee, and other commodities, in a way that protects livelihoods and protects natural resources, including forests. ASCI build and expand upon principles agreed upon at COP22 in 2016 for the palm oil sector. The Marrakesh Declaration for Sustainable Development of the Palm Oil Sector acknowledged the role of agricultural commodity development as a driver of deforestation while emphasising the critical role of forests and forest conservation in addressing climate change. 'From CoP22 in 2016, when the Marrakesh Declaration was signed, we saw huge progress at COP26 in 2021 where every country demonstrated crucial milestones to achieve the sustainable development of palm oil,' said Abraham Baffoe, global and Africa director of Proforest. 'Many countries have recognised the need to work across multiple commodities so the launch of ASCI is an important progression, as a truly multi-stakeholder initiative, with every country engaging at the regional, national and local level throughout the process,' Baffoe said. Read also: COP27 Ministers agreed that the issues being addressed in palm oil were the same in other commodities, catalysing the transition to the Africa Sustainable Commodities Initiative to ensure all sectors are aligned to drive positive outcomes for people, nature and climate. 'We need the guardians of the forests - national governments and local communities - to own and lead solutions on the ground that integrate agricultural commodity production and local livelihoods with forest protection,' Baffoe said. 'Embedding those rights and protection in laws and regulation will provide an enabling environment where we can continue to build capacity, readying the way for further investment and scale.' The Marrakesh Declaration has been implemented through the African Palm Oil Initiative (APOI), comprised of ten countries in West and Central Africa: Cameroon, Central African Republic, C\'f4te d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Edo State (Nigeria), Gabon, Ghana, Liberia, Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone. These countries account for 25 percent of the world's tropical forests and 75 percent of Africa's forests. An initiative of the Tropical Forest Alliance, the APOI is facilitated by Proforest, who will be supporting the Africa-led Africa Sustainable Commodities Initiative. Governments have recognised the potential for growth in the production of palm oil, cocoa and other agricultural commodities to meet increasing global demand and to contribute to food security and better livelihoods for millions of Africans while protecting the region's remaining rainforests. Diversification of food production also provides resilience and improves each country's food security as well as helping to offset the impact of climate change. The Congo Basin alone can hold 30 billion tonnes of carbon, equivalent to three years of global fuel emissions; and its forests are essential for regional climate stability. The signing in Sharm El-Sheik will take place at the Ghana Pavilion, attended by Ministers from the signatory countries. \</doc>

The world needs a new social contract,' ILO's Director-General, Gilbert F. Houngbo told members of the ILO's Governing Body at the opening session of their last meeting of 2022. Contained in his first address to the Governing Body since taking up office, the Director-General said, 'The founding values of the ILO in 1919 remain relevant. I pledge to do my utmost to defend these founding values of the ILO - our common values of peace, social justice, equitable economic growth and solidarity, while respecting and protecting the environment.' Houngbo went on to call for a 'Global Coalition for Social Justice' to face the challenges currently disrupting the world of work. The coalition would entail the participation of a wide range of stakeholders and would work to 'facilitate and strengthen collaboration and collective action, and serve as a framework for policy coherence on social justice at the wider multilateral level and beyond,' he told delegates. The meeting of the Governing Body also discussed issues arising from the 110th Session (2022) of the International Labour Conference concerning decent work and the social and solidarity economy and the inclusion of a safe and healthy working environment in the ILO's framework of fundamental principles and rights at work. In addition, it would look at ensuring decent work in supply chains and promoting productivity systems for decent work, among many other items on its 47-point agenda. The Governing Body is the executive council of the ILO. It meets three times a year in Geneva to take decisions on ILO policy and establish the programme and budget. The 346th session runs from October 31 to November 10, 2022. Also, the ILO has launched the first Green Jobs for Youth Pact at the UN Climate Change Conference in Egypt, also known as COP27 . The launch was a strategic step to accelerate green job creation for youth as well as the Just Transition Finance Tool on Banking and Investment Activities and opened the Just Tradition Pavilion. The Youth Pact, a partnership with the UN and other agencies, aims to close the skills gap for young people in developing countries and target climate vulnerable sectors. Its goals include creating one million green jobs, supporting the greening of one million existing jobs, and helping 10,000 green entrepreneurs. The Pact is part of the ILO's work to promote a Just Transition to a more sustainable and greener future. It brings together the ILO, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the European Commission, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), and the children and youth constituency of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (YOUNGO) and LinkedIn. During the launch ceremony, on November 9, Moustapha Kamal Gueye, Global Coordinator for Green Jobs at the ILO, reminded the participants that, 'investments in the green economy including clean and renewable energy, construction, sustainable agriculture, would create 8.4 million jobs for young people by 2030.' On November 10, the ILO, together with the London School of Economics Grantham Research Institute for Climate Change and Environment, launched the Just Transition Finance Tool on Banking and Investment Activities. Speaking at the launch, Vic Van Vuuren, Director of the Enterprises Department at the ILO, said, 'We are seeing first movers, we are seeing concrete actions coming from the financial sector. But to move from the current nascent stage into mainstream, the sector can benefit from further guidance. We trust that the tool will support implementation of tangible measures.' The launch was hosted at the ILO's Just Transition Pavilion at COP27 . The Pavilion, the first of its kind, was officially open on that same day by Eric Oechslin, Director, Decent Work Team and Country Office, Cairo; Joost Korte, Director-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, European Commission and James Grabert, Director, Mitigation, United Framework Convention on Climate Change. The opening event, which brought together high level governments, international organisations and social partners, highlighted the key role of the new Pavilion in providing a platform for negotiators and all COP actors to engage in constructive ways to support the UNFCCC process. The Pavilion is also hosting a Knowledge Hub to boost knowledge sharing and foster exchanges between just transition practitioners and interested actors. \</doc>

Amid a call for urgent action to safeguard the continent from climate change, Gabon's President Ali Bongo Ondimba opened the 2022 Africa Climate Week by highlighting his country's efforts to boost climate action and calling for continuous collective efforts. "For more than ten years, we have intensified our efforts to protect our remarkable forestry heritage and build a low-carbon economy," Ondimba said. "Consequently, Gabon, which has already achieved the objectives set by the Paris Agreement, is considered the most carbon-positive country in the world." More than 1200 delegates attended the event, which opened in Libreville, Gabon on Monday, 29 August. The conference is providing a crucial platform for the continent to address social inequalities and invest in development to advance climate action and safeguard people and ecosystems. In her address, Patricia Janet Scotland, secretary-general of the Commonwealth of Nations, said: "If we choose, we can be the solution we need, Africa can be the answer. And this is our time. We are the first generation to suffer the consequences of climate change but we are the last generation able to do anything about it." Egyptian Foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, the designated president of COP27 , said that Africans should work to secure climate, given the disproportionate impact climate change is projected to have on Africa as compared to other regions. He said: "African governments and all other African voices, be they civil society, youth, women's groups, farmers, workers, academia and the thriving African private sector, should all continue to call for climate justice." The African Union's Commissioner for Rural Economy and Agriculture Josefa Sacko, urged African countries to maintain a common stance as the continent tackles the impacts of climate change to achieve its long-term goals. COP27 , which will be held in Egypt in November 2022. The opening session featured a ministerial dialogue on the challenges of mobilizing and accessing climate finance at scale to spur the implementation of countries' Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and priority national climate plans and strategies. Kevin Kariuki, African Development Bank Group Vice President for Power, Energy, Climate & Green Growth, said, "For us, a just transition is all about greening the economy in such a way that it is fair and inclusive, and that ensures the costs and benefits of the transition to low carbon and climate-resilient development are shared across the entire economy." The African Development Bank's 2022 Africa Economic Outlook report projects that Africa will need as much as $1.6 trillion between 2020-2030 to implement its climate action commitments and NDCs. The African Development Bank has committed to mobilizing $25 billion for climate finance by 2025; more than 50% of that funding will be allocated to adaptation projects. A representative of the youth, Omnia El Omrani, said that commitments to climate action in Africa needed accelerating. "It's time for real action. Let this generation be the last generation to face the climate crisis," El Omrani said. Africa Climate Week, one of a series of regional climate weeks, gives a voice to a range of actors and partners: civil society, women, local communities and financial institutions. The event offers a forum for discussion on how to contribute most effectively to COP27 and achieve the Paris agreement objectives. \</doc>

Nigeria, Nov. 7 -- Egypt's President Abdel El-sisi on Monday called for an end to the ongoing Russian-Ukraine war. "Please allow me to say this in all respect, this war must stop; this war and the suffering it has caused must finish. This is a sincere appeal," he said. Mr El-sisi made this appeal while delivering his welcome speech during the leaders' summit at the ongoing 27th Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) taking place in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. "Of course, we must act, we are urged to act and much is expected from us because the crisis shakes the entire world," he noted. He noted that Egypt, which is not one of the strongest economically, suffered greatly from the covid pandemic over two years and is again suffering due to the Russia-Ukraine crisis. "This is an unnecessary war. I imagine of course that the entire world is suffering because of the war between Russia and Ukraine and so I would like to appeal to you," Mr El-sisi appealed. He added; "it is not that I want to play a particular role in this affair but of course, like many others, I'm ready to act to ensure the end of this war and I am sure that many of you share my opinion and I believe that all of us believe that we must put an end to this war." Russia and Ukraine have been at war since 24 February when Russia attacked Ukraine, its neighbour with claims of denazification. 257 days later, the war has continued with over 14 million people displaced; children out of school including Nigerian students; Ukraine is currently out of power supply in some regions. 15 per cent of Ukraine's territory was annexed by Russia; until August, grain exportation was cut off, plunging most of the developing world into a food crisis. The war has also led to an unprecedented energy crisis in Europe. UN chief, Antonio Guterres, in a passive reaction to Mr El-sis who spoke before him, said indeed the war in Ukraine and other conflicts have caused so much bloodshed, violence and dramatic impacts all over the world, "we cannot accept that our attention is not focused on climate change." "We must of course work together to support peace efforts and end tremendous suffering but climate change is on a different timeline and a different scale. It is a defining issue of our age," he said. Climate change, Mr Guterres noted, is a central challenge of our century, adding that it is unacceptable, outrageous and self-defeating to put it on the back burner. He said many of today's conflicts are linked with growing climate chaos and the war in Ukraine has exposed the profound risks of our fossil fuel addiction and today's crisis cannot be an excuse for backsliding or greenwashing. "If anything, there are reasons for greater urgency, stronger actions and effective accountability," he said. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Premium Times.

The National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency (NESREA) said it would\~ partner with OXFAM and Connected Development (CODE) on achieving net zero, climate change\~ and challenges in oil-bearing communities.Prof. Aliyu Jauro,\~ Director-General, NESREA said this in Abuja when the Civil Society Organisations paid an advocacy visit to the agency in Abuja .Jauro said that the agency had a set of regulations targeted at controlling ecosystem challenges like wetland, river banks and lake shores to ensure that whatever was done did not impact on the environment negatively.He added that there were also\~ regulations on\~ coastal and marine area protection, surface and ground water quality control, soil erosion and flood control, among others, to ensure good environment and\~ tackle climate change.He stressed the need for companies to abide by the guidelines of NESREA\~ to curb environmental hazards and for communities to benefit from extractive\~ resources."You\~ mentioned the National Action Plan as the guiding principle, which talks about how companies do their business\~ in relationship to the issue of human rights."There is what is called the Environmental Impact Assessment\~ which requires\~ the incorporation of social components and they are all issues of human rights;\~ so there is need for companies to abide by these\~ regulations in whatever they do ." There is also the corporate social responsibilities guideline,\~ these are the only ways we can reduce inequality which is very high in West Africa as it is mentioned that the entire wealth of West\~ Africa is in the hands of one per cent of the population."This is because\~ there is need to have a certain level of equality.In some developed countries, they found a way of taxing such rich people to bring\~ equality to the system, so there is\~ need for Nigeria to try and see how it could reduce the inequality gap."Jauro said that the agency would collaborate with the\~ CSOs to see how it could drive some of its policies and ensure companies abided by the guidelines, adding that\~ it was the only way to reduce inequality.Mr Henry Ushie, Project Coordinator,\~ Fiscal Accountability for Inequality Reduction OXFAM, said that\~ the CSOs were advocating for communities and countries to be environment conscious in terms of climate change adaptation and resilience .Ushie said that there was a new project\~ launched\~ in collaboration with\~ CODE and OXFAM aimed\~ to see how climate change\~ could be mainstreamed into\~ all conversations and brought to light ."We want to see how communities can also play their role in keeping their environment clean."The government made commitment to the United Nations Climate Change Conference , more commonly referred to as COP26\~ in 2021 to go net zero by 2060, 10 yeats ahead of the global commitment."So we want\~\~to see how agencies like NESREA and NOSDRA\~ are making concrete effort in terms of policy and practice to\~ get to that\~ point where we are able to say 'yes', we are net zero."He said that CODE's\~ Follow the Money initiative to track funds at the grassroots\~ would\~ play its role to track such expenditure on whether it was being targeted at reducing climate injustice, or promoting and ensuring the judicious use of the funds.Mr Hamzat Lawal, Chief Executive of CODE, said that as CSO leaders, it was important to\~ explore ways to collaborate with government because governments\~ served the people and CSOs\~ served the interests of the people.Lawal said that CODE was leading a \~campaign in collaboration\~ with OXFAM to look\~ at how the Nationa Action Plan (NAP) on Business and\~ Human Rights would be\~ implemented."

It has been one week since heads of state and government leaders, negotiators, climate activists, journalists, and civil society groups from more than 170 nations have come together to raise funds, make pledges, and negotiate on how to save the earth from global warming. The annual conference of parties, now in its 27th edition ( COP27 ) is of particular importance not just because it is the  implementation COP , or the largest COP summit ever, but also because it is being held in Africa - a continent most affected by the rapidly changing climate of the earth. The conference, presently held in Egypt, has been dubbed Africa\' s COP. One would ask why since the summit has previously been held in African countries like Morocco (2001 and 2016), Kenya (2006), and South Africa (2011). One can say it is being held on the continent at a time the devastating effects of climate change are ravaging the whole continent - from flooding in Nigeria, Western Africa, to drought in Somalia, Eastern Africa. And this is the best time yet to make demands and amplify their climate stories and realities to world leaders. Since last week, topics of discussion have bordered around six main issues: just transitions, food security, innovative finance for climate and development, investing in the future of energy, water security, and climate change and the sustainability of vulnerable communities. And this discussion is expected to last till the 18th of November, 2022. Below are some takeaways for African countries at the present conference so far. Loss and damage The  Loss and Damage agenda was adopted by the Conference of Parties at the opening plenary session of the COP27 conference led by Sameh Shoukry, COP27 president. The newly introduced  Loss and Damage concept would see countries that have contributed the most to climate change with their emissions pay poorer countries to recover from the resulting disasters suffered. To put it into context, the loss and damage fund would enable countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, and Nigeria, whose economy has been affected by flooding in recent times get paid for the loss and damages experienced. While the concept seems similar to the longstanding $100 climate finance, they are distinct. Loss represents economic impacts like lost agricultural production that can not be easily quantified, while damage captures the destruction of homes, roads, schools and other infrastructures that are calculable. Meanwhile, the $100 billion climate finance is to help poorer nations mitigate and adapt to climate change. Some funding announcements were made for loss and damage last week, but larger nations continue to push back on the funding proposals. For example, countries like Germany and Belgium have pledged to tackle climate loss and damage with \â¬ 170 million and \â¬ 2.5 million respectively. But it is not all rosy. The United States and European Union, which had been against poorer countries\' past attempts to secure loss and damage funding maintain their stance and claim they are already one of the largest contributors to climate finance Also, China said it would not pay into a climate loss and damage fund for developing nations. Historically, China has contributed to about 13% of the world\' s carbon emissions since the start of the industrial revolution, while the United States and the EU account for over 20% each. Notably, one of the biggest debates at the conference would be whether to create a dedicated financial mechanism for loss and damage. African multi-billion alliance for green infrastructure The African Union, African Development Bank Group and Africa50, in partnership with several global partners, launched the Alliance for Green Infrastructure in Africa (AGIA), an initiative to help scale and accelerate financing for green infrastructure projects in Africa. The mission is to raise significant capital to accelerate Africa\' s just and equitable transition to net zero emissions. With two strategic objectives in mind, the initiative would generate a robust pipeline of bankable projects and propel financing for Africa\' s green infrastructure. The alliance is seeking to raise up to $500 million for early-stage project development capital, with the goal of generating up to $10 billion in investment opportunities for the private sector. UK \Â£395 million investment in Nigeria\' s agricultural sector The United Kingdom announced it would invest \Â£395 million to advance climate-resilient agriculture in Nigeria. At least four million Nigerians, including two million women, are expected to benefit from this investment to increase productivity and adapt to the effects of climate change while reducing emissions. For a long time, agriculture has been integral to Nigeria\' s economy. It contributes as much as 23.7 per cent to its GDP and employs about 35 per cent of the population. But climate change and its accompanying effects, like intense droughts, heat waves, and floods, threaten agricultural productivity. Hence the need for farmers to practise climate-smart agriculture that would ensure food availability all year round regardless of the planting season. The investment, named Propcom+ is the UK government\' s investment in agriculture through the Propcom Mai-Karfi programme in Nigeria, set to help address key barriers to sustainable agricultural development in Nigeria.  It will support the development of climate-resilient agricultural policies, actions, and investments that deliver nutrition, increase productivity, adapt and build resilience while reducing emissions, and protect and restore natural ecosystems, the UK said. The \Â£395 million is part of the over \Â£3100 million investments by the UK to support developing economies to respond to climate-related disasters and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation pledges $1.4 billion to Africa Bill and Melinda Foundation has pledged $1.4 billion to Africa, including Nigeria, to spur the region-led innovation to build a resilient pipeline of climate-smart agriculture projects for smallholder farmers. The commitment is part of the foundation\' s efforts at global climate talks in Egypt to scale up the supply of  adaptation finance. Mr Enock Chikava, Interim Director, Agricultural Development of the foundation explained that while 2.1 million dollars is meant for research and development in the agriculture sector in Nigeria, the foundation plans to mobilise 9 million dollars for technologies that would help the region make a difference in livestock and crop. $350 million climate investment fund Kenya, Egypt, Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia and Tanzania, are among the first few countries that will receive funding from Nature, People and Climate Investment programme (NPC), a newly launched initiative by Climate Investment Fund (CIF). The $350 million was raised by Italy, the United Kingdom, and Sweden. The programme is focused on promoting and protecting natural environments integral to climate action, sustainable agriculture and food supply, healthy forests, resilient coastal systems and empowering indigenous people and local communities of these selected countries. \</doc>

The Nigerian Government has said that the $10bn cannot be sufficient to prosecute an energy transition as part of measures to mitigate climate change impact in the country. Minister of Environment, Barr. Mohammed Abdullahi said this at the ministerial media briefing in Abuja on the focus of Nigeria team to the conference of Parties ( COP ) 27 at Sharm El- Sheikh, Egypt in November. According to him: 'We have been able to strike some understanding with African countries to see that in COP27 , the issue of Africa transition is on the front burner, so as to attract fundings. 'That was why part of the case we are going to make, is to see that there is a softening of the conditions for access to these funds. Otherwise, African countries will be put in dire stress of trying to transit so quickly. 'We are attracting commitments to support our funding needs. And I can assure you $10 billion is not enough to support our transition, especially from infrastructure, transmission distribution, etc,' Abdullahi stated. COP27 logo was to drive the determination of Nigeria to push for the successful negotiations of interest of the country. Abdullahi stated that Nigeria team would not adopt a know-it-all approach but would as a leader of the African team cohesively advance the challenge of the continent on ensuring measures that would promote livelihood of the continent's population covering energy, health, agriculture, environment etc. On environment he pointed out that recent events underscored the urgency to address the issues of climate change globally and COP27 would not be allowed to go as a missed opportunity. His words: 'The focus will be on sustainable funding mechanism that drives nature-based solutions such as land restoration, reforestation, combating desertification, climate smart-agricultural practices as well as adaptation strategies. 'Nigeria will also seek collaboration and support on sustainable waste management, renewable and clean energy provision, and finance for loss and damage. Nigeria will push for developed countries to fulfil financial pledges to aid in tackling the climate crisis. 'He expected outcomes of Nigeria's participation will include increased partnership building that help Nigeria achieve its emission reduction targets, address adaptation and mitigation, establish sustainable financing for climate actions, resilience building, poverty eradication, energy transition and sustainable development. 'Nigeria, will not take a position of 'know it all' but will align with the West Africa region's identification of the thematic issues faced by the continent and the group's interim position on each which includes doubling adaptation finance by 2025; clarification on the support arrangements to address loss and damage; closing the climate financing gap; scaling up Africa's mitigation ambition and implementation; strengthening the linkage between technology and financial mechanisms; the global stock take on progress on the Paris Agreement; transparency; gender and climate change; agriculture; Article 6 and carbon pricing and Africa's unique needs and particular circumstance. 'At this COP, Nigeria will be including young professionals and youths to understudy the negotiators and advance Nigeria's position. This is part of the ongoing capacity building sessions by the Ministry in the development of its bank of Youth Negotiators. \</doc>

Nigeria, Oct. 19 -- Lawmakers from Nigeria, the Gambia, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Rwanda and Liberia on Wednesday met to discuss Africa's position on Climate Change ahead of the COP27 conference in Egypt. The lawmakers met virtually at a meeting convened by the Parliamentarians Call for Fossil Free Future. At the meeting, the lawmakers discussed the failure of world leaders to implement the agreement on Fossil Fuel reduction and also proffered a way forward for the continent. Buba Khan, a lawmaker from the Gambia, called for the lawmakers to join the Parliamentarians Call for Fossil Fuel-Free Future and present a united front at the COP27 conference. He said over 500 parliamentarians have signed up for the fossil fuel-free future, adding that the body is still growing. "It is about time that Africa look inward, to also decide and say let us join the global campaign so that we can begin to make the world a letter place and this campaign is about a fossil-free future. This means the emission that is being generated worldwide, we need to find means to reduce them. "As such, your colleagues in Asia and some in Africa came together under a banner called Parliamentarians call for a fossil fuel-free future. For the parliamentarian initiative, it is envisioned as a catalyst for scaling up commitment and actions of government," he said. The Chairman of the House Committee on Environment, Eguma Johnson (APC, Edo), said developed countries must provide support for African countries to access alternative energy sources. He argued that developed countries have a moral obligation to assist in the process of transitioning to cleaner energy since their industrial activities contribute the most to global warming. "The greatest contributors to this global warming are the industrialised nations. The alternative to fossil fuel is quite expensive and as poor nations in Africa-what we need to-at least be assisted by the major contributors to this global warming," he said. Mr Johnson said the lawmakers must provide the legislative framework to guide the process of transition in the face of inaction by the executive. "As parliamentarians, we have a role to play, and the role we have to play is in the area of legislation, not a political solution. Ours is not political solution but a parliamentary solution. We need to gather together and speak with one voice to the developed nations that we are not unaware of their contribution to global warming. We contribute less than two per cent of the emission," Mr Johnson said. Another lawmaker from Nigeria, Aisha Dukku, said despite all the promises at different conferences, little or nothing has been done to mitigate the impact of climate change. Meanwhile, another lawmaker from Nigeria, Shamshudeen Dambazzau, said African countries cannot afford to implement the climate change agreement without considering the cost to the economy. He noted that debt swaps and other financial support should be considered in adopting any agreement. "We should stop doing copy and paste. Let us look at how it is affecting us," Mr Dambazzau said. Several states in Nigeria are currently experiencing flooding with over 300 dead and millions displaced. While the flooding has been linked to the opening of the Lagdo Dam in Cameroon, however, the level of the flooding has also been linked to climate change. In September, while speaking in the United States, Vice President Yemi Oshinbajo asked developed countries to approve Debt-For-Climate (DFC) Swap deal to ensure a just energy transition for African countries. Also, on Monday, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, during an interactive session at Arewa House, said the reduction of fossil fuel should be based on financial support from the West.

By Torinmo Salau Men stand near a gas truck during the unveiling of the National Gas Expansion Programme, in Abuja, Nigeria December 1, 2020. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde. Global conferences demand that developing countries hasten their journey to clean energy, but African political leaders are pushing back. They want to develop the continent's gas deposits, in particular, to deliver vitally needed power. The 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference , also referred to as COP27 , is set to be held from 6 to 18 November 2022 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. It promises to be quite a fight. African petroleum and energy ministers have reached an unanimous decision to present a common voice at the COP27 for Africa to be permitted to continue to exploit its hydrocarbon deposits for the development of the continent. "There is no doubt that energy transition will be disruptive to the economies of Africa and producers of oil. The effects of the transition, ranging from revenue losses to underinvestment in hydrocarbon, what I call the transition curse, will ensure that Africa is left behind the rest of the world," Ghana's deputy minister of oil, Mohammed Amin Adam, told a conference in Cape Town. We cannot move at the same pace as the rest of the world because we contribute less than 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions. "African natural gas must be given the status as transition fuel for a longer period to allow gas reserves to be used when replacing a more carbon intensive fuel, such as coal. The transition should not be divorced from the necessity of addressing energy poverty" he says. Nigeria's minister of state petroleum resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, agrees. In March, he said: "We cannot move at the same pace as the rest of the world because we contribute less than 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions. We are not the problem and we cannot be made to pay for the sins we did not commit." "In Africa we have over 600 million people without basic energy, so how do we meet their energy baseload? We can only achieve this through gas." According to Sylva, it is unfair that Africans should be asked to abandon their abundant hydrocarbon deposits. He believes a multifaceted approach ought to be considered towards adapting to renewable energy. Nigeria's gas opportunity The global energy landscape is changing and there is increased demand for transition to greener energy sources to reduce carbon emission. In addition, the war in Ukraine has pushed European nations to look for alternative sources for gas. Nigeria has the most extensive gas resource in Africa, the value of its established gas reserves of approximately 206.53 trillion cubic feet was over $803.4trn. Amongst the 28 electricity generation companies (GENCOS) in Nigeria, only three are hydro  Shiroro, Kainji and Jebba \- while the others are gas powered plants. The remaining 25 GENCOS require constant supply of gas to effectively produce electricity. In addition, as per the Petroleum Industry Act 2021, the nation is strongly positioned for a restructured oil and gas sector that could sustain the demand for natural gas locally and a high export revenue.  meets Nigeria's power calamity Gas cannot be the only answer, however, experts argue. In July, Nigeria's national electricity grid collapsed again \- for the sixth time this year \- resulting in nationwide power outages. Aside from the economic and social loss, which result from the frequent power outages in the country, there are also health risks from the emissions of generators, the most widely used alternative power source by Nigerians. According to the Energy Commission of Nigeria (ECN), 72% of the households that have access are largely domiciled in urban areas, while 28% are in rural areas. Nigeria is the largest importer of diesel generators in Africa, and approximately $22bn (about N9.053trn) is spent annually to fuel their generators. Though the power sector was privatised in 2013, to improve power supply to households and businesses, the sector has not seen substantial improvement. The on-grid electricity demand in Nigeria is about four to 12 times the total electricity distributed on the grid. The current grid network is unable to meet electricity demand for Nigeria's increasing population. The design of the national grid is to function under controlled limits for stable grid operations. However, when the limits are exceeded, it leads to instability \- and collapse. Diversifying Nigeria's electricity mix involves the introduction of renewable energy sources: wind, solar, hydro, biomass, and tidal would help boost the energy mix in the country. The state-owned electric monopoly NEPA was characterised by poor operational performance. The increased power demand pushes the power transmission and distribution networks to their upper limits, leading to shortening of the network's life span or total collapse. Amongst the factors responsible for the constant national grid collapse and epileptic power supply include low level of water at the hydropower plants, low supply of gas at the gas power plants and vandalisation of grid equipment. Kenneth Okedu, adjunct professor at Nisantasi University and researcher in renewable energy systems, says: "Diversifying Nigeria's electricity mix involves the introduction of renewable energy sources; wind, solar, hydro, biomass, and tidal would help boost the energy mix in the country." "The challenges to diversifying the electricity mix include lack of strong renewable energy institutions, no policy for integration or penetration of renewable energy into the existing traditional power grid and lack of technical know-how and skilled workers in modern power grids among others," he says.

Nigeria, Nov. 12 -- The African Development Bank on Friday awarded $2 million to 20 African youth-led businesses, a press statement issued by the bank has said. The initiative, which is in partnership with the Centre on Adaptation and Climate Investment Funds, is a reward for winners in the 2022 African Youth Adaptation Solutions Challenge (YouthADAPT) competition. The winners of the competition are Flushh, Namibia; Green Impact Technologies, Malawi; AgriTech Analytics, Kenya; Baramoda, Egypt; Cassavita, Cameroon; Ecobarter, Nigeria; Farmer Lifeline Technologies, Kenya; Eurl Algerienne Des Industries Technologiques, Algeria; Lono, Cote d'Ivoire; West African Feeds, Ghana; Kisumeo Organics Limited, Kenya. Others are Grocircular Agro Services, Nigeria; IRIBA Water Group Ltd, Rwanda; Mpatsa Engineering Company Limited (formerly Sustainable Water Irrigation and Farming Technologies), Malawi; Viva Organica, Botswana; Voltx for Engineering & Industries, Egypt; Agroexpert farming, SenegalPazelgreen Technologies, Nigeria; Akatale On Cloud, Uganda and Multi-Tech Sustainable Solutions (MTTS), Cameroon. According to the statement which was jointly signed by the three awarding institutions, the participating businesses are scaling innovations in critical social and economic sectors affected by climate change including agriculture, waste management, water resources and sanitation, renewable energy and energy efficiency. 50 per cent of the winning teams are said to be female-led. "The annual competition invites young entrepreneurs and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in Africa to submit innovative solutions and business ideas that can drive climate change adaptation and resilience," the statement said. Speaking at the awards ceremony which was held on the sidelines of the ongoing climate summit, COP27 "No young person is too young to engage in climate dialogue. Our young people must be part of the solution. They are creative, dynamic, and engaging. They are futuristic and must be part of the solution for climate adaptation in Africa," he said. He added that AfDB would want the youth to speak for Africa and develop solutions for the continent. Mr Adesina noted that the organisers of the competition hope to double the prize money to accommodate more initiatives. While he observed that 80 per cent of the winners' businesses are in agriculture, Mr Adesina said agriculture is the future of Africa. "As you know, that has been my gospel for many decades. The lowest bar is for Africa to feed itself. The high bar is for Africa to feed the world. Agriculture is a business. I encourage our young people to do three things: Create, Adapt and Prosper. CAP for short." Meanwhile, Norway's Minister of International Development, Anne Tvinnereim, commended the enthusiasm that the competition generated, adding that it is important to tailor climate solutions that could be scaled up for the various communities. "Adaptation is good business. But it needs to be at scale. And that is exactly what the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP) does. The AAAP is mobilising $25 billion over five years to scale up and accelerate climate adaptation actions across Africa. And one of its four pillars is the YouthADAPT flagship program," CEO Global Center on Adaptation Patrick Verkooijen, said. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Premium Times.

UNITED Nations (UN) Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres yesterday unveiled the details of his Executive Action Plan for the Early Warnings for All initiative. The move is to ensure everyone on the planet was protected by early warning systems within the next five years. The plan calls for initial new targeted investments of $3.1 billion between 2023 and 2027, equivalent to a cost of just 50 cents per person per year. Guterres announced the plan at the ongoing COP27 Climate Change Conference at Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt, during a meeting of government and UN leaders, financing agencies, 'Big Tech' companies and the private sector. He told them that the people who had barely even contributed to the climate crisis were the most at risk and the least protected. The UN chief said: 'Vulnerable communities in climate hotspots are being blindsided by cascading climate disasters without any means of prior alert. 'People in Africa, South Asia, South and Central America, and the inhabitants of small island states are 15 times more likely to die from climate disasters. 'These disasters displace three times more people than war. And the situation is getting worse.' According to him, even though early warning systems save lives, vulnerable communities have no way of knowing that hazardous weather is on its way. Guterres said: 'Countries with limited early warning coverage have disaster mortality eight times higher than countries with high coverage. 'The Action Plan launched today sets out the way forward to right this wrong, and protect lives and livelihoods.' In March, Guterres announced the early warnings target. The plan will address key gaps in understanding disaster risk, monitoring and forecasting, rapid communication, and preparedness and response. The $3.1 billion represents a small fraction - roughly six per cent - of the requested 50 billion dollars in adaptation financing, according to the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). The UN agency and partners drew up the plan, which was supported by a joint statement signed by 50 countries. WMO said the need for early warning systems was urgent as the number of recorded disasters had increased five-fold, driven in part by human-induced climate change and more extreme weather. Even though this trend is expected to continue, half of all countries do not have early warning systems in place, and even fewer have regulatory frameworks to link early warnings to emergency plans. Coverage is worst for developing countries on the front lines of climate change, namely the world's Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). According to the WMO, when it comes to climate change adaptation, early warning systems are widely regarded as the 'low-hanging fruit' because they are a relatively cheap and effective way of protecting people and assets. Furthermore, the Global Commission on Adaptation found that spending just 800 million dollars on these systems in developing countries would avoid losses of 3 billion dollars to 16 billion dollars per year. 'Such progress is only possible with modern science, sustained systematic observing networks, daily international exchange of quality data, access to high-quality early warning products, the translation of forecasts into impacts, plus advances in telecommunications. 'The UN, governments and partners will work together to achieve the early warning goal within the next five years,' Petteri Taalas, the WMO Secretary-General, said. He added that the plan summarised the necessary initial actions and set out the pathway to implementation. To ensure effective implementation, he said the UN Secretary-General was establishing an Advisory Board which would be co-chaired by the heads of WMO and the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR). Its members, he said would include many of the key partners who helped shape the plan to date, and the Secretary-General would receive progress reports in advance of future annual COP meetings. \</doc>

The 27th Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC ( COP 27 ) is a great opportunity for Africa to band together to highlight climate justice and how the world can support Africa to adapt to climate change and grow their economy in a way that is climate friendly, Professor ChukwumerijeOkereke, a professor of Global Climate and Environmental Governance, has said. 'This is called green growth, low-carbon development or climate-resilient development.' Climate justice is an issue for Africa because the continent bears the brunt of climate change, while being the least contributor to the phenomenon. Professor Okereke, speaking in an interaction on the forthcoming COP27 holding in Egypt in November said, 'Africa must demand that emission mitigation levels from the West, especially the G20, should be ratcheted up,' noting that, 'if all the pledges in the NDCs are added up, they will not suffice to keep global rise in temperature below 2 degrees Celsius.' He said that at COP27 , 'Africa must call attention to the multiple and growing intensity and frequency of climate catastrophes happening in Africa. 'For example, you will see that the flooding incidence in Nigeria have been unprecedented in size and intensity.' Recall that as of October 16, no fewer than 2,504,095 Nigerians have so far been affected by floods across the country according to the statistics released by Federal Government on the 2022 flood. About 1,302,589 people were displaced; 2,407 people injured and 603 people killed, government figures say. 'About 50 per cent of the crop yield failure in Nigeria is due to climate change. This number is bound to increase. 'A vast part of the northern part of Nigeria has now been overtaken by desertification because of climate change. The herders-farmers conflict in Nigeria has something to do with climate change. 30,000 square km of Nigeria lies within the coast line. 'Lagos is endangered. States like Delta and Bayelsa will be completely inundated with a one-metre sea level rise. 'So Africa needs to call attention to these dimensions to the impact of climate change and ask the world to provide the necessary support that Africa needs to adapt.' The Director of Centre for Climate and Development at Alex Ekwueme Federal University Ndufu-Alike Nigeria, also spoke on the finance needed for climate adaptation. He explained that 'It is hard to adapt to climate if you don't have the finance. Previous COPs have recognised this. 'Industrialised countries promised to give $100 billion per annum to help developing countries cope. Up till now they have not been able to meet that target. So Africa needs to shine light on the importance of climate finance!' \</doc>

In the present age of impending climate challenges, sustainable agriculture is a very vital topic in any discussion, let alone COP, which stands for 'Conference of the Parties'. The parties are the attending countries that signed up to the original UN climate agreement in 1992. COPs are held by the UN every year, for governments to agree steps to limit global temperature rises. While the agricultural and food sector is profoundly impacted by climate change, it also contributes around a third of global greenhouse emissions, from production to consumption. Much of the emissions come from commercial, large-scale agriculture and processing and as you would imagine, the bulk of climate financing also goes to commercial, large-scale agriculture predominantly in the west. According to Climate Champions, whereas the world's smallholder farmers produce around a third of the world's food, only 1.5 per cent of global climate finance (USD 10 billion) is currently channelled into small-scale agriculture, and just seven per cent (USD 700 million) is going to value chain actors like smallholder farmers. Businesses and individuals have over the years contributed to the degradation of the environment and warming of the planet, through predominantly burning fossil fuels. Conscious efforts are made now to reduce the level of negative impact on the environment. This involves usage of renewable energies, sustainable architecture, waste management, etc. Agricultural and indeed all environmental sustainability questions the human actions that have caused such problems as deforestation and pollution. It continuously seeks to create measured decisions and actions that will reduce the negative impacts we have on the environment. Sustainability spans across many fields and disciplines in its stand to address all the economic, social, technological and institutional aspects related to the challenges of the environment. Governments and organisations such as the United Nations are continuously making policies and laws regarding environmental sustainability. Businesses, including agribusinesses through their activities play the biggest roles in escalating climate change, and must vehemently explore sustainability in order to improve the long-term impact they have on the planet. This is why many devised new means of using natural resources such as land, agricultural produce, and energy. As regards energy, most companies are turning towards renewable energies as opposed to fossil fuels that cause a serious threat to the environment. Also, the long-term maintenance of this consciousness is necessary to validate environmental sustainability decisions and actions. Thus, ways are devised to make production and other processes of business completely sustainable. Experts agree that sustainability is a process which tells of a development of all aspects of human life affecting sustenance. It inarguably involves resolving the conflict between the various competing goals, and involves the simultaneous pursuit of economic prosperity, environmental quality and social equity. Therefore, it is a continually evolving process. The activities involved in achieving sustainability are hence very vital as the only vehicles of getting there. In other words, sustainability is the process of making sure current processes of interaction with the environment are pursued with the idea of keeping the environment as pristine as naturally possible. Thus, environmental sustainability demands that society designs activities to meet human needs while indefinitely preserving the life support systems of the planet. This, for example, entails using water sustainably, only utilizing renewable energy, and sustainable material supplies (e.g. harvesting wood from forests at a rate that maintains the biomass and biodiversity). There can be a case of an 'unsustainable situation' when the sum total of nature's resources is used up faster than it can be replenished. Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. Inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity. Theoretically, the long-term result of environmental degradation is the inability to sustain human life. Such degradation on a global scale could imply extinction for humanity, and agriculture's purpose is to preserve humanity and planet. As smallholder farmers grapple to adapt to the often incredible impacts of climate change in Africa, one of my biggest worries is on Africa's capacity to fund the timely innovation needed to safeguard its vulnerable communities and the continent's food security. Donor funding has proven critical in the public sector building the economic infrastructure that supports farmers and agribusinesses to produce and process food, but how do we equally ensure there is funding for RandD and innovation in the private sector especially for startups and other agribusinesses in Africa? How do we get the much needed climate finance through for instance carbon markets to fund smallholder farmers and nature based solutions in Nigeria? This is why I am excited to hear about the launch of Food and Agriculture for Sustainable Transformation (FAST) by the COP27 presidency, to improve the quantity and quality of climate finance contributions to transform agriculture and food systems by 2030, supporting adaptation and maintaining a 1.5-degree pathway whilst supporting food and economic security. This multi-stakeholder cooperation programme will have concrete deliverables for enhancing country capacities to access climate finance and investment, increase knowledge, and provide policy support and dialogue. My hope is Nigeria can utilize this and many other initiative to tap into global climate finance for its smallholder farmers who are at the receiving end of the impacts of climate change. \</doc>

Are we telling the full and fair story about Africa and the climate crisis? This blog presents the problem with current narratives and explores how we can promote both climate action and Africa's development prospects. This post is co-authored by: Eniola Harrison\\xa0&\\xa0Annie Mutamba\\xa0of\\xa0Africa Communications Week, and Isabela Carrozza Joia\\xa0&\\xa0Felix Zimmermann\\xa0of the\\xa0OECD Development Communication Network Heat waves, droughts and floods. Extreme weather events have become an everyday reality for people worldwide. You would have to be on the moon not to know that the\\xa0climate crisis is real and requires action now. COP-27 , to be hosted by Egypt this month. After four European COPs with mixed results, perhaps a summit in Africa can help launch a new period of global climate negotiations. So what do we know about Africa and the climate crisis? Those of us who work in international development co-operation may have come across\\xa0two dominant narratives. The vulnerability narrative\\xa0highlights how Africa suffers from climate change. It stresses that\\xa0socio-economic factors like poverty\\xa0will cause immense human suffering. It warns that natural disasters will greatly increase the number of\\xa0climate refugees. The saviour narrative\\xa0focuses on how international partners are solving the continents' problem by sharing\\xa0expertise and technology\\xa0and investing in\\xa0green projects. Of course, there is some truth to these narratives. In Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia, climate change has left\\xa0millions of people without food. Angola is going through its\\xa0worst drought in 40 years, with almost 1.6 million people facing starvation and\\xa0thousands moving to Namibia\\xa0as climate refugees. In response to events like these, many OECD countries are indeed\\xa0increasing their international climate finance, and have many\\xa0ongoing projects\\xa0worldwide. But do these narratives about vulnerability and external "saviours tell the full and fair story? The problem with current narratives on Africa and the climate crisis There is a growing consensus that\\xa0current narratives on Africa and climate change are problematic. They ignore the\\xa0efforts by Africa's governments, businesses and citizens\\xa0to combat and adapt to the crisis. Portraying Africa's citizens as victims rather than problem-solvers reinforces negative stereotypes. It also robs audiences in Africa and beyond of hope and inspiration. The problem is not just with the story, but also with the\\xa0storytellers. The\\xa0top individuals tweeting about climate change in Africa are not Africans. And, when Africans do talk about climate on the internet, they tend to be retweeting content from the Global North. All of this means that key perspectives are lost from the debate. In the lead up to the COP-27 summit, leaders like\\xa0Senegalese President Macky Sall\\xa0have confirmed their commitment to climate action, but stress that African citizens also have other urgent development needs. In Sub-Saharan Africa, more than\\xa050% of the population lack access to electricity. In countries that produce fossil fuels, hundreds of thousands of workers still depend on the extractive industry for their livelihoods. In pursuit of green policies, wealthy countries have\\xa0stopped funding fossil-fuel related projects\\xa0in developing countries, but now face growing accusations of "energy hypocrisy , having\\xa0re-ignited their own fossil-fuel power plants\\xa0in the wake of Russia's war on Ukraine. These tensions were on display at the Africa Adaptation Summit in the Netherlands earlier this year.\\xa0Congolese President Felix Tshikedi said\\xa0that "the African continent has the smallest impact on climate change, but paradoxically suffers the majority of its consequences . Much of the debate is about who is responsible for footing the bill. The African Development Bank estimates that\\xa0the continent needs between USD 118 and 145.5 billion per year\\xa0to mitigate and adapt to climate change. At the COP-15 Summit in 2009, developed countries\\xa0pledged to mobilise USD 100 billion per year\\xa0by 2020 for climate action in all developing countries. At COP-26 last year in Glasgow, developed countries\\xa0promised to double their annual support for climate adaptation\\xa0to USD 40 billion per year by 2025. It is not clear when these promises will be met. Last year, the\\xa0OECD estimated that the USD 100 billion goal was likely to be reached\\xa0in 2023, but some\\xa0civil society organisations have claimed\\xa0that the true value of climate finance is far lower than reported. \\xa0These figures are unlikely to rise in the short term, however. \\xa0Russia's war on Ukraine has put pressure on budgets and, according to European climate chief\\xa0Frans Timmermans, dampened public support for international spending. A new\\xa0Eurobarometer\\xa0survey reveals that, while Europeans are hugely supportive of development assistance, they place climate action low on their list of perceived priorities. Recommendations: Towards a New Story for Africa and Climate Action So where does this leave us as international communications experts who want to promote\\xa0both\\xa0climate action\\xa0and\\xa0Africa's development prospects? How can we inspire better policies that combine economic, social and environmental goals? How can we help build more support for international collaboration and funding? How can we turn around paralysing negative stereotypes? \\xa0 We propose\\xa0three crucial ways forward. 1. Talk About Solutions, Not Just Problems We need to show the world that\\xa0change is possible, and that African actors are leading the way. There are so many fantastic stories to tell, for example about Rosette Muhoza, a young Rwandan woman whose\\xa0My Green Home\\xa0initiative\\xa0turns plastic into durable paving, or about\\xa0Drop Access, a women- and youth-led Kenyan NGO\\xa0promoting smarter agriculture and designing solar-powered fridges to transport medical supplies. At the national level, countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Gabon are positioning themselves as global problem solvers, showing how to turn an abundance of natural resources into long-term climate solutions. 2. Make it Real for Different Audiences Our climate headlines continue to feature numbers (e.g. temperature limits or financial commitments) and jargon (e.g. "net-zero ). Instead, we need to\\xa0link the climate crisis more directly to people's day-to-day concerns. Depending on our specific local audiences, let's focus on how climate action can help\\xa0create jobs, improve security and reduce poverty. Our rural audiences may be inspired about\\xa0Senegalese farmers fighting desertification, while young, urban audiences may respond to\\xa0entrepreneurs designing alternative building materials. 3. Promote Dialogue and Mutual Understanding If we want to help the world find climate solutions, then we also need to build bridges. African actors are unlikely to join the negotiating table if they are portrayed as lacking agency, or if their urgent development concerns are ignored. Communicators thus need to help explain the diversity of African perspectives and amplify African sources of information. Yet, building bridges is not just about how Africa is seen abroad. It is also about how international development actors are seen in Africa. To operate effectively, these actors need trust and legitimacy. Development communicators can help build trust by explaining how development and climate programmes improve people's lives. They also need strategies to counter a rising number of\\xa0mis- and disinformation campaigns. The global context for this year's\\xa0COP-27\\xa0could hardly be more difficult. Yet, the Summit is an opportunity to redefine the climate debate so that it reflects Africa's and the world's best interests. As\\xa0proposed by Carlos Lopes, we can shift the discussion from "how Europe could help Africa to "how we can help the planet together . Communicators have important roles to play! \\xa0 \\xa0This post represents the personal views of the authors and should not be reported as representing the official views of Africa Communications Week, the OECD or the OECD Development Centre.

Heads of State and global leaders from Africa and the global north have united to call for urgent investment into Africa&rsquo;s water and sanitation sector. &ldquo;USD $10-19 billion is invested each year in Africa, while at least USD $30 billion/year is required to achieve water security by 2030. There is therefore a need to close the gap by intensifying advocacy and, above all, action,&rdquo; said H.E. Macky Sall when he inaugurated the International High-Level Panel on Water Investments for Africa during the Heads of State High-Level Implementation Summit of the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt on 8 November 2022. Over 300 million Africans do not have access to clean drinking water and over 700 million live without access to good sanitation. Without action, climate change will make water shortages worse and lead to more food insecurity, disease burden, human displacement, conflict, and obstruct the continent&rsquo;s economic development. The objective of the Panel is to mobilise USD $30 billion per year by 2030, in order to implement the Continental Water Investment Program in Africa. The Panel will develop a high-level report and investment plan for the 2023 UN Water Conference and African Union Heads of States with pathways and recommendations for African countries on how to mobilise resources to close the water investment gap in Africa. Current levels of investment, USD $10-19 billion, cannot sustain the food production, sanitation, and industrialisation needs of the continent&rsquo;s rapidly growing population. The Panel is co-chaired by H.E. Macky Sall, President of the Republic of Senegal in his capacity as Chair of the African Union (AU); H.E. Hage Geingob, President of Republic of Namibia; and H.E. Mark Rutte, Prime Minister of the Netherlands. H.E. Jakaya Kikwete, Former President of the United Republic of Tanzania, is the Panel&rsquo;s alternate co-chair. At least USD $30 billion per year is required to meet the Sustainable Development Goal 6 on water and sanitation, and innovative sources of funding will be required, as well as strengthening governance and the capacity of institutional structures to ensure their efficient use. &ldquo;The Panel is an opportunity to focus discussions on prioritising water investments ahead of the UN 2023 Water Conference and the Panel&rsquo;s High-Level Report will be a key output from the conference. We expect it will guide African governments and development partners as we work collectively towards water action to accelerate progress towards all water-dependent sustainable development goals,&rdquo; said H.E. Mark Rutte. &ldquo;Achieving SDG 6 will contribute to the achievement of other SDGs. Good governance in water management is key to managing this highly complex policy domain. Water sector governance is vital. Given the unique positioning of the water sector, private-public partnerships are very important,&rdquo; said H.E. William Ruto, President of the Republic of Kenya, who will sit on the Panel. H.E. Badara Joof, Vice President of the Republic of the Gambia stressed that the country is facing considerable economic and development challenges and supports the mobilisation of finance for the Continental Africa Water Investment Programme. The Panel&rsquo;s work will be supported by a water investment scorecard, which will strengthen the necessary enabling investment environment in Africa. For finance to flow we will need strong, forward looking, and inclusive governance systems; improved financing structures, incentives, and cost recovery mechanisms for the water sector; and adequate processes to track, monitor, and evaluate the performance and sustainability of investments. &ldquo;I would like to call upon all the stakeholders that have rallied around the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA) programme, and the Continental Africa Water Investment Programme, and new partners that are coming to the table, particularly the private sector, to continue supporting investments in the water sector and to support the efforts of the High-Level Panel through implementing the action plans and recommendations that the panel will advance,&rdquo; said Nardos Bekele-Thomas, CEO of the Africa Development Agency-NEPAD. Mr. Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator emphasized that the UNDP commits to supporting the development of financing approaches, and development of the work of the Panel. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s good for Africa is good for the world. Africa is ground zero &ndash; it is disproportionately affected by climate change. The consequences of Africa will be felt by all. This Panel must deliver finance for African adaptation,&rdquo; said Prof. Dr. Patrick Verkooijen, CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation. &ldquo;Water is life for children but millions of children across Africa still do not have sustainable access to sufficient water. If we are serious about our goal of water security and sanitation for every child, we must increase financing for water investments in Africa,&rdquo; said Catherine Russell, Executive Director: United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund. The Panel is convened by AMCOW, African Union Development Agency-NEPAD, African Development Bank, UN Development Programme, UNICEF, Global Center on Adaptation, and Global Water Partnership. The Panel is expected to meet at least 3 times over the next 18 months. \</doc>

The National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA) has said that a total of 1,086 oil spills were recorded in Bayelsa State from 2015 to February 2022. The Director-General, NOSDRA, Mr Idris Musa, made this known when delegations from Connected Development (CODE) and OXFAM paid an advocacy visit to his office in Abuja. The visit was to discuss some challenges witnessed in oil-bearing communities. Musa said that out of the 1, 086 oil spill incidents recorded in Bayelsa, 917 were as a result of sabotage in the form of third party breakage of pipelines with hacksaw or outright blowing up of the pipelines. 'You see we cannot keep running away, I gave you the statistics now that we recorded 1, 086 oil spill in Bayelsa from 2015 to February 2022, that is 84.4 per cent; that means we need to do something . 'It is not about experts, if I came from a community for instance, and then an expert will come and aid me to break a pipeline in my community that will spill oil into my water, will I then drink it and do other domestic chores? 'We need to speak to these issues, we have done that consistently with evidence, what we call Disaster Risk Reduction programme for communities, telling them why they do not need to vandalise oil facilities. 'So CSOs also have to wake up and interface with these communities, let everybody check his own part and do the right thing, that is what I will advocate, the blame is not just on oil companies''. 'If everybody in the statistics I gave, which is 84.4 per cent, stop that act, then we will have zero spill and our environment will be good,' the DG said. Musa said that Nigeria loses billions of Naira due to the oil spillage experienced on a daily bases. He added that NOSDRA has been advocating against it and working to put an end to the sabotage and destruction of oil facilities. 'This is because when this spill happens, three things happen. As a nation, we lose revenue, individuals lose livelihood because the oil will impact on areas where they either fish or farm and then it is also a loss to the oil companies and the environment,' he added. Mr Hamzat Lawal, Chief Executive Officer CODE, said that the organisation through its Follow the Money initiative, track the utilisation of public funds to ensure its judicious utilisation in the interest of communities. Lawal said that CODE in collaboration with Oxfam have been working in the Niger Delta region through its Conflict and Fragility project. He added that they were working on a new project and sought for collaboration with NOSDRA. Lawal said the CODE partnership with OXFAM and the advocacy visit to NOSDRA was also to domesticate the National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights in Nigeria at federal and state levels. Mr Henry Ushie, Project Coordinator, Fiscal Accountability for Inequality Reduction, said that OXFAM Nigeria works to reduce poverty, which was caused by inequality. 'It is not that there are no resources, but those resources do not go round, because a few people have hijacked most of the resources to themselves. 'So we try to reduce poverty by also ending inequality in all its forms, whether social, political or gender inequality, we just make effort to end those forms of inequalities 'Specifically in Nigeria, we work across three key areas - gender justice, economic livelihoods and also on accountable governance. 'Within this sphere of work, is our work on just economy, where we look at those areas that have to do with revenue sharing. 'For example, issues around natural resources within the extractive industries and within that space, we work with stakeholders to look at those anomalies, the mismanagement that happen, particularly at community level.' Ushie said that the advocacy visit was to engage with NOSDRA on how to tackle challenges in extractive communities and how the communities can benefit more from the resources. He added that the advocacy was to also get update on how the agency leveraged on the United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP26, and its plan to participate and maximise the upcoming COP27 for the benefit of the nation. \</doc>

Nigeria, Nov. 8 -- The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has pledged $1.4 billion to help smallholder farmers boycott the existential impacts of climate change in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. This was disclosed by the foundation's Chief Executive Officer, Mark Suzman, at the ongoing COP27 in Egypt on Monday. The foundation noted that the commitment is part of its efforts at global climate talks in Egypt to scale up supply of "adaptation finance." "Today, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation echoed African leaders' calls for countries to rapidly scale up finance for climate adaptation and pledged to invest $1.4 billion to help smallholder farmers address the immediate and long-term impacts of climate change," the Foundation said in a statement. Poor funding Last week, the United Nations hinted that the world is currently not doing enough to assist poorer nations withstand the effects of global warming. By 2030, it has been projected that the annual financing needs of poorer nations will be $340 billion. More than 2 billion people depend on smallholder farms for food and income, yet less than 2 per cent of global climate finance is devoted to helping these farms adapt to climate change, the foundation said. It said food and economic crises will last longer and become more severe as climate threats escalate and further threaten food security by limiting smallholder farmers' yields and resilience. "The effects of climate change have already been devastating, and every moment the world delays action, more people suffer, and the solutions become more complex and costly," Mr Suzman was quoted to have said. He said: "Our commitment will help smallholder farmers adapt today and build resilience for the future. It is essential for this climate summit to produce bold commitments that address immediate and long-term needs. Leaders must listen to the voices of African farmers and governments to understand their priorities and respond with urgency." Duration, key focus The foundation emphasised that its commitment will fund immediate action and long-term initiatives over the next four years to help smallholder farmers in the aforementioned regions build resilience and food security. According to the statement, the funding will focus on spurring African-led innovation to build a pipeline of climate-smart agriculture projects, new applications of digital technologies, climate-smart innovations for smallholder livestock farming, and support for women smallholder farmers to capitalize on their untapped potential. "Women in rural Africa are the backbone of their food systems, but they have never had equal access to the resources they need to reach their full potential or build resilience to looming climate threats," Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Co-chair, Melinda French-Gates, said. She added: "As the climate crisis accelerates, women's vital role in their economies is too important to overlook." With the right financing and marketing support, Ms French-Gates noted that women smallholder farmers could earn more in a day than they currently earn in a month. This, she said, will ultimately transform these regional food systems and unlock a healthier, more sustainable, and more prosperous future for families and communities across the continent. "The climate crisis is causing enormous harm every day as it jeopardizes entire regions of people and economies. More funding is necessary to ensure agricultural and technological innovations are widely available to vulnerable communities, helping them to adapt to climate change, save lives and increase economic growth," she added.

By Salisu Sani-Idris/ Bashir Rabe Mani The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) says it will build the capacities of its vulnerable members who are losing out the space due to climate change. The association listed some of the effects of climate change affecting its members to include environmental degradation, depleting grazing areas and water resource, rapid desertification and forced migrations. He said: "We will take advantage of the emerging opportunities particularly the climate change initiatives signed during the Egypt COP27 Climate Change Conference. "We will also try to address the issues related to grazing reserve development and modernization of the livestock sub sector. " And by this, we will continue to urge the states and the Federal Government to come up with a settlement model that can suit the peculiarities of the pastoralists we have in this country." Othman-Ngelzarma said MACBAN was prepared to partner with local and international NGOs, as well as development partners to strengthen its networks that constitute the backbone of the global initiative for a fairer grazing and access to opportunities by pastoralists. "It is also our aspiration to fight against extortion, collusion and blackmailing of our members by some of our renegade members and some sections of the security and the judiciary. "This is in line with the zero-tolerance of these actions by the Federal Government and the leadership of the judiciary at all levels. " To achieve this, we intend to establish a legal committee at the National and the States levels to address the issues," he added. Othman-Nglezarma said now that the elections were over and a new leadership has emerged, other contestants and all members of the association should put all hands on deck to move the organisation forward. "This is a task for all of us. I also call on all other pastoralists' organiszations to join us in serving the pastoralists community in Nigeria and beyond. "It is absolutely necessary for us to come together and forge a formidable team to address the peculiar crises facing pastoralists in the country," he said. Othman-Ngelzarma also promised that the association would build its internal capacity to deliver, just as it would embark on some progranmes to bolster its activities. He said: "They include the reorganisation of the association through stakeholders' consultation and constitutional review., creation of new directorates. "This is to enhance its capacity to pursue justice, educational inclusiveness of pastoralist youth, women and children. "We will also pursue support programmes for victims of insecurity, conflicts, climate change and other disasters. strengthen the administrative / financial capacity of the association." Othman-Ngelzarma said that after winning the election, the task ahead wasalready cut for the new leadership sequel to the multi-faceted problems that pastoralists were facing in the country. He said: "The last eight years have been the most turbulent in the history of the association as our members became some of the biggest victims as well perpetrators in the challenges of insecurity in the country. "To this end, the new leadership will strive to amplify the voice of pastoralists through robust engagements with the media and by developing our own media platforms. "This is in order to bridge the gap that currently exists. It is imperative to tell our stories from our own perspectives. "We will partner with the media and have active social media platforms like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter to tell our stories."

Nigeria, Nov. 10 -- Despite being the least contributor to global emission, Africa is perhaps the worst hit by climate change effects in the world. Data from a recently released report by the Global Centre on Adaptation (GCA) shows that between January and September, 2021, more than 54 million people were affected by disasters linked to storms, droughts, wildfires, floods, and landslides in Africa. Temperatures are also increasing across all regions of the continent and it is warming faster than the global average over land and sea. Meanwhile, to mitigate these biting effects, the report says Africa needs $52.7 billion annually in adaptation funds by 2030. The report, which is titled: "States and Trends in Adaptation Report 2022," noted that current annual spending on adaptation across all of Africa is $11.4 billion, representing about 39 per cent of the total climate finance committed to the continent annually. This amount, GCA notes, is far short of what is needed. New funding commitments for Africa's adaptation programme from western countries at the ongoing conference of parties ( COP27 ) in Egypt may have confirmed that the developed nations are gradually succumbing to the pressures and demands of climate-vulnerable countries, especially in Africa, to rev up adaptation support. On Tuesday, the British government said it will invest &#163;95 million in climate-resilient agriculture in Nigeria. With at least four million Nigerians, including two million women expected to benefit from the investment, the funding support is aimed at increasing productivity and adapting to the effects of climate change while reducing emissions. The British government also announced it will provide &#163;200 million to the African Development Bank (AfDB)'s Climate Action Window (CAW), a new mechanism set up to channel climate finance to help vulnerable countries adapt to the impacts of climate change, from severe drought in the Horn of Africa to floods in South Sudan. CAW, according to AFDB, will mobilise up to $13 billion over time for Africa's low-income countries. In another batch of support, the Netherlands announced its contribution of 110 million euros in support of the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Programme (AAAP). AAAP was developed by African Development Bank and the Global Centre on Adaptation (GCA) to mobilise $25 billion by 2025 to implement, scale and accelerate climate adaptation across the African continent. Meanwhile, evidence has shown that meeting the goals set out in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) of African countries would require additional funding of $41.3 billion each year. However, the realisation of these funds poses a problem as much of it, 53 per cent, comes from multilateral development finance institutions (DFIs) with national governments contributing 23 per cent. In addition, cumulative analysis of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) of 51 African countries shows a need for an estimated $579 billion in funding for adaptation through 2030. The GCA report recommends ways for Africa to increase adaptation financing including mainstreaming adaptation and resilience into all investment decision-making by increasing access to information. It also suggests building an enabling environment for adaptation investment such as policies that mainstream climate adaptation into procurement plans as well as deploying innovative financial instruments. Lina Yassin, a member of the Sudan delegation to COP27 , described the support as a great step forward. She, however, cautioned that parties must remember that there are two important points to cover. "Finance in the form of grants should be prioritised and it should not be in the form of loans because our nations will continue to suffer from crippling debt. The second point is on the direct access to the funding and the delivery of those pledges," she said. Ms Yassin noted that in 2021 countries pledged to double their finance for adaptation but are still not on track to doing so, adding that pledges and higher ambition is nothing without delivery. "The money we are receiving right now is really a drop in the bucket when compared to what we need annually. We are getting very paltry sums; what we need is in billions and not in millions," Tobi Oluwatola, Executive Director, Centre for Journalism Innovation and Development, said. Mr Oluwatola, an energy expert, noted that the nature of the support being received so far is not enough to restore the 700,000 hectares of farmland that have been submerged in Nigeria for instance or the various lives that have been lost and those that will still be lost and the cost to their families. "For instance, what Nigeria needs for energy transition is about $10 billion every year; at COP right now we are looking to raise $23 billion for projects that already exist. It is still a very long distance to where we need to be," Mr Oluwatola. Also speaking, Fatou Jeng, Founder of Clean Earth Gambia, noted that "even though this is welcoming, it is definitely not sufficient, not even close to enough for Africa to be able to effectively adapt to the climate challenges that we are facing." She said it is quite welcoming to see western countries doubling their contribution on adaptation for Africa. She, however, added that more commitments are needed to reach the amount that is needed to sufficiently ensure climate adaptation for the continent.

ISIOLO, Kenya, 17 November\\xa02022,-/African Media Agency (AMA)/-\\xa0The Northern Kenya Rangelands Carbon Project (NKRCP) is the world's largest soil carbon removal project and proof of concept for rangelands restoration and community run development through the carbon market. It is the first ever project that uses rangeland activities in community conservancies to generate revenue for local communities. It is anticipated to remove 50 million tons of CO2 over 30 years - the equivalent of the annual emissions from over 10,000,000 cars - and generate millions of dollars for local communities. The sale of this sequestered carbon creates development income for local communities and enhances conservation efforts, including the improvement of habitat for community's livestock, wildlife and the four endemic endangered species that live in the project area. The project benefits local communities, conserves nature, improves the environment and directly addresses the impacts of global climate change. Work began on the project in 2009 with an official start in 2012. This is the first project to link rangelands restoration and livestock grazing planning to direct financial benefits for herders and local communities. The projects generates long-term sustainable revenue for communities. The first carbon credits were generated in 2013 and these, along with subsequent years of verified credits, were offered to the international voluntary market and have generated $14.6 million for local conservancies to date. In February 2022, each of the 14 participating conservancies received $324,000, their first of three payments from this sale. NRT receives no profit from the sale of the carbon credits. The project is improving rangelands across 1.9 million hectares (4.7 million acres). NKRCP was verified by VCS and awarded Triple Gold Status by the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Alliance (CCBA) due to the benefits from the project to wildlife and communities. Only 21 projects in the world have this status. NKRCP has been recognised as a Lighthouse from the Natural Climate Solutions Alliance at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt. The NCS Alliance is a multi-stakeholder group of businesses, solutions providers, and NGOs that are working to scale NCS in the voluntary carbon market. The award is designed to "build trust by 'shining a light' on projects that deliver high-integrity NCS carbon credits, generate biodiversity gains and provide substantive social and economic benefits for local communities and Indigenous Peoples." Sales for the remaining 27 years of the project are expected to generate even higher amounts. Funding is split between conservancy operations and funding community identified needs. Funding is channeled directly to the communities, who hold sole financial control, and spend it on community identified and community endorsed development programmes. NKRCP has followed Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) standards and has been praised for its community engagement and democratic involvement. Communities' lives are improving through development projects financially supported by the Carbon Community Fund (CCF). The communities are investing in infrastructure projects, education programs, and economic generating activities such as tourism and business. Across the project area, wildlife numbers are increasing. Four endangered species are being protected within the project are: the Eastern Black Rhino, Grevy's Zebra, Reticulated Giraffe and Beisa Oryx, all of whom will benefit from the increased funding toward conservation and restoration of rangelands. The project is improving the livelihoods of more than 205,000 people while also improving pasture for livestock and wildlife. This is leading to improved drought resilience and works to directly combating climate change by sequestering millions of tons of carbon in the soil across the northern Kenya landscape. H.E. William Ruto, President of the Republic of Kenya\\xa0said: "I am pleased to share encouraging news of an exemplary Kenyan project, which is the first and largest in the world focusing on soil carbon removals through sustainable grazing management. It is on course towards its inspiring target of removing up to 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the ecosystem of the next 30 years." Andrew Dokhole, a retired local community member and elected chair of the Carbon Project Oversight Committee\\xa0said: "Our people didn't know what carbon was, we don't have a word for it in our local language, or even in Kiswahili! Now we have created awareness and our people are aware that really putting grazing plans in place is very important for them, for their animals and also for carbon storage. Because of the benefits coming from this project, we are really supportive." Mohamed Shibia, an NRT Regional Director\\xa0said: "Carbon storage helps us in many ways. It improves the rangeland health, and by rangeland health we mean that if we have more soil carbon, we have more grass, we have more livestock, healthy livestock, thriving wildlife, healthy livelihoods for people." Priscilla Kushi, a local community member and Carbon Project Officer\\xa0said: "Improved grazing management through rotational grazing across the conservancies has led to improved pasture for livestock and wildlife. That means more grass, more pasture, more jobs, and healthier livestock and wildlife. This in turn, improves the soil conditions. When soil conditions are improved, we have more water storage and water retention and through this we are able to store more carbon within the soil. We get healthy animals which are putting better prices in the market and that improves the income of the pastoralist household."

15 recommendations from the Ibrahim Governance Forum call on climate leaders to take urgent action to make Africa's case ahead of COP27 Following the Ibrahim Governance Forum held on 25-27th May, the Mo Ibrahim Foundation releases the comprehensive 2022 Ibrahim Forum Report which now includes the main take aways and recommendations from the debates. Download: 2022 Ibrahim Forum Report Dakar and London, 12 July 2022 - The final 2022 Ibrahim Forum Report, 'The Road to COP27 : Making Africa's Case in the Global Climate Debate', outlines key facts and figures and 15 recommendations for how policymakers, climate leaders and African citizens can articulate Africa's case in the global climate debate. The Report draws on the Mo Ibrahim Foundation's latest research, and on the essential arguments put forward during the 2022 Ibrahim Governance Forum debates between experts, policymakers and African youth over three days. Commenting on the final 15 recommendations, Mo Ibrahim, Founder and Chair of the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, said: 'It is clear that the current climate agenda is failing Africa. When over 600 million in Africa still lack access to electricity, equivalent to twice the total US population, we need to pause and think very hard.' 'With COP27 Bringing together latest and most relevant data as well as insights from leading climate and energy experts and practitioners, the 2022 Ibrahim Forum Report provides a comprehensive analysis of the specificity of Africa's context in the global climate debate: how the climate crisis impacts in Africa intersect with pre-existing social and development issues; the challenge of balancing access to energy and climate protection; and last but not least, Africa's key assets and potential role in a global low carbon future. The report concludes with a set of recommendations issued from the Ibrahim Governance Forum debates to inform COP27 preparatory works and decisions, as well as any other global climate-related debates on the way to COP27 and beyond. By taking these recommendations on board, policymakers can ensure that going forward climate commitments take into account the continent's specific context, including the Africa's economic development path, and acknowledge the important role the continent can play globally. Key recommendations include: Take Africa's specific climate vulnerabilities into account Do not work in silos: address the interaction between climate, development and security challenges: Climate change has a major impact on pre-existing development and security issues. At the global level, debates and decision-making on development, climate change and conflict continue to take place in silos, missing opportunities to address how these challenges intersect. Mitigation alone cannot address the scope of the problem: increase focus on adaptation and 'loss and damage' compensation: Mainly driven by the Global North, the current global climate debate has up to now focused on mitigation, mainly through achieving net-zero emissions. Adaptation measures have been deprioritised while no ad-hoc 'loss and damage' fund has been set up yet. Invest in resilience to prevent loss and damage to lives, livelihoods and critical infrastructure: African countries need to set up clear adaptation investment plans, prioritising investments in early warning systems, disaster risk reduction and climate-resilient infrastructure. This includes stepping up data capacity. Address Africa's people's right to energy access Consider gas as a key transitional fuel, to be developed in parallel with renewables: Renewables are already the main source of electricity for almost half of Africa, and carry great potential for expansion, but alone will be insufficient to address the continent's energy gap. Gas, an abundant resource in Africa and the least polluting fossil fuel must be included to bridge the energy access gap on the continent. Whether for gas or renewables, look beyond just production alone: Whether gas or renewables, production is just the first challenge. Storage, transport and distribution infrastructure, affordability, relevant market sizes, maintenance capacities must also be addressed to attract needed investments and tackle access challenge. Clean cooking solutions are key to both climate and health goals: Replacing polluting cooking fuels such as firewood or charcoal with cleaner gas (LPG) or electricity is key from both a health and climate perspective. However, a transition clean cooking fuels must be a bottom-up process and take local contexts into account. Highlight Africa's potential in a global green economy Raise awareness of Africa's assets and Africa's ability to be a key stakeholder of a global green economy - not just a victim of the climate crisis: Assess Africa's huge potential wealth in green and sustainable economies. Build and leverage Africa's collective bargaining power as a key sovereign owner of ecosystems and assets that are essential for a low-carbon future at global level. Assess - and monetise - Africa's carbon-sequestration potential: The continent is not only the lowest per capita carbon-emitter, but also home to key carbon sinks. African countries should be duly compensated for the preservation of these global assets, including with a price on carbon storage. Avoid the 'resource curse': upgrade the value chain and put governance at the forefront: Move from exporting raw commodities to local processing, in order to upscale local business and employment. Define the relevant measures to avoid corruption, ecological disasters, human rights violations and resource-driven conflicts, and include them from the beginning in the management of Africa's ecological and mineral assets 'You don't get what you need or what you deserve, you get what you negotiate' Define, present, and negotiate a Common African Position: Africa must be on par with other global actors at COP27 . African leaders can define a common narrative for international negotiations, as Africa's position cannot be reduced to one or two countries' specific situations. Re-build trust lost through previous summits: Africa's partners should implement pledges that have already been made at previous summits before committing to new ones. Emphasise responsibilities: The link between carbon emissions and the climate crisis should be recognised and monetised. Adaptation and loss and damage mechanisms should be fully implemented so that the biggest emitters take relevant responsibility for the climate crisis. Adopt a wide range of integrated and innovative financial solutions: Address the link between climate and debt and increase the mobilisation of Africa's domestic resources, leveraging pension and sovereign funds and strengthening tax systems. Humanise the climate debate: The climate debate should highlight the impact on people's daily lives and livelihoods. 'Climate literacy' should be developed. Local contexts and solutions should be leveraged. \</doc>

The venue of the 27th United Nations Conference of the Parties () on Climate Change, held in the ultra-luxury Egyptian resort of Sharm-el-Sheikh, points to at least half of what is wrong with such elite junkets. As expected, COP27 This, essentially, is the problem with elite conferencing as the primary tool to address the problems caused by the behaviour of the elites themselves. As the elites of national governments, business and civil society fly around the world to debate 'The Climate Crisis', it remains women in rural and peri-urban areas, who play key roles as food producers and caregivers, that ultimately face the reality of this crisis. Many depend on natural resources for their livelihoods, so extreme climate-related droughts, flooding and other disasters disproportionately affect women's health, food security and livelihoods. In places where mining and extractive industries produce greenhouse gases and associated chemicals that cause severe environmental problems, women often bear an unequal share of the social, economic and environmental risk. Contamination of farmland destroys their livelihoods and forces many women into dependent relationships, which exacerbate the pandemic of gender-based violence and femicide. Mining pollution also threatens women's reproductive health, resulting in higher rates of miscarriage and children born with abnormalities. Emerging from all these underlying social pathologies is the realisation that the climate crisis is a direct consequence of the capitalist political economy, which produces at least four types of externalisation of costs, in a process which socialises the costs of doing business but privatises the profits. The costs to society take the form of extraction of surpluses, both economic and thermodynamic, as: 1) A social debt to dispossessed host communities; 2) A social debt to inadequately paid workers; 3) A social debt to women family caregivers; and Proceeding from the understanding that we cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them, it is reasonable to suggest that addressing these problems requires a new paradigm in which we toss out the flawed bias towards economic imperatives of privatised profits and socialising of costs in the ways we assess costs and benefits. The climate debate should then at the very least lay a foundation to catalyse a genuine just transformation of financing, extraction, production, transport and distribution, consumption, and disposal systems. The issue of climate change is integrally linked to democracy. The link between nature and society manifests through the ways in which large corporations in the minerals and energy sector have historically shaped (and continue to shape) the politics and economics of modern South Africa. The extraction of surplus value from exploration, mining, processing, distributing, subsidising and consuming of energy is often prioritised above the interests of marginalised people, leaving a legacy of destruction and poverty wherever these activities are carried out. The interests of large corporations are used to shape legislation that dictates the way in which we live, the way in which we are governed and the way in which we organise our economy, including the way we produce and consume. An approach to the climate crisis that does not seek to reshape the way that societal priorities are identified and developed will inevitably lead to a continuation of the same patterns of extracting surplus value, which has devastated the planet and subjected millions to poverty. A critical focus of our plans to address the climate crisis in a just and equitable way must ensure that global priorities and local realities are able to participate in dialogues that recognise the importance of each. Decisions taken at the local level have a significant contribution to make towards the resolution of the global crisis. But by the same token, decisions that are taken at a global level have consequences at the local level. Informing, educating and working with people who are both marginalised and directly affected by climate change, are critical to addressing the egregious structural violence that continues to legitimise patterns of disadvantage, such as racial and gender inequality. Despite the high-level hoopla about broad discussions on the Climate Change Bill and plans for renewable energy projects, the reality is that the process is still essentially an elitist one, which is biased towards private business interests and has failed to produce a different set of economic metrics through which the current crisis response could contribute towards a more just society. Instead, it is clear that what is on offer now is deeply corrupted by the same old paradigms that, in South Africa, produced the most unequal society in the world. \</doc>

Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, James Cleverly has announced a significant increase in the UK's financial support to African countries on the frontline of climate change. Speaking alongside African leaders at an event at COP27 , the Foreign Secretary confirmed the UK will provide \Â£3200 million to the African Development Bank (AfDB)'s Climate Action Window (CAW). The CAW is a new mechanism set up to channel climate finance to help vulnerable countries adapt to the impacts of climate change, from severe drought in the Horn of Africa to floods in South Sudan. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said: 'Climate change is having a devastating impact on countries in Sub-Saharan Africa facing drought and extreme weather patterns, which have historically received a tiny proportion of climate finance. 'This new mechanism from the African Development Bank will see vital funds delivered to those most affected by the impacts of climate change, much more quickly. 'Lack of access to climate finance for the world's poorest countries was a central focus at COP26 in Glasgow. This \Â£3200 million of UK funding is helping us to make tangible progress to address this issue.' The President of the African Development Bank Group, Akinwumi Adesina, welcomed the additional funding from the United Kingdom and said: 'I applaud the UK government for this major contribution towards the capitalization of the Climate Action Window of the African Development Fund, as it seeks to raise more financing to support vulnerable low-income African countries that are most affected by climate change. 'This bold move and support of the UK will strengthen our collective efforts to build climate resilience for African countries. 'With increasing frequencies of droughts, floods and cyclones that are devastating economies, the UK support for climate adaptation is timely, needed, and inspiring in closing the climate adaptation financing gap for Africa. 'I came to COP 27 The Netherlands has also announced that it will contribute to the CAW alongside the UK funding, and the Foreign Secretary has called on other countries to contribute over the coming months. The Prime Minister also confirmed yesterday that the UK is delivering the target of spending \Â£311.6 billion on International Climate Finance (ICF). This comes alongside new and expanded solar and geothermal power plants in Kenya backed by British International Investment, UK export financing for Nairobi's ground-breaking Railway City and a major public-private partnership on the Grand Falls Dam hydropower project - including a $3 billion investment led by UK firm GBM Engineering. On Monday, 7th November 2022, the Foreign Secretary announced a series of significant UK investments worth more than \Â£3100 million to support developing economies to respond to climate-related disasters and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Foreign Secretary announces fresh finance to support African countries to adapt to the impacts of climate change. The UK funding pledged at COP27 in Egypt will help deal with severe drought and floods across the continent \</doc>

Nigeria has joined other developing countries to intensify the push for climate change compensation from developed countries after recording its worst flooding in decades. Delegates from about 200 countries kicked off the UNFCC Climate Change summit on Sunday in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt with an agreement to compensate developing countries most vulnerable to climate change. But for several years, developed countries have often resisted such calls for loss and damage - a term used to describe the compensation from rich countries to help poor nations cope with the impact of global warming. Mohammed Abdullahi, minister of Environment and head of the country's delegation, expressed high optimism that the expectations of Nigeria and Africa at COP 27 will be achieved as issues that are of concern to them are already on the front burner of the agenda for discussions. 'We are focused on ensuring that we bring the issue of loss and damage to the fore, and we are already making progress in this regard,' Abdullahi said. 'Flood related issue with particular reference to Nigeria and Pakistan amongst other nations was highlighted as one of the key issue on the agenda for discussion, already the issues of flood is linked to loss and damage and that is of priority to us as a nation.' He added that the Nigeria delegation would also focus on the African carbon market initiative as it tries to kick-start the framework for carbon trading. He noted that similar attention would be given to the debt for climate swap aimed to call the attention of developed countries on the impact of their industrialisation on the developing countries and the need for them to mitigate the impact on Africa and Nigeria in particular. 'Nigeria as the leader of the PAN African Agency for the Great Green Wall will focus on climate finance to support its activities in the Sahel Region, particularly in the most endemic Northern states described as the front line states,' he said. He said the Sahel Region is fast approaching desert encroachment and wetlands are drying up, noting that these and others are huge issues that the country will focus on. Speaking on unfulfilled promises made to the developing countries by the developed countries during past COPs the Minister stated that Nigeria will not take its own approach but will align its position with the African agenda that was agreed upon at the Dakar meeting. Abdullahi assured Nigerians that he and his team of negotiators will return to the country with a strong, dependable, and bankable commitment from the development partners. 'We have secured the assurance of Damilola Ogunbiyi, Head of the United Nations Sustainable Energy for all, who is also a Nigerian that there is a window of about 400 million dollars to support Africa's carbon market initiative, we are beginning to record achievements even before we started.' Also, Sameh Shoukry, Egypt's foreign minister and president of COP27 said for the first time since the UN climate convention parties agreed to introduce loss and damage funding as an agenda item at COP27 . 'The inclusion of this agenda reflects a sense of solidarity for the victims of climate disasters,' Shoukry said at the opening plenary. 'The delegates would aim to reach a conclusive decision on loss and damage 'no later than 2024,' he said. \</doc>

As the world continues to experience the daily impact of global warming, whether the tragic recent flooding in Pakistan, or the less covered, but equally harmful, persistent environmental degradation of Africa's Sahel region, leaders need to act, not just talk. Equally, Africa should not just be in the conversation, but actively set the agenda. While Africa's 3.8 per cent contribution to global emissions is immaterial compared to others, we are the most vulnerable region to the effect of climate change. Africa's rain-fed agriculture focus, and a large share of agriculture in Africa's gross domestic product, add to the continent's vulnerability. It is clear that climate change is not just a threat to the future, it is also a threat to the present. Global conversations around climate change are geared towards a focus on green and renewable energy. However, Africa's focus is, and should remain, providing energy from both traditional and green sources for its citizens&mdash;this was the focus of my discussion with Senator John Kerry, Former Secretary of State and Current United States of America's Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, along with the CEO of Heirs Oil and Gas, Osa Igiehon, at Transcorp Hilton Abuja. We must be realistic about the inequalities that exist between Africa and the rest of the world. Africa has a significant energy deficit, with a substantial amount of its population living with minimal or no electricity. Africa transiting fully to green and renewable energy sources will require considerable investment, and this cannot be at the expense of the drive to urgently address the current energy deficit. Green energy transition must allow room for Africa to power its development and sustain its economic growth. Anything else will be potentially detrimental to us all. There must be an equitable transition; that is why I welcome the US's recent recognition of this concept in its much-awaited Africa strategy announced earlier this month. Africa's green revolution requires immediate and significant funding&mdash;funding that is larger than the resources available to African governments, that have so many competing priorities such as poverty, economy, education, healthcare, security, and more&mdash;all of which have a direct impact on the livelihood of Africans, especially the youth. With this dilemma, the world must step up! Africa will require far more external support and the same policy flexibility that rich nations claim for themselves in the energy transition. Related News Environmentalist calls for end to pollution Energy crunch: China doubles down on coal spending IBM named technology partner for COP27 As the world gathers in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt for COP27 , African nations must engage with the rest of the world, with one voice about the massive support required for this transition &ndash; one that is frankly in everyone's interest. The Tony Elumelu Foundation's work with the UNDP in the Sahel seeks to address the toxic cocktail of the lack of opportunity and extremism, and the frightening impact of environmental change has only made this task more difficult. Africa must do what it can in the present&mdash;African governments must provide the enabling environment to promote climate change and incentivise the private sector to own these initiatives and begin implementation in their various organisations. At Heirs Holdings Group, with our integrated energy strategy, we are working to address Africa's energy needs. Our energy strategy comprises three pathways: An oil and gas pathway (with HHOG already providing up to 12 million standard cubic feet of gas per day into the Eastern Nigeria Domestic gas hub); a gas-fired electricity generation pathway (with Transcorp Group operating an aggregate of approximately 2000 megawatts, some 15% of Nigeria's total installed electricity generating capacity); and a renewables/green energy pathway currently being developed. We cannot afford to ignore traditional energy sources, to power basic needs but equally we cannot ignore our responsibility to future generations in developing alternatives. We are great supporters of young entrepreneurs&mdash;and we are ensuring that we infuse green climate awareness in young African entrepreneurs, through the work of The Tony Elumelu Foundation. We believe that the current energy transition and future lies in the hands of our private sector, who through their actions or inactions can either perpetuate current ills or catalyse change. Our over 1.2 million TEF entrepreneurship seed capital/knowledge beneficiaries are being encouraged to create businesses that incorporate sustainability into their practices. My conversation with Senator Kerry ended with a broad-based discourse about opportunities for Africa in the renewables space, and technology-focused initiatives that will aid in addressing and improving access to energy in Africa. I applaud the United States of America, for this inclusive approach to addressing climate issues. It is through such direct engagements that a comprehensive agenda will be developed for faithful implementation across Africa and the wider world. Collectively, we can do better. We must do better. We have a dwindling window to address, probably the most significant challenge of our time. Our children deserve and expect better. \</doc>

The far-reaching consequences of climate change have over the years been wreaking havoc on the planet in so many different ways, claiming lives of all living creatures and throwing a spoke in the wheel of the 2030 targeted mission of the United Nations, known as the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Scientists have stated that human beings have been proved to be culpable for 98 percent of the causes of global warming and climate change. On the other hand, global leaders, humanitarian organizations and philanthropic individuals are now becoming embroiled in their combat with the climate crisis as lack of sufficient financial support, abject poverty and economic impacts of reducing greenhouses gas emissions when implementing policies for mitigating climate crisis for global nations are major stumbling blocks for climate change adaptation. It is palpable that African continent has become a global epicentre of climate crisis ranging from unprecedented rising of extreme weather, severe storms, erratic rainfall, catastrophic flooding, outbreak of water-borne diseases, displacements armed conflicts, desertification, abject poverty, biodiversity loss, drought, to mention but a few. These sweeping effects of climate change have put the African continent in a terrible dilemma taking Africans' lives, crippling socio-economic development, threatening food and water securities and raising so many questions for the continent's future stability. The continent contributes the smallest share of global greenhouse gas emissions compared to their counterparts of the EU, Asia and USA owing to their abundant manufacturing industries and Large Combustion Plants (LCPs); it is unfortunate that the continent remains the most vulnerable to climate crisis. Each year, severe floods hits the continent, killing the people, washing away villages and bridges, displacing families and flaring up water-borne illnesses that includes malaria, cholera, hepatitis a, typhoid fever, dengue, anaemia, diarrhoea, dysentery and others. These deadly diseases are currently striking some parts of the continent and killing vulnerable populations. According to scientists and conservationists, urbanization, illegal timber extraction, wood-fuel, overpopulation accompanied by artificial multidimensional grinding poverty have been turning Africa's air-conditioning forests into heat-producing machines exacerbating temperature of the planetary atmosphere, culminating in desertification, hunger, famine, poverty, unemployment, forced migration and armed conflicts are attributed to land degradation. Besides, a recent report of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) disclosed that up to 65 percent of productive land of Africa is degraded, while desertification affects 45 percent of Africa's land area. The FAO also forecast that by 2030 Africa may lose two-thirds of its arable land if the march of desertification - the spread of arid, desert-like areas of land - is not stopped. The Commissioner for Rural Economy and Agriculture of the African Union Commission, H.E. Josefa Leonel Correla Sacko recently said: 'Africa is witnessing increased weather and climate variability, which leads to disasters and disruption of economic, ecological and social systems. By 2030, it is estimated that up to 118 million extremely poor people (i.e. living on less than US$1.90/day) will be exposed to drought, floods and extreme heat in Africa, if adequate response measures are not put in place. This will place additional burdens on poverty alleviation efforts and significantly hamper growth in prosperity. In Sub-Saharan Africa, climate change could further lower gross domestic Product (GDP) by up to three percent by 2050'. Sincerely, African leaders should ponder over rising illegal widespread deforestation of the continent's pristine forests for wood-fuel and how the fastest-growing population accompanied by abject poverty are now putting the continent's young generations in dire jeopardy. The low-income families of the continent have no option other than to use wood-fuel for cooking since the price of clean energy, especially cooking gas, is very exorbitant for them. This menace is a major barrier to achieving goal seven of the UN's 17 SDGs in Africa which is to to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. Kudos to the epic effort and commitment of the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA) set up by African Development Bank and being funded by governments of Italy, Denmark, USA and UK for switching the continent to clean sources of energy so as to mitigate the climate crisis. Last year, the African continent witnessed the dawn of hope and emancipation from climate crisis as the African Bank for Development (AfDB) pledged to mobilize $6.5 billion of the $14.32 billion to be given by donors for the continent's Great Green Wall for the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative (GGWSSI) to accomplish its mission before 2030. Aside attempting to achieve those targets, it will be a very good idea for the GGWSSI to use these funds in order to improve Africans' access to clean energy. The initiative should also strive to ensure that Africa's abandoned dam projects are completed or build perforated dams across the continent with a view to reducing incessant annual flood ravaging some countries like Nigeria. The attention of African leaders should be drawn to the fact that Africa's vision of transitioning from dirty energy or wood-fuel energy will only be actualised when cooking gas is subsidised by African governments. As the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the UNFCCC will take place in Sharm El-Sheikh of the Arab Republic of Egypt in November, African leaders should bust their guts and take full advantage of the conference by pleading with global leaders of the developed world, international donors and humanitarian agencies to help intervene fully in their continent's climate crisis. \</doc>

BarRing all odds, Africa is set to host the 27th edition of the now famous Conference of Parties (COP) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which debuted in Berlin, Germany, in 1992. The COP27 , slated for Egyptian Sharm-el Sheikh peninsula in November this year, marks the fifth time Africa will be hosting the climate summit having been hosted previously by Morocco (2001 and 2016), Kenya (2006), and South Africa (2011). According to a UNCTAD 2021 report, climate change constitutes an existential threat to the lives and indeed livelihoods of some 490 million people living in extreme poverty across Africa. As Africa's big brother, Nigeria bears a chunk of the continent's climate impacts in many areas. For instance, the country's extensive coastline, stretching approximately up to 853km, has been receding over the years due to overlapping waves that swallow the shores of the Atlantic Ocean in southern region. With the sea level already projected to rise by about 65cm by the turn of the century, a further erosion of the shorelines will only deepen the environmental crisis the country must deal with. At another level, rivers are drying up while desertification is taking its devastating tolls across the arid zone of the far Northern region. Loss of biodiversity and fatal floods that ravaged farmlands and cities are other challenges confronting the world's most populous black nation. Similarly, degradation of the tropical forests, depletion of floras and faunas due to illegal deforestation as well as criminal wood logging have been on the increase. It must be noted however that the problem of deforestation in Nigeria is being exacerbated by the prohibitive cost of cooking gas and kerosene, and the virtual absence of alternative clean energy for use by the poor masses. The impact of climate change is also tellingly grim in the area of agriculture and the quest for food security in Nigeria. It is a cynical irony that a population of over 200 million people is being fed largely by rural peasant farmers using traditional hoes and cutlasses as major tools. By default, such farmers who are not agro-tech savvy can only cultivate crops that are subject to the vagaries of unstable climatic conditions. Of course when the rainfall is excessive, or the drought is extreme, farm produce harvest is abysmally poor, resulting in a disequilibrium between demand and supply, and causing galloping inflation on food prices. For a country that is in dire need of industrialisation, irregular power supply is a major disincentive for manufacturers and other entrepreneurs currently at the receiving end of climate impacts. And with barely 3,500 MW of electricity generation, factories and businesses that are embedded in Africa's leading economy are weighed down by the quest for alternative energy sources. It is estimated that over 60 million Nigerians rely on generators powered by fossil fuel for 48.6 percent of the electricity required in their homes and businesses, and at a huge cost of $14 billion yearly. The impact is no less serious in environmental waste as Nigeria produces 32 million tonnes of solid waste yearly with plastic waste constituting 2.5 million tonnes, making the country one of the highest waste producers in Africa. Yet the challenges posed by some of the climate impacts pale into mild threats in the face of the existential danger inherent in Nigeria's greenhouse gas (GHG) emission footprint which is estimated at 126.9 million tonnes as at 2020. In fairness, Nigeria has always been in motion to keep pace with the global advocacy on climate change. As a party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, it ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2004 and soon followed it up with a National Policy on Climate Change aimed at building an environmentally resilient society. The nation's interest was further concretised in 2012 when it was admitted as a voluntary member of the UN Environment's Climate and Clean Air Coalition saddled with the mandate to reduce climate pollutants in ten high-impact sectors of the global economy. President Muhammadu Buhari took a defining step in 2015 when he committed Nigeria to the Paris Agreement and presented the country's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) with a pledge to conditionally reduce GHG emissions by 45 percent by the year 2030. The Nigerian voice again resonated last year at the COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, where President Buhari announced a 2060 net-zero emissions target. He thereafter signed into law, in November 2021, the Climate Change Act which commits the federal government to measurable action plans for climate change mitigation and adaptation. As Nigeria prepares for a robust engagement with other state and non-state actors at the fifth global climate summit in Africa, President Buhari must ensure the seamless harmonisation of the country's environmental policies and actions, and the on-boarding of all critical stakeholders in energy transition, climate financing, renewable energy, biodiversity, waste management, and the media. The creation of the National Council on Climate Change, (NCCC) and the appointment of veteran environmentalist, Dr. Salisu Dahiru, as pioneer director general are steps consciously taken. It is hoped that this step will now accelerate the country's climate actions and convert the age-long motion into fast-paced movement. Ahead of the COP27 , Nigeria's crucial tasks must include to set a robust agenda for, and coordinate Africa's strategic response to the global climate debates, especially the blame game on culpability for GHG emissions, the tardiness in pegging the global warming at 1.5 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the dilemma over green and blue hydrogen options, and the resistance in redeeming the annual US$100 billion pledged to Africa to finance climate mitigation and adaptation, among others. The top industrialised nations who are known to be culpable for GHG pollution must be held accountable for climate change impacts being experienced in Africa today. Nigeria is duty-bound to lead the charge. \</doc>

SIR: It is no longer news that the world is converging in Sharm El Sheik Egypt to discuss countries commitments towards the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, accelerated actions to phase out dependence on fossil fuel to maintain the 1.5 degree Paris agreement to keep the planet safe for all. Scientists and experts continue to warn that unless drastic steps are taken to curtail human activities contributing to global warming many countries will be lost, ecosystems destroyed, biodiversity lost etc. In Nigeria, climate change continues to impact local communities in diverse ways. Nigeria is experiencing rapid desertification in the north and sea level rise and high level of flooding in the south. So far; 33 states including the Federal Capital Territory have been affected by flooding. The 2022 floods in Nigeria is recorded as the worst flooding crisis ever witnessed in Nigeria since 2012 with over 1.4 million people displaced, 600 deaths documented and over 2,000 people injured, about 82,035 houses damaged, 332, 327 hectares of land also damaged. The multiplicity of the impacts of climate change is severe for poor communities most especially the original inhabitants of Abuja. The original inhabitants of Abuja through a decree of state had lost all rights to customary lands as well as loss of access to lands which sustain their farming activities as they continue to face threats of evictions and internal displacement by the government rendering them stateless. The stateless status of the original inhabitants of Abuja is further exacerbated by the impacts of climate change as they face a dislocation of their local economy and commerce due to the flooding crisis in Nigeria. Climate change is about survival, so far; the Nigerian government actions seem not to recognize the inherent induced threats faced by the indigenous people of Abuja, the potential loss of indigenous food systems, cultural heritage, threats of deaths and extinction of an entire group of Nigerians if urgent steps are not taken to bring indigenous people of Abuja into climate discussions and decision making processes. The indigenous people of Abuja have rights to life, self-determination, right to indigenous food systems which must be recognized and protected. The global north must also do well to move away from making watery pledges and commitments and move into actions and implementation. The call and demand for loss and damage funding must be taken seriously by developed countries to help vulnerable indigenous communities build resilience to the adverse impacts of climate change that they contribute little or nothing to. \</doc>

Scientists have over the years been raising the alarm for the global leaders to rise up and mend their ways to go all out for combating the climate crisis from the bottom of their hearts. This is in realisation that most of the unprecedented calamities posing a grave threat to the existence of the human race have been proved to be genesis or evolution of climate change. The far-reaching consequences of climate change have over the years been wreaking havoc on the planet in so many different ways, claiming lives and throwing a clog in the wheel of the 2030 targeted mission of the United Nations, known as the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

Africans at COP27 and beyond need to pay critical attention about Africa's position as a key source of critical minerals. Climate change and energy poverty are two sides of the same coin. How about during this COP27 , Global leaders push to process Africa's minerals in Africa. Let's not forget, Africa is blessed with some of the world's largest reserve of metals and minerals needed for batteries, including lithium and cobalt, making the continent a key supplier for the global energy transition. At this COP27 , the African Energy Chamber believes when we process these minerals in Africa, we rapidly eliminates emission-spewing shipments of the continent's minerals and commodities. As the entire global transportation marketplace marches toward an increasingly electrified and battery-powered future, many countries across the African continent stand at the threshold of profound economic opportunity. Now is the time to take action and decide whether or not Africa steps across it. Countries around the world are encouraging their citizens to transition to electric vehicles (EVs) for both transportation and shipping. In many cases, governments are mandating their adoption by setting firm dates for total bans on gasoline-powered cars and trucks. Considering these circumstances, demand for EV batteries and the raw materials used in their manufacturing process will likely increase exponentially in the years ahead. Africa supplies a significant portion of the metals critical to producing the lithium-ion batteries that power EVs - namely cobalt, manganese, and phosphorus, and, to a lesser extent, lithium, iron, copper, and graphite. Unfortunately, African mines export most of the minerals extracted to Europe and China, where much of the work that adds to their value takes place. Processes such as beneficiation - the treatment of raw, mined materials to improve their physical or chemical properties - and the smelting and refining that occur before EV battery assembly can't be performed in Africa because there's no infrastructure for it. To begin the process of building the required infrastructure, African countries should move closer toward a thorough capitalization of their mineral resources. As noted in our newly released report, The State of African Energy: 2023 Outlook, "They can benefit from value-creation investments by developing the right market to support local demand for these metals, the right infrastructure to create an industrialization ecosystem, and the right capital markets to stimulate the much-needed investments across the battery value chain." Stepping Into a Larger Role Ongoing developments both in Africa and abroad have the potential to bring the concept of a fully integrated African EV value chain into reality. The first of these developments is the war in Ukraine. Russia holds a sizeable market share of the global metal production industry. The country is a net exporter of aluminum, copper, pig iron, direct reduced iron, iron ore, and nickel. Russia also produces 37% of the world's palladium supply and 11% of its platinum - metals essential to the worldwide production of catalytic converters. Focusing specifically on EV components, Russia also produces 17% of the global supply of high-purity nickel used in battery manufacturing and 4% of global copper - amounts that establish the nation as one of the world's most prominent metal suppliers. Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused numerous countries to impose import bans on Russian commodities. International companies, independent of their home countries, also initiated "self-sanctions" on Russia by withdrawing their operations from the nation or restricting the sale of their goods within its borders. While the United States and the European Union have yet to announce any sanctions on Russian metal, this status could change in the near future as the continued tensions in Ukraine do not suggest any coming de-escalation. Africa could potentially fill the gaps left by a Russian absence from the global mineral supply chain. South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Madagascar can collectively supply iron ore, nickel, and the platinum group metals, while Zambia and the DRC can provide copper. Africa's own demand for Russian imports of steel and aluminum could be affected by sanction-induced complications. Investing in African infrastructure and developing a domestic supply chain would add diversity to the global metals trade and safeguard it against any future political upheavals or military conflicts. Homegrown Transportation Another promising development is Africa's burgeoning EV industry. Rwanda and Ghana have declared their intentions to make the transition from gasoline-powered vehicles to EVs, while Rwanda and Kenya have committed to incentivizing domestic production. Egypt aims to produce 20,000 EVs per year beginning in 2023. Namibia has a goal of 10,000 EVs by 2030, and South Africa expects to see 2.9 million by 2050. While much of the conversation about EVs pertains to four-wheeled cars, motorcycles and tuk-tuks have always been more popular transportation options in Africa. The global EV market recognizes this preference. In 2021, 44% of all two- and three-wheeled vehicles sold were electrically powered. Previously, Africans had no choice aside from imported e-bikes and trikes, but now companies like Lagos-based Metro Africa Xpress (MAX) are manufacturing them at home. MAX's newest model, the M3, is a low-cost, long-range motorcycle capable of carrying heavy loads. MAX expects upwards of 70% of sold units to serve as commercial taxis. Local Demand Leads to a Local Supply This increased level of EV adoption, whether brought on solely by consumer choice or encouraged by government policy, will inevitably bring about increased demand for EV batteries. This demand could be satisfied by domestic mining and manufacturing - two links in a larger, fully African EV value chain. The ratification of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) primed industries across the continent to establish a network that could leverage the expertise and resources of its individual members to create an EV battery manufacturing chain capable of servicing the needs of both African and global markets. Proceeds from this arrangement could fund enhancements to African infrastructure - an evolution that would, in turn, attract further international investment. To properly seize the opportunities in front of us at present and to ensure the success of this endeavor, it is imperative that we acknowledge past mistakes and current conditions. An undertaking of this scale will require collaboration between governments, cohesive policy agreements, and uniform tax incentives. We cannot progress without commitments to improve roads, expand ports, and provide reliable and affordable electricity. We must also address the glaring workers' rights issues affecting the subcontracted miners currently laboring at the foundation of this proposed value chain. If we can work together to resolve these complexities, Africa will be ready to step into a bright, sustainable, and profitable future. \</doc>

The Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, James Cleverly, has said the UK will significantly step up its bid to help African countries fight climate change by supporting the African Development Bank's Climate Action Window with \Â£3200m. The Climate Action Window is an initiative of the AfDB set up to channel climate finance to help poor and vulnerable countries adapt to the impacts of climate change such as severe drought in Eastern Africa, floods in South Sudan, and more recently, Nigeria. Cleverly, who made the announcement while speaking alongside African leaders at an event at COP27 , said climate change was having a devastating impact on countries in sub-Saharan Africa facing drought and extreme weather patterns, which had historically received a tiny proportion of climate finance. According to him, the CAW by the African Development Bank would see vital funds delivered to those most affected by the impacts of climate change, much more quickly. Cleverly said, "Lack of access to climate finance for the world's poorest countries was a central focus at COP26 in Glasgow. This \Â£3200m of UK funding is helping us to make tangible progress to address this issue." Tuesday's development follows an announcement by the Foreign Secretary on Monday of a series of significant UK investments worth more than \Â£3100m to assist developing economies manage the impact of climate-related tragedies while also adapting to climate change. On his part, the President of the African Development Bank Group, Akinwumi Adesina, welcomed the contribution of the United Kingdom. He noted that the gesture by the UK would go a long way in consolidating efforts to help African countries cushion the impact of climate change. Adesina, "I applaud the UK government for this major contribution towards the capitalization of the Climate Action Window of the African Development Fund, as it seeks to raise more financing to support vulnerable low-income African countries that are most affected by climate change. "This bold move and support of the UK will strengthen our collective efforts to build climate resilience for African countries. With increasing frequencies of droughts, floods and cyclones that are devastating economies, the UK support for climate adaptation is timely, needed, and inspiring in closing the climate adaptation financing gap for Africa. "I came to COP 27 Meanwhile, a report released on Tuesday said developing countries would have to secure $1tn every year in external financing for climate action by 2030, and to also match that figure with their own funds. The report, which was commissioned by the current and previous COP hosts, Britain and Egypt, and released ahead of deliberations on climate change finance at the COP27 , said the funding would help in cutting emissions, boosting resilience, dealing with damage from climate change and restoring nature and land. "The world needs a breakthrough and a new roadmap on climate finance that can mobilise the $1 trillion in external finance that will be needed by 2030 for emerging markets and developing countries other than China," the report said. It further said the total annual investment requirement of developing countries would hit $2.4tn by 2030, with half coming from external financing and the rest from public and private sources in those countries. With the summit now in its third day, world leaders on Tuesday took the centre stage to pledge support towards fighting climate change by embracing cleaner and renewable energy. \</doc>

Abuja, Nov. 23, 2022 The Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA), has secured 64 million dollars in grant funding from the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD). The Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) also funded SEFA. This is contained in a statement issued by the Communications and External Relations Department of the African Development Bank (AfDB) on Wednesday. According to the statement, the announcement came during a panel discussion as part of the just concluded 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference Summit held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. The discussion was titled 'Renewable energy for climate action, socio-economic transformation in Africa: the role of SEFA'. SEFA, a multi-donor special fund managed by the AfDB, provides concessional finance to unlock private sector investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Commenting on the grant, Anne Beathe Tvinnereim, Norway's Minister for International Development, spoke on SEFA's ongoing contribution to tackling some of the challenges hindering access to clean energy in Africa. 'Six hundred million Africans lack connection to electricity and 900 million do not have modern cooking stoves. 'With today's announcement, NORAD - SEFA's partner since 2018 - increased its contribution to NOK 535 million (54.72 million dollars).' Also speaking, Joseph Nganga, GEAPP Executive Director for Africa said the alliance was proud to partner with the AfDB to expand access to clean, affordable, and reliable energy for communities across Africa. 'Together we will focus our efforts on sustainable energy projects with a high potential to be transformative, scalable, and replicable, and we look forward to supporting SEFA to catalyse and leverage additional financing for these pivotal projects,' Nganga said. Dr Daniel Schroth, AfDB Director for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, spoke on the importance of the grant funding. 'These new contributions to SEFA are a recognition of the critical role played by SEFA in catalysing private sector investments in Africa's sustainable energy sector. 'They will allow SEFA to further scale-up its investments over the coming years,' Schroth said. Furthermore, Geoff Sinclair, Managing Director of the Renewable Energy Performance Platform said SEFA played a critical role in catalysing African sustainable energy development. 'SEFA plays a critical role in catalysing African sustainable energy development and convenes an important conversation about how to increase the scale and rate of implementation. 'It was clear that all actors in the sector need to collaborate more to do this, and I am looking forward to following up to put that collaboration into action,' Sinclair said. \</doc>

The Humanitarian Affairs Ministry reported that about 603 persons have died, two million displaced and hundreds of hectares of farmlands destroyed in 2022 devastating flooding in Nigeria. This and many are the negative effects of externalities. Externalities connote an indirect cost or benefit to an economic agent which arises from the activities of another economic agent/agents. Externalities could either be positive or negative, and could also emanate from either production or consumption of goods or services. Production or consumption of certain goods or services could impact a third party that is not directly related to the production or consumption of such goods or services. According to Investopedia, externalities by nature are environmental issues such as natural resources or public health. The quest for growth and development led the world into that great turnaround of the 18th century, which is the industrial revolution. Western Europe, the United States of America and China are the biggest emitters in the industrial space, due to their high level of development and technical advancement. Their activities and engagement have contributed immensely to climate change, as a result of emission releases to the greenhouse. The effect they exert on the climate has resulted into what we now refer to as global warming. According to the recent report, the United States of America has injected about 19 percent of emissions into the greenhouse; China takes 23 percent while Sub-Sharan Africa has contributed about 4 percent or less to the total damages on the greenhouse. In 2017 at the Department of Economics, University of Ilorin, Dr Kilishi succinctly narrated lingering global political economics' debate. The debate was about who bears the burden of destructive activities of heavy industrialized economies of the world. He argues that the industrialized nations are polluting the earth by the virtue of their modus operandi and their profound effect is glaring for everyone to observe on climate change. According to him, there has been a proposition that these economies would compensate the less industrialized Sub-Saharan Africa, knowing that the continent has contributed less than 4 percent to climate change. The latter have arguably suffered the most devastating impact of climate change, as it was reported that poor nations pay twice for the effect of climate change. On the contrary, some opine that it is better if everyone could start polluting, and then suffer the consequences of climate change. He concluded that Economists have been vigorously debating on the valuation that would closely match the degree of destruction they've heaped on the African soil. Having cited the above, economics affirm that there's no such thing as free lunch; only trade-off which implies that nothing goes for nothing. In other words, for every choice taken by any economic agent, be it individual, firm or government, there is a corresponding opportunity cost that is forgone. What we are saying here is that these economies must pay for the consequences of their action. In essence, there should be a flexible roadmap through which Sub-Saharan Africa could be invigorated from the negative impact of climate change. Hitherto, there seems to be vague and less prolific agreement on this salient issue, because world leaders are still asking questions on how the cost of externalities should be priced. Debt-For-Climate (DFC) swap deal for Africa was proposed by Nigerian Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, in September 2022 at the Center for Global Development in Washington D.C, USA. The idea is that bilateral and multilateral debt ranging in billions of dollars by the debtors (Africa) to the creditors (West) would be forgiven to help the former in facilitating climate action programmes. Ceteris paribus, the savings from the debt obligation by African countries, if forgiven, would then be utilized to finance the energy transition plan that was set up by the government. At the 26th United Nations ' Climate Change Conference , COP26, in Glasgow, United Kingdom, in 2021, Nigeria pledged to reach net zero carbon by 2060. This simply means that Nigeria would have to transit from the cheaper sources of energy to zero carbon. The burning of fossil fuels is the cheaper source of energy, and Nigeria must transcend that to cleaner energy which requires humongous investment in climate projects. At this conference, Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari attested to the fact that flooding, erosion, desert encroachment and environmental pollution are glaring evidences of climate change in Nigeria. In order to avert these problems, we must drive an energy transitioning programme that would subside the negative impact of climate change. The only bridge that would enroute Nigeria from fossil fuels burning to cleaner energy is funding. In a recent report by the IMF, Sub-Saharan Africa needs between $30bn and $50bn to finance climate adaptation. In Nigeria, an estimated amount of $1.9 trillion would be needed to finance its energy transition plan. Samantha Power opines that the fresh idea would require full policy review of the American Government. In tandem with her statement, Olu Fasan writes: 'Truth be told, the debt-for-climate swap idea won't get traction with the West, due to their view about the moral hazard of debt forgiveness, and their antipathy to it.' Another impediment here is the issue of trust. We hope this proposition won't be like an elephant before the West that would never fly. The DFC swap deal should be given consideration to reduce the negative impact of climate change on African soil. Finally, Africans should re-present this case at the currently ongoing COP27 in Egypt. Africa should seek compensation, whose debate has been on for years. \</doc>

Countries have launched a package of 25 new collaborative actions to be delivered by COP28 to speed up the decarbonisation under five key sectors: power, road transport, steel, hydrogen and agriculture. A statement issued by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on Friday stated that under the Breakthrough Agenda, countries representing more than 50 per cent of global GDP set out sector-specific 'Priority Actions' to decarbonise power, transport and steel, scale up low-emission hydrogen production and accelerate the shift to sustainable agriculture by COP28. These measures are designed to cut energy costs, rapidly reduce emissions and boost food security for billions of people worldwide. The actions under each breakthrough will be delivered through coalitions of committed countries - from the G7, European Commission, India, Egypt, Morocco and others, supported by leading international organisations and initiatives and spearheaded by a core group of leading governments. These efforts will be reinforced with private finance and leading industry initiatives, and further countries are encouraged to join. The Priority Actions include agreements to: 'Develop common definitions for low-emission and near-zero emission steel, hydrogen and sustainable batteries to help direct billions of pounds in investment, procurement and trade to ensure credibility and transparency. 'Ramp up the deployment of essential infrastructure projects, including at least 50 large-scale net-zero emission industrial plants, at least 100 hydrogen valleys and a package of major cross-border power grid infrastructure projects. 'Set a common target date to phase out polluting cars and vehicles, consistent with the Paris Agreement. Significant backing for the dates of 2040 globally and 2035 in leading markets will be announced by countries, businesses and cities on Solutions Day. 'Use billions of money of private and public procurement and infrastructure spend to stimulate global demand for green industrial goods. 'Systematically strengthen financial and technological assistance to developing countries and emerging markets to support their transitions backed up by a range of new financial measures, including the world's first major dedicated industry transition programme under the Climate Investment Funds. 'Drive investment in agriculture research, development and demonstration (RD and D) to generate solutions to address the challenges of food insecurity, climate change and environmental degradation.' \</doc>

UN says while plans submitted by most signatories of the Paris Agreement will reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, they are still not ambitious enough to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. The UN gave the warning in a report published by the UN Climate Change (UNFCCC) on Wednesday. The current combined National Determined Contributions (NDCs) meaning the countries' national efforts to tackle emissions and mitigate climate change are leading our planet to at least 2.5 degrees warming, a level deemed catastrophic by scientists at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In 2019, the IPCC indicated that to curb global warming, CO2 emissions needed to be cut by 43 per cent by 2030, compared to 2010 levels, but current climate plans show a 10.6 per cent increase instead. However, this is an improvement compared to last year's report, which showed a 13.7 per cent increase by 2030, and a continued raise of emissions after 2030. "The downward trend in emissions expected by 2030 shows that nations have made some progress in 2022,"Simon Stiell, Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change, said. "But the science is clear and so are our climate goals under the Paris Agreement. "We are still nowhere near the scale and pace of emission reductions required to put us on track toward a 1.5 degrees Celsius world," he warned. Stiell underscored that national governments needed to strengthen their climate action plans now and implement them in the next eight years. Fossil fuel power plants are one of the largest emitters of the greenhouse gases that cause climate change. In 2021, during the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, all countries agreed to revisit and strengthen their climate plans, however, only 24 out of 193 nations submitted updated plans to the UN. " It's disappointing. Government decisions and actions must reflect the level of urgency, the gravity of the threats we are facing, and the shortness of the time we have remaining to avoid the devastating consequences of runaway climate change," he said. The good news is that most of the nations who submitted a new plan strengthened their commitments, demonstrating more ambition in addressing climate change, according to the agency, which deemed this fact as a "glimmer of hope". More positive trends were found in a second UN Climate Change assessment published on Wednesday looking at long-term net-zero strategies. 62 countries, accounting for 93 per cent of the world's GDP, 47 per cent of the global population, and around 69 per cent of total energy consumption, have these plans in place. "This is a strong signal that the world is starting to aim for net-zero emissions," the agency said. Nevertheless, experts note that many net-zero targets remain uncertain and postpone into the future critical action that needs to take place now. Stiell, however, called on governments to revisit their climate plans and make them stronger to close the gap between where emissions are heading and where science indicates they should be this decade ahead of COP 27 . In November, the UN Climate Change Conference COP27 will take place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. " COP27 Stiell urged national governments to show at the conference how they would put the Paris Agreement to work through legislation, policies and programmes, as well as how they would cooperate and provide support for implementation. He also called for nations to make progress in four priority areas: mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, and finance. (NAN) \</doc>

The green agenda of developed nations further ignores the tremendous role that Africa's oil and gas industry plays in generating African countries' revenue. Oil revenues represent at least 20% of GDP in Libya, Algeria, Gabon, Chad, Angola, and The Republic of Congo. In Nigeria, one of Africa's main oil producers, oil represents a more modest percentage of real GDP - about 6% - however, oil and gas account for 95% of foreign exchange income and 80% of government revenues. The green agenda of wealthy nations ignores those of us who point out that natural gas has the potential to bring life-changing prosperity to the continent in the form of jobs, business opportunities, capacity building and monetization. It ignores the sustainable, logical path we're proposing, which is using our resources, natural gas in particular, to help us meet current needs and generate revenue that can help pay for our transition to renewables. The wealthy nations' green agenda does not consider how much Africa needs natural gas to bring electricity to the growing number of Africans living without it. They do not understand that we, as Africans, are focused on growing Africa's energy mix to include fossil fuels and renewables, instead of insisting on an all-or-nothing approach to our energy transition. Around 600 million Africans lacked access to electricity before the pandemic, and it appears that this figure is growing. According to the International Energy Agency, in 2020 some gains in access were reversed, with as many as 30 million people who previously had access to electricity no longer able to afford it. Considering that universal access to affordable, reliable electricity is one of the UN's sustainable development goals - meaning it's a basic human right - the huge and growing number of Africans without electricity is morally wrong, and it cannot be ignored. Unfortunately, climate panic and fear-mongering are alive and well, and for some reason, Africa is the public enemy number one. A continent that emits a negligible amount of carbon dioxide, at most, 3% of the world's total, is being disproportionately pegged as a threat to the planet by developed nations. In particular, the West is vilifying Africa's energy industry because it is based on fossil fuels, even though the proportion of renewables is growing. There's no question that much of this anti-African oil and gas sentiment is based in fear of climate change, which is Interwoven with the sheer terror that a fossil fuel boom in Africa could be devastating to the world at large. Africa is vulnerable to climate change There's no denying that climate change is affecting Africa. One has only to look at the extended drought in the south to see how devastating things can be when customary weather patterns are disrupted. The thing is, Africa is being affected by a crisis NOT OF ITS OWN MAKING. If contributing just 3% of global emissions could cause issues like what we're seeing in Somalia, for example, the world's nations that produce far more greenhouse gases should be dried up, underwater, blown away, or burned to a crisp by now. Consider this: Prominent American climate activist Bill McKibben said that the world can't fight climate change if Total Energies and Uganda go through with building the East African Crude Oil Pipeline. Yes, according to McKibben, that one action will derail the entire carbon reduction scheme and offset anything any of the world's other countries are doing to reach net zero. Seems ridiculous, doesn't it? What's even more perplexing-or perhaps outlandish-is that McKibben has taken aim at a pipeline that will transport just 210,000 barrels of oil per day. That's roughly equivalent to 1.8% of the total output of the U.S., but he claims it must be stopped, or everything falls apart. What's the point of any climate effort anywhere if it can be undone by a relatively small pipeline that might actually be a lifeline in one of the world's most impoverished nations? But let's define what truly constitutes a boom in Africa. Energy use on the continent is still very low. So low, in fact, that researchers writing in Foreign Policy magazine estimate that if the one billion people living in sub-Saharan Africa tripled electricity using natural gas, the additional emissions would equal just 0.62% of global carbon dioxide. Energy use on the continent is so low that the average African consumes less electricity per year than an entire American family's refrigerator. At the same time, authors Todd Moss and Vijaya Ramachandran, from the Energy for Growth Hub, say the world is greatly overestimating how much natural gas Africa will generate between now and 2030. They cite a study in Nature Energy that claims the forecast for new gas generation in West Africa is five times the region's new gas potential. Obviously, there's some mathematical mismatch in the study. We have to ask ourselves: Will fossil fuel development in Africa signal an end to all of the world's good intentions and net zero ambitions? Or is this an example of 'green colonialism?' I find it interesting that a Financial Times' public poll, on the day it announced I was going to have an Oxford style debate on this issue, suggested that people are not at all convinced that African countries should abandon oil and gas - 70% of the 619 respondents took my position that Africa should make full use of its fossil fuels. How can we build a successful African energy movement? I believe the ultimate responsibility for getting there is ours and no one else's. Yes, we need partners to walk alongside us, but the success of our energy movement rests on African shoulders. To begin with, I am happy to see African energy stakeholders speaking with a unified voice about African energy industry goals thanks to African Energy Week. Africa Oil Week did everything to divide our voices and we stood firm and brought the Africa upstream, midstream and downstream together and we signed deals at African Energy Week. This will be particularly important as we go into COP27 in Egypt. It is imperative that African leaders present a unified voice and strategy for African energy transitions. We must make Africa's unique needs and circumstances clear and explain the critical role that oil and gas will play in helping Africa achieve net-zero emissions in coming decades. Western Support to Africa But, I would love to see Western governments, businesses, financial institutions, and organizations support our efforts. How? They can avoid demonizing the oil and gas industry. We see it constantly, in the media, in policy and investment decisions, and in calls for Africa to leave our fossil fuels in the ground. We see it with lawsuits to stop financing of Mozambique LNG or lawsuits to prevent Shell from even carrying out a seismic survey. Actions like these, even as Western leaders have pushed OPEC to produce oil, are not fair, and they're not helpful. Even as western countries are pushing to increase their own production and escalating coal use. I also would respectfully ask financial institutions to resume financing for African oil and gas projects and stop attempting to block projects like the East African Crude Oil pipeline or Mozambique's LNG projects. The 600 million-plus Africans without electricity are suffering. The 890 million Africans without a means of clean cooking are suffering. I would argue that if we want to protect Africans from harm and misery, we must embrace our natural gas resources. Natural gas has a lower environmental impact than other fossil fuels. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), switching thermal power plants from coal to gas was the main reason why the U.S. power-generating sector saw carbon dioxide emissions sink by 32% between 2005 and 2019. What's more, natural gas is indispensable in multiple ways. It is part of modern development, used for clean cooking, process heat, transportation, and as a feedstock for fertilizers. We can't overlook how important fertilizers are, considering the millions and millions of people who are food insecure across the globe or 'teetering on the edge of famine,' as the UN World Food Program puts it. The rise in food insecurity is often attributed to conflict, and the battles between Russia and Ukraine prove that point. Since the conflict began between the two large producers of wheat and grain, global food prices have skyrocketed. Considering how Russia has shut down natural gas exports, it's no surprise that fuel and fertilizer prices have also shot up. In fact, the increase in fertilizer costs is having as much of an effect on food prices as the conflict in Ukraine. When farmers can't afford fertilizer (which is more often the case in poor countries than rich ones), crop yield diminishes, food prices skyrocket, and more people are left hungry. Right now, the U.N. Global Crisis Response Group says, more than 60 countries are now struggling to afford food imports. It should come as no surprise that many of them are in Africa. Using African natural gas to fill the fertilizer feedstock gap will go a long way in mitigating those problems and putting food on the table worldwide. If Africa is allowed to develop its resources, there will be plenty of natural gas to go around. Natural gas helps the world meet its climate targets faster and can help solve the world's hunger crisis. And they're not alone. Think about Europe, which is scrambling to line up enough oil, gas, and coal for the winter- and are looking to Africa for supplies - or consider the results of a 2022 Pew Research Survey of 10,237 U.S. adults about America's energy transition. Only 31% believed that the U.S. should phase out oil, gas, and coal completely, while 67% called for cultivating a mix of fossil fuels and renewable energy sources. So my question is, why should we in Africa give up our fossil fuels - fuels that represent solutions to some of our most pressing needs - when so many others question the wisdom of doing the same? We shouldn't. And we shouldn't be forced to. \</doc>

NJ Ayuk, Chairman, African Energy Chamber ( HYPERLINK www.EnergyChamber.org Africans at COP27 How about during this COP27 , Global leaders push to process Africa's minerals in Africa. Let's not forget, Africa is blessed with some of the world's largest reserve of metals and minerals needed for batteries, including lithium and cobalt, making the continent a key supplier for the global energy transition. At this COP27 , the African Energy Chamber believes when we process these minerals in Africa, we rapidly eliminates emission-spewing shipments of the continent's minerals and commodities. As the entire global transportation marketplace marches toward an increasingly electrified and battery-powered future, many countries across the African continent stand at the threshold of profound economic opportunity. Now is the time to take action and decide whether or not Africa steps across it. Countries around the world are encouraging their citizens to transition to electric vehicles (EVs) for both transportation and shipping. In many cases, governments are mandating their adoption by setting firm dates for total bans on gasoline-powered cars and trucks. Considering these circumstances, demand for EV batteries and the raw materials used in their manufacturing process will likely increase exponentially in the years ahead. Africa supplies a significant portion of the metals critical to producing the lithium-ion batteries that power EVs - namely cobalt, manganese, and phosphorus, and, to a lesser extent, lithium, iron, copper, and graphite. Unfortunately, African mines export most of the minerals extracted to Europe and China, where much of the work that adds to their value takes place. Processes such as beneficiation - the treatment of raw, mined materials to improve their physical or chemical properties - and the smelting and refining that occur before EV battery assembly can't be performed in Africa because there's no infrastructure for it. To begin the process of building the required infrastructure, African countries should move closer toward a thorough capitalization of their mineral resources. As noted in our newly released report, The State of African Energy: 2023 Outlook, "They can benefit from value-creation investments by developing the right market to support local demand for these metals, the right infrastructure to create an industrialization ecosystem, and the right capital markets to stimulate the much-needed investments across the battery value chain." Stepping Into a Larger Role Ongoing developments both in Africa and abroad have the potential to bring the concept of a fully integrated African EV value chain into reality. The first of these developments is the war in Ukraine. Russia holds a sizeable market share of the global metal production industry. The country is a net exporter of aluminum, copper, pig iron, direct reduced iron, iron ore, and nickel. Russia also produces 37% of the world's palladium supply and 11% of its platinum &ndash; metals essential to the worldwide production of catalytic converters. Focusing specifically on EV components, Russia also produces 17% of the global supply of high-purity nickel used in battery manufacturing and 4% of global copper &ndash; amounts that establish the nation as one of the world's most prominent metal suppliers. Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused numerous countries to impose import bans on Russian commodities. International companies, independent of their home countries, also initiated "self-sanctions" on Russia by withdrawing their operations from the nation or restricting the sale of their goods within its borders. While the United States and the European Union have yet to announce any sanctions on Russian metal, this status could change in the near future as the continued tensions in Ukraine do not suggest any coming de-escalation. Africa could potentially fill the gaps left by a Russian absence from the global mineral supply chain. South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Madagascar can collectively supply iron ore, nickel, and the platinum group metals, while Zambia and the DRC can provide copper. Africa's own demand for Russian imports of steel and aluminum could be affected by sanction-induced complications. Investing in African infrastructure and developing a domestic supply chain would add diversity to the global metals trade and safeguard it against any future political upheavals or military conflicts. Homegrown Transportation Another promising development is Africa's burgeoning EV industry. Rwanda and Ghana have declared their intentions to make the transition from gasoline-powered vehicles to EVs, while Rwanda and Kenya have committed to incentivizing domestic production. Egypt aims to produce 20,000 EVs per year beginning in 2023. Namibia has a goal of 10,000 EVs by 2030, and South Africa expects to see 2.9 million by 2050. While much of the conversation about EVs pertains to four-wheeled cars, motorcycles and tuk-tuks have always been more popular transportation options in Africa. The global EV market recognizes this preference. In 2021, 44% of all two- and three-wheeled vehicles sold were electrically powered. Previously, Africans had no choice aside from imported e-bikes and trikes, but now companies like Lagos-based Metro Africa Xpress (MAX) are manufacturing them at home. MAX's newest model, the M3, is a low-cost, long-range motorcycle capable of carrying heavy loads. MAX expects upwards of 70% of sold units to serve as commercial taxis. Local Demand Leads to a Local Supply This increased level of EV adoption, whether brought on solely by consumer choice or encouraged by government policy, will inevitably bring about increased demand for EV batteries. This demand could be satisfied by domestic mining and manufacturing - two links in a larger, fully African EV value chain. The ratification of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) primed industries across the continent to establish a network that could leverage the expertise and resources of its individual members to create an EV battery manufacturing chain capable of servicing the needs of both African and global markets. Proceeds from this arrangement could fund enhancements to African infrastructure - an evolution that would, in turn, attract further international investment. To properly seize the opportunities in front of us at present and to ensure the success of this endeavor, it is imperative that we acknowledge past mistakes and current conditions. An undertaking of this scale will require collaboration between governments, cohesive policy agreements, and uniform tax incentives. We cannot progress without commitments to improve roads, expand ports, and provide reliable and affordable electricity. We must also address the glaring workers' rights issues affecting the subcontracted miners currently laboring at the foundation of this proposed value chain. If we can work together to resolve these complexities, Africa will be ready to step into a bright, sustainable, and profitable future. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Chamber.

Participating in the carbon market would not only offer Nigeria and Africa the opportunity for growth, industrialization and job creation for its teeming population, it would also provide the right incentives for clean energy and climate action, according to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN. According to him, the Carbon Market pipeline could create 30 million jobs in the next decade, with the potential to create more than 100 million jobs through climate aligned projects by 2050. The Vice President stated this yesterday in his keynote address at a high-level international meeting on Africa Carbon Market Initiative (ACMI) hosted by the Rockefeller Foundation in New York City, USA. , where he stressed the importance of building the carbon markets architecture in Africa. Speaking to an audience, which includes the US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry, who joined the meeting virtually, Vice President Osinbajo stated that "participating in the carbon market offers Africa the opportunity to pursue growth, industrialization, economic value creation, with the right incentives for clean energy and climate action. " The meeting explored potential opportunities which carbon markets offer to generate resources for clean energy transitions while accelerating economic growth in Nigeria and other African countries. It would be recalled that an International Steering Committee is driving the activation of African Carbon Markets in Africa, under the auspices of the African Carbon Market Initiative. Members of the Committee include the Nigerian Vice President, former President of Colombia, Ivan Duque Marquez, officials of the United Nations, United States Agency for International Development, USAID; Gates Foundation among others. Also, President Muhammadu Buhari had announced "Nigeria's commitment to net-zero by 2060 on the basis of a detailed Energy Transition Plan (ETP)," in his COP26 statement, while at COP27 , Nigeria's Minister of Environment, Mohammed Hassan Abdullahi, delivered the President's speech on the need for more funding for energy transitions and climate action, and why Nigeria is championing the development of the African carbon market initiative. " Against the backdrop of global rapid expansion of the carbon markets, the Vice President noted that "Africa currently only has a small share of this carbon market, but the current market can be scaled in a massive way to reach FDI of $120 billion to $200 billion dollars annually. For a continent that needs $240 billion dollars annually in mitigation investment alone, this carbon finance stream could be the difference between transitioning and not (transitioning). " Emphasizing the market's benefits for the African continent at the Rockefeller Foundation meeting, the VP said the "combination of capital flows, job creation, and avoidance of long-term climate destruction" are critical drivers of the interest of African leaders in supporting this effort. "As all of us in this room understand well, the priorities of the African continent are not just to act decisively on the climate crisis, but to also create significant growth opportunities for our young and growing population. " On the challenge of funding, Prof. Osinbajo noted that "the investment required to advance the energy transition in Africa is huge. World Bank estimates suggest that Africa needs $6.5 trillion US dollars between now and 2050 for mitigation action alone to keep temperatures below 2 degrees of warming." Lauding the positive Pan-African efforts at developing Carbon markets on the continent, the VP noted that the "rapid progress recorded in Africa benefitted from the support of a very engaged Steering Committee with President Duque, the UN, Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP), USAID, and a range of other public and private actors, which resulted in the successful launch in Sharm-el-Sheikh COP-27 . "The strong commitment and presence from fellow African leaders demonstrate the willingness and leadership of Africa. We already have 7 African countries (Burundi, Gabon, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria and Togo) signed up to develop country carbon activation plans and over $200 million in Advanced Market Commitments which we must continue to further advance as this is going to be the critical driver of action on the Continent." Prof. Osinbajo then commended the support and assistance on the progress recorded so far on the African Carbon Market Initiative, including from the US government, relevant UN bodies and other international organisations like the Rockefeller Foundation, and GEAPP. He added, "I think it's an auspicious moment for Africa to be participating more fully in the global carbon market conversation, especially in the light of the slowing pace of green investment flows into the continent. "The work several of us have done together in the past few months, makes it clear that while other sources of flows are slowing down globally Carbon Markets are growing rapidly." The Vice President further observed that other initiatives demonstrate that there is growing acknowledgement of the role of carbon finance. According to him, "One of the strong points of ACMI and the way we must structure it going forward, in terms of governance, is the flexibility to smoothly work with other initiatives, and there will be many others. Referencing the Energy Transition Accelerator announced at COP27 by the US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, the VP said, "two days to the opening of Cop 27 , Sen. John Kerry and I had a conversation about the proposed Energy Transition Accelerator and we both agreed that once the details were worked out, we would work out a collaborative framework with ACMI." Related News Continuing, he said, "the key really in the brave new world of energy transition initiatives is collaboration, and synergies. I look forward to speaking to Senator Kerry and aligning our efforts especially on power sector credits, which will be central to keeping up and delivering on the momentum we've worked so hard on. He noted that the single biggest thing standing in the way of making rapid progress on emission reductions is the absence of money dedicated to the cause. "And we surely can find that money which is why today's meeting is both extremely valuable and timely. We all know that the hard part comes next. We have created energy and excitement, and our collective reputations are on the line," Prof. Osinbajo stated, while calling on African leaders to "take responsibility to ensure this exciting momentum is maintained, and scaled up. "Carbon markets will play a critical role in the implementation of this (Energy Transition) Plan in mobilizing the capital required to move to our net-zero economy-wide trajectory. I want Nigeria to have the first Carbon Markets Activation Plan," he noted. Vice President Osinbajo reiterated Federal Government's continuing efforts on the climate change issue. "We passed our Climate Change Act, earlier this year, and together with Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) and GEAPP have also developed our own net-zero energy transition plan. " Stating his desired expectation for climate goals to be attained before the next UN Climate Change Conference, he said, "by COP28, we need to be able to show real results. I would propose that by COP28, we should be able to deliver the following five things: " At least 5 countries should have developed country activation plans. Nigeria will be one of them; We should have Advanced Market Commitments of over USD 1billion, We should be developing new projects based on new methodologies and realities of Africa like diesel replacement credits, We should be scaling up more than a dozen project developers or carbon credit suppliers as they would be known then, And most importantly, by COP28, we should have retired more than 40 million of credits on the continent." The Vice President also lauded the commitment of the continent's partners, including GEAPP, the Rockefeller Foundation and SEforALL. Expressing his optimism for the future, Prof. Osinbajo said "hopefully we will make more progress in the effort to significantly scale up over the next 24 months. Given the positive benefits of the ACMI, this feels like it should be an easy conversation." In his contribution, the US Presidential Envoy on Climate Change, Senator John Kerry, commended the VP for his leadership of the issue of energy transition while recalling his visit with him in Abuja before COP27 . "We are grateful for the leadership of the VP, grateful for the reception you gave me on my visit to Nigeria. I am honoured to share the platform with you on how to move this forward," Kerry said, referring to the African Carbon Market Initiative and the US' Energy Transition Accelerator. He noted that "it is possible to create a high integrity carbon market in a way to address Climate Change and African Development aspirations. " Senator Kerry observed that the developed world must be able to step up the support on climate crisis and expressed delight that "we are all joined together looking forward to developing the financing." In his welcome remarks, President of Rockefeller Foundation, Dr. Rajiv Shah, welcomed the Vice President to the meeting and lauded his commitment to the African carbon markets. Aside from US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate; and President of Rockefeller Foundation; other participants at the one-day meeting included the CEO of SEforALL, Ms. Damilola Ogunbiyi; CEO, GEAPP, Simon Harford; and Senior Executives at Rockefeller Foundation; US Government and United Nations officials, amongst other industry experts and potential financial partners. \</doc>

Nigeria, Nov. 16 -- Climate change is a global problem that requires cooperation between all nations. That's why today more than 30 newspapers and media organisations in more than 20 countries have taken a common view about what needs to be done. Time is running out. Rather than getting out of fossil fuels and into clean energy, many wealthy nations are reinvesting in oil and gas, failing to cut emissions fast enough and haggling over the aid they are prepared to send to poor countries. All this while the planet hurtles towards the point of no return - where climate chaos becomes irreversible. Since the COP26 UN climate summit in Glasgow 12 months ago, countries have only promised to do one-fiftieth of what is needed to stay on track to keep temperatures within 1.5degC of pre-industrial levels. No continent has avoided extreme weather disasters this year - from floods in Pakistan to heatwaves in Europe, and from forest fires in Australia to hurricanes in the US. Given that these came about from elevated temperatures of about 1.1C, the world can expect far worse to come. As many nations seek to reduce their reliance on Russia, the world is experiencing a "gold rush" for new fossil fuel projects. These are cast as temporary supply measures, but they risk locking the planet into irreversible damage. All this underlines the fact that humanity has to end its addiction to fossil fuels. If renewable energy was the norm, there would be no climate emergency. The world's poorest people will bear the brunt of the destruction wrought by drought, melting ice sheets and crop failures. To shield these groups from the loss of life and livelihoods will require money. Developing countries, says one influential report, need $2 trillion annually to cut their greenhouse gas emissions and cope with climate breakdown. Rich countries account for just one in eight people in the world today but are responsible for half of greenhouse gases. These nations have a clear moral responsibility to help. Developing nations should be given enough cash to address the dangerous conditions they did little to create - especially as a global recession looms. Rich nations should deliver on the promise of previously committed funds - such as the $100 billion a year from 2020 - to signal their seriousness. As a bare minimum, a windfall tax on the combined profits of the largest oil and gas companies - estimated at almost $100 billion in the first three months of the year - needs to be enacted. The United Nations was right to call for the cash to be used to support the most vulnerable. But such a levy would only be the start. Poor nations also carry debts that make it impossible to recover after climate-related disasters or protect themselves from future ones. Creditors should be generous in writing off loans for those on the frontline of the climate emergency. These measures need not wait for coordinated international action. Countries could implement them on regional or national levels. A nation's cumulative emissions must be the basis of its responsibility to act. While private finance can help, the onus is on big historical emitters to stump up the money. Solving the crisis is the moonshot of our times. Getting to the moon succeeded within a decade because huge resources were devoted to it. A similar commitment is needed now. But an economic crisis has reduced rich countries' appetite for spending and the planet risks being trapped in fossil-fuel-dependence by a rearguard action of big business. Yet, during the pandemic central banks across the world lubricated states' expenditure by buying up their own governments' bonds. The trillions of dollars needed to deal with the ecological emergency demands such radical thinking returns. This is no time for apathy or complacency; the urgency of the moment is upon us. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change must be about the power of argument not the argument of power. Key to maintaining the consensus in Egypt is not to let disputes over trade and war in Ukraine block global climate diplomacy. The UN process may not be perfect. But it has provided nations with a target to save the planet, which must be pursued at COP27 to stave off an existential risk to humanity.

African Development Bank ( HYPERLINK http://www.AfDB.org www.AfDB.org ) President Dr. Akinwumi Adesina and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) President Odile Reinaud-Basso have agreed that their organizations would step up cooperation to enhance resilience among African businesses. The two development bank heads held talks earlier this month at this year's global climate summit ( COP27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Adesina highlighted that  climate adaptation in Africa was a key condition to preserving economic growth and maintaining social cohesion on the continent. Reinaud-Basso confirmed EBRD's commitment to support the implementation of the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP), an initiative jointly launched in 2021 by the African Development Bank and the Global Center on Adaptation. The program is mobilizing $25 billion by 2025. These funds will help accelerate climate adaptation action in Africa through initiatives in four priority areas: food security; resilient infrastructure; youth entrepreneurship and job creation; and innovative climate adaptation finance. Global heating entails rethinking of how infrastructure, cities, and financial systems are designed and operated. This requires effective partnerships between public and private actors and strong engagement with civil society. By partnering and working closely with government institutions, public utilities, local enterprises and communities, multilateral development banks like the African Development Bank and EBRD can play a catalytic role in developing the approaches to finance that underpin this transformation since financing models use both public and private channels. Multilateral development banks can also support the development of innovative financing products using blended finance approaches and developing market-based instruments that reward enterprises investing in climate resilience projects. Both institutions will collaborate to further develop the African Development Bank's Adaptation Benefits Mechanism. They will explore innovative non-market approaches under Article 6.8 of the Paris Agreement. The African Development Bank and EBRD will expand their cooperation in all these areas of work in the context of the Africa Accelerated Adaptation Program. They will prioritize support to countries and clients to understand physical climate risks and scale up adaptation investments. Reinaud-Basso said:  Africa has the potential to become a global leader in climate adaptation solutions and services and we want to expand our cooperation to support Africa fulfill its potential.  While preserving their triple-A rating, which must remain the cornerstone of multilateral development banks' business model, MDBs must find avenues to secure more risk capital to leverage more private sector investments, Adesina said. He added:  One of these in the short term is the reallocation of a portion of their International Monetary Fund Special Drawing Rights from wealthy countries to MDBs. These can apply a multiplier factor of 3 to 4 on it. Both the African Development Bank and the EBRD are ready to implement this option, which will offer significant value for money to the countries that will provide SDRs.

Wealthy nations' green agenda ignores Africa NJ Ayuk Johannesburg, South Africa - I am going to COP27 because I believe if Africa is not on the table, it will be on the menu. Let me be clear, those of us who are advocating for African countries to continue using their oil and gas resources are not "ignoring" the world's green agenda - we're simply not willing to embrace the world's timetable for transitioning to renewable fuels at the expense of our own energy security and economic well-being. The way we see it, the world's wealthy nations' green agenda ignores Africa - or at least, it dismisses our unique needs, priorities and challenges. The green agenda of developed nations further ignores the tremendous role that Africa's oil and gas industry plays in generating African countries' revenue. Oil revenues represent at least 20% of GDP in Libya, Algeria, Gabon, Chad, Angola, and The Republic of Congo. In Nigeria, one Africa's main oil producers, oil represents a more modest percentage of real GDP - about 6% - however, oil and gas account for 95% of foreign exchange income and 80% of government revenues. The green agenda of wealthy nations ignores those of us who point out that natural gas has the potential to bring life-changing prosperity to the continent in the form of jobs, business opportunities, capacity building and monetization. It ignores the sustainable, logical path we're proposing, which is using our resources, natural gas in particular, to help us meet current needs and to generate revenue that can help pay for our transition to renewables. The wealthy nations' green agenda does not consider how much Africa needs natural gas to bring electricity to the growing number of Africans living without it. They do not understand that we, as Africans, are focused on growing Africa's energy mix to include fossil fuels and renewables, instead of insisting on an all or nothing approach to our energy transition. Around 600 million Africans lacked access to electricity before the pandemic; and it appears that this figure is growing. According to the International Energy Agency, during 2020 some gains in access were reversed, with as many as 30 million people who previously had access to electricity no longer able to afford it. Considering that universal access to affordable, reliable electricity is one of the UN's sustainable development goals - meaning it's a basic human right - the huge and growing number of Africans without electricity is morally wrong, and it cannot be ignored. Unfortunately, climate panic and fear mongering are alive and well, and for some reason, Africa is public enemy number one. A continent that emits a negligible amount of carbon dioxide, at most, 3% of the world's total, is being disproportionately pegged as a threat to the planet by developed nations. In particular, the West is vilifying Africa's energy industry because it is based on fossil fuels, even though the proportion of renewables is growing. There's no question that much of this anti-African oil and gas sentiment is based in fear of climate change, which is Interwoven with the sheer terror that a fossil fuel boom in Africa could be devastating to the world at large. Africa is vulnerable to climate change There's no denying that climate change is affecting Africa. One has only to look at the extended drought in the south to see how devastating things can be when customary weather patterns are disrupted. The thing is, Africa is being affected by a crisis NOT OF ITS OWN MAKING. If contributing just 3% of global emissions could cause issues like what we're seeing in Somalia, for example, the world's nations that produce far more greenhouse gases should be dried up, under water, blown away, or burned to a crisp by now. Consider this: Prominent American climate activist Bill McKibben said that the world can't fight climate change if Total Energies and Uganda goes through with building the East African Crude Oil Pipeline. Yes, according to McKibben, that one action will derail the entire carbon reduction scheme and offset anything any of the world's other countries are doing to reach net zero. Seems ridiculous, doesn't it? What's even more perplexing-or perhaps outlandish-is that McKibben has taken aim at a pipeline that will transport just 210,000 barrels of oil per day. That's roughly equivalent to 1.8% of the total output of the U.S., but he claims it must be stopped, or everything falls apart. What's the point of any climate effort anywhere if it can be undone by a relatively small pipeline that might actually be a lifeline in one of the world's most impoverished nations? But let's define what truly constitutes a boom in Africa. Energy use on the continent is still very low. So low, in fact, that researchers writing in Foreign Policy magazine estimate that if the one billion people living in sub-Saharan Africa tripled electricity using natural gas, the additional emissions would equal just 0.62% of global carbon dioxide. Energy use on the continent is so low that the average African consumes less electricity per year than an entire American family's refrigerator. At the same time, authors Todd Moss and Vijaya Ramachandran, from the Energy for Growth Hub, say the world is greatly overestimating how much natural gas Africa will generate between now and 2030. They cite a study in Nature Energy that claims the forecast for new gas generation in West Africa is five times the region's new gas potential. Obviously, there's some mathematical mismatch in the study. We have to ask ourselves: Will fossil fuel development in Africa signal an end to all of the world's good intentions and net zero ambitions? Or is this an example of 'green colonialism?' I find it interesting that a Financial Times' public poll, on the day it announced I was going to have an Oxford style debate on this issue, suggested that people are not at all convinced that African countries should abandon oil and gas - 70% of the 619 respondents took my position that Africa should make full use of its fossil fuels. How can we build a successful African energy movement? I believe the ultimate responsibility for getting there is ours and no one else's. Yes, we need partners to walk alongside us, but the success of our energy movement rests on African shoulders. To begin with, I am happy to see African energy stakeholders speaking with a unified voice about African energy industry goals thanks to African Energy Week. Africa Oil Week did everything to divide our voices and we stood firm and brought the Africa upstream, midstream and downstream together and we signed deals at African Energy Week. This will be particularly important as we go into COP27 in Egypt. It is imperative that African leaders present a unified voice and strategy for African energy transitions. We must make Africa's unique needs and circumstances clear and explain the critical role that oil and gas will play in helping Africa achieve net-zero emissions in coming decades. Western Support to Africa But, I would love to see Western governments, businesses, financial institutions, and organizations support our efforts. How? They can avoid demonizing the oil and gas industry. We see it constantly, in the media, in policy and investment decisions, and in calls for Africa to leave our fossil fuels in the ground. We see it with lawsuits to stop financing of Mozambique LNG or lawsuits to prevent Shell from even carrying out a seismic survey. Actions like these, even as Western leaders have pushed OPEC to produce oil, are not fair, and they're not helpful. Even as western countries are pushing to increase their own production and escalating coal use. I also would respectfully ask financial institutions to resume financing for African oil and gas projects and stop attempting to block projects like the East African Crude Oil pipeline or Mozambique's LNG projects. The 600 million-plus Africans without electricity are suffering. The 890 million Africans without a means of clean cooking are suffering. I would argue that if we want to protect Africans from harm and misery, we must embrace our natural gas resources. Natural gas has a lower environmental impact than other fossil fuels. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), switching thermal power plants from coal to gas was the main reason why the U.S. power-generating sector saw carbon dioxide emissions sink by 32% between 2005 and 2019. What's more, natural gas is indispensable in multiple ways. It is part of modern development, used for clean cooking, process heat, transportation, and as a feedstock for fertilizers. We can't overlook how important fertilizers are, considering the millions and millions of people who are food insecure across the globe or "teetering on the edge of famine," as the UN World Food Program puts it. The rise in food insecurity is often attributed to conflict, and the battles between Russia and Ukraine prove that point. Since the conflict began between the two large producers of wheat and grain, global food prices have skyrocketed. Considering how Russia has shut down natural gas exports, it's no surprise that fuel and fertilizer prices have also shot up. In fact, the increase in fertilizer costs is having as much of an effect on food prices as the conflict in Ukraine. When farmers can't afford fertilizer (which is more often the case in poor countries than rich ones), crop yield diminishes, food prices skyrocket, and more people are left hungry. Right now, the U.N. Global Crisis Response Group says, more than 60 countries are now struggling to afford food imports. It should come as no surprise that many of them are in Africa. Using African natural gas to fill the fertilizer feedstock gap will go a long way in mitigating those problems and putting food on the table worldwide. If Africa is allowed to develop its resources, there will be plenty of natural gas to go around. Natural gas helps the world meet its climate targets faster and can help solve the world's hunger crisis. And they're not alone Think about Europe, which is scrambling to line up enough oil, gas, and coal for the winter- and are looking to Africa for supplies - or consider the results of a 2022 Pew Research Survey of 10,237 U.S. adults about America's energy transition. Only 31% believed that the U.S. should phase out oil, gas, and coal completely, while 67% called for cultivating a mix of fossil fuels and renewable energy sources. So my question is, why should we in Africa give up our fossil fuels - fuels that represent solutions to some of our most pressing needs - when so many others question the wisdom of doing the same?

When Africans look at the green agenda from Western countries, they see something written by extreme forces that do not factor our concerns especially around natural gas and energy poverty. No thanks. Africa doesn't need a radical energy transition; Africa needs a just energy transition. We don't want to abandon our fossil fuels and find ourselves in the same situation Europe is in today. Africans know what it means to have no energy. We need a healthy balance of energy sources. Humanity's history is full of energy transitions. We move on to more efficient energy sources over time. The transition to renewable energy will happen. The Attacks on Africans Were Expected. Distractions from African Energy Poverty issues at COP27 Unfortunately, climate panic, smears and fear mongering are alive and well, and for some reason, Africa is public enemy number one. A continent that emits a negligible amount of carbon dioxide, at most, 3% of the world's total, is being disproportionately pegged as a threat to the planet by developed nations. With 600 million Africans without access to electricity, and more than 900 million without clean cooking facilities and many Africans looking for answers, Chlo&eacute; Farand, a very wealthy activist with close ties to radical group Extinction Rebellion came out attacking us with lies at COP27 . She never contacted us. She never talked to us. She lied. We would honestly like to ask who is funding Chlo&eacute; Farand's anti African campaign. Can she put out their financials? For an all-white climate group that is all day, all night, all white with no black employees to have the audacity to attack Africans kids working on energy poverty gives Chutzpah a new meaning. For a very rich white persons receiving a lot of money from Anti African groups and living with so much electricity to attack poor Africans who don't have lights is sickening. We are proud about the work we do at the African Energy Chamber and our work to Make Energy Poverty History. We did not say Gas is green. Europeans say Gas is green and we agree with them. Chlo&eacute; Farand's problem should not be with me or the Chamber, their problem should be with the EU that calls gas green. Their problem should be with the UK that is opening coal mines and drilling in the North Sea. The African Energy Chamber's position is, if we want to protect Africans from harm and misery, we must embrace our natural gas resources. Europe is doing same. What is their obsession with black people. Farand and team look everywhere for the mysterious causes of energy poverty, ignorance, crime, war and climate change problems. They need to look no further than their own mirrors and stop looking at Africans. Mirrors are not to reflect what you see. Mirrors are to correct what you see. This is the kind of colonial mindset that African children have to combat and defeat especially if we have to ensure that they don't take our critical minerals and leave us in the dark. When they don't have the intellectual capacity to beat you on the facts, they go low with misrepresentations and blatant lies that they have no proof, no evidence with hope that it works in world where alternative facts and fake news go. We are ready and we will fight back. Expedited Timelines The difference now, though, is that governments want to implement our transition on an expedited timeline. And they're very optimistic that everything will fall into place on their timeline in Africa. But, again, they're ignoring realities on the ground. And they're ignoring what our fossil fuel resources, especially natural gas, can do for our continent. We can use our natural gas to lift Africans out of poverty. After all, Africans are poor because they are energy-poor. To overcome that, we need to reject the world's green energy agenda and make full use of our fossil fuels, just as nations worldwide have already done. It's neither fair nor ethical for rich countries to make policies that keep other countries poor. Energy Transition or Renewable Energy We are not arguing against an energy transition or renewable energy. We are excited about renewables' potential. But a premature transition from fossil fuels to renewables would be harmful. We need to get away from this binary thinking. For now, let's work on growing Africa's energy mix. We can continue producing, exporting, and using clean natural gas and using the revenues to help pay for our energy transition. Let's work on building our capacity in renewable energies so we can make sure that good jobs and leadership opportunities in renewables go to Africans. And of course, we need the international community to keep its promises about providing the billions, possibly trillions, of dollars needed for a just African transition.

By NJ Ayuk, Chairman, African Energy Chamber ( HYPERLINK http://www.EnergyChamber.org www.EnergyChamber.org Ahead of the November 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference (more commonly known as COP27 ) in Egypt, Dr. Benedict Oramah, president and chair of Afreximbank, authored a thoughtful and compelling commentary about the economic and social impact of divestment from the production of fossil fuels in Africa. Dr. Oramah is not a climate science denier nor a fossil-fuels-at-all-cost advocate. In his paper, he is upfront and honest about the effect rising temperatures have already had on the continent, citing the devastation brought by extreme weather events &mdash; disastrous rainstorms on one hand, catastrophic droughts on the other. He casts a wary eye on the future, recognizing that developing parts of the world like Africa are at greater risk from climate change than are developed nations. In his commentary, "Transiting to green growth in fossil export-dependent economies: A pathway for Africa," Dr. Oramah acknowledges that urgent climate action is vital, that the time for foot-dragging is over. HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3EBXuer https://bit.ly/3EBXuer At the same time, Dr. Oramah doesn't overlook the fact that fossil fuels financed by foreign capital have been the economic engine of many African nations. Nor does he neglect to mention that, as major oil companies find themselves on the receiving end of divestment pressure and seek "less risky" assets, investment in the continent's oil and gas sector has fallen significantly, from $60 billion in 2013 to $22.5 billion in 2020 by African Energy Chamber estimates. One shudders to think what would happen to the continent's major oil-exporting countries &mdash; including Algeria, Angola, Equatorial Guinea. Gabon, Congo Republic, and Nigeria, where fossil fuels represent anywhere from 7% to 37% of GDP &mdash; should the industry evaporate altogether. As Dr. Oramah notes, "divesting from fossil fuel could cut as much as $30 billion off Nigeria's GDP and almost $190 billion off the continent's GDP." The social and economic repercussions &mdash; some of which are already playing out as investment has tightened &mdash; would be profound as export earnings and revenues dry up, fossil fuel-dependent factories shutter, the already limited fossil fuel-powered grid is strained further, jobs are lost, and poverty ripples even farther through even more communities. And, of course, the backdrop to all this is the fact that nowhere else is there an electricity deficit like Africa's. Six hundred million people still live without a reliable source of power. Fortunately, Dr. Oramah's commentary isn't without hope. He poses an interesting question: Is it possible to reconcile the world's carbon reduction goals with Africa's right to use its resources and achieve a smoother and "less painful" transition to renewables? He answers with a promising solution: using earnings from fossil fuels "to support an orderly economic diversification and structural transformation programmes and, importantly, to maintain a meaningful economic livelihood for the most vulnerable population." The institutional structure to accomplish those goals, Dr. Oramah says, is an African Energy Transition Bank &mdash; which his bank is working to establish in partnership with the African Petroleum Producers Organization (APPO). The African Energy Transition Bank is expected to achieve four key goals: Restore and leverage African and global investment flows into the continent's oil and gas industry over a transitional period. Mobilize funding to support investments into the energy value chain of its members. Increase investment in transition fuel production and logistics. Support diversification of the fossil-dependent economies to mitigate the economic cost of transition. In addition, Dr. Oramah wrote, the bank will promote intra-African trade and investment to reduce the sizable carbon emissions derived from the externalization of Africa's supply chains. Some 85% of Africa's trade is extra-African. It would be difficult, I think, to find fault with Dr. Oramah's concerns, assertions, or well-considered plans. Redirecting current fossil fuel revenues to greener industries on a measured timetable with appropriate benchmarks &mdash; that's how Africa can help mitigate environmental harm, stabilize vulnerable economies and prepare them for growth, and incentivize the development of low-carbon, green power across the continent. It's a win all around. The development of an African Energy Transition Bank does one more thing, though it's not mentioned in Dr. Oramah's commentary. It reduces our need for foreign aid, the traditional bandage for African poverty. We intend to push him on that issue during African Energy Week in Cape Town. As I've written in my books and editorials, Africa doesn't need hand-outs. They do more harm than good by blocking the potential and opportunities for poor people to help themselves. After all, it's hard for local farmers to sell their crops or eggs or cattle when they're competing with free food from a foreign government or institution. What we do need are skills development, infrastructure, and enabling environments to build vibrant economies &mdash; things I sincerely believe are possible through the work of a multi-billion-dollar, pan-African energy bank and its capacity-building. The African Energy Transition Bank will serve as a catalyst for private investment. By channeling these funds into African projects, the bank will drive homegrown development and socioeconomic growth while increasing access to electricity for everyday Africans. In short, Africans will be doing it by ourselves and for ourselves, without Western assistance or, more to the point, interference. Dr. Oramah's commentary gives the world a much-needed voice of reason when it comes to Africa's energy transition. The pragmatic approach he proposes for Africa's energy transition respects the global community's need to slow climate change&mdash;and holds our continent responsible for helping the world achieve that vital goal. But it also shows that we can protect our planet and people without sacrificing African needs and priorities. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Chamber.

With barely two months to go before the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt, Africa and other developing parts of the world that bear the severest brunt of climate change are warning against turning it into a mere talking shop of promises. African Development Bank Group President Dr. Akinwumi Adesina and speakers at the 2nd ministerial meeting on climate and development held on the sidelines of the ongoing UN General Assembly on Tuesday in New York questioned the commitment of developed countries to deliver on the promises they made at COP26 in Glasgow and the 2015 Paris Agreement. They called for urgent action to raise funding for the world's most vulnerable nations. The top-level meeting wants climate and nature objectives mainstreamed across financial and economic policy as well as a significant action point to be presented at COP27 in November. &ldquo;We are late. We must act. I'm fed up with saying the same thing too many times in the same meetings. Business as usual is the collective enemy. It's time for action,&rdquo; said US climate envoy John Kerry adding, &ldquo;We are working on something serious to be put on the table at Sharm El Sheikh.&rdquo; Senator Kerry spoke about his recent trips to Nigeria and Senegal, which are among 48 sub-Saharan countries that contribute less than 0.55% of carbon gas emissions yet suffer disproportionately from the impacts of climate change. He said the world must change the way it does business ahead of COP 27 and called for the involvement of the private sector to raise the financing that is required to tackle climate change.\\xa0 &ldquo;Climate and development go together. The key point is: where is the money? All promises were left in Paris.&rdquo; Dr. Adesina painted the reality of climate change in some of the African countries he recently visited, describing the situation as a heart-wrenching thing. &ldquo;In Cabo Verde, they have not had rain for nearly three years. In Mauritania, vast areas are deserted because of lack of rain,&rdquo; said the African Development Bank head Adesina told the meeting: &ldquo;Africa is suffering, choking, and is in serious financial distress for what it didn't cause. There must be a greater sense of urgency not in talking, but in doing and delivering resources that the continent needs very desperately.&rdquo; He charged the world to deliver at COP 27 -the Africa COP, &ldquo;we must deliver the goods there. If there are good to be delivered, it's really about adaptation. We do desperately need to have the financing for adaptation.&rdquo; Adesina spoke about the bank-led Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program, which is mobilizing $25 billion of financing to support the continent at scale. Speakers advocated for a coordinated strategy that involves funders, partners, and the private sector working together to finance climate change, especially for adaptation. Additionally, they urged countries to honour the promises they made at the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow. &ldquo;Adaptation never gets the attention it deserves.\\xa0 We need to make sure we are funding the things that have the highest impact, said co-founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Bill Gates. He highlighted how the challenge of climate change has been underscored by a series of bad weather events this year, emphasizing the urgency of action, including investing in technologies and scientists in developing countries. &ldquo;It is fantastic that there is the goal of doubling adaptation money by 2025 to $40 billion. I will say a few things about how we think about measuring those 40 billion dollars.\\xa0 The first is that it should probably be focused on low-income countries. The needs there are quite traumatic. There is a question of how we define that money given these weather events and their effects on agriculture&hellip;&rdquo; He added: &ldquo;I don't think the world community is saying that we should spend less on vaccines in order to fund climate adaptation, but rather that we want this money to be incremental in the aid budget.&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;As you can see, young people are worried about their future. Let us use today's ministerial meeting to learn from one another and share practical and tangible actions that will make young people proud of us. We are here together, working hand in hand to address the climate crisis to ensure a bright future for our young people.&rdquo; A youth climate activist from Papua New Guinea Vinzealhar Ainjo Nen emphasized the reality of the situation in her country. &ldquo;Papua New Guinea is one of many island nations experiencing the wrought of the climate and nature crisis-long droughts, submerging islands- you name it. My people and I are existing in these conditions every day,&rdquo; she told the meeting. Referring to what she described as a lengthy and complicated legal process to access climate funds at the national and international, she observed: &ldquo;I must stress that mother nature does not operate within legal frameworks, and we don't have time to waste.&rdquo; Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Simon Stiell echoed the need for what he termed &ldquo;a series of actions&rdquo; to mobilize finance. &ldquo;We need to get the whole architecture working. Climate disasters are increasingly coming in a variety of forms. We are formally in a decade of decisive action,&rdquo; he reminded the meeting. Rwanda and the UK COP 26 Presidency co-chaired the Second Climate and Development Ministerial Meeting to review progress since COP 26 UN Climate Change Conference and advance transformational global climate action. \</doc>

The Federal Government has identified about 213 gas blocks that are open for investments. A document obtained by The PUNCH titled, "Nigeria's Cretaceous Basins: The Potentials for Gas," put together by the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, stated that the gas blocks were located in the Niger Delta, Anambra, Benue Trough, Bida, Chad, Dahomey and Sokoto. It said 69 of the blocks were discovered in the Niger Delta basin, 12 in Anambra, 41 in Benue Trough, 17 in Bida, 40 in Chad, six in Dahomey, and 28 in Sokoto. Already, the country has 60 gas basins under the Oil Prospecting Licences; 44 are in the Niger Delta, five in Anambra, two in Benue Trough, six in Chad, and three in Dahomey. There are also 115 gas wells already allocated under Oil Mining Licenses\\xa0 112 in the Niger Delta, two in Anambra and one in Dahomey. The Federal Government, through the National Gas Expansion Programme, declared 2020 to 2030 as the decade of gas, and has identified gas as the country's transitional fuel. As part of Nigeria's contribution to energy transition, the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), in 2021, during the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Glasgow, pledged that the country would reach net zero by 2060. In exclusive report by The PUNCH, it was reported that the Federal Government would need N834trn to attain its net zero agenda. "That is a tall one. Where will the money come from? That target is ambitious and aspirational but again, because we are looking at a long term thing; we must not totally dismiss it" the immediate past Director-General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Muda Yusuf, stated. He added, "With what is happening globally, you can see that the pace of decarbonisation has slowed. Countries that are committed to a more aggressive push are going back to fossil fuels, looking for coal. "I am not optimistic that raising such an amount will be easy. Then the commitment to the COP is also not too impressive and very weak. And if commitment is this low, how do you convince investors either in form of aid or whatever, to invest this kind of huge money. It's going to be a tall order." The NUPRC said Nigeria's cretaceous basins hold a promising future for the Nigerian oil and gas industry, and presents a pathway for Nigeria to decarbonise, while ensuring energy security. It stated that further exploration of the other cretaceous basins would deepen and realise the potential for Nigeria to triple its gas reserves by 2050. Independent researcher and development practitioner and consultant on the DFID-funded Facility for Oil Sector Transformation, managed by the Oxford Policy Management, Dauda Garuba, said the management of Nigeria's revenue from its natural resources should be topmost concern. "Gas is touted as the transition mineral. Nigeria is richer in gas than oil. I see much more to be discovered. However, we should be more concerned about the management of earnings from this," he said. \</doc>

The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouq has stated the Federal Government's readiness to scale up climate change adaption in Nigeria through her ministry. This is in a bid to build community resilient and adaptation practices to mitigate and reduce the consequent of climate change. She said this at a side event at COP27 , taking place in Egypt, titled, 'Scaling up Climate Change Adaptation in Nigeria' organised by her ministry in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment. In her statement, the minister explained that: 'Our communities are composed of the poor, elderly, children and persons living with disabilities the addition effect of climate change has rendered them more vulnerable than they already are.' According to her, her ministry will attempt to mitigate the impact of climate change on the vulnerable members of society through the scaling up of climate change adaptation in Nigeria. She said her ministry will work with the Nigerian adaptation plan which seeks to reduce the vulnerability of communities to the impact of climate change by building adaptive capacity and resilience. She added that the plan also advocates integration of climate change adaptation into relevant policies programme and activities, as well as developing planning process and strategies. 'The reason we are here today is to harness and discuss good practices programme and strategies that other countries are using to reduce vulnerabilities to climate change. 'We want to know how to build adaptive capacities and resilience in line with national and international policies and commitment in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation' 'Specifically we want to know how to identify and map out climate change risk better we harmonise input and launch a people-centred climate change adaptation in collaboration with key partners like the federal ministry of environment and other relevant Ministry Department and Agencies.' Earlier in his remarks, the Minister of Environment, Mohammed Abdulahi quoting the report of the inter-governmental panel on climate change affirmed that by 2050 many coastal mega cities like Lagos, Port Harcourt and other low line coastal cities in Nigeria will in a century witnessed weather catastrophe every year affecting millions of people and properties and causing devastation. Consequently Nigeria has taken a bold step to develop Adaptation Communication guided by the NAP Global Network, adaptation communication will play a central role in identifying national needs and enabling international follow up while informing future action, driving ambition and contributing information for the global stock-taking. He said, 'It is obvious that the challenges of climate change are enormous and since no individual Ministry can confront the challenges alone, we are calling for joint and cooperative efforts to tackle the problem, it is therefore pertinent that we begin to take our pledges into action as take away from COP 27 .' \</doc>

By Vivian Emoni The Women Environmental Programme (WEP), on Wednesday, called for urgent action to mitigate the continuing impacts of climate change in Nigeria. Dr Priscilla Achakpa, Founder, Global Lead Women Environmental Programme, said in Abuja that this was imperative to ensure sustainable development in the country. Achakpa who spoke during the inauguration of African Women and Girls Demand for COP27 coming up in November, said women and girls also needed to have a voice during the conference. "Ahead of the 27th session of conference of parties ( COP27 ) to the UNFCCC, the stakeholders are expecting the meeting to deliver some effective matters that will pave way to the vulnerable countries. "As the impacts of climate change continue to take a toll on vulnerable continents across the world, urgent actions are needed to reverse this trend, to pave the way for sustainable development. "Therefore, we expected COP27 to deliver a funding mechanism for losses and damages associated with climate change impacts. "We expect strong support for smallholder food producers, especially our women and youths, including people with disabilities. "Our reason for the support is because the smallholders farmers produce around a third of the world`s food, unfortunately climate change has negatively impacted the farmers," she added. Achakpa said that the meeting should prioritise agro-ecology and other nature-based solutions in tackling the climate crisis, as well as redeeming pledges to climate funds. She said that the COP27 scheduled to hold in Egypt should provide more space for women and youth to participate in national and global climate change processes. Achakpa observed that only 10 per cent of heads of COPs delegations were women in 2009, 13 per cent in 2021, 9 per cent in 2015 and 26 per cent in 2017. "Therefore, promotion of participation of all population groups in global and national climate change processes is crucial. "We expect the promotion of this participant of all groups from COP27 because the percentage of women across all national delegations needs to increase. "Women participation tends to be highest in delegations from developed countries than in Africa and Asia," she said. Achakpa said that women and youth in the country and Africa have bigger expectations beyond COP27 . She said that the WEP would engage the Federal Government to support effective implementation of its demands and programmes, after the COP27 .

Nigeria, Nov. 4 -- A research work commissioned by the Centre for Journalism Innovation and Development (CJID) has revealed the capacities or otherwise of three West African countries to meet their climate change pledges. The findings, a product of intensive survey and deep-dive research by climate experts, has been released by CJID ahead of the Conference of Parties (COP) scheduled to hold in Egypt in November. Authored by Gideon Ofosu-Peasah, Obasanjo Oyedele, Onu Kingsley, and Fatou Jeng, the research was funded by the Ford Foundation, as part of the CJID's climate change project. A snippet into the report suggests that the African continent is currently between the rock and a hard place over the challenges posed by climate change. Background With its far-reaching and devasting impact on natural and human ecosystem, climate change is wreaking social and economic havoc on Africa. The recent devastating flooding - one of the worst in human history, is said to be an example of the dangerous impacts of climate change in Nigeria and other African countries. According to experts, Africa's vulnerability to climate change suggests that governments must join the rest of the world in taking ambitious climate action to increase the continent's resilience and adaptive capacity to climate change. However, the reality, these experts said, is that most Africa's economies are poor, heavily dependent on natural resource exploitation, and are struggling with heavy debt burdens. Therefore, they believe, poorly thought-out climate action, globally and within countries, can compromise the prospects of economic growth and bind the continent to poverty. Based on the encouragement by international development partners, several African countries have recently made ambitious pledges on climate action through their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), Long Term Visions and Strategies (LTV/LTS), and more recently by way of net-zero announcements. These efforts, on the surface, are found to be encouraging. However, a major question remains whether Africa can meet the ambitious climate pledges they are making, particularly with a widespread apprehension about the feasibility of African climate pledges. "There are concerns that the ambitious climate goals being set by African countries are not in alignment with the political and economic realities in these countries and that these may result in a huge implementation and credibility gap in the coming years," CJID noted in a publication. Research With a focus on three West African countries - Nigeria, Ghana, and The Gambia - CJID coordinated major research to explore the feasibility of the climate pledges made by West African countries, under the leadership of globally recognised professor of climate change, Chukwumerije Okereke. The research sought to ascertain the forces that led to the setting of these targets, the likelihood that the targets will be met, the barriers that inhibit action, and some options for driving credible and context-sensitive climate action in West Africa. Extensive research has shown that the ability of countries to implement ambitious climate policies to drive the transformation towards low carbon economies depends on a number of specific dimensions of 'feasibility' and 'enabling conditions' which operate across multiple scales, including political, socio-economic, technological and institutional factors. Drawing from the above background and conceptual framework, the chapters have provided a short overview of the key social, political, and economic facts of the case study countries, provided a sketch of the climate policy in the case study countries, with emphasis on the events after the Paris Agreement - when NDCs were submitted, when they were revised, whether there are Long Term Strategies (LTS'), and crucially assessed the feasibility of climate pledges in the case study countries. In assessing the feasibility of the climate pledges in the case study countries, the research focuses on the political, economic, social, and institutional dimensions of the feasibilities. For the political dimension, it focuses on the extent to which the political situation and processes in the country make it more or less likely that countries will fulfil their pledges. And for financial feasibility, it focuses on the likelihood that countries have the financial resources to fulfil their pledges. With respect to social dimensions of feasibility, the emphasis is the extent of climate change awareness in the case study countries and the degree of agitation and mobilisation for strong climate action by citizens and civil societies. Also, the research considered the institutional feasibility that focuses on the nature and quality of institutional arrangements for climate action in the case study countries. This includes the presence and quality of the countries' environment and climate change ministries, the presence or otherwise of climate change laws to impel action, whether there are overarching bodies within the Presidency in these countries that are supervising climate action or whether there are systems for inter-ministerial coordination on climate action. Equally vital is whether there are dedicated public bodies supported by consultative mechanisms for implementation? All the chapters end with subject assessments of the authors on how each case country ranks in the above measurement criteria - political, economic, social, and institutional feasibility - with scores ranging from low, medium to high. For each of the ranking, the authors provide justification for their assessment. Research Findings The research finds that in the three countries studied, existing dire socio-economic realities hamper the feasibility of lofty ambitions announced by the respective governments. For one, rising debts are a big challenge to raising the needed financial resources to support mitigation and adaptation plans, and that, the populations in these countries already battle poor living conditions, hence balancing economic growth and climate ambitions is a serious challenge for them. Ghana In Ghana, the research finds that, notwithstanding the high percentage of conditional policy actions, the country has performed admirably in the past with regard to its climate pledges and that it has largely created realistic climate pledges situated within the context of government policy. "Social and institutional factors support Ghana's climate pledges, while economic and political forces pose a threat. Based on advancements made in the social and institutional variables, Ghana's new climate goals are largely realisable," the research findings revealed. The Gambia In the Gambia the research predicts grave difficulties in implementing the country's ambitious NDC as a nation that is dealing with significant economic difficulties and dependent on donor funding to carry out its development programme. It added that The Gambia has been successful in creating national climate policies that would aid in the execution of her NDC, but that the nation's economy is entirely dependent on agriculture. According to the research, having ambitious climate policies without taking concrete action would have an impact on how well these NDCs are implemented in nations like The Gambia. Nigeria The research credits Nigeria for lofty ambitions as expressed in the NDC and net zero target, but concludes that implementation has been very slow, and poorly coordinated. The research therefore suggests that weak financial, economic, social and institutional conditions casts severe doubt on the likelihood that Nigeria will accomplish her climate pledges. Essence CJID said the report is essential to providing quality information to the public and members of the climate community "in order to mobilise and demand realistic and effective actions from the respective governments as we approach COP27 later this year." "While it is important to raise the climate ambitions, when these ambitions are not backed by requisite action or where there is a lack of wherewithal to implement them, the ambitions become unfruitful," it added.

H.E. Macky Sall, President of the Republic of Senegal and Chairperson of the African Union (AU), will deliver the opening ceremony welcome address at the MSGBC Oil, Gas & Power Conference, organized by Energy Capital & Power (ECP) ( HYPERLINK http://EnergyCapitalPower.com http://EnergyCapitalPower.com COP 27 . http://www.EnergyChamber.org www.EnergyChamber.org With gas top of the agenda in the region, this year&rsquo;s edition encompasses the theme, "The Future of Natural Gas: Growth Using Strategic Investment and Policymaking," a subject on which H.E Macky Sall has been fiercely outspoken throughout his term. In his inaugural speech as chair of the AU, H.E. President Macky Sall called for a just energy transition which opens up the exploitation of clean hydrocarbons such as gas for industrialization, along with improved access to development finance for the continent. Backed by developments such as the 15 trillion cubic feet (tcf) Greater Tortue Ahmeyim (GTA) ( HYPERLINK http://bit.ly/3PJ3yVE http://bit.ly/3PJ3yVE As new abundant natural resource reserves are discovered across the region, there has never been a more prescient time to unite leaders, industry professionals and executives in discussions on investment and policy, decarbonization and technology. Senegal itself has a dozen offshore blocks open for lease, Mauritania has 19, The Gambia has two onshore and four offshore blocks under exploration, Guinea-Bissau has recently licensed 11 offshore blocks of its own, whilst Guinea-Conakry is only now entering the extractive energy field with reserves unknown. In this regard, the entire MSGBC region is ready and open for business, with regional leaders inviting international companies and governments to partner, invest and sign deals to reshape the MSGBC landscape on the back of gas. The MSGBC Oil, Gas & Power Conference 2022 steps into this picture in response to increased interest by international stakeholders to invest, develop and succeed in Africa, focusing on enhancing regional partnerships and spurring investment. Already there has been some success in this area with Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany meeting with H.E. President Macky Sall this week, discussing a potential gas deal between the two nations. As this agreement takes off, other MSGBC countries are calling for more European nations to follow suite, with MSGBC Oil, Gas & Power 2022 representing the best platform to cement such partnerships. Gathering together leading policymakers and with the Senegalese Energy Minister, H.E. Aissatou Sophie Gladima, in attendance, the event will be one of the first big opportunities to re-engage and connect with investors following COP26 and before COP27 , where the African continent and its energy industry will stand in the spotlight. The conference represents the official meeting place of stakeholders from across the oil, gas and renewable sectors, making it the most suitable platform to discuss Africa&rsquo;s energy narrative ahead of COP27 . COP27 COP27 . About the MSGBC Oil, Gas & Power 2022 Conference: Under the patronage of H.E. Macky Sall, President of the Republic of Senegal, MSGBC Oil, Gas & Power will once again take place in Dakar, Senegal, with the event serving as a catalyst for investment and multi-sector development in 2022.

The Federal Government is now pioneering a voluntary billion dollars' worth Carbon Market on the continent, a new and innovative Climate Change solution which will create, over the period of energy transition, millions of new jobs in Nigeria alone, according to estimates of the international experts. This is part of efforts of the Federal Government to attain the global net-zero emissions target, and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN is a member of the recently formed international Steering Committee for the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI), with the objective of facilitating the emergence and growth of the market in Africa. Besides Prof. Osinbajo, other members of the Committee of the ACMI, which would be announced early in November at the COP27 meeting in Egypt are former President of Colombia, Ivan Duque Marquez; President of the African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina, among others, including officials of the United Nations, USAID, Gates Foundation and other international private sector players. ACMI's estimates suggest that Nigeria alone could produce up to 30 million carbon credits per year by 2030, which at $20/credit would be worth over half a billion dollars annually. According to the estimates by the ACMI, "at this level of production, the industry could potentially support over 3 million Nigerian jobs. And Nigeria has only a portion of Africa's total potential the impact for the continent as a whole could be far greater." The jobs would span the period of the energy transition, starting from the time the market is able to kickoff, till 2060. Also on the committee are the CEO of UN-based Sustainable Energy for All, Damilola Ogunbiyi; Deputy Director, Gates Foundation, Samuel Thevasagayam; Chief Climate Officer, USAID, Gillian Caldwell; Chair of Integrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Markets, Annette Nazareth; and CEO, Verra, David Antonioli. In addition, the CEO, M-PESA Africa, Sitoyo Lopokolyit; Managing Partner, Hartree, Ariel Perez; Director, MENA Voluntary Carbon Exchange, Riham EIGizy; CEO Conservation International, M Sanjayan; Vice President, Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP), and Africa Director, UN Climate Change High-Level Champions, Joseph Nganga, complete the list of distinguished personalities on the committee. The Committee will be inaugurated at the forthcoming International Climate Change Conference in Egypt tagged COP 27 , with the aim to lead advocacy for the realisation of the Carbon Credits initiative as an effective way of reducing emissions while financing green growth across Africa. The Carbon Credit initiative prioritises the use of environmentally friendly energy sources for domestic and industrial purposes. For instance, carbon credits could support the conditional portion of Nigeria and other Africa nation's nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. Nigeria's carbon credit potential is concentrated in household devices and forestry sectors, both of which will attract significant benefits. Household devices like solar lanterns and clean cookstoves contribute to expanding energy access and improving health outcomes, while carbon forestry credits enable the conservation of Nigeria's rich biodiversity and support sustainable livelihoods. \</doc>

The President of the 26th Conference of Parties, which took place in Glasgow, the United Kingdom and British official to the 27th\\xa0 Conference of Parties, Alok Sharma, has called for more concrete actions in fighting climate change. He made these remarks on Sunday, November 6, 2022 in Sharm el-Shiekh, Egypt as COP27 began. In his opening speech, Sharma spoke of the need to keep to the 1.5 degree Celsius reach as enunciated in the Paris Agreement. He also noted the dangers of inaction, which could defer climate catastrophe. He said, "Friends, we are not currently on a pathway that keeps 1.5 degree Celsius in reach. And whilst I do understand that leaders around the world have faced competing priorities this year, we must be clear as challenging as our current moment is, inaction is myopic, and can only defer climate catastrophe." Speaking about the need for drastic actions, Sharma spoke of the impacts of climate change such as the recent flooding experienced in Nigeria and Pakistan. "We must find the ability to focus on more than one thing at once. How many more wake-up calls do world leaders actually need? A third of Pakistan under water. The worst flooding in Nigeria in a decade. This year, the worst drought in 500 years in Europe, in a thousand years in the United States, and the worst on record in China," he said. The COP26 President expressed hope that world leaders during the conference would explain what their countries had achieved within the past year and would highlight how they intend to go further. He promised that the United Kingdom would reach ambitious outcomes across the agenda of the climate conference which are on mitigation, adaptation and loss and damage. Meanwhile, the Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs and COP27 President, Sameh Shoukry, has called on countries to use the opportunity that the climate conference provides to make multilateralism work in the fight against climate change. Shoukry said, "We're gathering this year at a time when global climate action is at a watershed moment. Multilateralism is being challenged by geopolitics, spiraling prices, and growing financial crises, while several countries battered by the pandemic have barely recovered, and severe and depleting climate change-induced disasters are becoming more frequent. " COP27 COP27 must be remembered as the 'Implementation COP' \- the one where we restore the grand bargain that is at the centre of the Paris Agreement." COP27 is expected to end on Friday, November 18, 2022. \</doc>

The United Kingdom (UK) government yesterday voted \Â£3200milion to African countries to adapt to the impacts of climate change, deal with severe drought and floods that have dealt a debilitating blow across the continent. The COP27 The Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, who made the announcement, said the funding will go, via the AfDB Climate Action Window (CAW) to 'those most affected by the impacts of climate change' The CAW is a new mechanism set up to channel climate finance to help vulnerable countries adapt to the impacts of climate change, from severe drought in the Horn of Africa to floods in South Sudan. 'Climate change is having a devastating impact on countries in Sub-Saharan Africa facing drought and extreme weather patterns, which have historically received a tiny proportion of climate finance. 'This new mechanism from the African Development Bank will see vital funds delivered to those most affected by the impacts of climate change, much more quickly. 'Lack of access to climate finance for the world's poorest countries was a central focus at COP26 in Glasgow. This \Â£3200 million of UK funding is helping us to make tangible progress to address this issue,' Cleverly said. Speaking on the cash, AfDB Group president, Akinwumi Adesina, welcomed the additional funding from the UK. Adesina said: 'I applaud the UK government for this major contribution towards the capitalization of the Climate Action Window of the African Development Fund, as it seeks to raise more financing to support vulnerable low-income African countries that are most affected by climate change. This bold move and support of the UK will strengthen our collective efforts to build climate resilience for African countries. With increasing frequencies of droughts, floods and cyclones that are devastating economies, the UK support for climate adaptation is timely, needed, and inspiring in closing the climate adaptation financing gap for Africa. 'I came to COP 27 The Glasgow Climate Pact included a commitment from donors to double adaptation finance in 2025 from 2019 levels. British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, said the UK will surpass that target and triple adaptation funding from \Â£3500 million in 2019 to \Â£31.5 billion in 2025.?This funding package provided to the AfDB will be part of this commitment. The Netherlands has also announced that it will contribute to the CAW alongside the UK funding, and the Foreign Secretary has called on other countries to contribute over the coming months. The Prime Minister also confirmed yesterday that the UK is delivering the target of spending \Â£311.6 billion on International Climate Finance (ICF). This comes alongside new and expanded solar and geothermal power plants in Kenya backed by British International Investment, UK export financing for Nairobi's ground-breaking Railway City and a major public-private partnership on the Grand Falls Dam hydropower project - including a $3 billion investment led by UK firm GBM Engineering. Cleverly had announced a series of significant UK investments worth more than \Â£3100 million to support developing economies to respond to climate-related disasters and adapt to the impacts of climate change. \</doc>

By Tobias Lengnan Dapam The Commandant, National Institute for Security Studies (NISS), Alh. Ayodele Adeleke, said global climate change is responsible for farmers/herders clashes, drought, loss of farmland; desert encroachment; food insecurity; and migration. Adeleke made the submission, Thursday, at workshop organised for participants of the Executive Intelligence Management Course (EIMC 15) with the theme: The Global Climate Challenge: Prospects and Priorities for Economic Development and Conflict Resolution in Africa. While maintaining that the attendant effect of climate change on human lives cannot be overemphasized, the Commandant expressed the hope that workshop will provide perspectives on the challenges occasioned by climate change, and mitigation approaches. "We are all aware of the Global Climate Change and its Attendant Effects on human lives: loss of farmland; desert encroachment; food insecurity; drought; migration; farmers-herders clash et cetera", the institute's boss said. According to him: "The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) also known as the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 1992, United Nations Climate Change Conference 2015 \- COP 21 (Paris Agreement), United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), 2021 \- COP 26 (Glasgov \- Scotland) and other coalitions highlighted how different social, economic and environmental factors are interdependent and evolve together and how success in one sector requires action in other sectors to be sustained over time. "The presentations and discussions of today will create an avenue to dissect both sides of Climate Challenge, the Pros and Cons. "How has it affected the Environment and the inhabitants negatively and can it in anyway impact positively on our Economy? What are the conflicts associated with Climate Challenge and how have they been or can be resolved? What further impact is the Russia and Ukraine war having on the theme? "This Seminar will be thought provoking and it is on this note, that I appreciate the Keynote Presenter and the Discussants for agreeing to impact on the Participants. I therefore, enjoin the Participants and all of us here today, to pay rapt attention for our individual and collective benefits". He explained that the aannual seminar is one of the highlights of the Executive Intelligence Management Course, which is why the Institute places utmost premium in selecting the components of the Seminar. The Institute's Seminar has always provided a useful forum to exchange expertise and knowledge on issues confronting the nation and the entire Globe such as today's Theme. The programme witnessed presentations by the Vice Chancellor of the University of Calabar (UNICAL), Prof. Florence Obi; Prof. Kayode Oyesiku; Prof. Ebele Amali, as well as Prof. Patricia Donli. \</doc>

Trade policies should be incorporated into global climate action to augment financing and other climate-related support provided to vulnerable economies, World Trade Organization Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has said. 'I feel trade is part of the solution. You might have financing, but if the trade policies don't align, you may not be able to get the technologies you need for climate adaptation,' Okonjo-Iweala said at a recent Africa Adaptation Summit organized by the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Africa and many parts of Asia are among the most vulnerable to climate change and often, proposed solutions have hinged on rich nations who are largely culpable for higher emissions to fund climate adaptation strategies. Okonjo-Iweala argues it is possible to increase the return on investments in adaptation strategies and increase the resources available to African governments for adaptation through trade. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change in its February report said actions can be taken in the near-term, to address desertification, land degradation, and food security while supporting longer-term responses that enable adaptation and mitigation to climate change. Read also: South Africa's clean energy drive holds lessons for Nigerian retailers These include actions to build individual and institutional capacity, accelerate knowledge transfer, enhance technology transfer and deployment, enable financial mechanisms, implement early warning systems, undertake risk management and address gaps in implementation and upscaling. Africa is likely to be the continent most affected by climate change, accounting for 80% of the world's population that is most at risk, Okonjo-Iweala said citing IPCC report, a development that calls for more attention on agriculture. Climate impacts could cause crop productivity growth on the African continent to shrink by a third and lead to annual GDP losses of 3.8% by 2060 and trade will be vital to offset future shocks in agricultural output by ensuring access to new technologies such as more resilient crop varieties and better irrigation and water storage systems, the Director-General said. Ahead of COP 27 'At COP27 , along with climate finance issues, we need to give focus to trade and investment facilitation for the just climate transformation that we need.' At the sidelines of the summit, DG Okonjo-Iweala and GCA Chief Executive Officer Patrick Verkooijen signed a memorandum of understanding between the two organizations to intensify collaboration on trade and adaptation action in countries and regions vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The signing ceremony was witnessed by Ban Ki-moon, former Secretary-General of the United Nations and Chair of the GCA. The GCA is an international organization that works as a solutions broker to accelerate action and support for adaptation solutions, from the international to the local, in partnership with the public and private sectors. \</doc>

Godwin Oritse Lagos - A technical committee of the African Union has raised alarm over the dangerous push for gas supply by the European Union, a development Climate Change Campaigners warned that may put the continent in danger of locking Africa into fossil fuels for decades to come. Already, African leaders are considering a new position that would prioritize natural gas and nuclear over cleaner, cheaper, renewables. The technical committee of the African Union - made up of energy ministers has proposed an "African Common Position on Energy Access and Transition". This position centres on fossil gas and nuclear energy, at the expense of renewables, and is proposed for adoption by African Heads of State and was launched at COP27 . This comes on the back of the European Union's recent vote in favour of a new rule that will consider fossil gas and nuclear projects "green," making them eligible for low-cost loans and subsidies, and their scramble for Africa's energy resources. Recall that the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned in 2020 that there is no room for new fossil fuels. The development of gas would not only lock African nations into fossil fuel production but would also undermine any plans to rapidly cut greenhouse gas emissions in a bid to keep global temperatures under 1.5 degrees Celsius, in order to avert even more catastrophic climate impacts. Campaigners are concerned that the position will fail to achieve its own objectives of ensuring energy access and transition. They have also expressed concerns that it could have drastic consequences for Africa's future prosperity, locking in stranded asset risk damaging development prospects, while prioritising exports to Europe and the Global North. It could also damage the credibility of COP 27 and the viability of global climate goals as set out in the Paris Agreement. Their concerns are set out in an African Energy Access and Transition Memorandum Mohamed Adow, Director of Power Shift Africa, said: "Africa is blessed with an abundance of wind, solar and other clean renewable energies. African leaders should be maximizing this potential and harnessing the abundant wind and sun which will help boost energy access and tackle climate change. What Africa does not need is to be shackled with expensive fossil fuel infrastructure which will be obsolete in a few years as the climate crisis worsens. "It would be a shameful betrayal of African people, already on the front line of the climate crisis, if African leaders use this November's COP27 climate summit on African soil to lock Africa into a fossil fuel based future. Africa does not need the dirty energy of the past, it needs forward looking leadership that can take advantage of the clean energy of the present and future." Similarly, Dr. Sixbert Mwanga, Coordinator of Climate Action Network Africa, said: "The African Continent is endowed with so many and high-quality renewable energy sources including solar, wind, geothermal, tidal which could benefit its people. At COP27 , we call for the African Union and African leaders to announce the utilization of these sources for the benefit of our people and leave aside fossil fuel development for export." Also speaking, Charity Migwi, Africa Regional Campaigner at 350.org, said: "As a concerned African citizen, it is totally unacceptable for African leaders to prioritize gas while millions are hit by the unfolding climate crisis are struggling to adapt to the devastating realities of climate change. The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned in 2020 that there is no room for new fossil fuels. The development of gas would not only lock African nations into fossil fuel production but would also undermine any plans to rapidly cut greenhouse gas emissions in a bid to keep global temperatures under 1.5 degrees Celsius, in order to avert even more catastrophic climate impacts. African leaders must instead support sustainable sources of renewable energy for the communities in developing countries for the good of humanity and the planet." Another Climate Change campaigner, Avena Jacklin, Climate and Energy Justice Campaign Manager at groundWork and Friends of the Earth, South Africa said: "In July, South African communities and movements met and reflected on the expansion of the fossil fuel sector in South Africa and strengthened their commitment to fight for climate justice and to call for an urgent stop to all new fossil fuel exploration, extraction and development, and a managed phase out fossil fuel to secure a just transition for all South Africans, not only for the elite." Lorraine Chiponda of the Africa Coal Network Coordinator, said: "The 2022 IPCC clearly warns that the world needs drastic cuts in carbon emissions to prevent catastrophic climate impacts. The globe already has seen temperature rise and we will exceed 1.5\'baC by and suffer an increase in intensity and frequency in climate disasters. The prospect that African leaders are presenting and pushing for gas developments and investment is overwhelming and reckless given the climate impacts that threaten the lives of millions of people in Africa having seen worsening droughts and hunger, recurring floods and cyclones. In addition to this as we have seen in the past, the acceleration of gas projects in Africa is another colonial and modern 'Scramble and Partition of Africa' amongst energy corporations and "rich" countries. Fossil fuel projects have neither solved energy poverty in Africa where 600 million people in Africa still live in energy poverty nor brought any socio-economic justice to Africa people. We shall continue to strengthen calls for a people's just transition away from fossil fuels." Fatima Ahouli, Regional Coordinator of Climate Action Network Arab World, said: "Calling for more and new exploitation of fossil fuels in Africa is driven by the same hungry countries who only see Africa as a gold mine. The continuous and unsustainable abuse of Africa's resources contradicts all the fight against climate change in the World. It in fact undermines all the efforts of phasing out of fossil fuels as well as of letting African countries lead a more sustainable economies. We therefore demand a shutdown of these colonialist mindsets that only lead to more conflicts and accelerate humanity's doomsday." SweetCrude Reports 2022. \</doc>

Up to one-third of Africans lacking access to clean cooking today will be transitioned by 2027, according to the Conference of Parties ( COP27 )'s Africa Just and Affordable Energy Transition Initiative (AJAETI). According to the report titled 'Just Africa,' the initiative aims at transitioning 300 million people towards clean cooking out of the 970 million who do not have access to clean cooking fuels and technologies today, contributing to the SDG 7.1 target of universal access by 2030. AJAETI was commissioned by the leadership of the COP27 presidency of the Arab republic of egypt with with support from Boston Consulting Group, Inc., the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), International Energy Agency (IEA), and Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL). 568 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa lack access to electricity, and 900 million lack access to clean cooking fuels and technologies, according to the most recent Tracking SDG7: The Energy Progress Report 2022. The opportunity for an ambitious and long-lasting energy transition in Africa is provided by COP27 . It's a chance to create a fresh framework for collaboration in order to meet Agenda 2063's energy goals and the commitment to achieve universal access by 2030, the report read. Pinnacle's $1bn Offshore Subsea Petroleum Terminal To Ease Apapa gridlock 'Establishing a strong, broadly supported course for the just and equitable energy transition in Africa at COP27 will be crucial, as will becoming the benchmark for African nations as well as for the international partners who will be required to support this transition effort.' According to the report, the Initiative is framed around three key elements that are necessary for countries across the continent to accelerate preparation, financing, and implementation of their energy strategies. 'Second, it will ensure the access to technical assistance, advisory support and policy advice to governments at all levels for the different stages and phases of their transitions, which include energy infrastructure development, enabling frameworks, energy market structure, energy transition plans, project facilitation, the development of local and regional supply chains, human capacity and skills enhancement, retraining of labor and SME development, and the inclusiveness of communities to promote equitable approaches. 'Also, it will facilitate access to and the transfer, application, and development of new technologies and innovative solutions to harness the potential of and the opportunities for Africa in expanding its low carbon and renewable energy capacity. According to AJAETI initiative, the pillars of focus would include off-grid and grid -based renewable energy, energy efficiency, sectoral solutions (e.g., transport, industry etc.), entrepreneurship and technological innovation, and jobs and local value creation. \</doc>

The United States government has announced it will provide a $5 million grant to the African Development Bank to support efforts to abate methane gas emission, across Africa. Methane accounts for about half of the net rise in global average temperature since the pre-industrial era. The grant, subject to the completion of US domestic procedures and approvals, will go to the multi-donor Africa Climate Change Fund ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3DtKhno ), which is managed by the African Development Bank. The Fund supports a broad range of activities covering climate resilience and low-carbon growth. US special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry, made the announcement at a breakfast event held on the margins of the 18th African Ministerial Conference on the Environment taking place in Dakar. He said: "More than 25 countries on the continent have joined the Global Methane Pledge, a resounding level of support for the importance of methane in keeping 1.5 degrees within reach." "I am very pleased that the African Development Bank is responding to the increased global attention on methane emissions and is planning to increase their own focus on methane abatement in coming years," Kerry added. The Global Methane pledge, launched during COP26, targets reducing emissions of methane by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels over the next seven years. Welcoming the contributions, African Development Bank Vice President for Power, Energy, Climate and Green Growth, Kevin Kariuki said the Bank planned to create activities within the ACCF to support methane abatement. "With the support of the U.S. government, and other donors and non-state actors, we intend to create a dedicated pillar of activities within our Africa Climate Change Fund to support methane abatement including working with countries to include methane in their Nationally Defined Contributions and develop pipelines of methane abatement projects for further investment," Kariuki said. The African Development Bank would be releasing a methane baseline reporting covering waste and energy sector methane emissions across Africa at the forthcoming COP 27 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. "This will provide an excellent foundation for increased focus on methane emissions," said Kariuki. The African Development Bank's 2022 Africa Economic Outlook projects that Africa will need as much as $1.6 trillion between 2020-2030 to implement its climate action commitments and NDCs. The African Development Bank has committed to mobilizing $25 billion for climate finance by 2025; more than 50% of that funding will be allocated to adaptation projects.

President of the African Development Bank Group Dr Akinwumi Adesina says civil society organizations are essential partners in the Bank's effort to build the continent's resilience to climate change. Addressing the opening plenary of the 2022 Civil Society Forum on Thursday in the Ivorian economic capital, Abidjan, Adesina highlighted the African Development Fund's Climate Action Window to mobilize up to $13 billion to provide 20 million farmers with climate-smart agricultural technologies and 20 million farmers and pastoralists with weather-indexed insurance. The scheme will also revive 1 million hectares of degraded land, and provide renewable energy for about 9.5 million people. "We will need you, civil society organizations, to strongly advocate for and support the 16th replenishment of Fund, as it holds great promise for supporting the most vulnerable in the face of climate change devastation," the Bank chief told the forum. The African Development Fund is the concessional window of the African Development Bank Group that supports eligible African countries in strengthening their economic capacity, reducing poverty, and spurring economic and social development. ADF-contributing countries are currently discussing its next financial replenishment. The two-day forum was held under the theme "Engaging civil society for climate resilience and just energy transition." It fostered an open dialogue with civil society actors, allowing them to share their views and proposals ahead of the global climate summit, COP27 , slated for mid-November in the Egyptian resort city of Sharm El Sheikh. Adesina said COP27 Vice President for Power, Energy, Climate and Green Growth, Dr Kevin Kariuki, projects that for Africa to meet its needs for socio-economic development, it must double its energy consumption by 2040. To help this happen, "the Bank is committed to engaging in permanent and constructive dialogue with all African climate change stakeholders, including the civil society, to deliver tangible results and ensure a successful COP27 for Egypt, and for Africa", Kariuki said. The president of the Panafrican Farmers Organization, Kolyang Palebele, called for the integration of resilience into national development plans and challenged African governments to operationalize the Malabo Declaration on Accelerated Growth and Transformation of Agriculture in Africa for Shared Prosperity.\\xa0 "The time is critical. We must react quickly to the shocks of climate change that are affecting the African people." The diplomatic corps in Abidjan also aired strong support for the continent's climate change objectives. The Ambassador of the Republic of Korea\\xa0 to C\'f4te d'Ivoire, Lee Sang Ryul, commended the African Development Bank's efforts to ensure accountability by working closely with civil society organizations. He reiterated his country's commitment to supporting energy projects and institutional capacity building to aid the continent's growth. The Ambassador of the Arab Republic of Egypt to Cote d'Ivoire, Wael Badawi, assured the audience that civil society will be represented during COP27 . "Egypt will be organizing thematic days on the margins of COP27 as panel discussions in which we seek a balanced participation from States, private sector and from civil society organizations mostly to tackle issues such as finance, new and renewable energies, water, adaptation and agriculture, biodiversity, science and scientific research, solutions, decarbonization, civil society, women and youth," he said. The opening ceremony included a high-level conversation between Bank chief Adesina, an African Union Youth Advisory Board Member, Soumaya Zaddem, and Salif Traore, founder of Magic System Foundation and UNESCO and UNHCR ambassador. This was followed by induction for civil society organizations and accountability sessions on Bank's civil society engagement. The 2022 forum formed part of the bank's engagement with stakeholders leading up to COP27 . \</doc>

For the first time at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change (UNFCCC) - COP27 , an entire day was dedicated to agriculture to focus on how to feed the world's eight billion people in a year of challenging food security. Experts say trying to act on climate at a time when many people can barely afford to eat is both a challenge and an opportunity to avert the future food crisis that climate change will undoubtedly inflame. Nigeria has just suffered from its most devastating floods that claimed 600 lives and displaced over 1,600 persons, according to the Humanitarian Ministry. The unprecedented floods have battered the country's major agricultural belts and now threatening its food security. The situation, coupled with the Russian-Ukraine war has led to a sharp rise in food prices to levels not seen in decades. Food inflation hits a 17-year high at 23.34 percent in September. The Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) in a March 2022 report says that 19.4 million Nigerians are food insecure, and the number is expected to double as flooding issues have worsened the hunger crisis in the country. For the country to prevent this kind of catastrophe from happening in the future, experts say it has to reform its food systems to become sustainable and resilient to withstand any future climate shocks. 'We need to transform our food systems to become sustainable and resilient to withstand climate shocks,' Batty Fong, program director, climate and health and well-being, Global Alliance for the Future of Food says at a side event organized by Foodtank at the COP27 climate talks. Despite the role of the food systems in keeping global warming under check at 1.5 degrees, it still hasn't gotten the attention it requires. Fong states that the research recently conducted by her organisation found that the food systems account for only three percent of climate financing, adding that over 74 percent of countries still do not have a detail of food system reforms in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The food and agriculture systems are part of the climate problem. The way we produce, transport, and grow our food is fueling climate change, experts say. The food system is the main driver of biodiversity loss and it leads to land degradation and depletion of water resources. It accounts for a third of total greenhouse gas emissions. It is important in the climate equation as it is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, an emitter of greenhouse gas emissions, and has climate solutions. 'We need to undertake a thorough overhaul of our food systems, which is another way of saying our relationship with the natural world. There is only one way to achieve this. It can be summarized in one single word: implementation,' says Simon Stiell, executive secretary at UNFCCC. Maria Helena Semedo, deputy director general of the Food and Agricultural Organisation while speaking during the launch of the Food and Agriculture for Sustainable Transformation initiative during COP27 climate talks says countries need bold transformative actions to boost Agrifood system transformation, and support to ensure that resources reach food producers across the value chain. Sameh Shoukry, COP27 president while commenting during the agriculture day says the impact of climate change is disproportionately impacting vulnerable communities around the world. 'To address this imbalance, we need to develop sustainable farming and food systems and meet the urgent needs of food-importing developing countries.' \</doc>

The 28th session of the Executive Committee and the 26th session of the Pan-African Council of United Cities and Local Governments of Africa (UCLG Africa) ( HYPERLINK http://www.UCLGA.org http://www.UCLGA.org Both meetings were chaired by Ms. Fatimetou Abdel Malick, President of the Region of Nouakchott (Mauritania) and President of UCLG Africa. The opening of the Executive Committee was marked by the speeches of Mr. Mounir Lymouri, President of the Municipal Council of Tangiers and President of the Moroccan Association of Presidents of Municipal Councils (AMPCC) and Mrs. Fatimetou Abdel Malick, President of the Region of Nouakchott (Mauritania) and President of UCLG Africa. "Our meeting today in Tangiers has more than one connotation and meaning, for a city that has symbolic significance in terms of history and geography, being the gateway to Africa from Europe and the exit door from Africa to Europe. If this city is destined to be a place of civilizational cross-fertilization, it must also be the voice of the peoples of Africa, in particular the voice of its local elected officials, convinced of the need to meet the challenges of development", said the president of the AMPCC, Mr. Mounir Lymouri. The President of UCLG Africa thanked His Majesty King Mohammed VI for the constant support He has provided to the umbrella organization of African local and regional governments. "I would like to express the gratitude of UCLG Africa to His Majesty King Mohammed VI, for the constant support our organization has received since the installation of its headquarters in Rabat, in January 2008. I would also like to thank the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco for the multifaceted support provided to our organization. We are preparing to participate in the COP27 , to be held in Sharm el-Sheikh on African soil in Egypt. We must together during this Adaptation COP plead for the materialization of the commitments of the Paris Agreement. Adaptation is above all a territorial issue. We invite you to participate massively in COP27 . We would like to thank the partners who support us in our efforts and especially the European Union with whom we signed a new Framework Partnership Agreement on September 12, 2022 in Brussels", said Ms. Fatimetou Abdel Malick. Proceedings The report of the activities carried out by the General Secretariat of UCLG Africa since the holding of the 26th session of the Executive Committee in August 2022, and since the meeting of the General Assembly in May 2022 in Kisumu, Kenya, was approved. The Executive Committee also adopted the 2023-2024 work plan and the 2023 budget of UCLG Africa. The Executive Committee as well as the Pan-African Council members received detailed clarifications on the activities implemented by the General Secretariat of UCLG Africa, particularly with regard to Africa's participation in the UCLG World Congress which took place from 10 to October 14, 2022 in Daejeon (South Korea), and the preparation of the participation of UCLG Africa members in the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) scheduled from November 06 to November 18, 2022 in Sharm el-Sheikh (Egypt). The members of the two governing bodies of UCLG Africa were informed of the progress made to strengthen the role of local authorities in Africa in climate action. During its meeting held in Dakar, Senegal, from 12 to 16 September 2022, the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) granted UCLG Africa the status of implementing agency of AMCEN. During this same meeting, the Secretary General had a bilateral meeting with the U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, His Excellency Mr. John Kerry, who confirmed the interest of the United States to support the Africa Adaptation Initiative (AAI) and the hosting of the technical support unit of the AAI within the UCLG Africa Regional office for North Africa (UCLG Africa NARO). UCLG Africa is also an implementation partner of the Green Climate Fund and will conduct a pilot experiment in the territorialization of Morocco's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in the Souss-Massa Region. UCLG Africa has a pavilion in the Blue Zone at COP 27 . This pavilion will be the rallying point for African local authorities present at COP27 . All the delegates of local and regional governments of Africa are encouraged to use this space for their bilateral meetings or for their potential meetings. African delegates are also encouraged to participate in the sessions organized by UCLG Africa, in particular in its pavilion in the Blue Zone of COP27 . The leadership of UCLG Africa was also informed of the progress made in the operationalization of the Africa Territorial Agency (ATA) which becomes the Africa Territorial Agency for Trade and Investment in Africa (ATIA, Africa Territorial Trade and Investment Agency), a financial vehicle intended to facilitate the access of local authorities in Africa to the financial market and their contribution to the development of intra-African trade and the creation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). A draft Memorandum of Understanding is being negotiated concerning this subject with Afreximbank. In addition, the African Development Bank (AfDB) has agreed to finance a training program for local authorities' access to the capital market for chief financial officers in cities and territories of Africa. A first training cycle was held in September 2022 in Abidjan, C\'f4te d'Ivoire. A second cycle is planned for Johannesburg in early 2023. UCLG Africa aims to significantly improve the capacities and professionalism of elected officials and staff of local authorities in Africa. This is why the umbrella organization has developed an e-learning platform within the African Local Government Academy (ALGA). The courses are digitalized and each national association has the possibility of customizing the tools according to its own needs. Other achievements include the launch of the Forum of African Regions (FORAF) in September 2022 in Saidia (Morocco) and that of the network of Young Local Elected Officials from Africa (YELO). Eight projects were presented to the members of the Executive Committee and of the Pan-African Council: The city of Berkane's Smart City experience; the "Building Climate Resilience for the Urban Poor Globally and Regionally" (BCRUP) initiative; the operationalization of the partnership between UCLG Africa and PACJA (Panafrican Climate Justice Alliance); Innovation in policy dialogue: the experience of Mauritania ; the African Territorial Agency for Trade and Investment (ATIA); the support tools of the African import-export bank (Afreximbank); the African Network of Urban Agencies; and the Trombino Platform of UCLG Africa. Signing of an MoU During the opening ceremony of the Executive Committee, the Moroccan Association of Presidents of Communal Councils (AMPCC) and the Union of Cities and Communes of C\'f4te d'Ivoire (UVICOCI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding, which was signed respectively by Mr. Mounir Lymouri , President of the AMPCC, and Mr. Claude Paulin Danho, President of UVICOCI. Tribute paid to honorary members of UCLG Africa On the sidelines of the two statutory meetings of UCLG Africa, the meeting of members of the Presidency of the Network of Locally Elected Women of Africa (REFELA) and that of the Forum of African Regions (FORAF) were held in parallel.

By Cecilia Ologunagba UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has described the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) report which details the catastrophic speed of climate change and its devastation on lives and livelihoods on every continent as a "chronicle of climate chaos." The WMO, in its provisional 2022 State of the Global Climate released on Sunday, stated that extreme heatwaves, drought and devastating flooding had also affected millions and cost billions in this year. The UN has said that the last eight years have been the warmest on record, fuelled by ever-rising greenhouse gas concentrations and accumulated heat. Faced with the inevitability of continued climate shocks and extreme weather across the world, Guterres is to launch an action plan at COP27 to achieve Early Warnings for All in the next five years. The UN chief explained that early warning systems are necessary, to protect people and communities everywhere. "We must answer the planet's distress signal with action, ambitious, credible climate action," he argued. COP27 must be the place and now must be the time," he said in a statement. The report outlines the increasingly dramatic signs of the climate emergency, which include a doubling of the rate of sea level rise since 1993, to a new record high this year; and indications of unprecedented glacier melting on the European Alps. The full 2022 report is due to be released in the Spring of 2023, but the provisional study was brought out ahead of COP27 , the UN climate conference, raising awareness of the huge scale of the problems that world leaders must tackle, if they are to have any hope of getting the climate crisis under control. Related News "The greater the warming, the worse the impacts," WMO chief Petter Taalas, said at the launch of the report at an event held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. "We have such high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now that the lower 1.5 degree of the Paris Agreement is barely within reach. "It's already too late for many glaciers and the melting will continue for hundreds if not thousands of years, with major implications for water security". The study details the effects of both droughts and excessive rains. Kenya, Somalia, and Ethiopia are facing crop failure and food insecurity, because of another season of below-average rains, whilst more than a third of Pakistan was flooded in July and August, as a result of record-breaking rain, displacing almost eight million people. The southern Africa region was battered by a series of cyclones over two months at the start of the year, hitting Madagascar hardest with torrential rain and devastating floods, and in September, Hurricane Ian caused extensive damage and loss of life in Cuba and southwest Florida. Also, the World Health Organisation (WHO) issued a reminder that the climate crisis continued to make people sick, and called for health to be at the core of the COP27 climate negotiations. The UN health agency announced a programme of high-level events, scheduled throughout the conference, focusing on the health threat posed by the crisis, and the huge health gains that would come from stronger climate action at the centre of discussions. The WHO warned that, between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths per year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea, and heat stress; the direct costs to health are estimated to rise by as much as $4 billion dollars per year by the end of this decade. However, the agency points out that investment in clean energy will yield health gains that repay those investments twice over: applying higher standards for vehicle emissions, for example, has been calculated to save approximately 2. 4 million lives per year.

By Chijioke Okoronkwo Nigerian Government is pioneering a voluntary billion dollars' worth Carbon Market on the continent. Laolu Akande, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Office of the Vice President, disclosed this a statement on Sunday in Abuja. He said "It is an innovative climate change solution which will create, over the period of energy transition, millions of new jobs in Nigeria alone, according to estimates of the international experts. The initiative is part of efforts of the Federal Government to attain the global net-zero emissions target. The vice president is a member of the recently-formed international Steering Committee for the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI), with the objective of facilitating the emergence and growth of the market in Africa. Besides Osinbajo, other members of the Committee of the ACMI, which would be announced early in November at the COP27 meeting in Egypt, are former President of Colombia, Ivan Duque Marquez, and President of the African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina. Officials of the United Nations, USAID, Gates Foundation and other international private sector players are also members. ACMI's estimates suggest that Nigeria alone could produce up to 30 million carbon credits per year by 2030, which at US$ 20 dollars/credit would be worth over half a billion dollars annually. "At this level of production, the industry could potentially support over 3 million Nigerian jobs. "And Nigeria has only a portion of Africa's total potential the impact for the continent as a whole could be far greater," ACMI's estimates indicate. The jobs would span the period of the energy transition, starting from the time the market is able to kick off till 2060. The committee will be inaugurated at the forthcoming International Climate Change Conference in Egypt, tagged COP 27 , with the aim to lead advocacy for the realisation of the Carbon Credits initiative as an effective way of reducing emissions while financing green growth across Africa. Related News The Carbon Credit initiative prioritises the use of environmentally-friendly energy sources for domestic and industrial purposes. For instance, carbon credits could support the conditional portion of Nigeria and other Africa nation's nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. Nigeria's carbon credit potential is concentrated in household devices and forestry sectors, both of which will attract significant benefits. Household devices like solar lanterns and clean cook stoves contribute to expanding energy access and improving health outcomes, while carbon forestry credits enable the conservation of Nigeria's rich biodiversity and support sustainable livelihoods. As part of this vision, Nigeria aims to pioneer innovative climate solutions that will benefit Africa and the world. One of these solutions is the production and sale of carbon credits, which have enormous potential for Africa that is only beginning to be explored. The Federal Government is committed to supporting the development of the domestic carbon credit industry and is exploring strategies for how carbon credits can best catalyse investment and economic growth. President Muhammadu Buhari and Osinbajo's ongoing climate leadership has won applause for Nigeria with FG's policies in place to support the development of the industry. Building on Nigeria's history of climate action, the President signed the Climate Change Act of 2021 providing a framework for national coordination on climate change issues. Some of the efforts for which the Buhari administration is globally acknowledged include the creation of the National Council on Climate Change, which the President inaugurated last month, with the authority needed to drive major emissions reductions. Recently, Osinbajo launched the Federal Government's Energy Transition Plan in August 2022, a detailed strategy outlining how Nigeria will reach global net zero emissions by 2060 while eliminating energy poverty. To further support the domestic production of carbon credits, the Federal Government is developing a carbon credit activation plan. This plan will clearly identify responsibility within the government for the regulation and promotion of carbon credits, and will outline a set of actions government can take to support the industry.

Download logo Overwhelming flooding has affected at least 27.7 million children across 27 countries worldwide, with the number of children affected by flooding in Chad, Gambia, Pakistan and northeast Bangladesh, being the highest in over 30 years. The UN Children's Fund, UNICEF, said in its alert on Tuesday as the COP27 Climate Conference continues, that a large majority of the children affected are among the most vulnerable and that rolling disasters are straining the ability of governments and the international community to respond, given the enormous scale of need. With millions of children at severe risk of starvation, disease, exploitation and death, the agency is calling for delegates at COP27 to commit to funding to protect children from the devastating effects of a changing climate. Deadly floodwater UNICEF says that this year, floods have contributed to the increased spread of major killers of children, such as malnutrition, malaria, cholera and diarrhoea, and that the aftermath of floods is often more deadly for children than the extreme weather events that caused the flooding. In Pakistan, more than one in nine children under five, who were admitted to health facilities in flood-affected areas of Sindh and Balochistan, were found to be suffering from severe acute malnutrition. In South Sudan, 95 UNICEF-supported nutrition sites have been affected by floods, hampering the delivery of life-saving and preventative malnutrition services for 92,000 children. An estimated 840,000 children were displaced by floods in Nigeria in recent months. Heavy rains and flooding in Yemen triggered floods causing extensive damage to shelters in displacement sites. Up to 73,854 households were affected and 24,000 households have been displaced. &lsquo;Drowning in inaction' &ldquo; COP27 provides an opportunity to chart a credible roadmap with clear milestones for finance for climate adaptation and solutions for loss and damage,&rdquo; said Paloma Escudero, UNICEF's Director of Global Communications and Advocacy. She added that youngsters &ldquo;from the most affected places on Earth are drowning in climate inaction. Enough is enough. Lives are on the line - children need action now.&rdquo; Adaption is key As well as pressing governments and big business to rapidly reduce emissions, UNICEF is urging leaders to take immediate action to safeguard children from climate devastation by adapting the critical social services they rely upon. Adaptation measures, like creating water, health and education systems that stand up to flooding and drought, will save lives. Paloma Escudero said that &ldquo;without urgent action, many more vulnerable children and young people will lose their lives in the days and weeks to come. And without climate action, hundreds of millions more will almost certainly suffer like those in Pakistan.&rdquo; Distributed by APO Group on behalf of UN News. Load-Date: \~November 9, 2022 \</doc>

The grant, subject to the completion of US domestic procedures and approvals, will go to the multi-donor Africa Climate Change Fund, which is managed by the African Development Bank DAKAR, Senegal, September 15, 2022/ - Climate envoy Kerry announces funding at Dakar meeting of African ministers; Financing will drive fulfilment of Global Methane Pledge targets The United States government has announced it will provide a $5 million grant to the African Development Bank to support efforts to abate methane gas emission, across Africa. Methane accounts for about half of the net rise in global average temperature since the pre-industrial era. The grant, subject to the completion of US domestic procedures and approvals, will go to the multi-donor Africa Climate Change Fund ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3DtKhno ), which is managed by the African Development Bank. The Fund supports a broad range of activities covering climate resilience and low-carbon growth. US special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry, made the announcement at a breakfast event held on the margins of the 18th African Ministerial Conference on the Environment taking place in Dakar. He said: 'More than 25 countries on the continent have joined the Global Methane Pledge, a resounding level of support for the importance of methane in keeping 1.5 degrees within reach.' 'I am very pleased that the African Development Bank is responding to the increased global attention on methane emissions and is planning to increase their own focus on methane abatement in coming years,' Kerry added. The Global Methane pledge, launched during COP26, targets reducing emissions of methane by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels over the next seven years. Welcoming the contributions, African Development Bank Vice President for Power, Energy, Climate and Green Growth, Kevin Kariuki said ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3R1C7G1 https://bit.ly/3R1C7G1 'With the support of the U.S. government, and other donors and non-state actors, we intend to create a dedicated pillar of activities within our Africa Climate Change Fund to support methane abatement including working with countries to include methane in their Nationally Defined Contributions and develop pipelines of methane abatement projects for further investment,' Kariuki said. The African Development Bank would be releasing a methane baseline reporting covering waste and energy sector methane emissions across Africa at the forthcoming COP 27 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. 'This will provide an excellent foundation for increased focus on methane emissions,' said Kariuki. The African Development Bank's 2022 Africa Economic Outlook projects that Africa will need as much as $1.6 trillion between 2020-2030 to implement its climate action commitments and NDCs. The African Development Bank has committed to mobilizing $25 billion for climate finance by 2025; more than 50% of that funding will be allocated to adaptation projects.

Download logo With the next COP27 set to be hosted in Africa and under a different scenario to previous editions &ndash; oil, gas and nuclear has returned to the scene as crucial for global energy security and for ensuring stable economic growth &ndash; a ministerial panel discussion during African Energy Week (AEW) ( HYPERLINK http://www.AECWeek.com www.AECWeek.com ) 2022 emphasized the need for a unified message regarding the energy transition, one that will be taken from AEW in Cape Town to COP27 in Egypt. Moderated by Mohamed Fouad, Founder and CEO, Egypt Oil & Gas, high-level speakers included H.E. Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima, Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbon, Equatorial Guinea; H.E. Sophie Gladima, Minister of Petroleum and Energies, Senegal; H.E Mahamane Sani Mahamadou, Minister, Ministry of Petroleum of Niger; NJ Ayuk, Executive Chairman, African Energy Chamber; and Hon. Matthew Opoku Prempeh, Minister, Ministry of Resources of Energy, Ghana. Kicking off the session, H.E Tarek El-Molla, Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, Egypt delivered a keynote presentation, stating that, &ldquo;This year, COP27 represents an opportunity to articulate Africa's priorities to reducing emissions, accessing appropriate funding and addressing climate repercussions. We cannot deny that oil and gas represent an essential resource globally and will remain part of the energy mix for the long term. Our goal is to provide these resources more responsibly. I am optimistic about the Egyptian and African efforts to collaborate on a just energy transition in Africa.&rdquo; Thereafter, the panel discussion kicked off to an electric start, with speakers emphasizing the need to face COP27 with common positions on how the energy transition should look like for the continent in the near future in order to improve intra-continental cooperation and investment with the goal of eliminating energy poverty. During the discussion, insight was given as to whether an African just energy transition can be compatible with a global energy transition and whether or not the continent will be able to speak with one voice at COP27 . Expanding on what H.E. Minister Lima shared, H.E. Minister Gladima stated that, &ldquo;I think that during this week we have discussed at length the future of Africa. The main issue that we all agree on is funding. Funding has been cut, and even though we have a gas-to-power strategy, the funding continues to be cut. This planet has given us natural resources and we have to exploit them. But we need to exploit them in a responsible manner and ensure that we do not make the same mistakes others have done in the past. Let us use our oil and gas and have the chance to grow. Ministers of energy must go and convince the ministers of environment. We need to decide together and find a way that is for the good of Africa.&rdquo; Meanwhile, panelists discussed what priorities need to be established for the continent and what a victory in Egypt would look like for Africa. &ldquo;I do not want to talk in terms of victory, but in terms of responsibility and rights. I will be an irresponsible leader to sell my country on the altar of energy transition without talking about the significance of energy security or energy access or without talking about energy affordability. The ministers of energy have been meeting, building and developing a consensus. We should not allow ourselves to be divided between environment and development,&rdquo; stated H.E. Minister Prempeh, adding that, &ldquo;We are going to COP to tell everyone our responsibility as leaders. First, to the people who elected us and who we have accepted to govern. If we talk about the energy transition, we will talk about using what God has given us to use. We will continue to exploit our reserves for the socioeconomic development of the country.&rdquo; Thereafter, the conversation shifted to the role and position of international oil companies (IOC), with H.E. Minister Mahamadou stating &ldquo;When it comes to IOCs, the same way that African countries and ministers have to stay united and speak with one voice, IOCs have to join that single narrative that we share. When it comes to Niger, we have three IOCs active, so we are working closely with them to ensure the full potential of the oil and gas is exploited,&rdquo; adding that, &ldquo;When it comes to the environment, in Niger, 80% of the population lives in rural areas. They rely on biomass and have to do damage to the environment. The way we proceed is we provide them with access to clean cooking and prevent the damage being done to the environment.&rdquo; Finally, the need for a consolidated message was further emphasized, with Ayuk stating that, &ldquo;Drill baby drill: that should be Africa's message to the world. If you want to solve energy poverty, gas baby gas. Europe wants to call gas green: it has always been green. If it is green gas for Europe, why is it not green gas for Africa? We can do better if we tone down the rhetoric that energy producers are evil people or bad people. We need to go to COP27 , backing up our energy producers. We should not be apologizing for our energy sector. That is the message we should take.&rdquo; Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Week (AEW). \</doc>

Nigeria, Nov. 13 -- Sharm El-Sheikh - Small and medium-sized enterprises are essential engines for growth and play a key role in creating jobs and supporting sustainable livelihoods. Yet, the financing gap for SMEs, particularly in emerging markets, is widening. Climate change has become an increasing concern, especially for small businesses. As the effects of climate change intensify, people around the world are feeling the pressure of financial constraints, greater risk and an increase living costs. These challenges are even more complex in developing countries. Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) are the backbone of Africa's job creation, economic growth, and development. According to the International Finance Cooperation, MSMEs account for up to 90% of all businesses in African markets and remain one of the main sources of employment. They're important drivers of employment and entrepreneurship for women, youth and vulnerable groups. To highlight the contributions of these enterprises, the United Nations General Assembly designated June 27 as the Micro-, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises Day, recognising the important role these enterprises play in sustainable development. However, the majority of businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa are micro-enterprises and they need access to capital for them to thrive and grow. The Small and Medium-sized enterprise Competitiveness Report provided clear recommendations for stakeholders to support MSMEs in the face of climate change but what does it mean, in practice? Pamela-Coke-Hamilton, Executive Director of the International Trade Centre explained that in 2021 at the COP26, she walked the entire spectrum of Glasgow, the Convention Center, and there was not one space that represented small businesses. "This is serious, how can we not have small business space as they represent, 90% of all businesses and 50% of job creation. Big firms are responsible for 80% of emissions simply because they are part of the value chain and supply chain. So what is our biggest challenge? Our biggest challenge is that we're in an existential threat." "So where do we go from here, I would say we need to look at the wider ecosystem. So we look at the market charges, technology, access to finance, legal changes, and requirements of what small businesses really need. A competitiveness assessment tool that has been launched is a very important tool because it looks at what are the necessary mechanisms that need to be put in place for companies to meet their actual current agricultural impact. Pakistan, for example, we're doing a U.S.$60 million programme with FAO that has actually trained over 40,000 farmers. We've also been looking at Ghana, where we've actually helped small farmers increase their yield and revenue by 22% overall", Coke-Hamilton said. The World Bank estimates that there are 500 million smallholder farming households globally, comprising upward of 2 billion people. Though these farms are small, typically under two hectares, their cumulative impact is large. Smallholder farmers produce at least a third of the global food supply. And though these small farms contribute little in the way of greenhouse gas emissions, they bear the brunt of climate impacts. Oxfam reports that this year the combination of the pandemic, inflation and the already stretched economic capacity in many countries is pushing 260 million people into extreme poverty, with the total number now rising to 860 million, undermining the ability to guarantee a healthy future for generations to come. Taking action on climate change offers new opportunities for economic development, growth and job creation. Reducing emissions, can save businesses money, attract new customers, and keep their competitive edge around the globe. According to the Harvard Business Network, "decarbonizing and cutting emissions at the SME level has benefits. It creates a more resilient supply chain overall, especially as the impacts of climate change become more uncertain and severe. The Covid-19 pandemic, for example, led to significant challenges across 57% of the supply chain, showing that "when small business suppliers struggle, larger operations falter too." In the Sahel, droughts are becoming more and more intense. The temperatures are rising 1.5 times faster than in the rest of the world and could reach up to five degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Yet, the Gambia is only responsible for just 0.05% of the world's emissions. As temperature rises, extreme weather events such as heat waves and droughts are increasing in frequency and intensity, threatening biodiversity. Kemo Fatty, the founder and executive director of Green-Up Gambia, an organization that addresses urgent environmental crises and raises eco-consciousness in communities, especially amongst young people in rural villages, spoke of how his organisation works with entrepreneurs in various ways to deliver sustainable farming practices. He says that most of the food needed to feed 9 billion people is going to be grown by these local subsistence farmers. "But the earth's temperatures are rising 1.5 times faster and where I live there's been a significant reduction in the rainfall patterns. So obviously, drought has been a major player. So we've seen that in terms of adjustments to resistance, farmers are really learning agroforestry models and these are really working, but not to their full capacity. Because most of the produce, 90% of the produce goes abroad, and people come and buy, there's no value added to this. Small and medium-scale enterprises are actually focusing on adding value to this approach means that time is our premium." "We are lacking the tools that are necessary for us to leapfrog into this transition to bring up small business involvement and see how we can help enterprises to actually decarbonise our supply chains. So if we look at the carbon footprint, we need to help these small businesses become sustainable in the long run." According to the United Nations, eradicating poverty is the greatest global challenge and an absolute requirement for sustainable development. But to achieve this, more businesses need to join with the government and civil society to actively confront inequality, poverty, and climate change together.

Download logo As COP27 gets underway in Egypt, UNICEF warns this year has brought overwhelming flooding to at least 27.7 million children in 27 countries worldwide. A large majority of the 27.7 million children affected by flooding in 2022 are among the most vulnerable and are at high risk of a multitude of threats including death by drowning, disease outbreaks, lack of safe drinking water, malnutrition, disruption in learning, and violence. "We are seeing unprecedented levels of flooding all around the world this year, and with it, an explosion in threats to children," said Paloma Escudero, head of the UNICEF delegation for COP27 . "The climate crisis is here. In many places, the flooding is the worst it has been in a generation, or several. Our children are already suffering at a scale their parents never did." The aftermath of floods is often more deadly for children than the extreme weather events that caused the flooding. In 2022, floods have contributed to the increased spread of major killers of children, such as malnutrition, malaria, cholera and diarrhea: In Pakistan, more than 1 in 9 children under five admitted to health facilities in flood-affected areas of Sindh and Balochistan were found to be suffering from severe acute malnutrition. In Chad, 465,030 hectares of farmland were destroyed, worsening the already dire food insecurity situation. In Malawi, torrential rains and flooding by tropical storm Ana in January 2022 caused extensive damage to water and sanitation systems, which created the perfect conditions for a cholera outbreak. The outbreak has claimed the lives of 203 people, out of which 28 are children. To date, 1,631 children have been infected with cholera. Together with other climate shocks and conflict, floods have caused the projected number of children in South Sudan facing high levels of food insecurity to surpass the rates seen during the conflict in 2013 and 2016. Additionally, the United Nations recently warned that some communities are likely to face starvation if humanitarian assistance is not sustained and climate adaptation measures are not scaled-up. In addition to threatening the lives of millions of children, the flood waters have disrupted essential services and displaced countless families: The recent floods in Pakistan damaged or destroyed nearly 27,000 school buildings, forcing 2 million children to miss school. In South Sudan, 95 UNICEF supported nutrition sites have been affected by floods, hampering the delivery of life-saving and preventative malnutrition services for 92,000 children. An estimated 840,000 children were displaced by floods in Nigeria in recent months. 126 schools in Cameroon were affected by floods, depriving 38,813 children from access to education. Heavy rains and flooding in Yemen triggered floods causing extensive damage to shelters in displacement sites. Up to 73,854 households were affected, and 24,000 households were displaced. " COP27 As well as pressing governments and big business to rapidly reduce emissions, UNICEF urges leaders to take immediate action to protect children from climate devastation by adapting the critical social services they rely on. Adaptation measures, like creating water, health and education systems that stand up to flooding and drought, will save lives. Last year, developed countries agreed to double support for adaptation to $40 billion a year by 2025. At COP27 , they must present a credible roadmap with clear milestones on how this will be delivered, as a step to delivering at least $300bn per year for adaptation by 2030. At least half of all climate finance should flow towards adaptation. UNICEF also urges parties to find solutions to support those who will face climate losses and damages beyond the limits of what communities can adapt to. UNICEF is calling on governments to close the finance gap for addressing these irreversible changes for children. AT COP27 PREVENT. Revisit their national climate plans to cut emissions drastically and urgently to prevent a climate catastrophe. PROTECT. Secure clear action on adaptation that protects every child from the accelerating impacts of climate change through the Global Stocktake and Global Goal on Adaptation PREPARE. Advance climate change education and meaningful participation to prepare children and youth through the Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) Action Plan PRIORITIZE. children and youth by accelerating climate finance investment in climate-resilient social services that reach the most at-risk children, and unlock progress on loss and damage Commit to child-sensitive climate action by aligning with and operationalizing the Declaration on Children, Youth and Climate Action UNICEF's immediate humanitarian response to flood affected countries is wide-ranging across all sectors: health, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), child protection, and education. A lack of funding, however, has hampered the response in many countries. For instance, the funding gap for the humanitarian response in Pakistan currently stands at 85 per cent. UNICEF is working to strengthen resilience of communities and health infrastructure to withstand disaster-related hazards, and increasingly linking our work on humanitarian response and longer-term climate adaptation.

By Angela Atabo The Connected Development (CODE) says it plans to sponsor five Nigerian youths to participate at the 2022 UN Climate Change Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) from Nov. 7 to Nov. 18 in Egypt. The Chief Executive Officer, CODE,Mr Hamzat Lawal, said this at a news conference on Wednesday in Abuja. Lawal said that the sponsorship was through CODE's Ewah Eleri Climate Justice Fellowship. He said that the fellowship was in honour of climate change activist, Ewah Eleri, aimed at providing opportunities for young Nigerians to join world leaders in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt for the 2022 UN Climate Change Conference of Parties ( COP27 ). They included Mr Etta Bisong, Abuja Bureau Chief, EnviroNews, Mrs Gift Samuel, Editor, The SightNews and Mr Samuel Nwokike, a Mass Communication graduate of University of Nigeria(UNN) Nsukka. Others were Mr Gregory Odogwu, an Environmental Columnist at Punch Newspaper and Ms Hyeladzira Mshelia, a Climate Change Activist and Programmes Associate with CODE. Lawal said that COP was the supreme decision-making forum of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). "This year, the UN Climate Negotiations ( COP27 ) will be held in the city of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt from Nov. 7 to Nov 18. "This conference could be a chance to turn the Glasgow outcome into action, through implementing climate change adaptation, mitigation, and financial strategies," he said. Lawal said that many young people in Nigeria were being lost because they were not given opportunities. According to Lawal, Ewah Eleri has continued to show transitional leadership and build the next generation of climate justice leaders. "Eleri embodies values that talk about service for community and environment and this is one of his legacy that I build upon. He is an example of a godfather. "I believe that Eleri is a model of mentorship where people should come and learn and we are working to ensure we are able to start a mentorship in his honour but I felt we should first start this Fellowship in his honour," he said. Lawal said that CODE was committed to sending at least five people every year to all the COP meetings to support the government, civil society, private sector and the international community on the issues of climate change. Speaking, Eleri, also the Executive Director, International Centre for Energy, Environment and Development (ICEED), commended CODE for instituting the fellowship in his honour. Eleri said that climate change was imposing a lot of challenges, not only on the environment but on livelihoods, economy and the chances for young people to have a sustainable future and hope in the country. He added that the unprecedented climate crisis has seen 30 of the country's 36 states submerged due to the 2022 flooding. "As the world gathers in Egypt for COP27 , there is the need to seize this opportunity to turn the challenges of climate change to new opportunities by making it the climate of opportunities for our own people. "To identify ways to leverage on the energy transition from dirty fuel to renewable energy; and to build new resilience not only in our cities and rural areas but also in our people through education, sound healthcare, and training for young people. "We need to expand our view about how we address climate change, when we build resilience in the Nigerian people, then even the awareness of the environment also changes. "If we do it that way, we will reclaim the future so that climate change becomes climate change, not only for our livelihoods and the environment, but climate change for new opportunities for our people; We must act for climate. I am very proud of the legacy Hamzat Lawal is building," he said. (NAN)(nannews.ng) Edited by Ali Baba-Inuwa About The Author See author's posts 2022 News Agency of Nigeria \</doc>

European countries are making plans to ramp up gas importation from Nigeria to the tune of 22 million tons per year, providing an opportunity for Africa's most populous nation to earn revenues. A document obtained by The PUNCH from the Global Gas Monitor entitled, 'Europe Scrambles for African Gas', published by DW on Friday, said Africa was the next gas hub for European countries. The document put Nigeria as the country attracting the biggest European interest after Algeria (29 million tons). Apart from Nigeria and Algeria, the report identified eight other African countries to also benefit from the plan to include: Mauritania, 10 million tons; Mozambique, 19 million tons; Democratic Republic of Congo, 1.2million tons; and Tanzania, 4 million tons. Others are: Cameroon, 6 million tons; Equatorial Guinea, 5.2million tons; Angola, 12.2 million tons, and Egypt, 29 million tons. The EU declared fossil gas a transition fuel this year, describing it as 'sustainable'. Oil is a source of revenue for many African countries, accounting for 50 to 80 per cent of total government revenue in some countries. Oil and gas exports account for 80 per cent of Nigeria's yearly revenue, but most of the minerals are refined abroad due to the absence of functional refineries. The PUNCH learnt that rich countries, especially Europe, negotiated new gas supplies with Nigeria at the just concluded COP27 meeting held last week in Egypt. The fresh deal comes at a time when the country has declared gas as its transitional fuel. Director of Power Shift Africa, a think tank based in Nairobi, Mohamed Adow, told journalists at the COP27 conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, that Europe was trying to make Africa its 'gas station' but was not providing enough money for renewable energy. \</doc>

Download logo UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Kenyan President H.E. William Ruto met at the COP27 climate summit today [Monday 7 November]. The leaders agreed to fast-track six green investment projects worth KES 500 billion spanning green energy, agriculture and transport. Sunak praised Kenya's pioneering climate leadership and urged President Ruto to continue championing clean growth. The UK and Kenya have agreed to fast-track six projects worth KES 500 billion to accelerate the flow of climate finance into Kenya after the UK Prime Minister and President Ruto met at the COP27 climate summit in Sharm-el-Sheik, Egypt. These new, clean and green investments will become flagship projects of the UK-Kenya Strategic Partnership - an ambitious five-year agreement that is unlocking mutual benefits for the UK and Kenya. The projects include: new geothermal and solar energy generation at Menegai and Malindi; a KES 425 billion Public Private Partnership to deliver the Grand High Falls Dam, which will generate a gigawatt of renewable power and provide an area over twice the size of the Maasai Mara with drought-combating irrigation solutions; the green regeneration of central Nairobi anchored around a new central rail station; and a Ksh 32 billion investment in a climate-resilient agriculture hub for the Lake Victoria region in Kisumu that will create 2,000 direct jobs and provide an income for a further 20,000 farmers. The UK Government will commit KES 2 billion to a new guarantee company that will lower investment risk and unlock KES 12 bn of climate finance for Kenyan projects over the next 3 years, through collaboration with CPF Financial Services and other private investors. The Prime Minister praised President Ruto's pioneering climate leadership and urged Kenya to continue along the path of green growth, urging all countries to deliver on the commitments made at COP26 in Glasgow. But the UK recognises that there is further work to do. During his recent visit to Kenya, COP President Alok Sharma reaffirmed the need for progress on access to finance and transformational adaptation action by COP27 . British High Commissioner to Kenya Jane Marriott, said: "The UK and Kenya go far when we go together. By fast-tracking finance into these clean, green projects with honest, reliable investment the UK is supporting Kenya to advance and maintain its continent-leading climate credentials - with mutual benefits for both our countries."

(BBC) King Charles will not attend the climate change conference COP27 , which is due to be held in Egypt next month, Buckingham Palace has confirmed. It was responding to a story in the Sunday Times which claimed Prime Minister Liz Truss had "ordered" the King not to attend. The Palace said advice had been sought by the King and given by Ms Truss. "With mutual friendship and respect there was agreement that the King would not attend," the Palace stated. Royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said the BBC had put it to the Palace the King must be personally disappointed given his long decades of passionate environmental campaigning. But the Palace responded that the idea the King was uncomfortable was not the case, and he was ever mindful of the sovereign's role to act on the government's advice. Last November \- as Prince Charles \- the King travelled to Egypt with the then-government's blessing to urge the Egyptian administration on its efforts, meeting President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi during a planned visit. In the past, the King has demonstrated his deep commitment to environmental issues and, as Prince of Wales, had a long history of campaigning to reduce the effects of climate change. Only last year he made a speech at the COP26 opening ceremony in Glasgow, when the summit was hosted by the UK. The late Queen also gave a speech at the event, via video link. Senior Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood said he hoped "common sense would prevail" and the King would be allowed to go Egypt. He said in a tweet that King Charles was a "globally-respected voice" on the environment whose attendance would add "serious authority" to the British delegation. The Egyptian authorities say they hope to use their presidency of COP27 to urge the international community to act on pledges of support for developing countries to cope with the devastating impacts of climate change. However, there has been criticism ahead of the summit. Human Rights Watch has said Egypt has severely curtailed the work of environmental groups. Officials in Cairo said the report was "misleading". COP27 , a United Nations event, is being held in the coastal city of Sharm el-Sheikh from 8 to16 November. Next week, King Charles will attend his first public engagements since the royal period of mourning came to an end, including a reception in Edinburgh for South Asian communities from across the UK and a visit to Dunfermline Abbey in Fife. \</doc>

Nigeria, Nov. 13 -- In the last few years, the world has begun a more definitive transition from the place of cynicism and misunderstanding about the issue of climate change to that of warmer realisation, if not wholesome acceptance, of the reality of the phenomenon as a significant threat. But then, even in the face of a whittling down of opposition against the science of climate change, with the pushback against efforts to mitigate it not as fierce as it once was, agreeing on a framework with universal acceptance, embedded with individual contours, has been rather difficult. That is not a surprise, given the different and, often, competing realities among countries. Indeed, there is no way the issue of climate change can be addressed on a sustainable basis without putting into the mix the conjoined issues of energy inequity, energy poverty, and energy access. "For Africa, the problem of energy poverty is as important as our climate ambitions. Energy use is crucial for almost every conceivable aspect of development. Wealth, health, nutrition, water, infrastructure, education, and life expectancy are significantly related to the consumption of energy per capita," Professor Yemi Osinbajo, Nigeria's vice president argues. In August this year, the Nigerian government launched the Energy Transition Plan to address the issues of climate change and energy poverty. Having accepted that climate change is a reality and threat to crop productivity, with the potential of further worsening unemployment, the government commits itself to an urgent plan of action, which requires putting an end to energy poverty by 2030 and achieving net-zero by 2060. In fact, President Buhari committed to this in a statement at COP-26 in Glasgow. However, on the back of that commitment is the realisation that "the average $3 billion per year investments in renewable energy recorded for the whole of Africa between 2000 and 2020 will certainly not suffice," as this is a plan that requires huge resources and funding that cannot come through the regular window. The energy transition plan will require an estimated $1.9 trillion in finance, which includes $410 billion above business-as-usual spending, to the tune of $10 billion annually till 2060. According to the African Development Bank (AfDB), Africa is not only losing 5-15% capital economic growth, but also facing a shortfall in climate finance, as Africa benefits less than 5.5% of global climate finance. Between 2016 and 2019, African nations only received around $18.3 billion in climate finance. While the industrialised world had promised in 2009 to deliver $100 billion in climate financing to the developing world, that pledge has only been redeemed in part. Yet, another gap of about $1.3 trillion has been identified for 2020-2030. It is against the backdrop of the challenges posed by climate change and the obvious finance gap that confronts Africa that makes the idea by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo for debt-for-climate swap a compelling proposition for consideration. In a lecture on a just and equitable energy transition for Africa he delivered at the Center for Global Development in Washington D.C, USA, he argued that the issue was not only one of just transition but of two existential crises - "climate crisis and extreme poverty." For that reason, whatever plans and commitments made towards carbon neutrality "must include clear plans on energy access," he contends. Further to that, in order to confront poverty, there must be "access to energy for consumptive and productive use," he says. Osinbajo spoke to the disparity of energy access between the developed and developing world in graphic terms. Africa, with about 17% of the world's population, only generates 4% of the world's electricity. Whereas the one billion people in Sub-Saharan Africa, excluding South Africa, are serviced by an installed capacity of 81 gigawatts, "the United States has an installed capacity of 1,200 gigawatts to power a population of 331 million people, while the United Kingdom has 76 gigawatts of installed capacity for its 67 million people. The per capita energy capacity in the United Kingdom is almost fifteen times that in Sub-Saharan Africa." While developing countries are faced with the constraint of energy poverty, striving to increase capacity and improve on energy access to drive industrialisation and development, they are compelled to take into consideration the demands or expectations that come with mitigating climate change. As Osinbajo notes, ".in the wider responses to the climate crisis, we are not seeing careful consideration and acknowledgement of Africa's aspirations. For instance, despite Africa's tremendous energy gap, global policies are increasingly constraining Africa's energy technology choices." In fact, there has been advocacy or implementation of "policies on limiting public funding for fossil fuel projects in developing countries, making no distinction between upstream oil and coal exploration; and gas power plants for grid balancing." Yet, in the face of a global energy crisis, some countries in Europe have made a move to "increase or extend their use of coal-fired power generation through 2023, and potentially beyond," in disregard or violation of their climate commitments, which analysts suggest "will raise power sector emissions of the EU by 4%, a significant amount, given the high base denominator of EU emissions." While there is no doubt that every country, by virtue of policies and activities, has its impact on cumulative global carbon footprints, the level of impact is remarkably different from one country to the other. It is estimated that about 80% of all emissions in the world come from only 20 countries, with Africa contributing only 2-3% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions from energy and industrial sources. Despite the disproportionate nature of carbonisation, with only minimal carbon footprints generated by less-industrialised countries like Nigeria, the government has launched an ambitious energy transition plan that commits her to the decarbonisation of Nigeria's energy sources and future, with objectives that include "lifting 100 million people out of poverty in a decade, driving economic growth, bringing modern energy services to the full population and managing the expected long-term job loss in the oil sector due to global decarbonization." Whereas there is greater interest on the part of the developing world to contribute its quota in the drive for a carbon-free globe, there is also the desire to be more involved in the formulation of strategies and transition pathways in line with the objectives of the countries themselves and Sustainable Development Goal 7, which pushes for universal access to clean and affordable energy. Targets set out in Nigeria's Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) include: 20% conditional and 45% unconditional emissions reductions; establishment of 13 GW of off-grid solar PV; an increase in energy efficiency by 30% by 2030; and an end to gas flaring by 2030. There are also measures and strategies to promote reforestation, climate smart agriculture, to make agriculture a more sustainable and productive venture; and the sustainable use of resources through programmes that promote alternative means of livelihood. The project also has incorporated within climate adaptation policies and biodiversity conservation. However, beyond the intentions and commitment on the part of developing countries, noble as they might be, the question of financing the energy transition away from carbon is a sticky one, especially within the larger context of the economic condition of the countries, made worse by the overwhelming realities of COVID-19. As Singh and Widge note, since "a greater proportion of these governments' (now reduced) revenues are now dedicated to servicing debt, spending towards reviving growth or achieving climate goals will likely take a backseat." They propose fiscal headroom for countries caught in such a situation through the mechanism of either "debt suspension, debt forgiveness or reorientation of debt so that service payments are utilized for a green recovery." Debt for Climate (DFC) swaps, which began to gain currency in the last two years, "are a type of debt swap in which the debtor nation, instead of continuing to make external debt payments in a foreign currency, makes payments in local currency to finance climate projects domestically on agreed upon terms. DFC swaps can reduce the level of indebtedness, as well as free up fiscal resources to be spent on green investments.Alternatively, new debt can be issued by a debtor nation to replace existing debt with a commitment to use proceeds to address climate change through mutually agreed performance-linked incentives such as lower interest rates, grants, carbon offsets to service interest, etc." The essence of the debt-for-climate swap is to engender and "increase the fiscal space for climate-related investments and reduce the debt burden for participating developing countries." Indeed, the idea of debt as a climate change-related financing instrument is not new but the argument as presented by Vice President Osinbajo has enlivened and elevated it. His presentation at CGD and subsequent engagement with Vice President Kamala Harris of the United States of America, as well as other government officials, have pushed up and energised the conversation. He has succeeded in placing side-by-side the twin issues of energy poverty and climate change, arguing not only for them to be considered together, but for African nations to be more critically engaged in conversations on the global climate future and take ownership of their transition pathways. Osinbajo specifically argues for Africa to fully participate in the global carbon finance market, in addition to conventional capital flows both from public and private sources. "Currently, direct carbon pricing systems through carbon taxes have largely been concentrated in high and middle-income countries. However, carbon markets can play a significant role in catalyzing sustainable energy deployment by directing private capital into climate action, and improve global energy security, provide diversified incentive structures, especially in developing countries, and provide an impetus for clean energy markets when the price economics looks less compelling - as is the case today. So, supporting Africa to develop into a global supplier of carbon credits, ranging from biodiversity to energy-based credits, would be a leap forward in aligning carbon pricing and related policy around achieving a 'just transition'." There is no doubt about the increasing coincidence of realisation on the part of both the developed and developing world that climate change is indeed an existential challenge. Also, there is no doubt about the urgency of the situation and the necessary actions that need to be taken. All African countries have signed onto the Paris Agreement, with Nigeria and a few other countries in Africa having also announced a net-zero target, in firm commitment to a decarbonised energy future. The challenge is with financing climate and clean energy plans for developing countries like Nigeria in the face of a climate finance shortfall and the problem of energy poverty. That is what makes the Osinbajo argument of swapping debt for climate financing a compelling proposition, if every country is to be carried along in putting the right foot forward on the decarbonisation drive. However, questions have been raised about the idea. Is the Debt for Climate Swap Deal really a good idea? What are the possible challenges? How can all concerned be brought together to be on the same page with intended outcomes? What about the question of size and structure? Which countries constitute the target? Who are the likely creditors? To Chamon et.al, "because some of the benefits of debt-climate swaps accrue to non-participating creditors, they are generally less efficient forms of support than conditional grants and/or broad debt restructuring (which could be linked to climate adaptation when the latter significantly reduces credit risk)". Vikram Widge believes that a debt swap for climate financing will be more meaningful where there is direct negotiation between borrower and lender. Taking into consideration that China is a major bilateral official creditor, there is not much that can be done with respect to swap arrangements without engaging with China and securing its support. To Widge, ".to be successful at scale and mobilize significant capital, debt-for-climate swaps should probably focus on countries that are able to service their debt, and who - in exchange for some reduction/forgiveness of the debt as an incentive - would be willing to redirect the debt service cash flows into mutually agreed use of proceeds from the swap. In this arrangement, target countries are likely to be the larger emerging market borrowers that are working toward ambitious climate action plans but need extra help here." Chamon et.al argue that "debt-climate swaps could be superior to conditional grants when they can be structured in a way that makes the climate commitment de facto senior to debt service; and they could be superior to comprehensive debt restructuring in narrow settings, when the latter is expected to produce large economic dislocations and the debt-climate swap is expected to materially reduce debt risks (and achieve debt sustainability). Furthermore, debt-climate swaps could be useful to expand fiscal space for climate investment when grants or more comprehensive debt relief are just not on the table." It is instructive that more voices are being heard in support of the debt-for-climate swaps. The U.N. Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed, ahead of the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Egypt made the point that "countries need options to refinance crippling existing debt, including debt for climate adaptation swaps, where vulnerable countries can reduce their debt stock and free up resources for adaptation." The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), one of five regional commissions under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, piloting with Jordan and other countries, has come up with an initiative tying climate with SDGs and debt swap. The essence of the initiative is to "address the challenge of reducing debt burden, improving climate finance and accelerating implementation of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda." Also, there has emerged a group known as V20, made up of 58 countries (Nigeria excluded) deemed to be the most vulnerable to climate change, with only a 5% share of global emissions, a population of 1.5 billion people and GDP valued at $2.4 trillion. Ahead of COP27 , they were considering "a plan to stop payment on a combined $685 billion in debt until the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank address climate change the way their nations see fit." There is no doubt that the idea of a debt-for-climate swap is no longer one that can be easily waved away. Indeed, there is no denying the grave impact of climate change, which sees 15 million people dying annually on account of the poor quality of air from pollution and another five million dying as a result of extreme heat. There is the question of future demand for energy compounding the current energy poverty, which is a threat to the lives and livelihoods of millions of Africans. There is also the question of Nigeria's methane pledge to end gas flaring and yearning to take more advantage of its gas reserves to meet domestic energy need, among other options. Yet, there is the commitment to decarbonisation that she has made, even in the face of a yawning financing gap. The most feasible route to the resolution of these questions, some of them contending, is to design a template for climate financing via debt swap, which will be adopted and adapted to suit the different circumstances across bilateral and multilateral platforms. That will serve Nigeria and the world well. Simbo Olorunfemi works for Hoofbeatdotcom, a Nigerian communications consultancy and publisher of Africa Enterprise.

President Muhammadu Buhari has restated Nigeria's commitment to a rapid and strategic transition to renewable energy in response to the worldwide efforts for the preservation of the environment, saying that the country's energy transition plan will create about 340,000 jobs by 2030 and up to 840,000 by 2060. Speaking, on Wednesday, at a leaders' closed-door meeting on climate change convened by the secretary general of the United Nations, Mr. Antonio Guterres, at the sidelines of the ongoing United Nations General Assembly in New York, he stressed that his administration had, in august this year, launched a home-grown, data-backed, multi-pronged energy transition plan, which is the country's framework in achieving net-zero emissions by 2060. He highlighted some of the details in the plan, saying that through the use of emerging technologies and alternative fuels such as hydrogen, bioenergy, and waste-to-energy, a pathway would be created for accelerated decarburization of energy systems and harnessing of new and diverse technologies toward low carbon development while aligning to our broader developmental aspirations in a fair and just manner. Speaking further, the Nigerian leader said, 'the plan also sets out a timeline and framework for the attainment of emissions reduction across five key sectors: power, cooking, oil and gas, transport and industry,' adding that, 'gas will play a critical role as a transition fuel in Nigeria's net-zero pathway, particularly in the power and cooking sectors. 'The clean energy goals of the plan include modernising the power sector with large-scale integration of renewable energy, enhancing energy efficiency and conservation; and is expected to generate 250 gigawatts of installed energy capacity with over 90% made up of renewables.' Expressing his confidence that the plan would put the nation on the path of prosperity, President Buhari said that a careful implementation would create significant investment opportunities as it will engender the establishment and expansion of industries related to solar energy, hydrogen and electric vehicles. 'It will guide Nigeria's rapid transition to renewable energy and result in significant job creation with up to 340,000 jobs created by 2030 and up to 840,000 jobs created by 2060 driven mainly by power, cooking and transport sectors.' He commended Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi for his tireless efforts in the preparations for the COP27 and assured him of the support of the Nigerian government. A statement issued by Femi Adesina, special adviser to the president (Media and publicity), said while speaking at a bilateral meeting with the president of Palestine, Mahmoud Abbas, in New York, he said the actualisation of the UN resolution which proposed a two-state solution to the crisis between Israel and Palestine required a platform to think creatively on how to engage the rest of the world on the matter. In another meeting with Mr Mahamadou Issoufou, former president of Niger Republic and special envoy of the UN and African Union on Joint Strategic Assessment and Governance Situation in the Sahel, President Buhari assured the special envoy of the support of Nigeria in the discharge of his assignment bordering on seeking political and economic solutions to issues confronting countries in the Sahel. The President expressed optimism that with his wealth of experience and capacity, Mr Issoufou will get the job done. The former Nigerien leader had informed President Buhari that they required Nigerian support to raise funds for their activities especially as desertification is spreading across a number of African countries and most of the countries are severely challenged. He added that the committee needed to visit the countries involved to know their specific needs and would, at this instance, be in Nigeria in October this year. He requested President Buhari to convene a side event at the COP 27 meeting in November in Egypt so that it can come up with a rich outcome for the committee to use as a basis for its report. \</doc>

From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja According to estimates of the international experts, the Federal Government is currently leading a voluntary Carbon Market worth $1 billion on the continent, a novel and creative Climate Change solution that will, during the period of energy transition, create millions of new employment in Nigeria alone. According to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who is a member of the recently established international steering committee for the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI), it aims to promote the emergence and expansion of the market in Africa. He said this is part of the Federal Government's efforts to achieve the global net-zero emissions target. In a statement by his spokesman, Laolu Akande, besides Osinbajo, other members of the Committee of the ACMI, which would be announced early in November at the COP27 meeting in Egypt are former President of Colombia, Ivan Duque Marquez; President of the African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina, among others, including officials of the United Nations, USAID, Gates Foundation and other international private sector players. According to ACMI's projections, Nigeria may create up to 30 million carbon credits yearly by 2030, which, at $20 per credit, would be worth more than $500 million a year. ACMI further estimates that, "at this level of production, the industry could potentially support over 3 million Nigerian jobs. And Nigeria has only a portion of Africa's total potential the impact for the continent as a whole could be far greater." The jobs would span the period of the energy transition, starting from the time the market is able to kickoff, till 2060. Also on the committee are the CEO of UN-based Sustainable Energy for All, Damilola Ogunbiyi; Deputy Director, Gates Foundation, Samuel Thevasagayam; Chief Climate Officer, USAID, Gillian Caldwell; Chair of Integrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Markets, Annette Nazareth; and CEO, Verra, David Antonioli. In addition, the CEO, M-PESA Africa, Sitoyo Lopokolyit; Managing Partner, Hartree, Ariel Perez; Director, MENA Voluntary Carbon Exchange, Riham EIGizy; CEO Conservation International, M Sanjayan; Vice President, Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP), and Africa Director, UN Climate Change High-Level Champions, Joseph Nganga, complete the list of distinguished personalities on the committee. The Committee will be inaugurated at the forthcoming International Climate Change Conference in Egypt tagged COP 27 , with the aim to lead advocacy for the realisation of the Carbon Credits initiative as an effective way of reducing emissions while financing green growth across Africa. The Carbon Credit initiative gives the use of green energy for commercial and residential uses top priority. For instance, the conditional element of Nigeria's and other African countries' nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement could be supported by carbon credits. Nigeria's carbon credit potential is centered in household devices and forestry sectors, both of which would garner large benefits. While household appliances like solar lights and clean cookstoves help to increase energy availability and improve health outcomes, carbon forestry credits help to preserve Nigeria's abundant biodiversity and encourage sustainable livelihoods. As part of this vision, Nigeria aims to pioneer innovative climate solutions that will benefit Africa and the world. One of these solutions is the production and sale of carbon credits, which have enormous potential for Africa that is only beginning to be explored. According to the statement, the Federal Government is actively looking into ways to help the domestic carbon credit market expand as well as plans for how carbon credits may best spur investment and economic expansion. Some of the efforts for which the Buhari administration is globally acknowledged include the creation of the National Council on Climate Change, which President Buhari inaugurated last month, with the authority needed to drive major emissions reductions. Also, Vice President Osinbajo launched the Federal Government's Energy Transition Plan in August 2022, a detailed strategy outlining how Nigeria will reach global net zero emissions by 2060 while eliminating energy poverty. To further support the domestic production of carbon credits, the Federal Government is developing a carbon credit activation plan. This plan will clearly identify responsibility within the government for the regulation and promotion of carbon credits, and will outline a set of actions government can take to support the industry. \</doc>

THE $1.4 billion committed by Bill and Melinda Foundation Nigeria and other African countries is to spur the region-led innovation to build a pipeline of climate-smart agriculture projects for smallholder farmers. Interim Director, Agricultural Development of the Foundation, Mr. Enock Chikava, dropped the hint yesterday in a chat with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt on the sidelines of the ongoing United Nations ( UN ) Conference on Climate Change . Chikava, who said $2.1 million would be spent on research and development in agriculture sector in Nigeria, noted that the Foundation would mobilise $9 million for technologies to help the region make a difference in livestock and crop. He said: 'Our focus is 100 per cent on smallholder farmers. If you look at the impact of climate change over the years, which I am sure in your own country, last year there was a severe drought and this year floods. 'Now, there is that very platform that is responsible for lifting people out of extreme poverty is under huge threat because of climate change and because we focus 100 per cent on smallholder farmers, we are going to be spending $1.4 billion to make sure that we do much better work. 'By that we mean crops like cassava. We need cassavas that can tolerate draughts and floods. In Nigeria, flood has been the issue. In the research pipeline, the draught genre was never part and rarely a game, but now, we have draught and likely we are going to have more frequent draught. 'So, we need to be improving cassava in Nigeria not only for today, but also for the future. So, we do that and we focus on crops like cowpea. In cowpea, Nigeria's worth is 4.9 hectares, and that is a source of protein for the majority of the farmers.

'The difference is R and D and that can happen in cassava; it can happen in any other one. That is why it is super important that we focus on research and development.'

UN ) Conference on Climate Change . Chikava, who said $2.1 million would be spent on research and development in agriculture sector in Nigeria, noted that the Foundation would mobilise $9 million for technologies to help the region make a difference in livestock and crop. He said: 'Our focus is 100 per cent on smallholder farmers. If you look at the impact of climate change over the years, which I am sure in your own country, last year there was a severe drought and this year floods. 'Now, there is that very platform that is responsible for lifting people out of extreme poverty is under huge threat because of climate change and because we focus 100 per cent on smallholder farmers, we are going to be spending $1.4 billion to make sure that we do much better work. 'By that we mean crops like cassava. We need cassavas that can tolerate draughts and floods. In Nigeria, flood has been the issue. In the research pipeline, the draught genre was never part and rarely a game, but now, we have draught and likely we are going to have more frequent draught. 'So, we need to be improving cassava in Nigeria not only for today, but also for the future. So, we do that and we focus on crops like cowpea. In cowpea, Nigeria's worth is 4.9 hectares, and that is a source of protein for the majority of the farmers.

Power Up is working to unlock more ambitious pledges from wealthy countries Ahead of the crucial COP27 climate talks, a new campaign is boosting African efforts to seek greater global funding for affordable green energy - essential for adaptation to the climate crisis. The campaign calls for wealthy nations to greatly increase climate adaptation funding, and to ensure a significant share of this funding supports access to green, affordable energy for people facing climate catastrophe. Power Up is uniting and amplifying African voices in pursuit of climate justice, including organizations powering up communities most affected by energy poverty. Dr Sheila Oparaocha, Director of the ENERGIA Network, said: "At COP27 , taking place in Africa, world leaders can deliver climate justice and change the course of history with action to invest in affordable, sustainable energy that leaves no one behind." "More finance must flow from nations responsible for the climate crisis to those in the greatest danger - and money already promised must be delivered. Crucially, using adaptation funding to widen access to sustainable and affordable energy will ensure African communities are better prepared for the challenges ahead." Power Up is working to unlock more ambitious pledges from wealthy countries, starting with\\xa0 action at November's COP27 summit and continuing through the ongoing UNFCCC process that guides global climate action. Power Up members call on NGOs, businesses, civil society organizations, faith groups and other organizations across society to join and back the campaign. A full list of coalition members, and information on how to support the campaign, is available at PowerUpNow.org (launching September 19). Why Power Up More than 600 million African people go without access to electricity, and more than 900 million without safe cooking facilities - blocking development and stopping communities from adapting to the threats posed by climate change. Solar water pumps can make Africa's agricultural land more resilient and productive - currently, just 7% is irrigated - while establishing cold chains equivalent to wealthy nations would raise countries' food supplies by 15%. Powering up will help health services respond to health challenges - 60% of Africa's clinics lack access to electricity - and improve digital connectivity for education and information, including early warning of natural disasters. Renewable energy also boosts incomes and economic growth. Globally, it could create 14 million jobs by 2030. And research from the continent suggests that for every new job in the off-grid energy sector, up to five times more employment is created through gained productivity. Locally generated renewable energy brings these benefits cheaper, faster, and reaches more people than new fossil fuel infrastructure. But the African Development Bank reports an annual energy finance gap for the continent of 17 to 25 billion USD. Africa's trailblazers call for change The growing list of frontline organizations backing Power Up includes: Smiling Through Light - Providing affordable solar lighting to families in Sierra Leone, using a woman-to-woman sales model. Ignite Power - delivering solar-powered irrigation to Rwanda's farmers. Zonke Energy - bringing clean energy to off-grid township communities in South Africa, with mini-grids designed for urban settings. Kakuma Ventures - bringing solar-powered Wi-Fi to one of the world's largest refugee camps, supporting skills and entrepreneurship. Innocent Tshilombo, Kamuma Ventures Co-founder and Managing Director, said: "I know the power of green, affordable energy to change lives. But organizations like mine need much more support to scale up our work. We're playing our part. In communities where the need is greatest - now, politicians and global funders must step up. The more people back Power Up, the louder the call for action." How will the campaign work? Power Up is amplifying African calls to increase total climate adaptation funding and to spend a significant proportion on supporting energy access. The campaign will build public support for action and back African policymakers to pursue this goal at COP27 and beyond. The campaign will initially focus on five African countries with the potential to be trailblazers in growing energy access - Kenya, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa and Tanzania. But in 2023, Power Up is set to expand its focus on countries worldwide affected by energy poverty. \</doc>

The ongoing International Convention Centre during the COP27 climate summit, which began on Sunday, has gifted the world-famous resort of Sharm el Sheikh, an Egyptian resort town between the desert of the Sinai Peninsula and the Red Sea, another moment in the spotlight. Perhaps because of its unique sheltered sandy beaches, clear waters and coral reefs, Sharm El Sheikh is best known outside Egypt as a beach haven for tourists - Germans, British and, lately, Ukrainians and Russians - who love to get sunburned along the calm waters and rich coral reefs of the Red Sea. However, at least for the next two weeks, the all-inclusive resorts is instead housing tens of thousands of world leaders, climate negotiators, environmental activists and other attendees of COP27 , the annual United Nations climate summit. To give conferees an experience to remember for a long time, trees have been planted and plastic bags banned in an effort to 'green' the city that has earned the moniker 'City of Peace, Mangroves and Sustainability.' At the international climate summit ( COP27 ) gets underway amid compounding crises of war and economic instability, it is an open secret that world leaders will have some stormy sessions over how to address a key and fundamental question: whether or not rich and industrialised nations will pay for climate-related losses and damage. That has often been a sore point in previous meetings. 'We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator,' UN Secretary-General As presidents, prime ministers and activists from around the globe gathered yesterday to exchange ideas and tell the world what they have done and are still doing to tackle climate change, the United Nations Secretary-General, Ant\'f3nio Guterres, delivered a characteristically dire message about the rapidly-warming planet. 'We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator,' he warned. While setting the tone for the annual United Nations-led international climate talks, Guterres talked about the accumulating threats of war, warming and economic crisis taking a debilitating toll on every continent, hitting the world's most vulnerable people the hardest. 'We are in the fight of our lives, and we are losing,' Mr. Guterres said in his opening remarks at the summit where dozens of world leaders are scheduled to deliver brief addresses. The talks opened under the shadow of grim new data, as the World Meteorological Organisation said on Sunday that the planet had likely witnessed its warmest eight years on record, including every year since countries came together in 2015 to create the landmark Paris agreement. That was aimed at pivoting the global economy away from fossil fuels and slowing down warming. However, the biggest fault line of this year's talks is the question of what rich, industrialised countries - who account for the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions - owe to those bearing the brunt of climate hazards. On that issue alone, some are optimistic that there was a small breakthrough on Sunday on the contentious issue of who will pay for the irreversible damage that climate change is wreaking on the world's most vulnerable. The event is the 27th session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations convention, which is why it's known as COP27 . As at the last count, organisers said over 44,000 people have registered to attend, including representatives of governments, businesses, and civil society groups. The talks come at the end of a year that has seen extraordinary heat waves across the northern hemisphere, catastrophic flooding in Pakistan and Nigeria, and a punishing drought in China. According to a list posted by the United Nations, 110 heads of state and government are expected to address the conference, a larger number than at many previous climate conferences. Of those, just seven are women. Activists call for a 'fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty' to end oil, gas and coal use Environmental activists at COP27 are calling for a 'fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty.' This, in essence, is asking governments to promise an end to all new oil, gas and coal projects. In reality, this is a tall request for governments that are consumed with a global energy crisis induced by the Russia/Ukraine war. But activists argued on Monday that the solution lies in promoting the development of wind, solar and other renewable power rather than relying on gas and oil. Many also said they are worried that the world leaders scheduled to speak are really at the gathering to pay lip service to climate change; while sealing deals on the side-lines for more fossil-fuel-driven energy. 'So-called leaders are flying in to show that they care, but all they care about is drinking champagne with C.E.O.s,' said Dominika Lasota, a Polish activist with the group Fridays for Future, the international movement that grew out a solo school strike by Greta Thunberg, the climate activist from Sweden, in 2018. Other activists expressed concern that the gathering was already shaping up to be a disappointment, and they accused world leaders of not providing clear direction on urgent climate issues. 'Unfortunately, the only way I can actually sum up the COP27 summit so far is using two words: poor start,' Mohamed Adow, the director of Power Shift Africa, a group that aims to mobilize climate action across the continent, said at a news conference. 'We cannot have COP27 become a sham.' Mr. Adow said he was dismayed that there appeared to be no defined outcome on the issue of whether richer countries that have contributed the most to climate change should pay compensation to poorer countries that have been most affected. That issue, known as funding for 'loss and damage,' is included on the conference's formal agenda for the first time, but activists said the conversations were not focused enough on how such a policy would be carried out. Tasneem Essop, the executive director of Climate Action Network International, a network of more than 1,300 environmental groups, said at the same news conference that richer countries had an obligation to support poorer ones. 'A COP in Africa has to deliver for the most vulnerable in Africa and across the world,' she said. Compensation for 'loss and damage' may be stalemated A treaty to end coal, oil and gas use is not on the agenda at the conference; in fact, it has never been a direct topic of discussion at these climate summits. Harjeet Singh, the head of global political strategy for Climate Action Network, an international coalition of environmental groups, said that nations needed Â£ global framework to talk about fossil fuels.' Last year, at a summit in Glasgow, Scotland, nations agreed for the first time to put the phrase 'fossil fuels' into a U.N. climate declaration. There was also a dispute at that summit about whether nations would agree to phase fossil fuels 'out' or merely 'down.' In the end, 'down' won. The most vulnerable countries are seeking 'loss and damage' compensation from the biggest polluters. Year after year, calls have steadily grown louder for industrialised nations responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions already heating up the planet to own up to the problem - and pay for the damage. Known by the term 'loss and damage' - sterile code words crafted to avoid blame - such funding would be separate from money to help poor countries adapt to a changing climate, its proponents have argued. Loss and damage, they insist, is not charity - it's what's due. At this year's COP27 summit, for the first time, 'funding arrangements' for loss and damage are included on the formal agenda, overcoming longstanding objections from the United States and the European Union. 'We are pleased that the parties were able to agree on an agenda item related to loss and damage,' a U.S. State Department spokesperson was quoted to have said on Sunday. 'Damage,' which refers to the destruction of physical things like roads, homes and bridges, is relatively easy to quantify. 'Loss' refers to economic impacts: lost work hours because of extreme heat, for instance, or lost agricultural revenues because rising sea levels flood paddy fields with salt water, or lost tourism revenues because of a hurricane. That is harder to quantify. Estimates of the amount of money required vary widely, from $290 billion to $580 billion a year by 2030, rising to $1.7 trillion by 2050, according to one study. Loss and damage was first championed by countries in the Pacific Ocean, and then embraced by a widening group of developing world countries. All the while, the real losses and damages kept piling up. Storms washed away crops. Droughts turned farmland to desert. Scientists got better at pinpointing the role of the warming planet in extreme weather. As negotiators met at the climate summit in 2013 in Warsaw, Super Typhoon Haiyan wiped away homes and farms and killed more than 6,000 people in Southeast Asia. In 2015, loss and damage was acknowledged in the Paris accord, the agreement among nations to jointly work to limit global warming, but not before the United States - historically the largest emitter of greenhouse gases - included specific language ruling out the prospect of liability and compensation. A breakthrough came at the Madrid climate summit in 2019: an agreement to set up a technical assistance program. So far that consists of a website but no staff or funding. At last year's COP26 summit in Scotland, the United States signed a statement agreeing to 'increase resources' for loss and damage, without committing to anything more specific. Then came record flooding in Pakistan last month, leaving what the World Bank estimated to be $30 billion in economic losses. The issue represents the biggest fight at this year's gathering, and even though it is finally on the formal agenda, the issue is far from settled: There's no agreement on whether to set up a pot of money - and certainly no money yet. 'Space has been created for discussion,' said Simon Stiell, the head of the United Nations climate change agency, which is leading these talks. Can Washington, Beijing and others work together to stop the world from 'highway to climate hell'? As world leaders gathered in Egypt to confront climate change, this is taking place at a moment of colliding crises: a war in Europe that has upended energy markets, rising global inflation, deep political divisions in many countries and tension between the world's two greatest polluters, China and the United States. Many believe the prevailing conditions don't bode well for a mission that demands cooperation among nations to bring down the pollution from burning oil, gas and coal that is warming the planet. The United States, which for the first time is attending United Nations negotiations with a climate plan that is backed by the force of law, will try to reassert itself as a leader in the fight to keep temperatures from rising to catastrophic levels. But while the legislation may mend America's tattered reputation after former President Donald Trump halted climate action for years, more is needed to meet its commitments under the 2015 Paris agreement to constrain global warming. And the law barely squeaked through a bitterly divided Congress. In addition, much of climate progress hinges on China, which now pumps the most greenhouse gases of any country into the atmosphere - an output that is not expected to peak for several more years. John Kerry, President Biden's special envoy for climate change, emerged from last year's summit with his Chinese counterpart to announce the two countries would work together to cut fossil fuel pollution this decade. But a year later, there is distance between the two as relations between the United States and China have sunk to their lowest point in decades amid economic competition, tensions over Taiwan and differences over Russia's war in Ukraine. Anyway, the United Nations scribe has called on China and the United States - the world's two biggest polluters - to cooperate in addressing climate change, saying that the nations had Â£ particular responsibility to join efforts.' 'We are in the fight of our lives, and we are losing. We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator,' Guterres said. He acknowledged other steep challenges that the world faces, including the war between Russia and Ukraine, but said that climate change was of another order. 'It is unacceptable, outrageous and self-defeating to put it on the back burner,' he said. Mr. Guterres also had a message for India and China, although he did not name them. Days before leaders of the Group of 20 major economies meet, with India chairing the gathering, he said: 'All G20 countries must accelerate their transition now - in this decade.' 'Developed countries must take the lead,' he added, signalling that historic polluters have a different responsibility. 'But emerging economies are also critical to bending the global emissions curve.' In his own opening remarks, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, which is hosting the conference, called on leaders to act with urgency to meet their commitments. 'There is no time to slip back. There is no space for hesitation,' he said. 'For the sake of future generations, here and now we are facing a unique historical moment, a last chance to meet our responsibilities.' Why some influential world leaders may boycott COP27 ? The leaders of some of history's largest polluters are slated to speak, including the president of the European Union, Ursula Von der Leyen, and Britain's prime minister, Rishi Sunak. Both have ambitious targets to reduce emissions of planet-warming gases. Mohamed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, is also scheduled to make an address, though his kingdom has no plans to slow down the exploitation of fossil fuels. President Biden is due to arrive late this week, after the midterm elections in the United States. Several key world leaders will not be in attendance at a convention centre on the shores of the Red Sea: Xi Jinping of China, the world's largest emitter, nor Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, whose emissions are expected to grow sharply alongside its economy. Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, whose war on Ukraine is financed by the country's fossil fuel riches, is not coming either. But Russia's military aggression and the global energy and food crisis it has unleashed loom large. Without naming any countries, Egypt's foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, urged that the nations of the world not let 'political tensions' get in the way of addressing climate crisis. 'We need to prove the contrary,' he told delegates at the opening ceremony on Sunday. 'Climate change and its impacts are existential,' he added. COP27 and its lofty aims For two weeks, as nations struggle to cut greenhouse gas emissions amid a global energy crisis, war in Europe and rising inflation, there are high hopes, especially on the side of the most vulnerable parts of the world. What does COP stand for? COP stands for Conference of the Parties, with 'parties' referring to the 197 nations that agreed to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992. The 197 parties, including the United States, ratified the treaty to address 'dangerous human interference with the climate system' and stabilise levels of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. The U.N. climate body convenes those governments once a year to discuss how to jointly address climate change. This is the 27th time countries have gathered under the convention - hence, COP27 . \</doc>

Part of my nation is underwater. Seasonal flooding is normal in Nigeria, but not like this. Thirty-four of the country's 36 states have been affected. More than 1.4 million people have been displaced. Together with drought-driven famine in the Horn of Africa, cascading wildfires across the North and wave upon wave of intensifying cyclones in the South, climate disasters in Africa form the backdrop to this year's U.N. Climate Change Conference (known as COP27 ) in Egypt. Many of my peers are frustrated with Western hypocrisy and its inability to take responsibility. Governments have repeatedly failed to meet their commitments to the $100 billion fund for climate adaptation and mitigation in the developing world - for the mess their own industries caused. According to the United Nations, Africa is the continent worst affected by climate change despite contributing the least to it. Even though the COP27 's agenda notes the need for compensation for loss and damages (as distinct from adaptation and mitigation funding), that demand has mostly been met with silence in the West. Amid this simmering acrimony, I offer a few words of advice to Western negotiators at this year's COP27 First, rich countries should direct a greater share of funding to developing nations' adaptation to the effects of climate change. Most financing currently flows toward mitigation projects, such as renewable energy projects, that reduce emissions. While such projects have their uses, far more money needs to go to helping Africa adapt to the effects of climate change - which seems only fair for a continent that produces less than 3 percent of global emissions. Read Also: COP27 Second, don't tell Africans they can't use their own resources. If Africa were to use all its known reserves of natural gas - the cleanest transitional fossil fuel - its share of global emissions would rise from a mere 3 percent to 3.5 percent. We are not the problem. Yet the continent needs a reliable source of power if it is to pull millions of citizens out of poverty and create jobs for its burgeoning youth population. Africa's future must be carbon-free. But current energy demands cannot yet be met solely through weather-dependent solar and wind power. Don't tell Africa that the world cannot afford the climate cost of its hydrocarbons - and then fire up coal stations whenever Europe feels an energy pinch. Don't tell the poorest in the world that their marginal energy use will break the carbon budget - only to sign off on new domestic permits for oil and gas exploration. It gives the impression your citizens have more of a right to energy than Africans. Third, when you realize you need Africa's reserves, don't cut its citizens out of the benefits. In the wake of the Ukraine war, there has been a resurgence of interest in Africa's gas. But this impulse is coming from Western companies - backed by their governments - who are interested only in extracting these resources and then exporting them to Europe. Funding for gas that benefits Africa as well as the West is conspicuously lacking. At last year's COP, Western governments and multilateral lenders pledged to stop all funding for overseas fossil fuel projects. Without these pools of capital, Africa will struggle to tap the gas needed to boost its own domestic power supply. Consequently, its development and industrialization will suffer. Donor countries don't believe in the developing world exploiting its own hydrocarbons even as they pursue new oil and gas projects within their own borders. Western development has unleashed climate catastrophe on my continent. Now, the rich countries' green policies dictate that Africans should remain poor for the greater good. To compound the injustice, Africa's hydrocarbons will be exploited after all - just not for Africans. Fourth, follow your own logic. Africa is told that the falling cost of renewables means that it must leapfrog carbon-emitting industries. At the same time, Western governments are effectively paying their citizens to burn more hydrocarbons: Lavish subsidy packages have been drawn up to offset spiraling energy bills. Meanwhile, Africa is the continent closest to being carbon-neutral. It reserves the right to plug holes in its energy mix with the resources in its ground - especially when they will make almost no difference to global emissions. The Western countries are unable to take politically difficult decisions that hurt domestically. Instead, they move the problem offshore, essentially dictating that the developing world must swallow the pill too bitter for their own voters' palates. Africa didn't cause the mess, yet we pay the price. At this year's COP, that should be the starting point for all negotiations. \</doc>

\\xa0By Kest\'e9r Kenn Klomeg\'e2h As Rotating Chairman of the African Union and the President of Senegal, Macky Sall, has excelled in speaking up on many development priorities for Africa. His complete understanding of sustainable development questions began during his childhood as he grew up in a family of politicians and ultimately continues pursuing political career. Without doubts, he made "The Path of Real Development" political slogan during his campaign for presidency. He campaigned across the country, without cutting off ties with the "23 Juin" (M23) opposition movement, rather telling them the importance of achieving development through unity. President Sall was awarded the 2020 Sunhak Peace Prize for successfully shortening the presidential term from seven to five years and reviving the economy through transparent policies. Since his appointment as Chairman of the African Union, Macky Sall now has a wider platform to drum home "unity in diversity" across the Africa and beyond. On international platform he fearlessly tells the African story including the key priorities, the challenges and the future. His message for African leaders is "with one collective voice" rally for the continent's sustainable development, sharpen external partners' understanding Africa's priorities and also its role in the emerging multipolar world. As African Union Chairman, Macky Sall was invited to the United Nations General Assembly last September. During his address to the gathering, Macky Sall was not shy about speaking up for Africa. The gist of his message? There is absolutely no excuse for failing to ensure consistent African representation in the world's key decision-making bodies. "It is time to overcome the reticence and deconstruct the narratives that persist in confining Africa to the margins of decision-making circles," said Sall, who is also the President of Senegal. His speech was about the need to give Africa permanent seats at the UN Security Council so, as he put it, "Africa can finally be represented where decisions that affect 1.4 billion Africans are being taken." But that was far from the first time he has called upon the global community to seek and consider African perspectives. From the beginning of his one-year term as the African Union's chairman last February, Sall said he wanted to see fair, equitable international partnerships that welcomed African contributions instead of dismissing African priorities. "Our continent cannot be a field which is the feast of others," Sall said during his inaugural speech. He also has spoken up for greater African representation in the G20, which as of yet only has one African member (South Africa). Multilateralism must "serve the interests of all," Sall argued in October, or it will suffer "loss of legitimacy and authority." There have been several high praises and admirations for him. In an opinion article, the Executive Chairman of the African Energy Chamber, NJ Ayuk, spoke positively about his tireless work, not only to insist that the global community listens to and respects African issues, but also to build awareness of what those issues are. Macky Sall has put African needs and priorities - including infrastructure development, greater access to COVID-19 vaccinations, food security, and an end to energy poverty - in front of world leaders ranging from Chinese President Xi Jinping to U.S. President Joe Biden. He has done the same at global events, including the 2022 G20 summit and the COP27 climate conference. Sall has been particularly outspoken about Africa's energy needs and the rights of African countries to continue extracting and capitalizing upon their oil and gas resources, even in the face of tremendous global pressure for Africa to make a rapid switch to renewable energy sources. He has firmly stated that, when it comes to the global march toward net zero emissions, Africa will not be in lockstep with the rest of the world at the expense of our countries' well-being. "We are in an era when Africa needs fierce advocates. Nations and international partnerships are fighting for their respective priorities, and unless African leaders are willing to stand up for what our continent needs, our objectives will be pushed aside. Sall has, indeed, taken a stand," NJ Ayuk wrote in an opinion article. Relating to an unwavering voice for a just energy transition, NJ Ayuk said "African energy was not Sall's only priority as chairman of the African Union, but he did, rightfully, use his platform to expand global awareness of Africa's unique energy needs in 2022. He pointed out the hypocrisy of wealthy countries that harnessed fossil fuels to industrialize and grow their economies telling developing African countries that the world's zero-emission goals trumped their right to do the same." Macky Sall speaks with authority. "We will not accept that polluting countries, responsible for the situation of the planet, tell us that we are no longer going to finance fossil fuels," Sall said in September. According to him, "while remaining committed to the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement, we must continue to defend the interests of our countries in the run-up to COP27 next November in Egypt." And that's exactly what happened. Sall and other African leaders fiercely defended Africa's energy interests before and during COP27 . The result? As multiple news outlets reported, African natural gas took center stage at the conference. Macky Sall is further described as a strong collaborator. Executive Chairman of the African Energy Chamber, NJ Ayuk, said when he tweeted in November, Africa was fortunate to have Sall at COP27 . He understands both sides of the African energy transition debate: the need for Africa to set the timing for its shift to renewables and the world's need to address climate change. Sall advocated for ongoing natural gas production in Africa, which allows us to minimize carbon dioxide emissions while providing much-needed gas to generate electricity domestically, build our economies, and move toward industrialization. Sall also has pushed for the international community to help fund the renewable energy infrastructure Africa needs for a just transition and to provide financial support for African climate adaptation. Climate adaptation measures have particularly been a priority for Sall. In his capacity as President of Senegal, he and the CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA), Patrick Verkooijen, partnered in 2022 to unlock $1 billion in climate finance for Senegal under the Africa Adaptation Accelerator Program (AAAP). The AAAP, Africa-led and Africa-owned, is working to bolster adaptation in agriculture, digital services, infrastructure, entrepreneurship, and jobs for young people. It was developed by the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) and the African Development Bank (AfDB) in collaboration with the African Union. Sall was among the trailblazers to convene the Africa Adaptation Leaders' Event during COP27 . He also co-wrote, with French President Emmanuel Macron and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, an opinion piece for the Guardian about the AAAP. It emphasized the critical importance of increased funding from developed countries for climate adaptation initiatives in developing countries, particularly those in Africa. "What we've seen is a pragmatic approach from Sall, one that recognizes the need for Africa to continue harnessing its oil and gas reserves while working diligently to move toward the transition to renewables - and to build climate resiliency into Africa's economy," wrote NJ Ayuk. "When Sall's one-year term at the helm of the African Union concludes February 5, 2023, many challenges facing Africa will hardly be behind us. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that Sall has been making a vital difference in his role. Sall has said, loudly and clearly, that African voices will not be silenced. Thanks to Sall, it appears that the global community is starting to hear that message. That is a step in the right direction," concluded NJ Ayuk, Executive Chairman of the African Energy Chamber based in South Africa. \</doc>

Ahmed Bello Umar, the director of currency at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), has said N165 billion of old notes have so far been mopped up by commercial banks since the announcement of the introduction of new bank notes was made on October 26. Umar revealed this in Abuja during a post-Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) media briefing on Wednesday. He said that the amount deposited so far in the commercial banks was small compared to what CBN had hoped to get. He revealed that since the new currency had already been officially launched by President Muhammadu Buhari at the presidential villa on Wednesday, the apex bank would start distributing the new naira notes to all its branches on Thursday. However, the new notes will only be available for spending on December 15, even as he reemphasized the position of the federal government that there would be no extension beyond January 31, 2023, to discontinue usage of the old naira notes. : Explainer: What to know about new naira notes Gov. Muhammad Badaru of Jigawa State urged the electorate on Wednesday to vote for Sen. Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All-Progressives Congress (APC) in 2023, for continuity. The governor said that voting for Tinubu was important in order to ensure that he continued with the road, rail line, and other federal government projects initiated by President Muhammadu Buhari in the state. He stated that the APC was the only party that people in the state and Nigeria trusted. 'We fulfilled almost all our campaign promises, as there is no community in the state that is yet to benefit from one or more capital projects by our great party, the APC.' 'We have a legacy in the state, and I assure you that voting for APC at all levels will ensure the continuity of such projects and programmes,' the governor said. This is according to NAN. AfDB fund secures $64m grant from Norway The African Development Bank (AfDB) has secured $64 million in grant funding from the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD) for its Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA) project. AfDB also received funding from the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) for SEFA. This is contained in a statement issued by the Communications and External Relations Department of the African Development Bank (AfDB) on Wednesday. The announcement about the funding came during a panel discussion as part of the just-concluded 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference Summit held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. The discussion titled 'Renewable energy for climate action and socio-economic transformation in Africa: The Role of SEFA' aimed to provide concessional finance to unlock private sector investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency. US Fed considers slower rate hikes A review of the November 1-2 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes has shown that a substantial majority of Fed officials accepted that a slowing in the pace of the fed funds rate increase would likely soon be appropriate. They believe that would better allow the committee to assess progress toward its objectives of price stability and full employment. Monetary policy markets also noted that, with inflation not slowing as a result of the rise in energy prices caused by the Ukraine war and the economy's worsening supply and demand imbalances, the ultimate level of the federal funds rate required to achieve the committee goal will be slightly higher than previously expected. The Fed raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points to 3.75 percent to 4 percent during its November meeting. This is the sixth consecutive rate hike this year. This decision could force policymakers to declare a recession as many businesses struggle to deal with the higher borrowing costs. Scottish nationalists suffer huge blow as UK court rejects independence vote bid All hopes for Scotland's independence from the United Kingdom were dashed on Wednesday following a ruling from the UK Supreme Court, which insisted that calls for a second referendum must get the backing of the British Parliament. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP), had announced earlier this year she intended to hold an advisory vote on secession next October but that it had to be lawful and internationally recognised. Sturgeon, undeterred by the ruling from the UK Supreme Court, had vowed to campaign in the next UK-wide election, expected to be held in 2024, solely on a platform of whether Scotland should be independent, making it a 'de facto' referendum. 'We must and we will find another democratic, lawful, and constitutional means by which the Scottish people can express their will. In my view, that can only be an election,' Sturgeon told reporters. 'As of today, democracy is what is at stake... It is now about whether or not we even have the basic democratic right to choose our own future,' she said. \</doc>

Daniel Kanu The Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA) with other environmental-based groups have raised the alarm that although Africa carries the greatest burdens of climate change the continent contributes less than three percent of global emissions. Also they lamented the devastating effect of the change, which caused massive floods in Nigeria, Chad, Republic of Benin, and Cameroon. This is as CAPPA wants Nigerian government to stop further policy somersault on climate change issues and articulate the project properly with clarity. CAPPA Executive Director, Akinbode Oluwafemi, raised the alarm, at the unveiling of the report \- Assessing Climate Change, COP26 Commitments in Africa: Case Studies of Nigeria, South Africa, and Uganda \- held at it's Lagos office on Wednesday, November 2, 2022. Oluwafemi Said that the project was informed by the need to review the climate commitments of African countries ahead of the 27th Session of the Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) billed for Sharm El-Sheikhin Egypt. The activist pointed out that South Africa also had its unfair share with floods that led to mudslides that claimed citizens lives, whily lamenting that the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report predicted that the crises would continue and likely displace not less than half of Africa's 1.4 billion population by the year 2030 unless something was done urgently. To arrest the impending danger, Oluwafemi appealed to both developed and developing nations to cut down on emissions that cause climate change. The report carried out in the three African nations want global north and big polluters pay for damages already done. Among the demand is : . To pay reparations for historical losses suffered by individuals and communities on the frontline of the climate crisis in Africa. . To cancel Africa's debts, insistiy that the continent's economies need a breather through debt cancellation to better focus and redirect scarce resources to their climate change actions and aspirations. . It called on European governments, Asian and North American financial institutions to stop pumping monies into projects that risk locking Africa into fossil-fuel dependency. The report also called for the stoppage of fossil fuel burning. "The most contribution to global warming comes from the industrialized world. "False solutions like carbon trading will continue to create a false sense of progress while global temperature continues to rise. We need a concerted effort to stop fossil fuel burning and move towards the use of renewables to accelerate the reduction of GHG emissions and by extension global warming," it stated. To African countries, the report appealed to the governments to : Leverage Green Economic Opportunities including increased demands for electric vehicles, solar panels, batteries, etc. which are produced with critical minerals some of which are sourced from Africa places. This it argued puts Africa at a vantage point to renegotiate its position on the global stage while stimulating inclusive economic growth. Other demands include . Removing Barriers to Renewable Energy Technologies in Africa Such as Import Tariffs to make renewable energy accessible and affordable to most of the energy-poor African population. . Withdraw Support for Heavy-Carbon Project such projects like Dangote refineries and petrochemicals and Uganda's EACOP which will lock Africa into Fossil fuel. . Frame Just transition in an African Context: Framing the understanding of just and equitable transition from an African context to take care of the "one-size fits all". A just transition in an African context must be equitable, inclusive, gender sensitive, and respect the human language \- cultural and religious rights of peoples. . Protect Workers and Communities since transition comes with a price, sometimes painful. . Harness Capacity to Secure Funding Support to Finance Africa's Climate Ambition: The Africa Group of Negotiators has called for $1.3 trillion a year in climate finance to be made available from 2025. There is a need to utilize the global stage afforded by COP 27 to campaign and secure commitment to this as well as a strategy to follow up and net in the commitments after the conference. . Drop False Solution Schemes eg carbon trading schemes, and gas as a transition fuel as a pathway towards carbon emission reduction. . Increase Climate Change Education and Awareness. . Scale Up Adaptive Capacities: The recent flooding episodes in Uganda and Nigeria show that a lot is still lacking in the terms of building resilience and providing adaptation support for victims of climate change in Africa. The report was put together by Nigeria-based CAPPA, Uganda-based African Institute for Energy Governance (AFIEGO) and South African Climate Action Network (SACAN). \</doc>

The third day of the Africities was marked by the elective general assembly of United Cities of Local Government of Africa (UCLG Africa) ( HYPERLINK http://www.UCLGA.org www.UCLGA.org ). The general assembly elected the new office bearers of the organization, namely the 45 members of the UCLG Africa Pan African Council; the 15 members of the Executive Committee; the 5 members of the UCLG Africa Financial Management Committee; the 5 Vice Presidents, among which the Region of Nouakchott, Mauritania represented by its President, Mrs. Fatimetou Abdel Malick, was elected the new President of UCLG Africa. "The mandate that is beginning will be the mandate of all challenges, which we can only take up together and each one separately in its segment. For my part, I will strive to carry our voice as far and as effectively as possible and to contribute to making our organization a key player at the continental level but also at the international level, " she said. . The new leadership of UCLG Africa elected for a 3-year mandate is composed as follows: UCLG Africa Presidency (5 Vice Presidents) : Region of Nouakchott (Ms. Fatimetou Abdel Malick), County of Kisumu (Prof. Peter Anyang' Nyong'o), City of Libreville (Ms. Christine Mba Ndutume), Union of Cities and Communes of C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire ( Hon Claude Paulin Danho), and Botswana Association of Local Authorities (Mr. Jeffrey Sibisibi); to which to add, ex officio, the City of Banjul, The Gambia, President of the Network of Locally Elected Women of Africa, REFELA (Mrs. Malick Lowe). The Region of Nouakchott represented by Ms Fatimetou Abdel Malick, was elected the new President of UCLG Africa until the next general assembly due to take place in 2025. UCLG Africa Executive Committee (15 members) : Kisumu County Government (Kenya); Rwanda Association of Local Authorities. RALGA, (Rwanda); Victoria District (Seychelles); Botswana Local Authorities Association (BALA), South African Local Government Association (SALGA); City of Kwe Kwe, Zimbabwe; La Faiti&egrave;re des Communes du Togo (FCT); Association of Local Authorities of Nigeria (ALGON); Union des Villes et Communes de C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire (UVICOCI); Communes et Villes Unies du Cameroun (CVUC); Commune de Libreville, Gabon; Association des Maires de Congo (AMC); Region of Nouakchott; Moroccan Association of Presidents of Communal Councils (AMPCC, Morocco); and the Governorate of Cairo ( Egypt). The Local Government Association of South Africa, SALGA (Cllr. Bheke Stofile) was designated to be the candidate of Africa for the Co-Presidency of the world organization of UCLG. "With women on the driving seat of our organization, UCLG Africa confirm its resolve to bring women centered. This is the winning Africa! This is what the world should know about Africa." said the Secretary General of UCLG Africa, Jean Pierre Elong Mbassi. Women's Day: Improving women's rights till we achieve gender equality Women were on the spotlight during The Women's Day at the Africities 9. Improving women's rights till we achieve gender equality is achieved, is one of the main ambitions of UCLG Africa. During the proceedings session by the Network of Locally Elected Women of Africa (REFELA), the participants agreed that ensuring land ownership to women across the continent is one of the ways to achieve this objective. This is a critical factor for the social and economic empowerment of African women, whether they live in urban or rural areas. Women's role as actors in the economic and sustainable development of territories has to be confirmed. And this approach is part of the REFELA's campaign, "Women's Economic Empowerment" "Agriculture is the largest sector in most of our economies contributing over 20% to the GDP and it heavily relies on women for labour, trading and processing of agricultural products. Therefore, if you really want to emancipate women and be inclusive in development, it is important to address the fundamental right to land for women. When women know they own the land they can make long term impactful decisions about it. One of the ways to do this is to ensure that there's harmonization amongst laws like traditional laws, marital laws, land laws and the constitutions to avoid any conflict and ensure that the constitutions which guarantee land rights for women" said Joan Kagwanja, Chief of the Land Policy Initiative, United Nations Economic Commission For Africa. During the Women's Day, the REFELA presented the "Charter of Local Government on Gender Equality in Africa" which is intended to be a political instrument in favor of strengthening women's rights at the sub national and local governments in Africa. This Charter commits the territories to fight all forms of discrimination against women to guarantee their inclusion in the development programs of the cities and territories of Africa. This response from African local governments deserves consideration beyond mere membership. Young people should not shy away to offer themselves for leadership African youth in its wide diversity is under-represented in the decision-making process. This first Youth Day of Africities addressed the way to improve the involvement of African youth to play a decisive role in local governance as well as at the national level. "We are galvanizing the energy of young elected leaders of Africa to confront these issues of policies that are not conducive to the development of young people. Young people should not shy away to offer themselves for leadership. The young people of Africa should not chicken out to take up the tough route of fighting and ensuring their voices are heard because real decision makers are not just listeners and beneficiaries of the youth programs and pronouncements. Look, at the age of 27 I was able to go through the difficult route of going through an election, defeating old and rich people that are usually greedy and have no vision to transform lives and give us the Africa we want to see and that is why I'm calling upon all youth to not fear because this is their continent and they are to blame if they do not carry the mantle of leadership" said George Mwanza, Mayor Of Chipata in Zambia. Engaging larger and balanced territories During this day, the question of leveraging the right partnerships in intermediary cities was at the core of the debates. By putting secondary cities at the heart of national urban strategies, national and local leaders will give a second chance to Africa by engaging larger and balanced territories, leaving no one and no place behind. The City We Need Now! is a manifesto and a campaign towards the Africa we want. This campaign will not stop at summit in Kisumu. Campaigners will continue spreading the word and raising ambitions for African cities towards the 11th session of the World Urban Forum convened by UN-Habitat in Katowice, Poland, from 26 to 30 June 2022, as well as towards the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) to be held in Sharm El-Sheikh from 7 to 18 November 2022. The campaign will engage the national and sub-national level, regional and local government organizations, civil society and grass roots organizations, urban professionals, researchers, youth and women groups and the media. On 20 May in the morning, the focus will be on the official opening ceremony of the political segment, marked by the dialogue between former heads of state and young elected officials aged 35 or below leading a local government as mayor or president of a subnational local government. In the afternoon will held in parallel, the meeting of ministers, the meeting of mayors and leaders of subnational governments, and the meeting of development partners.

Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, the Minister of Agriculture of and Rural Development, Dr Muhammad Abubakar and the United Kingdom High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing are expected to lead conversation at the Feed Nigeria Summit. The summit scheduled for 12th December this year, will focus on how to recalibrate the Nigerian economy using the advantages the agricultural sector and agribusiness ecosystem provides. Director General of Feed Nigeria Summit Secretariat, Richard-Mark Mbaram, who stated this on Monday while addressing journalists, said the summit will also focus on the best way to deploy biotechnology which he said has contributed to the growth of agriculture in Africa, without leaving a mark on the environment. He said having studied the global economic meltdown, it was realising that agriculture is the answer to this global economic crisis. According to him, the world is much concerned about growing more food without having a negative impact on the environment which was part of the discussions at the concluded COP27 . 'So, as the environment is pushing at the farmers, the farmers' pushback becomes enhanced only if they have the backing of science, technology and innovation, and that is sitting in this year's Feed Nigeria Summit as a thematic area. 'We now have a new agricultural policy in Nigeria and it focuses on the critical need of time, we just returned from Egypt for the COP27 and the core concern globally is how do we produce more food without leaving marks on the environment, and we are saying that in Nigeria the policy that we have in place now indicates that those who were behind it are visionaries, they knew that technology and innovation is at the core of providing the farmers, the stakeholders in the agricultural ecosystem the tool that they require to meet this phenomenal challenge of increased productivity. He, however , stated that the Summit will be setting up and calibrating the Deal Room with which the USAID Feed The Future is a partner in a manner that it provides support for the agricultural sector around financing. \</doc>

900 million Africans rely on solid biomass such as firewood and charcoal for cooking, which causes indoor pollution that kills 600,000 people a year A kettle boiled twice a day by the rich and luxurious family of radical leftist group Extinction Rebellion\' s Chlo\'e9 Farand in the France, uses five times as much electricity as an entire Malian family uses per year. 900 million Africans rely on solid biomass such as firewood and charcoal for cooking, which causes indoor pollution that kills 600,000 people a year. On average, a Tanzanian would take 8 years to consume as much electricity as Chlo\'e9 Farand consumes in one month. Sub-Saharan Africa has undiscovered, but technically recoverable, energy resources estimated at about 115.34 billion barrels of oil and 21.05 trillion cubic metres of gas. We have to use our natural gas to fix Africa\' s problems. Chlo\'e9 Farand needs to decarbonize and Bola, Aderike, Abosede, Atinuke Omolade and Oyinola need to have electricity, clean cooking, jobs and industrialization. And we need to use African natural gas to do that. Except you believe like many in Chloe Ferand\' s camp do, that Africans do not deserve reliable and affordable power just like they have in Europe. Environmental Concerns While environmental causes are a major focus in the West, lawmakers in Africa\' s developing countries are more concerned with living wages and supplying basic necessities to the continent\' s growing population. The plan of radical western activists like Chlo\'e9 Farand who often pretend to be journalists to hide their murky anti-Africa agendas and Extinction Rebellion would amount to austerity measures in Africa that would see Africans leaving petroleum resources in the ground that has benefitted Farand and generations of her family for hundreds of years, in exchange for poverty for Africans. Her parents colonized us and took everything and today she\\xa0 essentially brands poor Africans criminals  or at the very least enemies of the environment  for using fossil fuels. We just saw it with the recent hit job and attacks on Africans at COP27 . What\' s more, we can\' t overlook the fact that renewable energy solutions are still young technologies  they are less reliable and more expensive per unit of power than other tried-and-tested sources of base load, including hydrocarbons. Achieving net zero by 2050 would therefore require that Farand focus her advocacy on her family and her neighbors rather than pick on poor Africans. Banning African Natural Gas Production A ban on African natural gas production would bring about the collapse of many carbon-dependent governments in Africa. The oil industry is the primary source of income for many African nations. Without the continuation of petroleum production  or time and opportunities to cultivate new revenue sources  their economies will suffer  along with their citizens. Fossil Fuel executives should be at COP27 . We have maintained in the past and continue to believe that demonizing energy companies and those that work in the oil and gas industry is not a constructive way forward and ignoring the role that carbon-based fuels have played in driving human progress distorts the public debate. Western countries are flat out wrong on this. They have benefited the most from Fossil Fuels. We are facing climate challenges today solely due to their historic pollution. We cannot expect African nations, which together emitted seven times less CO2 than China last year and four times less than the US, according to the Global Carbon Atlas, to undermine their best opportunities for economic development by simply aligning with the Western view of how to tackle carbon emissions. At the same time, no western nation is ready to pay a fair price for their role in legacy carbon emissions Outside Agitators at COP27 . Africans who attend COP27 are not outside agitators. Africans who work in the natural gas industry continue to be treated as outside agitators for daring to attend an African COP27 in Egypt. The nasty and vicious attacks from radical environmental groups such as extinction rebellion and their surrogates such as Chloe Farand who claim and pretend to speak in Africa\' s best interest.\\xa0 Where and when were they elected to this these positions and by which Africans might we ask? A very rich white woman who does not understand the need to defeat black energy poverty. We are not surprised by the racist undertones of their advocacy, given that her Orgarnisation do not hire or recruit black people. Maybe she can start by hiring some token blacks.\\xa0 She has refused to provide documentation on her funding for such anti-black and African activities.\\xa0 She plagiarized a discredited and debunked story to attack Africans. Sounds familiar. Black people who are fighting energy poverty in Africa must understand that they will continue to be attacked by vested anti-African interests, many of which often pretend to be pro-African. They will face situations like that of African Americans fighting for civil rights in the 60s.\\xa0 Segregationist Alabama Governor John Patterson for example refused to condemn white rioters, and instead blamed the Freedom Riders for the violence they suffered in Alabama at the hands of white rioters who used similar language like we see being used today against African anti-energy poverty advocates; trouble makers, charlatans, fraudsters, looters, corrupt, terrorists etc. Patterson had warned that integration would cause  violence, disorder, and bloodshed and had refused to repudiate an endorsement from the Ku Klux Klan.  If the Federal Government really wants to help in this unfortunate situation, Patterson told reporters in Montgomery,  they will encourage these outside agitators to go home. We have the means and the ability to keep the peace in Alabama without any outside help. White opposition to black energy poverty was largely a quiet movement that has now become the rallying cry of the climate movement. Africans need to pay attention to this. When they attack your beloved African Energy Chamber and anyone associated with it, it is because our work is picking up steam and they need to silence our voices. We will not be silenced by people who live in houses that use coal, use gas to drive their cars, use diesel to power their economies and then lecture Africans that they need to stay in the dark and be happy for it for the sake of our environment. A very white colonialist agenda. China and Africa While extinction rebellion and others are calling for a ban on investment in African oil and gas, China, meanwhile, appears willing to continue investing in fossil fuel projects in Africa. This means that to keep their nations energized, African governments will have little choice but to partner with China. This generation of Africans have a battle on their hands. Like Nkrumah, Mandela, Sankara, Garvey, King, Ahmed Ben Bella, Malcolm and Winnie Madikizela Mandela, we will continue fighting these battles. We will push back harder; we will not let anyone silence and destroy the future of Africans. The God of our ancestors is with us and we are wearing the armor and winning the war. \</doc>

By Cecilia Ologunagba The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) has said overwhelming flooding has affected no fewer than 27.7 million children across 27 countries worldwide. According to the UN agency, the number of children affected by flooding in Chad, Gambia, Pakistan and northeast Bangladesh is the highest in over 30 years. UNICEF, in statement on Tuesday said that a large majority of the children affected were among the most vulnerable . It stated that rolling disasters were straining the ability of governments and the international community to respond, given the enormous scale of need. "With millions of children at severe risk of starvation, disease, exploitation and death, the agency is calling for delegates at COP27 to commit to funding to protect children from the devastating effects of a changing climate.'' UNICEF says that this year, floods have contributed to the increased spread of major killers of children, such as malnutrition, malaria, cholera and diarrhoea, and that the aftermath of floods is often more deadly for children than the extreme weather events that caused the flooding. For instance, an estimated 840,000 children were displaced by floods in Nigeria in recent months. In South Sudan, 95 UNICEF-supported nutrition sites have been affected by floods, hampering the delivery of life-saving and preventative malnutrition services for 92,000 children. Related News Heavy rains and flooding in Yemen triggered floods causing extensive damage to shelters in displacement sites. Up to 73,854 households were affected and 24,000 households have been displaced. Children make their way home through contaminated floodwater in Jacobabad, Sindh province, Pakistan. " COP27 provides an opportunity to chart a credible roadmap with clear milestones for finance for climate adaptation and solutions for loss and damage," Paloma Escudero, UNICEF's Director of Global Communications and Advocacy, said. She added that youngsters "from the most affected places on Earth are drowning in climate inaction. Enough is enough. Lives are on the line children need action now." As well as pressing governments and big business to rapidly reduce emissions, UNICEF is urging leaders to take immediate action to safeguard children from climate devastation by adapting the critical social services they rely upon. Adaptation measures, like creating water, health and education systems that stand up to flooding and drought, will save lives. Paloma Escudero said that "without urgent action, many more vulnerable children and young people will lose their lives in the days and weeks to come. "Without climate action, hundreds of millions more will almost certainly suffer like those in Pakistan." (NAN) (www. nannews.ng) CIA/SH \</doc>

Download logo President Uhuru Kenyatta has underscored the need for urgent measures to protect and manage oceans in a sustainable way for present and future generations. The President emphasized that the conservation of oceans, seas and marine resources can no longer be left out of the broader environment and climate change agenda. "When we started this conversation that oceans needed to be part of our agenda or mainstreaming oceans in the overall environment and climate agenda, we did so because oceans are a very critical part of the livelihoods of millions of people across the globe," President Kenyatta said. Speaking on Friday during a high-level side event dubbed 'Road to Lisbon' held on the margins of the Stockholm+50 international meeting, the President said Kenya is keen to take the lead and join the global action on conservation and sustainable use of the oceans. The 'Road to Lisbon' side event, moderated by Foreign Affairs Principal Secretary Amb. Macharia Kamau, was part of the build-up engagements to mobilize participation and enhance awareness to build momentum towards the 2nd UN Oceans Conference that Kenya and Portugal will co-host in Lisbon later this month. President Kenyatta encouraged delegates at the Stockholm+50 meeting to partner with Kenya and Portugal as they co-host the oceans conference. "For us, we see Stockholm+50 where we are today and we see Portugal where we shall be in a few weeks time as basically a road that is leading to Egypt (where the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference will be held) in a few months. "We see an Egypt that will not be a talk-show but hopefully an Egypt where all of us can stand firmly together and demand that those with ears and eyes but refuse to see must hear. We must have action if we desire to protect our future," President Kenyatta said. Speaking at the meeting, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Executive Director Inger Andersen said the triple planetary crisis of climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss has plunged oceans into deep trouble that requires humanity to join hands and urgently address. On his part, Portugal Minister for Environment and Climate Action Duarte Cordeiro said the 2nd UN Oceans Conference will, among other things, be a crosscutting universal forum to build a bond and create synergies to scale up action and support ambitious oceans-based solutions. Swedish Minister for International Development Cooperation Matilda Ernkrans said managing oceans in a sustainable, firm and inclusive way will be a major step to reaching the 2030 agenda. "The ocean is an ally in the fight against climate change. It hosts the solutions to poverty, food security and gender equality. And there is hope. Last year at COP26, we succeeded in integrating ocean-based action into the agreement," Ms Ernkrans said. Environment Cabinet Secretary Keriako Tobiko, Deputy Chief of Staff in charge of Policy and Strategy Dr. Ruth Kagia, Principal Secretaries Nancy Kagirithu (Shipping and Maritime) and Charles Sunkuli (Youth Affairs) also attended the meeting. Later, President Kenyatta met members of the Kenya chapter of the Stockholm+50 Youth Task Force where he challenged them to take the lead in environmental conservation and curbing the challenges of climate change. The President said necessary policies and programmes have to be implemented now to reverse the effects of climate change, oceans as well as ensure the encroaching desertification that is threatening the country is stopped. During the meeting, the youth presented to the President a policy paper regarding their stand on the decade of eco-system restoration, Covid-19 recovery and the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 16. \</doc>

The report reveals that cumulative adaptation finance to 2030 will come to less than one-quarter of the estimated needs stated by African countries in their National Determined Contributions (NDCs) unless more funding for climate adaptation is secured. In 2019 and 2020 an estimated $11.4 billion was committed to climate adaptation finance in Africa with more than 97% of the funds coming from public actors and less than 3% from private sectors. This is significantly less than the $52.7 billion annually to 2030 it is estimated African countries will need. To increase the volume and efficacy of\\xa0 adaptation finance flows to Africa over the coming decade, the report makes a number of recommendations: Financial institutions must mainstream resilience into investments they are making. Policy makers and other stakeholders must build the enabling environment for adaptation investment. Financial innovation for adaptation must match country-level policy and market conditions. Professor Patrick Verkooijen, CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation, commenting on the report findings said: "Adaptation finance is scaling too slowly to close the investment gap in Africa, even as the costs of inaction rise. As we look forward to COP27 , we must generate a breakthrough on finance for climate adaptation. The Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program endorsed by the African Union, is the best vehicle we have to ensure the adaptation investment shortfall in Africa is met with action from all available sources including the private sector." Speaking during the launch event for the report, Amina Mohammed, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations said: " COP27 must be a turning point. Developed countries must put forward credible plans to double adaptation finance to reach 40 billion dollars a year by 2025. The Secretary-General has called for a new business model to deliver adaptation finance by turning adaptation priorities into pipelines of investment for projects." Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank Group said: "At the Global Center on Adaptation, they are doing incredible work in mapping out what the needs are, mapping out how to make climate resilient infrastructure.

By Vivian Emoni The Global Initiative for Food Security and Ecosystem Preservation (GIFSEP), in collaboration with Civil Society Organisations, have called for concrete action to address climate change for climate justice in the country. The Executive Director of the GIFSEP, Mr David Terungwa, gave the call at the Africa Climate Caravan and Art competition by 19 schools in the FCT on Tuesday in Abuja. Terugwa said that the event was organised by the GIFSEP and supported by Oxfarm. He said that the demand for climate justice became necessary, considering the upcoming UNFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), COP27 , which would take place from Nov. 6 to 18 in Egypt. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the UNFCCC, COP27 was a conference where countries come together to take action towards achieving the world`s collective climate goals and its impact. Terungwa said that the climate caravan was an initiative of Oxfam in Nigeria as part of the African Climate Caravan, bringing CSOs and climate impacted communities together, demanding for concrete climate action. He said that the climate justice was to promote equity and ensure access to basic resources and for young people to live, learn, play and work in healthy and clean environment. According to him, the aim of the event is to unite all the CSOs in Africa to show that it is important that we demand for climate justice, considering the impact of climate change on the continent. "This is a very important issue, the art competition displayed by the students shows that the students are not ignorant of the climate change impact in the country. "We call on the government to go beyond signing agreements and policy statements without real action on the ground. "We lost over 600 people to flood, with farms and farm lands washed away, so many households are still living in Internally Displaced Camps, with very slow response. "It is an issue of climate finance, enough funds need to be released during the international negotiations, COP27 , to tackle all of these challenges," he said. The executive director said that the government had been signatory to the UNFCCC Paris Agreement and had signed the Climate Change Act into law, adding that it was a great achievement. He, however, said that Nigeria was lacking action and strong implementation of policies. Terungwa said that more than a hundred African CSOs were currently traveling across 28 countries, including Nigeria to Egypt, to present their joint declaration. He added that the country's participants were expecting their heads of state and government to defend the interests of their own populations. "In particularly, by supporting the agro-ecological transition and protecting the rights of farming communities. "We must as well emphasise on the request for promoting better representation of youth and women in decision-making bodies. "We are also calling on the developed countries to live up to their climate commitments from the Paris Agreement," he said. The Climate Justice Coordinator for Oxfarm, Mr Kenneth Akpan, said that the programme was a collection of CSO's across each countries in African. "There was a need for coming together to have a unified opinion to approach the climate change table, to amplify the voices of Africans, particularly the vulnerable. "We all know that Africans suffer more of this climate change which has been leading to loss of lives and damage of property," he said. Akpan said that Nigeria needed at least, N100 billion to approach and tackle the flood issues. He said that there were many commitments by the government to put in place to ensure that the climate change law was being implemented but there were still more efforts to be done. Miss Oluomachukwu Okafor, from Government Girls School, Dutse, who spoke on behalf of other students, said that the art work displayed by the schools was all about the effect and impact of climate change in the environment. "The art shows that climate change is living already with us and must have urgent attention to address it effectively," she said.

The Federal Government on Thursday said a report by the inter-governmental panel on climate change revealed that many coastal mega cities including Lagos, Port Harcourt and others, would witness weather catastrophe by 2050. It, however, stated that it was taking steps to mitigate this through the provision of information on future actions required by cities that projected to be affected by the climate change effects. The Minister of Environment, Mohammed Abdullahi, disclosed this during a side event on "Scaling up Climate Change Adaptation in Nigeria", organised by the Federal Ministry Environment in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, at the ongoing COP27 event in Egypt. This minister's remarks were contained in a statement that was made available to our correspondent by the FME in Abuja on Thursday. The statement read in part, "Abdullahi, quoting the report of the\\xa0 inter-governmental panel on climate change, affirmed that by 2050 many coastal mega cities like Lagos, Port Harcourt and other low line coastal cities in Nigeria will in a century witness weather catastrophe every year affecting millions of people and properties and causing devastation. "Consequently, Nigeria has taken bold step to develop the adaptation communication guided by the NAP (National Adaptation Plan) Global Network. "The adaptation communication will play central role in identifying national needs and enable international follow up while informing future action, driving ambition and contributing information for the global stock taking." \\xa0Abdullahi stated that it obvious that the challenges of climate change were enormous, adding that no individual ministry could confront the challenges alone. "We are calling for joint and cooperative efforts to tackle the problem, it is therefore pertinent that we begin to take our pledges into action as take away from COP27 ," he stated. On her part, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Farouq, said the Federal Government would scale up climate change adaption in Nigeria through her ministry. Farouq said her ministry would work with the Nigerian Adaptation Plan to reduce the vulnerability of communities to the impact of climate change by building adaptive capacity and resilience. She stated that the plan also advocated integration of climate change adaptation into relevant new and existing policies, programmes and activities, as well as developing planning process and strategies. "The reason we are here today is to harness and discourse good practices, programmes and strategies that other countries are using to reduce vulnerabilities to climate change," she stated. \</doc>

President Muhammadu Buhari has said Nigeria's rapid transition to renewable energy will result in significant job creation with up to 340,000 jobs created by 2030 and up to 840,000 jobs created by 2060. The President said this at a Leaders' Closed-Door Meeting on Climate Change, which held on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. The meeting was convened by the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Antonio Guterres, before the commencement of the COP27 in November this year. Buhari renewed the commitment of Nigeria towards ensuring that there was a rapid and strategic transition to renewable energy in response to the world-wide efforts for the preservation of the environment. He stressed that his administration had, in August this year, launched a home-grown, data-backed, multi-pronged energy transition plan, which is the country's framework in achieving net-zero emissions by 2060. The President, while speaking on some of the details in the plan, said that through the use of emerging technologies and alternative fuels such as hydrogen, bioenergy and waste-to-energy, a pathway would be created for accelerated decarburization of energy systems and harnessing of new and diverse technologies towards low carbon development while aligning to our broader developmental aspirations in a fair and just manner. He said, "the plan also sets out a timeline and framework for the attainment of emissions reduction across five key sectors: power, cooking, oil and gas, transport and industry," adding that, "gas will play a critical role as a transition fuel in Nigeria's net-zero pathway, particularly in the power and cooking sectors. "The clean energy goals of the plan include modernizing the power sector with large-scale integration of renewable energy, enhancing energy efficiency and conservation; and is expected to generate 250 gigawatts of installed energy capacity with over 90% made up of renewables." President Buhari, in a statement issued by his spokesman, Femi Adesina, said a careful implementation would create significant investment opportunities as it will engender the establishment and expansion of industries related to solar energy, hydrogen and electric vehicles. He commended Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi for his tireless efforts in the preparations for the COP27 and assured him of the support of the Nigerian Government. \</doc>

Africa is facing a critical shortfall in funding for climate adaptation with cumulative adaptation finance to 2030 coming to less than one-quarter of the estimated needs stated by African countries in their National Determined Contributions (NDCs) unless more funding for climate adaptation is secured. According to a new report entitled: State and Trends in Adaptation in Africa 2022, launched by the Global Center on Adaptation yesterday, in 2019 and 2020 an estimated $11.4 billion was committed to climate adaptation finance in Africa with more than 97per cent of the funds coming from public actors and less than three per cent from private sectors. This is significantly less than the $52.7 billion annually to 2030 it is estimated African countries will need. To increase the volume and efficacy of adaptation finance flows to Africa over the coming decade, the report said financial institutions must mainstream resilience into investments they are making while policy makers and other stakeholders must build the enabling environment for adaptation investment. The report also said financial innovation for adaptation must match country-level policy and market conditions. Speaking on the new report, CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation, Prof Patrick Verkooijen, said: 'Adaptation finance is scaling too slowly to close the investment gap in Africa, even as the costs of inaction rise. As we look forward to COP27 , we must generate a breakthrough on finance for climate adaptation. The Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program endorsed by the African Union, is the best vehicle we have to ensure the adaptation investment shortfall in Africa is met with action from all available sources including the private sector.' Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Amina Mohammed, also said COP27 must be a turning point. Developed countries must put forward credible plans to double adaptation finance to reach $40 billion a year by 2025. 'The Secretary-General has called for a new business model to deliver adaptation finance by turning adaptation priorities into pipelines of investment for projects,' she added. President, African Development Bank Group, Akinwumi Adesina, said the Centre is doing a great job by mapping out what needs to be done. 'At the Global Center on Adaptation, they are doing incredible work in mapping out what the needs are, mapping out how to make climate resilient infrastructure. Already the Upstream [Financing] Facility at the Global Center on Adaptation is doing so much analytical work to support countries to build climate resilience into infrastructure, into agriculture and to mainstream climate financing into national bodies but also into the financing of large multilateral development banks,' Akinwumi said.

Download logo UN Human Rights High Commissioner Volker T&uuml;rk on Tuesday appealed for Egypt to free a prominent blogger and activist whose life is in imminent danger following a seven-month hunger strike, that has escalated with the start of the COP27 climate summit being hosted there. Alaa Abdel Fattah has been arrested many times over more than decade for his activism around violations perpetrated by the security forces and the use of military courts to try civilians. &ldquo;I urge the Government to immediately release Abdel Fattah from prison and provide him with the necessary medical treatment,&rdquo; Mr. T&uuml;rk said in a statement. Multiple arrests Mr. Abdel Fattah, 40, is a dual British and Egyptian citizen. The pro-democracy activist was sentenced to five years' imprisonment in 2015 and released in March 2019, but arrested again that September. He was then held in pre-trial detention for two years before being sentenced in December 2021 for another five years on charges of publishing false news. In great danger Mr. Abdel Fattah began the hunger strike in April, severely limiting his calorie intake, but stepped it up on 1 November. He then stopped drinking water this past Sunday, the first day of the COP27 climate action conference, which is taking place in the Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh. &ldquo;Abdel Fattah is in great danger. His dry hunger strike puts his life at acute risk,&rdquo; said Mr. T&uuml;rk. &ldquo;My Office and other UN Human Rights Mechanisms have raised Abdel Fattah's case and the cases of other individuals arbitrarily deprived of their liberty and incarcerated after unfair trials on multiple occasion.&rdquo; Release all detainees The UN rights chief noted that the resumption of Egypt's Presidential Pardon Committee had resulted in numerous people being released. The Committee was established in 2016 and reviews cases of prisoners held for political crimes, according to media reports. Mr. T&uuml;rk urged the authorities to fulfill their human rights obligations and immediately release all persons who have been arbitrarily detained, including those in pre-trial detention, as well as individuals who have been unfairly convicted. &ldquo;No one should be detained for exercising their basic human rights or defending those of others,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I also encourage the authorities to revise all laws that restrict civic space and curtail the rights to freedom of expression, assembly and association.&rdquo; Against reprisals The High Commissioner also warned about possible reprisals against people supporting human rights activists, in particular Mr. Abdel Fattah's family, who are in Egypt demanding his release. He reminded the Egyptian Government of its responsibility to protect the rights and security of all people within its jurisdiction. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of UN News.

What was less observed was that the summit faced a major additional obstacle in 2022. This year, the climate crisis was overshadowed by the war in Ukraine which has been the foreign policy priority of the United States and the European Union since the beginning of Russia's invasion in February. The difference between the way the world's richest countries responded to the Ukraine war and the carbon war on our whole planet is undoubtedly stark. Since the beginning of Russia's invasion, the US and its NATO allies provided Ukraine with military assistance worth more than $25bn, welcomed nearly seven million refugees, and willingly absorbed severe economic shocks caused by energy price increases triggered by the war. Despite a global recession looming on the horizon, these countries did not hesitate to increase their military expenditure. Germany allocated 100 billion euros ($104bn) of its 2022 budget for the armed forces, for example, and the US House of Representatives approved a record $840bn military spending. Yet at COP27 After many years of pressure, at COP27 , nations finally agreed to create a loss and damage mechanism to provide funds to impoverished countries suffering severe climate impacts, but it is so far just an empty pot. The accelerated arms race that has emerged since the Russian invasion and rising US-China tensions signal that filling that pot will not be a priority for most wealthy nations in the near future. These spending choices matter not just because they are diverting resources from urgently needed climate action, but also because every dollar spent on the military is worsening the climate crisis. Most militaries consume significant amounts of fossil fuels. One estimate calculates that military emissions may make up 5.5 percent of global emissions. If the global military were a country, it would be the fourth biggest emitter in the world, ahead of Russia. Furthermore, most of the world's military spending goes towards the purchase of equipment and vehicles that are among the worst offenders when it comes to carbon emissions. In 2022 alone, for example, 475 new F-35 fighter jets, which use a whopping 5,600 litres (1,480 gallons) of oil per hour of flight, have been ordered. These fuel-guzzling planes could be flying for the next 30 years. The emissions increase even further when war breaks out. The Ukrainian government at COP27 presented research showing that the first eight months of war had already led to 33 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, equivalent to adding 16 million cars to the United Kingdom's roads for two years. US and UK military chiefs argue that they are committed to reducing military emissions, but their plans so far remain undetailed, opaque and unconvincing. Adding solar panels to a military base is easy to do, but does nothing to tackle the main challenge, which is fossil fuel consumption by military jets, ships and tanks. For now, there is no alternative, green fuel that can be produced at the scale needed and without triggering unacceptable social and environmental consequences, such as increased deforestation and the dispossession of Indigenous peoples. The uncomfortable truth is that there is no way of ensuring that our planet remains habitable in the long term while continuing to increase military spending. In the midst of an intense and brutal war in Ukraine, this fact is too easily lost as governments are able to justify any increases in military spending to deal with the new immediate 'threats'. Moreover, the military spending of many rich countries is already way out of proportion to any real or perceived threat. NATO member states, for example, already spend 17 times as much on the military as Russia. The US spends more on its military than the next nine countries combined. Meanwhile, the world has an ever smaller window to tackle climate change - the most pressing threat to our collective future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says the world must cut emissions by 45 percent by 2030 to have any chance at keeping global average temperature increases below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). When every month counts, embarking on an accelerated arms race is the worst path the world's most powerful nations can take. It diverts money and attention from urgent climate action, it increases emissions and it fuels conflicts at a time of increased climate instability. Climate change can teach us a critical lesson about security. Carbon emissions do not recognise borders. It is not possible for any nation to shield itself from the effects of climate change using tanks or fighter jets. The only way to tackle the climate emergency is through global cooperation. Demilitarisation and peace are the best and perhaps the only ways to ensure that humanity has the capacity and resilience to respond to this crisis. Only if the world's leaders recognise that uniting to confront the threat of global heating is more important than any imperialist strategy or narrow economic interest, may we have a chance to avoid climate catastrophe. A secure nation in the end depends on a secure planet. \</doc>

85 insurers make pledge to extend climate cover Comes as COP27 talks focus on issue of loss and damage African Climate Risk Facility to cover 1.4 bln people SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Nov 9 - A group of over 85 insurers in Africa has pledged to create a financing facility to provide $14 billion of cover to help the continent's most vulnerable communities deal with climate disaster risks such as floods and droughts. The commitment to create the African Climate Risk Facility (ACRF) was made on Wednesday during the COP27 climate talks comes as developing countries push their richer peers to do more to help them pay for the costs of responding to such events. Demand for compensation for the 'loss and damage' caused by global warming has long been rejected by wealthy countries, whose leaders are wary of accepting liability for the emissions driving climate change. Africa, which accounts for less than 4% of greenhouse gas emissions, has long been expected to be severely impacted by climate change. Against that backdrop, the African insurance plan is based around creating a scalable, local market-based funding tool to help countries better manage the financial risk of climate shocks and increase the resilience of its more vulnerable communities, the group said in a statement. 'This is the African insurance industry saying let's come together and try and solve this ourselves,' said Kelvin Massingham, director risk and resilience at FSD Africa, one of the partners behind the launch. 'We have a massive risk gap in Africa and existing solutions aren't working,' Massingham said. FSD Africa is a UK government-backed development group. The ACRF will provide protection for 1.4 billion people against floods, droughts and tropical cyclones by providing $14 billion of climate risk insurance by 2030 to African sovereigns, cities, humanitarian organisations and NGOs, the insurers said. The group is calling for $900 million in funding from development partners and philanthropies to support the project, much of which will go towards providing a subsidy on the cost of the premium to help governments and cities with limited fiscal resources buy the cover. These donor funds will be held in a trust and managed by the African Development Bank. 'The facility will enable us to cover certain risks like floods, cyclones and droughts...and to help us mitigate the risks we face as underwriters dealing with these climate risks,' said Philip Lopokoiyit, chief executive at Nairobi-based insurer ICEA LION Group. The insurance commitment is the first from the 85 signatories of the Nairobi Declaration on Sustainable Insurance, signed in April 2021 by the industry to support the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. The ACRF will provide a domestically funded alternative to global initiatives like the World Bank's Global Risk Financing Facility and the Global Shield Financing Facility, a new funding facility that will help countries that suffer heavy economic loss due to climate change-driven disasters, announced by World Bank president David Malpass on Tuesday.

Nigeria, Nov. 10 -- The Nigerian government on Thursday launched a new tree-planting tagged: "Project 250k". The new initiative which was disclosed by the Minister of Youth and Sport, Sunday Dare, said it targets the youth as part of efforts to get them involved in the country's fight against the devastating impacts of climate change in Nigeria. Mr Dare said this while making his remarks at an event titled: "Youth and Climate Change," at the Nigerian pavilion in Egypt. The event is part of the activities marking the ongoing Conference of Parties in the North African country. "We are launching a 250K project. This means we will be engaging 250,000 youths across the country, to plant 250,000 trees," the minister said. He said the initiative will ensure that youths are paid for every tree planted and nurtured over the years. "We have secured global partners already," he added. The minister said the goal of the initiative is not just about tree planting but the awareness that would be generated. "These people (youths) that plant the trees would also become ambassadors of Climate Change and then they can help spread the awareness and the information that is needed," Mr Dare said. The minister noted that a lot of activities are tied around the initiative and that his ministry is working with strategy implementation partners to actualise the goal of the initiative. He said:"We would work very closely with the ministry of environment and relevant agencies." Thursday at the ongoing COP27 was dedicated to marking "Youth and Future Generation Day." It created an atmosphere that helped to broaden the narrative around Africa as a hub of opportunities and innovative solutions, highlighting how youth are collaboratively driving action towards achieving climate justice and intergenerational equity. "The impacts of climate change have significant effects on the health, nutrition, education and the future of young people, meanwhile youth standg to be the most impacted by the decisions we take at the climate process. Thus, they should be considered a natural ally and partner in driving climate action ," said COP27 President Sameh Shoukry during his recent visit to the Children and Youth Pavilion. He said: "Ensuring that the youth are represented and have a seat at the table is of absolute importance as it is their future lives and livelihoods that are directly impacted with the implementation of climate commitments." For Nigeria, Mr Dare described the youths as important "foot soldiers" when it comes to planting trees. By the sheer number and population of the youth, the minister said they are an important conveyor belt of passing the climate change message around climate change. "More importantly, because of their innovative mindsets, they are solutions providers," the minister added. The minister said the youth that would be participating in the tree planting project will be placed on stipends throughout the initiative.

The United Kingdom (UK) has approved a \Â£395 million Propcom+ investment that is set to benefit at least 4 million Nigerians, including 2 million women, to increase productivity and adapt to the effects of climate change while at the same time reducing emissions. Propcom+ builds on the UK government's investment in agriculture through the Propcom Mai-karfi programme in Nigeria. This new \Â£395 million Propcom+ programme is set to help address key barriers to sustainable agricultural development in Nigeria. It will support the development of climate-resilient agricultural policies, actions, and investments that deliver nutrition, increase productivity, adapt and build resilience while reducing emissions, and protect and restore natural ecosystems. For example, through the adoption and scaling of practices such as heat and flood tolerant crop varieties and integrated soil fertility management. The package was unveiled by UK Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh Egypt. The new Propcom+ programme involves supporting inclusive and resilient growth by promoting the progressive transformation of Nigeria's rural economy. The new programme will build the capacity of small-scale farmers and rural communities in climate smart agriculture. It will work with Nigeria's vibrant private sector on agriculture to increase productivity, improve nutrition and food security, enhance climate resilience, pursue lower emissions and halt and reverse biodiversity loss, as well as helping to tackle some of Nigeria's underlying drivers of conflict and insecurity. Speaking on the initiative, Cleverly said: 'The Glasgow Climate Pact gave the world the tools to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees and build a secure and sustainable future. Now is the time for all countries to step up their action on climate change and deliver the tangible change needed. The UK will continue to play a leading role in this mission. The funding we have announced will support countries which are facing the devastating impact of climate change, to adapt effectively.' Also commenting on the fresh funding, UK Deputy High Commissioner in Lagos, Nigeria, Ben Llewellyn-Jones said Nigeria is extremely vulnerable to climate change and land degradation. Climate risks are increasing, diminishing productive capacity and contributing to worsening food insecurity. Farmers are on the front line and highly dependent on seasonal rainfall making them increasingly vulnerable to the changing and unpredictable climate.

President Muhammadu Buhari has hit Western country for majority of the effects of climate change in Africa even as he rapped them for failing to take responsibility for the climate disasters in Africa. In an opinion authored by the president and published on Washington Post, he recalled that in 2009, developed countries most responsible for global warming pledged to give $100 billion annually by 2020 to help developing nations deal with its consequences. But the commitment has still not been met, generating mistrust and reluctance among some developing nations to accelerate their emissions reductions. Buhari described the failure of the Western leaders to meet their commitments to the $100 billion fund as hypocritical as most of the emissions come from their industries situated in Africa. "Many of my peers are frustrated with Western hypocrisy and its inability to take responsibility. "Governments have repeatedly failed to meet their commitments to the $100 billion fund for climate adaptation and mitigation in the developing world  for the mess their own industries caused. "According to the United Nations, Africa is the continent worst affected by climate change despite contributing the least to it. Even though the COP27 's agenda notes the need for compensation for loss and damages (as distinct from adaptation and mitigation funding), that demand has mostly been met with silence in the West." Buhari accused the Western leaders of leeching on the continent's natural resources and leaving its citizens out of the benefits. He decried the injustice meted out on Africa, saying the actions give off the impression that Africans do not deserve a right to energy. "Don't tell Africans they can't use their own resources. If Africa were to use all its known reserves of natural gas  the cleanest transitional fossil fuel  its share of global emissions would rise from a mere 3 percent to 3.5 percent," Buhari said. "We are not the problem. Don't tell the poorest in the world that their marginal energy use will break the carbon budget  only to sign off on new domestic permits for oil and gas exploration. It gives the impression your citizens have more of a right to energy than Africans. "When you realize you need Africa's reserves, don't cut its citizens out of the benefits. In the wake of the Ukraine war, there has been a resurgence of interest in Africa's gas. But this impulse is coming from Western companies  backed by their governments  who are interested only in extracting these resources and then exporting them to Europe. "Western development has unleashed climate catastrophe on my continent. Now, the rich countries' green policies dictate that Africans should remain poor for the greater good. To compound the injustice, Africa's hydrocarbons will be exploited after all  just not for Africans. "The Western countries are unable to take politically difficult decisions that hurt domestically. Instead, they move the problem offshore, essentially dictating that the developing world must swallow the pill too bitter for their own voters' palates. Africa didn't cause the mess, yet we pay the price. At this year's COP, that should be the starting point for all negotiations." At the ongoing COP27 in Egypt, the United Kingdom had said Nigeria will get a \Â£395 million investment fund to support climate-resilient agriculture (CRA) in the country. \</doc>

President Muhammadu Buhari has restated the commitment of the Nigerian government towards ensuring that there is a rapid and strategic transition to renewable energy. He said this would be in response to the world-wide efforts for the preservation of the environment. Mr Femi Adesina, the President's media aide, said in a statement on Thurday that Buhari was speaking at a\~Leaders' Closed-Door Meeting on Climate Change\~convened by the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Antonio Guterres. The meeting, according to Adesina, is coming before the commencement of the COP27 in November this year, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, in New York, United States. At the meeting, the Nigerian leader stressed that his administration had, in August this year, launched a home-grown, data-backed, multi-pronged energy transition plan. He highlighted some of the details in the plan, saying it's the country's framework in achieving net-zero emissions by 2060. The president said that through the use of emerging technologies and alternative fuels such as hydrogen, bioenergy and waste-to-energy, a pathway would be created for accelerated decarburization of energy systems and harnessing of new and diverse technologies. According to him, this is aimed at ensuring low carbon development while aligning to our broader developmental aspirations in a fair and just manner. Speaking further, the Nigerian leader said: "The plan also sets out a timeline and framework for the attainment of emissions reduction across five key sectors: power, cooking, oil and gas, transport and industry." The president affirmed that gas would play a critical role as a transition fuel in Nigeria's net-zero pathway, particularly in the power and cooking sectors. "The clean energy goals of the plan include modernizing the power sector with large-scale integration of renewable energy, enhancing energy efficiency and conservation. "This is expected to generate 250 gigawatts of installed energy capacity with over 90% made up of renewables." While expressing his confidence that the plan would put the nation on the path of prosperity, Buhari said that a careful implementation would create significant investment opportunities. He said it would also engender the establishment and expansion of industries related to solar energy, hydrogen and electric vehicles. "It will guide Nigeria's rapid transition to renewable energy and result in significant\~ job creation with up to 340,000 jobs created by 2030 and up to 840,000 jobs created by 2060 driven mainly by power, cooking and transport sectors," he added. He commended Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi for his tireless efforts in the preparations for the COP27 and\~ assured him of the support of the Nigerian Government. (NAN) \</doc>

African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) President Benedict Okey Oramah will receive the African Energy Chamber's inaugural African Energy Person of the Year during African Energy Week ( HYPERLINK http://www.AECWeek.com www.AECWeek.com ) 2022 in Cape Town in October. The African Energy Person of the Year Award recognizes an individual who has been influential or prominent in Africa's energy industry during the year or has championed Africa and its energy sector Dr Oramah, an outstanding advocate for the continent and for a just African energy transition, is a natural choice for this award. In an era when fossil fuels funding are being restricted by wealthy nations, Benedict Oramah has been doing everything he can to strengthen Africa's oil and gas industry. He understands that our oil and gas resources are still very much needed to eradicate our continent's widespread energy poverty and create a pathway to a better economic future. Oramah, who holds a doctorate degree in agricultural economics, has been president and chairman of the board of directors of Afreximbank since 2015. Prior to beginning his career with Afreximbank in 1994, he was an assistant research manager at the Nigerian Export Bank. Oramah is a published author and a frequent speaker at trade finance conferences around the world. In May, he was named African Banker of the Year (for the second time) in recognition of his leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Oramah is untiring in his work on behalf of the continent. Under his guidance, Afreximbank distributed more than $7 billion to African countries during the pandemic so they were able to meet their people's health needs and address COVID-19's devastating impact on African economies. Not only that, Afreximbank guaranteed the procurement of 400 million doses of Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines, enough to vaccinate 30% of the continent's population." Dr Oramah works equally hard to empower African governments, businesses, and communities to realize a more stable, prosperous future. In his role as Afrexibank's president, he strives to de-risk transactions in Africa through medium- and long-term guarantee programs and is an outspoken voice on behalf of increased intra-African trade. Because Dr Oramah recognizes that Africa's energy sector still have important roles to play in building stronger, more resilient African countries, he continues to find ways to support a strong African sector &mdash; a healthy mix of oil, gas, and renewable sources. That became readily apparent in 2021, when Africa tried to convince the international community to respect the continent's priorities, a plea that seemed to fall on deaf ears. During the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, more than 20 countries and financial institutions pledged to stop public financing for overseas fossil fuel projects. Foreign investment in African oil and gas projects was rapidly drying up, and we at the chamber felt the only way forward was an African solution. We started calling for an African energy bank that would finance the continent's energy projects and allow African nations to transition from fossil fuels to renewables on their own timetable. Dr. Oramah immediately put his support behind that idea. That support helped pave the way for Afreximbank and the African Petroleum Producers Organization (APPO) to sign a memorandum of understanding in May 2022 and agree to collaborate on the establishment of an African Energy Transition Bank. "These are challenging times when we must strive to strike the right balance between the imperatives of mitigating climate change and the urgency of averting social upheavals as a result of increasingly difficult economic and financial conditions in Africa," Dr Oramah said at the time. His cooperation with APPO was one of many ways Dr Oramah has shown himself to be a true champion of the continent's energy sector. Under Dr. Oramah's direction, Afreximbank has repeatedly helped national oil companies get the funding they need. Just this year, Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited secured a $5 billion corporate finance commitment from Afreximbank, financing that will support major, and critically needed, investments in Nigeria's upstream sector. Oramah has been a voice of reason during a critical time for Africa's energy sector. He has clearly stated that balance is the key to a just energy transition, one that moves the world closer to its net-zero ambitions, and at the same time, gives Africa the same opportunities to capitalize on its petroleum reserves as other countries have realized. The African Energy Chamber is proud to recognize Dr. Oramah, a champion for Africa and a role model for Africans. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Week (AEW).

The Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency has said it will create three additional zonal offices to increase its intervention in environmental practices among residents of the state. The General Manager, Dr Dolapo Fasawe, made this known, according to a statement on Sunday, during the last management meeting for the year with senior members of the agency's staff at Alausa, Ikeja. Fasawe said the move was in tandem with the vision of the agency to increase its zonal offices to 20 by 2023 to tackle pollution in different parts of the state. She said, "To effectively serve and reach out to larger society, we increased our zonal offices from four to 20 in a spate of four years. This noble move is to reduce bureaucratic hurdles and also improve response time. "There is the need to bring environmental regulation closer to Lagosians in response to the goal of COP27 , which emphasises the urgent need to unite the world to tackle climate change. The additional three zonal offices are Mushin, Alimosho 3, and Kosofe and necessary equipment and manpower have been in place to facilitate the smooth running of these offices." \</doc>

Costs for renewables continued to fall in 2021 as supply chain challenges and rising commodity prices have yet to show their full impact on project costs. The cost of electricity from onshore wind fell by 15%, offshore wind by 13% and solar PV by 13% compared to 2020. This provides a fillip to increased climate ambition ahead of COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in November, opening up additional space for governments to submit more ambitious climate action plans - crucial to reach the central Paris Agreement goal of holding global average temperature rise to a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius. A report, Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2021, published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) earlier this month, shows that almost two-thirds or 163 gigawatts (GW) of newly installed renewable power in 2021 had lower costs than the world's cheapest coal-fired option in the G20. IRENA estimates that, given the current high fossil fuel prices, the renewable power added in 2021 saved around USD 55 billion from global energy generation costs in 2022. IRENA's new report confirms the critical role that cost-competitive renewables play in addressing today's energy and climate emergencies by accelerating the transition in line with the 1.5\'b0C warming limit and the Paris Agreement goals. Solar and wind energy, with their relatively short project lead times, represent vital planks in countries' efforts to swiftly reduce, and eventually phase out, fossil fuels and limit the macroeconomic damages they cause in pursuit of net zero. 'Renewables are by far the cheapest form of power today,' Francesco La Camera, Director-General of IRENA said. '2022 is a stark example of just how economically viable new renewable power generation has become. Renewable power frees economies from volatile fossil fuel prices and imports, curbs energy costs and enhances market resilience - even more so if today's energy crunch continues.' 'While a temporary crisis response might be necessary in the current situation, excuses to soften climate goals will not hold mid-to-long-term. Today's situation is a devastating reminder that renewables and energy saving are the future. With the COP27 in Egypt and COP28 in the UAE ahead, renewables provide governments with affordable energy to align with net zero and turn their climate promises into concrete action with real benefits for people on the ground,' he added. \</doc>

The Federal Government has said Nigeria will require $1.9trn or N834trn to attain net zero by 2060 as part of its support to the global fight against climate change and meeting the country's Energy Transition Plan. A document on the Energy Transition Plan obtained by The PUNCH on Sunday said Nigeria would require $1.9trn to get to net zero by 2060,\\xa0 including $410bn above projected usual spending, which translates to about $10bn or N4trn annually over the coming decades. To kickstart the implementation of the plan, the Federal Government said Nigeria would raise an initial $10bn support package ahead of the COP27 holding in Egypt, adding that a $23bn investment opportunity had also been identified based on current in-country programmes and projected that were directly related to just the energy transition. According to the document, there would be incremental investments from 2021 through 2060 to attain the plan. A breakdown of the required spending by sector shows that $135bn will be spent in the infrastructure sector, while $150bn is to be spent on the power sector. Also, $12bn will be expended on the oil and gas sector; $21bn on industry; $79bn on the cooking sector; and $12bn on the transport sector. \</doc>

NIGERIAN government has been urged to be less dependent on fossil fuels and focus more on alternatives. This among others was made known by a group of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) at a media briefing organized in Lagos by Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA), which was tagged: 'Expectations after the End of Climate Change Conference.' According to the Executive Director, CAPPA, Akinbode Oluwafemi, this year's COP could not be termed African COP because of its mere geographical location, as Africans could not attend due to diverse restrictions while the corridors of the COP were filled with fossil fuels promoters who attended to block decisions that would rescue the world from the clutches of the industry. ''Nigeria has about 40% of global power for renewable energy which it can take advantage of rather than depending on fossil fuels, ' said Akinbode. On his part, the Director, Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF), Dr. Nnimmo Bassey stated that ' COP27 leaves vulnerable nations to contend with climate impacts without any serious help that can be counted as additionalities. According to him, delaying action on loss and damage simply means tossing nations into more famine, fires, and floods, adding that climate change continues to be driven by development based on the exploitation of peoples and the destruction of nature made in the guise of fighting global warming. \</doc>

Nigeria, Nov. 11 -- The President of the United States of America, Joe Biden, Friday, announced $150 million in support for climate adaptation projects in Africa. He made the announcement at the ongoing climate summit, otherwise called the Conference of Parties ( COP27 Mr Biden noted that controlling climate change is imperative for the future of the world, adding that there is no reason not to finance clean energy in developing countries. "To permanently bend the emission curve, every nation has to step up," he said. America has joined the list of other nations including the United Kingdom and the Netherlands that have made financial pledges towards addressing climate change adaptation issues in Africa. Though Africa is the least contributor to global emissions, it is perhaps the worst-hit continent by climate change effects in the world. Statistics from relevant global agencies have confirmed that millions of people are currently rattled by disasters linked "to storms, droughts, wildfires, floods, and landslides on the continent."

The sister of prominent Egyptian British activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah has said she fears her brother may be in prison for the rest of his life. Speaking to Al Jazeera's The Take podcast on Wednesday, Mona Seif said her family believes President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi intends to keep her brother behind bars as long as he remains in office. 'We realised that as long as Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is in power, he does not intend for Alaa to be out of prison at all, and that whenever a case is over, they will just, [make] up a new case and new charges and make sure he spends the rest of his life in prison,' she said. Abd el-Fattah, a blogger and software developer, is one of the most well-known voices to have come out of the uprising of January 25, 2011, when millions of Egyptians protested against then-President Hosni Mubarak's rule. He has been imprisoned for most of the past decade, and in April he began a partial hunger strike to protest against his arrest and sentencing. On November 6, in the run-up to the COP27 UN climate summit taking place at the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, Abd el-Fattah escalated his hunger strike and stopped drinking water. His youngest sister Sanaa, who has also been imprisoned in Egypt several times, is attending the summit to draw more attention to his case. She flew in from London, where she had staged a sit-in protest in front of the Foreign Office building for several days, demanding British officials act quickly to ensure Abd el-Fattah's release. Abd el-Fattah received his UK citizenship towards the end of last year as a result of family ties to Britain, after his family applied on his behalf. According to Mona, the hope was that the British government could help him. 'He feels that for the first time in years, there's an opportunity for him to [get] out, an opportunity for him to change the plan the Egyptian regime has for him, which is to remain in prison until he dies,' Mona said. 'And he is trying everything he has, including putting his life at risk, to seize this opportunity and be reunited with us as a family and actually have a go at a future away from this madness.' Previously, the British government's public actions amounted to calling repeatedly for a consular visit, while relations between London and Cairo continued as normal. But last week, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he wanted to take advantage of the COP27 climate summit held in Egypt this month to discuss Abd el-Fattah's case, which Mona says is a shift in the UK government's behaviour. 'We first got a phone meeting with the foreign secretary, James Cleverly,' she said. Then came the statement from Sunak, who declared he would make raising the case a priority. Mona described Sunak as her brother's last chance but said that her family was 'worried that stepping up or them taking it seriously [is] happening a little bit too late because, well, the Egyptians are going to try and stall as much as possible, and I truly believe they want Alaa to die'. Sameh Shoukry, Egypt's foreign minister and president of COP27 , told reporters during the summit on Monday that Abd el-Fattah 'is receiving all the necessary care in prison'. Shoukry has also cast doubt on the hunger strike, and said that the Egyptian government had not yet recognised the activist's British citizenship. The family dismissed the claims and repeated calls for proof of life after Abd el-Fattah's weekly letter to his mother did not arrive as expected. Mona last saw her brother in September and was 'horrified' at how much weight he had lost. 'All I could think of is if [only] people could see how he looks,' she said. 'They would realise the severity of the situation, and I think this is precisely why they [Egyptian authorities] won't allow the consular visit and they won't allow any image or footage of how he looks right now.' 'Brutality and oppression' Abd el-Fattah was among the tens of thousands of Egyptians who were imprisoned following el-Sisi's sweeping into power after overthrowing former President Mohamed Morsi. He was arrested in November 2013 for protesting without a permit. After completing a five-year sentence, he was released in March 2019 but had to report to a police station every evening, where he stayed from 6pm until 6am. In the remaining 12 hours, Abd el-Fattah spent time with his family, reconnecting with his non-verbal and autistic son, who is 11 years old. But in September of that year, he was arrested again and held in pre-trial detention. He was sentenced in December 2021 to five years in prison for 'broadcasting false news' - for re-sharing a Facebook post about the death of a political prisoner. Alaa was sent to a maximum security prison where, his family and rights groups like Amnesty International say, he was tortured. Mona said it is hard for outsiders to grasp the 'level of brutality and oppression' of the Sisi government. Human rights organisations say more than 60,000 prisoners of conscience have been jailed under the current president. The arrests are not just limited to writers, journalists, political activists and human rights defenders. Thousands of people have been randomly arrested under el-Sisi, Mona explained. \</doc>

Nigeria needs effective public-private sector collaboration and business-to-business partnerships to drive its clean energy agenda and achieve its 2060 net-zero target. Key Nigerian speakers at the agreed that all stakeholders across the private and public sectors must join hands to deliver on the country's clean energy agenda. President and Chief Executive Officer, Oando Clean Energy Limited (OCEL), Dr. Ainojie Irune, said the future would see a more diverse and dynamic energy mix with less reliance on oil, and a greater focus on creating net zero opportunities using gas and more sustainable energy sources. He underscored the importance of the company's sustainable transport strategy as a launchpad that will create the impetus for private users to start to migrate to electric vehicles (EVs) and eventually lead to economies of scale across the nation. Executive Vice President, Oando Clean Energy Limited (OCEL), Mr. Ademola Ogunbanjo, highlighted OCEL's sustainable transport initiative specifically targeted at decarbonising the Niger Delta region. He explained how the company's strategic focus aligned with the Nigeria Energy Transition Plan (NETP). According to him, OCEL is leading private sector's partnership by supporting government's roadmap for the implementation of EVs across Nigeria and its ambition to boost local capacity in the medium term through the construction of an EV assembly and manufacturing plant. 'This is not the age of competition; it is the age of collaboration. We must collaborate, not only between the government and the public sector but also, within the private sector, if we want to push forward the country's net-zero agenda,' Ogunbanjo said. Read Also; Pioneer Director-General, National Council on Climate Change (NCCC), Dr. Salisu Dahiru underlined the importance of OCEL's pipeline projects as a veritable catalyst for Nigeria's net zero agenda. He noted that even before the advent of the NCCC, many climate change mitigation and adaptation initiatives were already being driven by the private sector. He advocated the need to further bridge the gaps between government policy and private sector initiatives, with the first step being creating an enabling environment to ensure the successful delivery of long-term sustainable energy projects. Themed 'delivering for the people and the planet', one message revibrated at COP27 - climate pledges must be matched with action. The event, tagged Africa's COP, served as an opportunity to showcase what countries were doing to safeguard the planet. OCEL, the renewable energy subsidiary of Oando Plc, and part of the Nigerian delegation to COP27 , hosted two side events at the Nigeria pavilion. The first side-event themed 'Decarbonising an Oil-rich Region: A Case for the Niger Delta was held in partnership with Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, National Council on Climate Change, REAN and Stratus Limited. The event had a diverse audience of financiers, partners, government officials and non governmental organisations (NGOs). Engineer John Agada, Director of Environmental Management, gave the welcome address on behalf of the Honourable Minister of State, Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, Chief Sharon Ikeazor while Ogunbanjo made a presentation on OCEL's sustainable initiative. Conversations on the role of private public partnerships (PPPs), climate financing and an enabling business environment intensified at OCEL's second side event, themed 'Achieving Nigeria's Net Zero Target: A Public-Private Partnership'. The event organised in partnership with the Federal Ministry of Environment, amongst others, showcased the company's pipeline projects to support Nigeria in meeting the commitment made by President Muhammadu Buhari at COP26 to hit net zero by 2060. Irune participated as a panelist alongside the Commissioner for Environment, Kogi State, Mr. Omofaiye Adewale, and Managing Director of the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading (NBET), Dr. Nnaemeka Ewelukwa. \</doc>

By Mashe Umaru Gwamna Minister of State for the Environment, Chief Sharon Ikeazor has reaffirmed the commitment of the Federal Government towards promoting and boosting environmental conservation in the country. This was contained in statement issued and issued by Director Press Federal Ministry of Environment Saghir el Mohammed. This is in a bid to guarantee the sustainability of Nigeria's biodiversity and exotic ecosystem for livelihoods of teeming citizens. Ikeazor made this known when she received Dr. Adewale Adeleke, ECOWAS Advisor who led a delegation of the West Africa Biodiversity and Low Emission Development Project (WABILED) on a working visit to her office in Abuja. According to the Minister, "the sustenance of the nation's biodiversity is a core priority of the federal government". She added: "The fact is, we have not really paid attention to the issue of conservation in the past. But now, it is an area of focus for us. Our life and livelihood depend on the ecosystem. Hence, we must put a deliberate effort towards boosting biodiversity conservation". Ikeazor explained that working with other Ministers of Environment in Africa, Nigeria will ensure that Africa makes a statement among the committee of nations in the forthcoming COP27 slated for Egypt later in the year. She assured that her Ministry "will support every effort at conservation and wildlife protection as we look forward to COP27 , making sure that Africa present a strong voice as we continue to work with other Ministers of Environment from Africa". Bar. Ikeazor appealed for the support of WABILED in the implementation of Nigeria's Wildlife Strategy Plan, as well as the signing of the Trans-Boundary Memorandum of Understanding with the Republic of Cameroun, which she described as key to the nation's conservation efforts. Earlier in his remarks, Dr. Adeleke noted that the mission of their WABILED delegation to the Ministry was to appreciate the Federal Government's role in the conservation and sustainable management of the country's natural resources. He solicited Nigeria's support for the final endorsement of the 'West Africa Strategy for Combating Wildlife Crime' by the ECOWAS Ministerial Council and Heads of State Summit. \</doc>

During the last conference (Cop26), which was held in Glasgow, Scotland, very few Africans attended due to COVID-19 and vaccination issues. This edition however is a profound opportunity for the continent, which is already devastated by climate change to make a collective bargain. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) needs assessment estimated that developing countries need $6 trillion by 2030 and that Africa will particularly require $2.5 trillion by 2030 to effectively deal with climate change issues. Africa, with a population of 1.4 billion people (about 17 per cent of the world's population) contributes less than 5% of the global greenhouse emission but it is the most affected and the least informed about climate change issues. At the just concluded Pre- Cop27 Media Conference in Kigali, Rwanda, organised by Kenyan-based think-tanks (Power Shift Africa and MESHA) and Rwanda Media Commission, which was designed to equip journalists to effectively report the event from Africa's perspective, experts said scaling up funding to the continent is central to meeting the target of cutting emissions. At the previous conferences, developed countries that are the highest polluters made a commitment to deliver $100 billion to fight climate change in developing countries but that was never met. Mohamed Adow, CEO of Power Shift Africa, opined that success at COP27 , in the long run, depends on its ability to get funds flowing from 'developed countries to developing countries- at the pace and scale required to match the climate challenge.' The climate change expert held that a key priority for Africa is to get industrialised countries to 'deliver and increase exponentially from the floor of $100 billion amount to at least $150 billion per year until 2025 and fulfil pledges to the Adaptation Fund and new pledges to respond to the increasing adaptation needs.' Addressing African Climate Journalists, Mr Adow said Africa has long been the forgotten component of the climate puzzle, but this is intolerable in a year when the continent is hosting COP27 , adding that, 'This needs to change, and it needs to happen at the African COP. 'If we are to deal with climate change, we need to change our current energy systems as they are failing Africans. Renewable energy has the capacity to meet the needs of Africans and help build resilience to the climate crisis.' Daniel Okechukwu Ogbonnaya, Country Representative of Global Green Growth Institute in Rwanda, echoed the voices of other African activists on the need to provide significant funding to deal with the climate crisis, which he argued is responsible for low agricultural productivity, drought and food crisis in Africa. At the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Tuesday, the Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, while sharing the sentiment of developing countries advised world leaders that the rich energy and conglomerates should be obligated to release some dividends from their profits to support victims of climate change and to deal with rising fuel and food costs. He argued that the fossil fuel industry, which emits a significant amount of greenhouse gases, was making 'hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies and windfall profits while household budgets shrink and our planet burns.' However, climate change activists like Mohamed Adow and a host of others fear that Africa may have a problem because many fossil fuel companies investing across the continent may weaken the collective resolve of the governments to speak with a unifying voice on renewable energy, mitigation and adaptation, and if that happens, the continent will be in trouble. Nigeria at crossroads Nigeria is beset by the numerous debilitating effects of climate change and the realities it brings. Despite taking meaningful actions to combat climate change by contributing their share to the lofty targets of preserving global temperature levels at 1.5 degrees Celsius agreed upon at COP26, effort towards achieving renewable energy away from fossil fuel lacks vigour. Currently, desertification inches closer in the northern fringes of the country, erratic rainfall/drought affecting agricultural productivity across the country and flooding since 2012 have now become a national headache and in a scale never witnessed in history; yet, commitment has not been in a pace to commemorate climate change. With regard to the current state of carbon emission in the country, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) captures the Nigeria situation thus: 'In 2020, Greenhouse Gases (GHG) in Nigeria totalled 126.9 million tons. The energy sector accounts for the largest source of GHG emissions (60% of total emissions). In 2017, Nigeria's GHG emission per capita (including land use) was 3.37 tons of CO2 equivalents, far below the global average of 7 tons. GHG emissions for Nigeria in 2030 are estimated to be 435 million tons of CO2 equivalents, representing a 31% increase in total emissions between 2018 and 2030.' In 2021, President Mohammadu Buhari signed the 2021 Climate Change Act, which provides a structure for climate change response at the country level. The new Climate Change Act built on previous climate change policies is said to be comprehensive climate change legislation in the West Africa sub-region. Under the Climate Change Act 2021, the Federal Ministry of Environment is tasked with developing the country's budget. The budgets, which typically have a five-year cycle, are set in place to ensure that Nigeria meets its net-zero carbon emission targets between 2050 and 2070. Without funding, experts say the target might well be a mirage. \</doc>

With hundreds of high-level delegates filing into the CICAD main hall, day one of MSGBC Oil, Gas & Power 2022 ( HYPERLINK http://bit.ly/3a4fuRb http://bit.ly/3a4fuRb "Gas is going to shape Africa. Already we're seeing the market change month by month as governments and other actors come together to drive gas regionally and globally... This is the best industry that exists and we need to be proud of it every day- stand up and back Africa's right to grow," he said. Building on the momentum of NJ Ayuk's opening address, MSGBC 2022 attendees were greeted to a keynote from Gordon Birrell, bp's Executive Vice President of Production and Operations, who noted that the gas richness of the MSGBC region is even more significant today than when the resources were first discovered five years ago. "We don't only need low carbon energy; we need secure energy and affordable energy... Where bp operates, we are building an economic and social legacy - working with 350 local companies, creating over 3000 local jobs, addressing the highly complex engineering jigsaw the world faces for power in light of recent world events." Passing from one dominant MSGBC energy major to another, bp's Gordon Birrell gave way to Shiva McMahon, Executive Vice President of International Operations at Woodside Energy, in an insightful keynote carrying forward the hopeful messages from the morning's opening addresses. "We find ourselves at a unique crossroads defined by the obstacles we've overcome where many countries are turning towards Africa for an answer to their energy demand... We need energy that is lucrative, resilient, diversified to thrive in a competitive evolving industry, and supported by the Senegalese government, this is precisely the nature of Woodside's developments in three pillars: gas, oil and new energies, fulfilling 5% of global LNG demand and operating Sangomar- the nation's first offshore oil development projecting 100,000 b/d initial production next year," she said. Woodside EVP Shiva McMahon's MSGBC address was succeeded by that of Milton Catelin, Secretary General of the International Gas Union. "Access to affordable, reliable, secure energy is a human right. But choosing the right energy mix in terms of human impact is a human responsibility. Balancing this right and responsibility is the crux of modern energy discussions... Gas is the fastest available, flexible, efficient and sustainable long-term vehicle to get the world back onto the energy transition path... 319 trillion cubic feet of gas await discovery in sub-Saharan Africa, offering a very real opportunity for the continent to take control of its energy future," she noted. Taking the mic from Milton Catelin, H.E. Tom Alweendo, Namibian Minister of Mines and Energy, was next to take the stage. Having experienced a hydrocarbons surge of its own with the discovery of 11 billion barrels of offshore oil in 2011, Namibia is a vision of a bright future for the African hydrocarbons sector, marking two major discoveries just this year- Shell's 300 million barrels at Graff-1 shortly followed by TotalEnergies' 3 billion barrels at Venus-1 the following month. "Energy is a critical catalyst for development; thus, we call for an energy transition that is just and equitable among nations. In order to reap the social and economic benefits for our citizens, we need to be steadfast. We must determine our own energy transition timetable to match our priorities, granting energy access to the 600 million Africans." Maintaining the momentum of H.E. Tom Alweendo, Namibian Minister of Mines and Energy's address, H.E. Dr. Omar Farouk Ibrahim, Secretary General of the African Petroleum Producers Organization graced the hundreds of assembled delegates with his insights from the oval room stage. "Oil and gas constitute a major pillar of African energy security... We have used fossil fuels for over 100 years to transform our societies, and so we cannot and must not abandon hydrocarbons across the continent... As Western financial institutions announce divestments, we at the APPO are working to establish an Africa Energy Bank to take up the slack, to institute world-class oil and gas research, innovation and development centers across Africa and realize the full potential of Africa's 125 billion barrels of oil, taking practical actions to forestall challenges to our industry." H.E. Macky Sall, President of the Republic of Senegal and Chairman of the African Union closed the session, highlighting the need for Africans to be united and the importance of creating strong partnerships across the continent and globally. "Africa cannot be an object of global geopolitics, it must be a conscious actor, a competitor and collaborator with win-win partnerships driving power forward. We need capacity development, we need capital but mostly we need people to work together." Touching on COP 27 COP27 ." Media files \</doc>

The Chairman, Lekki State Urban Forest and Animal Shelter Initiative, Desmond Majekodunmi, has urged Nigerians to stop the continuous pollution of the environment. The environmentalist, while speaking on Wednesday, at an event organised by the Dawn Project Initiative, to mark the World Emissions Day 2022, said the world had about 12 years left to save the planet from the effects of climate change, before it becomes irreversible. He said, "More than ever before, it has become a necessity for us, especially as Nigerians, to begin to take our environment seriously and care for it. Globally, an estimated three to five million people die yearly as a result of waste and pollution deposited in the air and water around us. "Nigerians have a tendency to handle issues lightly, but this is not a joke. From the government to the grassroots, we cannot continue living like all is well, when the very environment we live in is degenerating before our very eyes. "We need to stop the pollution immediately. As humans, we have between eight and 12 years to effect the necessary change our environment needs before the damage becomes irreversible. Prevention, they say, is better than cure; we cannot continue destroying our home and be smiling." Majekodunmi, who is a founding partner of the Dawn Project Initiative, added that the irresponsibility in decision making by the government had also contributed adversely to environmental damage in Nigeria. Adding that he was happy talking to a calibre of people who could effect positive change. The Senior Special Assistant to the General Manager, Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency, Dr. Adebola Odunsi, said awareness about climate change and its effects would take a collaborative effort from both the government and private individuals. He, however, noted that the Lagos State Government had policies in place to aid free distribution of information and to encourage as much innovation in the space as possible.

The representative of the Bank of Industry's Renewable Energy Department, Mr. Idris Ibrahim, said the BoI would continue to encourage people to invest in alternative source of energy through its funding. He said, "The BoI has weekly televised programmes on the Nigerian Television Authority and selected stations that air what the BoI is doing and how people can benefit from our services. "The bank holds a lot of engagement with stakeholders and customer forums, just to sensitise people on how they can be partakers of what the bank is offering. "Concerning renewable energy, the bank offers nine per cent on loans collected yearly, but a lot of people are not aware because they don't participate in these forums. We want to encourage as many people as possible not to be afraid and come take part so as to boost the industry and aid alternative sustainable energy sources." \</doc>

Ushering MSGBC Oil, Gas & Power 2022 to a triumphant close, the final Ministerial panel of the conference convened under the theme,  The Future of Africa's Energy: COP27 and the Road Ahead, presenting a unified African position on energy autonomy and security ahead of the UNFCCC's 27th Conference of Parties in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt at the end of the year. Speakers included H.E. Sophie Gladima, Minister of Petroleum and Energies of the Republic of Senegal; H.E. Dr. Omar Farouk Ibrahim, Secretary General of the African Petroleum Producers' Organization; H.E. Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima, Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea; H.E. Bruno Jean-Richard Itoua, President of OPEC and Minister of Hydrocarbons of the Republic of the Congo; Hon. Tom Alweendo, Minister of Mines and Energy of the Republic of Namibia; and Milton Catelin, Secretary General of the International Gas Union. NJ Ayuk, Executive Chairman of the African Energy Chamber, moderated the session. During the ministerial panel, speakers emphasized that up until now, climate change policies have largely been dictated by western and environmental organizations, organizations which have failed to consider Africa's energy crisis.  There is nothing different from a just transition other than what is already in the Paris Agreement. There is a principle about equity and the ability of countries to transition in the agreement. The developed countries eventually agreed to it. They didn't like it, but they agreed to it. Let's talk about what we can do. What we are saying is that we must not be forced to do what will destroy our future and our children. We need energy to sustain our future generation. Those who are responsible for the mess we see today, should be responsible for change, said H.E. Dr. Ibrahim.  When somebody is sick, you need to diagnose what is wrong. If you do a bad diagnosis, you will never cure it. I believe that the Paris Agreement was not a good diagnosis, H.E. Minister Lima expressed, adding that,  I am not pro fossil fuel; I am pro fossil fuel for Africa. Developed nations enjoyed the resource, they contaminated the world, they should be the ones who change their lifestyle. To tell Africa to stop fossil fuels is unfair. I am pro fossil fuels for Africa so that we can develop. As such, Africa needs its own Africa-focused approach to mitigating climate change while correspondingly eradicating energy poverty.  Only Africa's hydropower potential will enable us to cover the needs of people in Africa. Considering solar, where no one can compute the amount, and if you add gas and wind, Africa is in excess of energy. When you look at policies of Africa in terms of development, energy has never been a priority in Africa. We have never been able to make energy a priority at national level. The difference today is that the discourse we are having is that African should be prioritized. This is the first-time people are talking about this. This is not the Paris Agreement or the energy transition but to make sure the energy potential in Africa is made available to the continent, H.E. Itoua stated. According to Hon. Alweendo,  Namibia is developing green hydrogen simply because we have the natural resources to be able to harness it. Green hydrogen is not likely to be the source for electricity. This is mostly for hard to abate industries, the manufacturing and mining. It is more for movement and transportation and not so much for giving electricity to the people. Therefore, gas to power remains part of the solution. The crucial importance of aligning African narratives on matters of energy and climate was underlined following yesterday's Dakar Declaration joint statement endorsed by the ministers, now set to be taken forward to the G7 and G20 summits before finally arriving at COP27 . COP27 , the voice of Africa should be heard. Where decisions are made, Africa must be there, stated H.E. Gladima.  Africa is the future for the world. Africa is the hope for the world, it offers solutions and practical considerations around global issues. This continent brings a practical approach to the challenges we face such as climate change. Without having a healthy growing economy, you do not have the inclination of resources or the time to devote to stewardship of the environment. The most robust arguments about the environment are put forward by wealthy countries that have developed economies. Renewables have an important role to play globally, but gas has an important role to play globally and locally. Renewables have an important role but it is only something you can do with a developed economy. In terms of hydrogen, this will be part of the global mix and part of the solution, whether it's a solution for Africa is a different question. This is a question that needs to be answered by Africa, stated Catelin. \</doc>

Nigeria, May 25 -- About 40 million additional people in sub-Saharan Africa could be pushed into extreme poverty by 2030 due to climate change, a new report by Mo Ibrahim Foundation, a political leadership and public governance think-tank in Africa, has revealed. The report titled "The 2022 Forum Facts & Figures: The Road to COP27 : Making Africa's Case in the Climate Debate" and launched on Wednesday, highlights the need for greater consideration of Africa's specific position within the global debate on climate change. "39.7 million additional people in sub-Saharan Africa could be pushed into extreme poverty by 2030 due to climate change, more than in any other world region," the report noted. Established in 2006, the Mo Ibrahim Foundation is a non-governmental organisation with a focus on the critical importance of political leadership and public governance in Africa. The Foundation's 2022 Forum Facts & Figures launched exactly six months ahead of the forthcoming Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to be held in Egypt later this year and just after the conclusion of COP15 of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Cote d'Ivoire, provided a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and prospects of the global climate crisis from Africa's perspective. The research highlights Africa's consistent resource potential, and that the continent possesses all the key assets to accelerate the global transition to a green and sustainable economy. However, the report explained that for this potential to be effectively and efficiently delivered in the best interest of people in Africa, the continent will need to break from the "natural resource curse", and focus on leveraging financial resources, strengthening governance frameworks and natural resource management. According to the report key findings, Africa is the least responsible world region for climate change, accounting for 3.3 per cent of total global carbon emissions since 1960, but the impact of climate change is already hitting the continent harder. "In 2020, the whole of Africa's per capita carbon emissions were ten times lower than North America's," the report said. The report highlights that between 2010 and 2022, the number of people affected by drought amounted to at least 172.3 million, and that the ones affected by floods amounted to at least 43.0 million. It said the ten most climate vulnerable countries globally are in Africa. According to the report, Africa is the most vulnerable continent to climate change due to pre-existing development challenges that exacerbate climate impact and lower resilience. The report noted that climate change is forecasted to push an additional 78 million people into chronic hunger by 2050 and that over half of these people are in sub-Saharan Africa. "Without climate action, sub-Saharan Africa is expected to see the displacement and migration of up to 85.7 million people, equivalent to 4.2 per cent of the continent's population," the report said. The research found that 600 million people in Africa currently lack access to electricity and that more than 930 million lack access to clean cooking fuels, making Africa the continent with the lowest rates of energy access globally. "Most climate vulnerable countries in Africa are showing governance deficits," the report added. Reacting to the report, Mo Ibrahim, founder and chair of the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, was quoted to have said, "As the least industrialised continent, Africa has contributed the least to the global climate crisis, yet it is suffering the most from its consequences." Mr Ibrahim said Africa has the potential to be at the heart of a sustainable future for both the continent and the world. As we now head towards COP27 , to be hosted on the continent, he said it is vital that Africa's unique position is better understood and taken into account. "Leaving Africa out of the equation not only hinders efficient climate action, but it also threatens global development and security prospects," Mr Ibrahim said.

Nigeria, Aug. 26 -- The Centre for Journalism Innovation and Development (CJID) in partnership with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, London (CIJ) last week held a three-day media workshop on climate change for journalists and policy analysts in Nigeria. The training was held in Lagos State from 15 to 17 August. The CJID said it was aimed at strengthening the capacity of the media and civil society to carry out deep and impactful reporting as well as advocacy around issues related to environmental sustainability and climate change. The Project Coordinator, Daniel Whyte, said access to quality information and capacity building are requisite tools for the media to fulfil its role in the drive for climate action. "Through this fellowship, we aim to improve the skills and capacity of journalists and more importantly improve the quality of conversations on climate change in the country," he said. The Lagos training is the first in a series of training planned for participants in English-speaking West Africa. "We are excited about the outcome of this initial training and strongly believe this project will engender insightful discussions on climate change in the lead up to COP27 which will be held in Egypt later this year," Mr Whyte added. READ ALSO: CJID trains University of Uyo campus journalists Climate change is a long-term shift in normal weather and temperature conditions, believed to be caused by human activities such as carbon emissions and fossil fuel burning. It poses a big threat to livelihoods as it affects almost all sectors of the global economy. Currently, the world is moving towards limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees through different climate action plans such as reduction in fossil fuel usage, and climate-smart interventions in agriculture, among others. One of the participants, Temitope Bademosi, a journalist with TVC, described the training as enlightening and engaging. "The topics we have been discussing are relevant to the climate discussion. It is a wakeup call on the role that we as journalists must play in amplifying climate issues," she said. Bamidele Olajide, a participant and a researcher at the University of Lagos, thanked the organisers. He said they successfully extended the frontiers of knowledge of climate change with the training. Adeolu Adekola, a project manager at CIJ, the funding partner, said through the training, journalists and researchers will be able to investigate and expose wrongdoings as well as craft meaningful stories on climate change-related issues. "We are excited by the quality of journalists and researchers in the fellowship and by their innovative ideas. We can't wait to see the agenda-setting work they will be doing in the lead-up to Africa COP27 ," The Executive Director of CJID, Tobi Oluwatola, said. Selected participants from the workshop will receive funding to produce in-depth reports and policy analyses on climate change issues, impacts and solutions in the West African sub-region.

The Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) has cancelled its scheduled presidential debate for the 2023 polls. The debate was scheduled to hold next week in Abuja as part of the National Economic Summit (NES#28). Organisers of the summit shelved the debate because of what they called 'unfavorable climate'. In place of the debate, NESG said it will organise a town hall meeting for presidential candidates of the political parties at a later date. NESG chairman Asue Ighodalo confirmed the change of plan while responding to questions from journalists after a scheduled pre-summit briefing. Ighodalo said there must be a minimum level of issues that presidential aspirants must sign on to. He said the NESG had 'hoped there was going to be a debate, but the prevailing climate wasn't comfortable for it anymore.

The World Bank Group yesterday announced a new Blue Economy programme that will catalyse financing and provide an operational response to development challenges in coastal-marine areas of Nigeria and other African countries. The Blue Economy for Resilient Africa Programme (BE4RAP), was announced at a COP 27 World Bank event. The programme seeks to respond to the challenge coastal countries face to manage their coastal and marine resources to spur economic growth and reduce poverty, while adapting to the effects of climate change. A first for the World Bank in Africa, a 'Mangrove Blue Carbon Pilot Program' was announced as part of BE4RAP. The $13.5 million programme includes $2 million financing from IDA and $3 million from PROBLUE, a multi-donor trust fund housed at the World Bank, and $8.5 million from the Danish energy company \'d8rsted. 'BE4RAP is about doing more, better, and faster,' said World Bank Global Director for Environment, Natural Resources and Blue Economy Valerie Hickey. 'By capitalizing on existing programs and partnerships, we rally under the leadership of the coastal Africa countries and support each with finance and technical assistance.' The Blue Economy for Resilient Africa Program is set to convene a 'Focus on Africa Blue Marketplace' in 2023. Building on the vast existing portfolio of the World Bank in North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, the BE4RAP is intended to mobilize new support, financing, and partnerships to respond to the COP 27 ambition to have an Africa-wide initiative bringing innovative climate solutions, notably to the Blue Economy. 'The French Development Agency (AFD) is deeply concerned with the wellbeing of the African people, cultures, countries and the environment. With a wide portfolio of activities in all sectors on the continent, AFD is increasingly engaging on climate, biodiversity, and the SDGs. Addressing many of these challenges at once, the blue economy is a major part of the solution, and we are keen to associate fully with the World Bank on the BE4RAP.' Deputy Director, Operations, French Development Agency, said Cassilde Breni\'e8re, said. 'We are very happy that the NDF financing to the World Bank for the West Africa Coastal Areas Management Program Scale-Up Platform has supported the design of the new and innovative blue carbon project for Ghana. It has unlocked financing from both the public sector as well as from the Nordic private sector which has the potential to be replicated to the coastal landscape and to other countries in Africa. 'We look forward to engaging further with the World Bank and many other partners to promote sustainable and resilient blue economy, including through initiatives like the BE4RAP,' Program Manager, Nordic Development Fund, Martina J\'e4gerhorn. \</doc>

IBM has said it will provide $30m worth of services on projects focused on dealing with environmental threats such as climate change. The firm announced this at COP27 conference while announcing the new members of its global pro bono social impact program, the IBM Sustainability Accelerator. According to it, the programme applied its technologies to enhance and scale projects focused on populations vulnerable to environmental threats, including climate change. It added that all its new members would focus on accelerating clean energy projects. IBM had previously announced it planned to select five organisations for the programme each year and expected to provide $30m worth of services by the end of 2023. The Vice President of Corporate Social Responsibility and ESG at IBM, Justina Nixon-Saintil, said, "With the IBM Sustainability Accelerator, we are convening experts and using innovative technologies to help tackle the toughest environmental challenges our planet faces; and transitioning to clean energy is a critical step right now. "With this new cohort, helping marginalised communities get just and equitable access to sustainable energy resources not only helps the world achieve the goal of UN SDG7, but can help in the larger global energy transition." IBM revealed that it evaluated more than 100 submissions from around the world before selecting the new members of its clean energy cohort. It stated, "United Nations Development Programme: UNDP is working with IBM to increase access to sustainable, affordable, and reliable energy in African countries, focusing on those furthest left behind. The goal is to forecast electricity access to better guide policy and investment decisions, using UNDP's technical knowledge and IBM's artificial intelligence and geospatial analytics." \</doc>

The answer is less than straightforward when considering the billions of people living in the Global South. As counterintuitive as it might seem at a first glance to people living in the 'Global North', there is a strong case to invest more in sustainable livestock systems across the developing world as a matter of climate justice. Let me explain. Having been widely recognised as the 'African COP', this year's negotiations are emphasising the need to support the most vulnerable in adapting to climate change by requiring the wealthiest historic emitters of greenhouse gases to pay for the loss and damage that has already occurred. Livestock actually offers a compelling case for both of these priorities. If COP27 The African continent is responsible for just under four per cent of historic global emissions, yet - along with the broader developing world - is already facing the worst effects of climate change. However, many of these countries' livestock sectors can help them endure this change in the short term and transition fairly in the long run. This is because livestock across the Global South is not simply the packaged meat, milk, and eggs the Western audiences are familiar with; it is a complex production system that anchors whole economies, societies and ecosystems. The benefits livestock provides for many in poor, low-emitting countries are clear. In particular, livestock is a reliable source of income for Africa's farmers, including marginalised groups like women, who often are not allowed or are unable to own other assets easily. Livestock also offers a valuable safety net in rural communities in a time of need, for example, when crop harvests fail. Likewise, livestock also provides vital and sustainable assistance in all aspects of farm management: cows pull ploughs, eat leftover crop residues after harvest, and convert residues into valuable manure for the next season - often when other fertiliser sources are simply not available or are prohibitively expensive. They also play an important role in managing rangelands sustainably. In addition to this, and perhaps most importantly, livestock provides an accessible and high-quality source of nutrition for those who do not have the privilege of other food choices and struggle disproportionately with undernutrition rather than excess (as is often the case in the Global North). Advocating for a reduction in livestock production in the Global South would deprive some of the world's most vulnerable communities of the clear benefits these animals provide. Livestock has significant potential as a key climate solution in these regions, whose per capita emissions are small fractions of what the world's highest-emitting nations produce. Instead of cutting their investments in livestock, donor governments should commit to supporting the crucial research that will help the livestock sector in the Global South to develop more sustainably. Additional investment could make a systemic difference in climate adaptation, One Health - the intersection between the health of people, animals and the environment, as defined by the UN - and greater productivity and profitability. While efforts to mitigate climate change should continue, we know that they will not be enough, as a certain amount of global warming is now inevitable. Therefore, more research is needed to support more resilient animal breeds while developing greater social safety nets and livelihood opportunities for livestock farmers. Furthermore, we need to improve access to opportunities for women and other marginalised groups who will bear the brunt of climate change fallout. More gender-focused research is critical to reducing poverty and making sustainable development possible for poor livestock keepers, their families and the communities in which they live. Livestock is too often painted with the same brush regardless of the context in which it is raised, the benefits it can provide for vulnerable communities, or its actual environmental impact. Livestock should instead be celebrated, not demonised, for the role it plays across the Global South. At the COP27 \</doc>

The African Development Bank had several productive engagements around its strategic priorities at the just concluded 77th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) meetings in New York. Meeting highlights included an urgent call for increased financing to mitigate the effects of climate change and food insecurity. African Development Bank Group President Dr Akinwumi Adesina led the bank's delegation to the meetings and played an active part in discussions leading to an international declaration to end malnutrition and stunting. The bank's engagements reflect its strategic priorities as African countries, which it supports, struggle with the lingering impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as food and fuel price spikes arising from Russia's war in Ukraine, and climate change. Climate change was a recurring theme in many of the bank's UNGA discussions, especially the need for urgent financing for the countries most at risk from climate change. Climate change has assumed greater urgency with the next UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) due to be held in Sharm El-Sheik, Egypt in less than two months. COP 27 or "the African COP," as it is being called, presents an unprecedented opportunity for a unified African voice to demand that the global community move beyond talk to concrete action on financing for climate adaptation and mitigation. Speaking at the 2nd ministerial meeting on climate and development, Adesina joined US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry and other participants in urging developed countries to deliver on the pledges they made at COP26 in Glasgow last year, and under the 2015 Paris Agreement. John Kerry's words were unambiguous: "We are late. We must act. I'm fed up with saying the same thing too many times in the same meetings. Business as usual is the collective enemy. It's time for action," he told the meeting. Adesina echoed this call for urgent action. He warned: "Africa is suffering, Africa is choking, and is in serious financial distress for what it did not cause. There must be a greater sense of urgency, not in talking, but in doing and delivering resources that the continent needs very desperately." The African Development Bank Group joined the Global Leadership Council in a new initiative to scale up clean, reliable energy and address global warming. The\\xa0 Global Leadership Council comprises global leaders, including the African Development Bank head, the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Patricia Espinosa; United Nations Development ProgrammeAdministrator Achim Steiner; European Investment Bank. President Werner Hoyer; Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr; and the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, Dr. Rajiv J. Shah, co-chair of the council. As a first step, the Council will focus on efforts to break down barriers to just energy transitions in developing countries. While developing countries are currently responsible for only 25% of global CO2 emissions, this share could grow to 75% by 2050, according to an analysis published by the Alliance. Developing countries currently receive only a fraction of financing to develop clean energy, despite representing nearly half of the world's population. The General Assembly allowed the African Development Bank Group to demonstrate particular leadership in efforts to end hunger, nutrition, and stunting across Africa. Under the Presidential Dialogue Group on Nutrition, inspired by the African Union's designation of 2022 as the "Year of Nutrition," the African Development Bank Group head joined African presidents to sign a landmark commitment to stop childhood stunting. According to the Global Nutrition Report- considered the most comprehensive accounting of the state of nutrition worldwide-more than 30% of children in Africa are stunted. The Dialogue Group is an initiative of the African Development Bank's African Leaders for Nutrition platform, the Ethiopian government, and Big Win, a philanthropic organization. In addition to Ethiopia, the platform counts the leaders of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda among its members. The African Development Bank's African Emergency Food Production Facility featured prominently at the Global Food Security Summit. Senegal's President Macky Sall, chair of the African Union, commended the bank for its swift launch of the $1.5 billion\\xa0 facility to avert a looming food crisis. The program is facilitating the production of 38 million tons of food. This represents a $12 billion increase in output in just two years. In furtherance of the African Development Bank's Group's Jobs for Youth in Africa program to create 25 million jobs by 2025 and related initiatives, the Bank president participated in a high-level session to discuss the Global Accelerator on Jobs and Social Protection for Just Transitions ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3SVfKTX https://bit.ly/3SVfKTX Speaking at the session, UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres urged governments across the world to quickly invest in quality job creation and the provision of social protection for those without coverage. The session was also addressed by various leaders from around the world including the President of the African Development Bank Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, Malawi's President Lazarus Chakwera, Uganda's Vice President Jessica Alupo, and Egypt's Minister for Planning and Economic Development Hala El-Said. African Development Bank President Dr. Akinwumi Adesina said: "We have to restructure our economies to be productive with education, infrastructure, energy and making sure we have productive sectors that can use people's skills and absorb that into the economy." In the sidelines of the General Assembly, Adesina also led a bank delegation to the World Health Organization (WHO) for meetings. The two organizations agreed to work together on quality health care infrastructure, vaccines, essential medicines, nutrition, and the African Pharmaceutical Technology Foundation. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus congratulated the African Development Bank for birthing the Africa Pharmaceutical Technology Foundation, which he said "could help in market shaping for pharmaceutical products." Adesina also held bilateral meetings with Kenya's new president, William Ruto; American billionaire and philanthropist Michael Bloomberg; and former US President Bill Clinton and former US Senator Hillary Clinton. \</doc>

By Temitope Ponle Partners of the Africa Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) Hub have stressed on the importance for African countries to implement their NDCs to adapt to climate impacts. This is contained in a statement from the Communication and External Relations Department, African Development Bank (AfDB) on Wednesday. NDCs represents the commitments of each country to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change. They were agreed to by countries during the Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP) in Paris in 2015, a commitment known as 'The Paris Agreement'. Partners hosted a session titled "Enabling faster and efficient NDC support through advocacy and partnerships" at the just-ended Africa Climate Week. The partners included the AfDB, United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the African Union Commission (AUC), United Nations Development Fund (UNDP) and the Global Green Growth Institute. The representatives from across the continent gathered to share their experiences of implementing the NDCs. They noted that partnerships and effectiveness in measuring, reporting and verifying greenhouse gas emissions would be key to African countries hitting their various targets. The session showcased a collaborative platform for partner institutions to leverage one another's strengths to support African countries deliver their NDCs faster and efficiently. In his opening remarks, Gabon's Minister of Water, Forest, the Sea and Environment, Prof. Lee White said: "Gabon is a net positive country and is committed to remain carbon neutral to 2050". White noted that Gabon had submitted a second NDC in 2022 in collaboration with several development partners, some of them members of the NDC Hub. Speaking of one of the country's key sectors, he stressed that Gabon's timber should not be embargoed as it is certified, and produced legally and sustainably. He also pressed a point made by Gabon's President Ali Bongo Ondimba earlier during Africa Climate Week to, "let Africa lead" on climate issues. "The continent has a lot to offer," he said. Mr Jean-Paul Adams, UNECA's Director for Technology, Climate Change and Natural Resources Management, said: "To be effective, NDCs needed to be integrated in national budgeting systems to receive funding from the national treasury." Looking ahead to COP27 , Adams said that Africa's priorities should include a just and equitable transition, finance and resource mobilisation through such instruments as debt for climate swaps. Dr Richard Munang, Deputy Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Africa Office said there was no one size fits all model. Munang added that African countries should consider their own individual contexts and prioritise sectors in which they enjoy a comparative advantage. He also stressed the importance of tapping Africa's youth dividend. Davinah Milenge, AfDB's Principal Programme Coordinator in the Climate Change Department said: "The African Development Bank established the Africa NDC Hub to leverage the power of partnerships in delivering the NDCs with efficiency, urgency and at scale." Milenge said the bank had targeted its NDC support to prioritise a holistic approach that stimulates economic growth, and delivers inclusivity and regional integration. She cited the Desert to Power initiative, which will add 10 gigawatts of solar generation capacity and provide electricity to around 250 million people in 11 Sahelian countries by 2030. Representatives from Kenya, Nigeria and Gabon provided country experiences on NDC implementation, current needs and priorities. During the last session of the side event, Africa NDC Hub partners institutions outlined their country-support programmes for NDC implementation. Africa NDC Hub partners will launch a flagship publication at COP27 outlining progress in NDC implementation across nine thematic areas. The report is expected to spotlight key priorities ahead of the United Nations Global Stocktake (GST) on the Paris Agreement, scheduled for 2023.

In pursuit of making energy poverty history in Africa by 2030, the African Energy Chamber (AEC) met with Pavel Sorokin, First Deputy Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation, to discuss the role Russia-Africa energy collaboration will play in accelerating large-scale energy developments in Africa - driving an Africa-adapted energy transition while alleviating energy poverty on the back of improved access and sustainable economic growth. In the spirit of H.E. Mohammed Sansui Barkindo, the late Secretary General of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), discussions during the meeting centered around the need to encourage and improve continuous Russia-Africa energy collaboration on the need for a just energy transition as well as making energy poverty history. In the meeting, parties emphasized the need for Russia to continue its collaboration with OPEC+, as well as other key organizations including the Gas Exporting Countries Forum and the African Petroleum Producers Association, as well as participating in discussions held in Sham El Sheihk in Egypt at COP27 . "The AEC is committed to making energy poverty history in Africa by 2030, and to do this, we believe that every resource available on the continent needs to be maximized. Russia can help drive investment and know how into these resources and ensure the continent benefits from its natural resource wealth," states NJ Ayuk, Executive Chairman of the AEC, adding that, "The meeting with Pavel Sorokin was centered around this very narrative: that in order to alleviate energy poverty and drive long-term, sustainable economic growth, we need to improve Russia-Africa collaboration, drive an Africa-adapted just energy transition and fighting climate change." The need for an Africa-centric energy transition has been a topic of debate in recent years, with the AEC as the voice of the African energy sector, driving the narrative that Africa's energy future will continue to rely on every resource present on the continent. As such, the AEC's annual energy conference, African Energy Week (AEW) - taking place from October 18-21, 2022, in Cape Town - will largely center on this narrative, with panel discussions, investor forums and ministerial summits exploring the need for a multi-resource approach to the energy transition. These discussions will start at AEW in Cape Town and will continue at COP27 in Cairo. As such, the AEC will take the narrative of a just energy transition from Cape to Cairo.

The Executive Secretary of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), Dr Orji Ogbonnaya Orji, stated this on Thursday at the National Dialogue on Energy Transition in Abuja which was convened by NEITI, the Natural Resources Governance Institute (NRGI) and BudgIT. Orji said, 'The global energy transition agenda is already reshaping the oil and gas landscape. Just recently, during the last United Nations Climate Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, 26 countries and some public finance institutions announced their commitment to ending finance for overseas fossil fuel energy projects by the end of year 2022. 'Being an oil and gas dependent country, Nigeria is highly vulnerable and exposed to the risks and challenges of energy transition. Nigeria must not allow to be rushed into hasty energy transition decisions without a thorough analysis of our comparative advantage.' He said NEITI was integrating transparency and accountability mechanisms in Nigeria's energy transition, especially in the area of energy sustainability. The West Africa Regional Manager of NRGI, Nafi Chinery, said about 660 million Africans might be without electricity up till 2030, with 910m people not having access to clean cooking systems. She noted that Nigeria was crucial in driving energy transition as it had $450bn Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as of 2021. She said, 'Nigeria's emphasis on gas as a transition fuel aligns with the thinking of most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and the African Union Commission in the run up to COP27 .' \</doc>

The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva has restated government's commitment to achieving its net-zero emission targets by 2060. The minister stated this in his remarks at the 7th National Council of Hydrocarbons meeting which held in Minna, Niger State, according to a statement from the ministry signed by its Director of Information, Enefaa Bob-Manuel. Sylva, whose address was delivered by the Permanent Secretary, at the ministry, Gabriel Aduda, informed that in demonstration of its commitment, Nigeria had commenced the "mitigation and adaptation" of proactive measures towards achieving its net-zero emission targets by 2060. He noted that the event came at a time when global efforts were geared towards achieving lesser emissions. The minister noted that the recently concluded UN Climate Conference ( COP27 ) held in Egypt, offered another opportunity for Nigeria to identify opportunities for cooperation and collaboration with other countries and international organisations. According to him, this collaboration would help accelerate mitigation and adaptation of proactive measures towards achieving the targets. "Oil and gas are a major development resource for Africa and will be for a long time to come. We are however putting measures in place to ensure cleaner processes and processing to mitigate the impact of methane and greenhouse gasses," the minister added. Sylva noted that one of the gains recorded in Nigeria's oil and gas sector with the signing of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021 was the creation of a regulatory frameworks with clear and non-overlapping mandates for the growth and development of the oil and gas sector. In his address, the governor of Niger State, Sani Bello, expressed confidence that achieving the energy transition plan in Nigeria was attainable if Nigeria is able to strategically outline the right policy directions and draw up implementable frameworks for the supervisory agencies. Bello, who was represented by the Secretary to the Niger State Government, Ahmed Mutane, informed that there were proven presence of commercially viable hydrocarbon in the Bida Basin of the State. \</doc>

The International Labour Organization (ILO) launched the first Green Jobs for Youth pacts and Just Transition Finance Tool on Banking and Investment Activities at the COP27 Climate Change Conference held in Egypt. The Youth Pact, a partnership with the United Nations (UN) and other agencies, aims to close the skills gap for young people in developing countries and target climate vulnerable sectors. Its goals include creating one million green jobs, supporting the greening of one million existing jobs, and helping 10,000 green entrepreneurs. The Pact is part of the ILO's work to promote a Just Transition to a more sustainable and greener future and brings together the ILO, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the European Commission, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), and the children and youth constituency of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (YOUNGO) and LinkedIn. Speaking at the launching ceremony, Global Coordinator for Green Jobs at the ILO, Moustapha Kamal Gueye reminded the participants that, "investments in the green economy including clean and renewable energy, construction, sustainable agriculture will create 8.4 million jobs for young people by 2030." Similarly, ILO together with the London School of Economics Grantham Research Institute for Climate Change and Environment, launched the Just Transition Finance Tool on Banking and Investment Activities. Speaking, the Director of the Enterprises Department at the ILO, Vic Van Vuuren, said, "we are seeing first movers, we are seeing concrete actions coming from the financial sector. But to move from the current nascent stage into mainstream, the sector can benefit from further guidance. We trust that the tool will support implementation of tangible measures." The initiative aims to provide financial institutions with practical advice, emerging practices and links to relevant resources on how to embed a just transition lens into their operations, in alignment with the Paris Agreement. \</doc>

Download logo The resumed 18th session of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) closed with environment ministers from 54 African countries adopting a series of decisions and key messages to tackle climate change, the loss of nature, pollution and waste, including the elimination of open dumping and burning of waste. The conference took place from 12 to 16 September 2022 in Dakar, Senegal. The President of AMCEN and Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development of Senegal, H.E Abdou Karim Sall, emphasised that the session comes in the wake of a regional health, food, energy and financial crisis that particularly impacts Africa, denoting urgency to the conference's theme of "securing people's well-being and ensuring environmental sustainability in Africa." On pollution, ministers committed to: eliminate open dumping and burning of waste in Africa and to promote use of waste as a resource for value and job creation. They called on development partners to support African countries to better monitor and reduce methane and black carbon emissions associated with waste. improve awareness on the risks that antimicrobial resistance poses to human health and sustainable development in Africa. They also called for urgent and collective action to prevent and minimise adverse impacts of antimicrobial resistance. The President of the Sixth UN Environment Assembly, Minister of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development of Morocco, H.E Laila Benali said:" we recognise the crucial role that AMCEN is playing in leading and advocating for Africa's positions and interests in the areas of environment and sustainable development, at all levels including through its active involvement in global negotiations on Multilateral Environment Agreements. We need to strengthen the role of AMCEN as a platform for implementation." John Kerry, the United States special presidential envoy for climate, who participated in the conference said: "It is an honour to join this year's AMCEN, where I hope to offer a few thoughts, but mostly hear from you... our challenge is too big for any one nation - or group of nations - to solve alone. We need to work together - as the private sector, civil society, governments, and tribal and indigenous groups, to win the battle here. Partnerships will be key in Africa and beyond." Ministers also committed to make the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment stronger and more effective, including through strengthening collaboration with the African Ministers of Finance and Economic Planning. "Decisions by AMCEN have provided a map the continent can now use to chart a new course, one that boosts human well-being and ensures environmental sustainability for generations to come," said Ligia Noronha, UN Assistant Secretary-General representing the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). "The time has now come for African nations to use this map by implementing the decisions this body has made. It is time to transform AMCEN from a decision-making body into a platform for action and implementation." Ministers provided policy guidance for African participation in upcoming global environmental events: Regarding the UN climate conference ( COP27 ) to be held from 6 to 18 November in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, Ministers emphasised the need to: call up on developed countries to fulfil promised finance commitments and for COP27 to set an ambitious new goal for 2025, including Loss and Damage and a Just Transition financing framework to support developing countries. support African countries to leapfrog fossil-heavy development models while enhancing energy access. On the UN Biological Diversity Conference (UNCBD-COP15) to be held from 7 to 17 December 2022 in Montreal, Canada, Ministers reiterate that the post-2020 global biodiversity framework must include a solution for sharing the benefits arising from the use of digital sequence information on genetic resources. Ministers underlined the need to close the financial gap to ensure implementation of the goals and target of the framework and called for the establishment of a global biodiversity fund. The resumed 18th session in Dakar follows last year's first part of the conference, held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday, called for new partnership for prosperity and development on the Africa continent, but also for more support to address the climate crisis. Guterres made the call while addressing journalists after he attended the 6th African Union\- UN annual conference in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. "Far too often, Africa is viewed from outside through a prism of problems. When I see Africa, I see hope and potential. "I see countries working together, including here at the AU, to foster peace and development." Focusing on the huge untapped potential of African youth, he said their "limitless energy" and "new ways of thinking" could provide solutions for deep-seated challenges, that could benefit the entire world. Recovery for Africa, especially in light of the unequal COVID vaccine rollout since 2021, was being held back by what he called "a morally bankrupt global financial system." Guterres said the continent was "receiving mere droplets of support to adapt to this destruction. "The world is counting on Africa. But Africa could not count on the world. That must change," he said. "We need to repair trust, supercharge development, and place Africa's future at the heart of the solutions our world needs." Firstly, he said Africa needed new partnerships to boost stalled economies and development. The tools are there to provide the urgent support needed, but they need to be used "with much greater flexibility and speed", such as favourable Special Drawing Rights for liquidity, and debt relief. Secondly, Africa "deserves and needs climate support", building on November step towards climate justice secured at COP27 in Egypt, with the establishment of a Loss and Damage fund. "However, the promise to double adaptation finance to $40 billion dollars annually has not been met," he said. Turning to the issue of peace, the secretary-general said that from the Sahel to the Great Lakes and Ethiopia, deep-rooted conflicts continued to challenge the world. The UN, he said, would continue working along the African Union to deliver the peace, prosperity and climate justice that the people of the African continent deserve. (NAN) \</doc>

The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission has said Nigeria will deepen gas exploration by 20 per cent by the end of the decade. \\xa0It also said the country was committed to energy transition plan with a plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2060. The Executive Commissioner, NUPRC, Rose Ndong, made the revelation while speaking at the pre-conference workshop of the Nigerian Association of Petroleum Explorationists held in Lagos. According to her, gas remains Nigeria's transitional fuel, and that the country is on track to also increase exploration by 50 per cent after the decade. "Beyond the sad story of Nigeria not meeting up to its energy transition plan, I want to reassure everyone that we are actually in a good place. Nigeria is already transitioning before the COP26 because we have already signed the gas pact. We are therefore fully committed to reach net zero by 2060 by making sure that companies bring their gas to the market instead of flaring them. We definitely cannot abandon gas", she said. Nigeria's current proven gas reserves stands at 208TCF, and 600TCF unproven reserves. Group General Manager, NAPIMS, Bala Wunti represented by the General Manager, Nigerian Petroleum Exchange, one of its arm, Andrew Grant during his presentation at the annual pre-conference workshop of the Nigeria Association of Petroleum Explorationists held in Lagos on Wednesday, had said the world, Nigeria inclusive, would have little or no progress report on its energy transition efforts to present at the next COP27 meeting slated for Egypt in November. According to him, Nigeria is currently not doing enough to achieve its 2060 commitment to net zero emissions and energy transition plan. "Nigeria is working towards reducing our carbon footprints. We also have other things in that plan like the national forest policy, which aims to promote sustainable forest management because you know forests are very important in reducing carbon footprints." \</doc>

The has announced a Global Shield Financing Facility to help developing countries access more financing for recovery from natural disasters and climate shocks. This facility will support the Global Shield Against Climate Risks, a joint initiative launched today at COP27 by the G7 and V20 to better protect poor and vulnerable people from disasters by pre-arranging more financing before disasters strike. World Bank Managing Director of Operations, Axel van Trotsenburg, said: 'We estimate that by 2040, over 130 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty by climate change'. 'Access to disaster risk finance and insurance solutions for low-income countries is part of the World Bank's strategy for helping them adapt to the growing risks of natural disasters. We will contribute to the Global Shield initiative through our analytical and advisory work, policy dialogue and country lending operations,' he said. The Global Shield Financing Facility will channel grants to developing countries through World Bank projects or through projects prepared by other participating partners, including UN agencies and multilateral development banks. It will also work closely with key stakeholders, such as civil society organisations, risk pools, private sector and humanitarian partners. The Global Shield Financing Facility will finance integrated financial protection packages that offer coordinated and consolidated financial support to those vulnerable to climate shocks and disasters. These financial packages will complement investments in climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction. Such packages will also enable and mobilise private capital for improved financial resilience, by offering private financial solutions, including insurance and other risk transfer instruments such as catastrophe bonds. The Global Shield Financing Facility builds on the earlier Global Risk Financing Facility, established in 2018, which has supported country operations in Africa, Asia, and Small Island Developing States. The program has been paired with $3 billion in World Bank lending and helped to mobilize more than $1 billion in private sector capital. \</doc>

To help the agriculture industry in Africa undergo digital transformation, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Microsoft have teamed. The IFC and Microsoft, working together through the Africa Transformation Office (ATO), presented their partnership to assist the digital transformation of Africa's agriculture sector during a discussion on Adaptation and Agriculture Day at COP27 in Egypt. In a joint statement, IFC and Microsoft emphasized that their relationship is supplying digital agriculture technologies to help African agribusinesses improve their food security and climate change resilience. "Through the partnership, digital tools such as Microsoft's AgBot and Community Training applications are integrated with IFC's Agribusiness Leadership Programme to provide better information, newer technologies, and management capacity training to agribusinesses, farmers and cooperatives," they noted. Henrik Elschner Pedersen, IFC's Director for Manufacturing, Agribusiness, and Services in Africa, stated: "Digital technology can improve the operation of key supply chains in the food system by increasing production, enhancing business procedures, promoting traceability, and expanding access to finance. However, there is still a limited adoption of digital tools in the African agricultural sector, frequently due to infrastructure, affordability, awareness, and regulatory concerns. IFC and Microsoft are collaborating to change this so that more African agricultural players may benefit from the digital economy, he said. According to Microsoft ATO's managing director Kunle Awosika, regenerative agriculture, the use of "Nature-based Services," and burgeoning markets for carbon credits all create new prospects for farmers in the future. He added that strong management and reporting systems must support these new opportunities, and that the new set of digital tools specifically supports these systems. "By using digital channels, agronomic and business sensitive information is delivered directly to smallholder farmers to help improve productivity as well as mitigate the risks associated with climate change and unexpected weather events. Combined, the digital tools encourage improved farming practices, more sustainable and resilient farming practices and greater efficiencies in resource use," said Awosika. \</doc>

The 2022 edition of African Energy Week (AEW) ( HYPERLINK http://www.AECWeek.com www.AECWeek.com ) 2022 officially kicked off with opening messages given by a suite of high-level African energy ministers. Under the theme 'Exploring and Investing in Africa's Energy Future while Driving an Enabling Environment,' the opening ceremony &ndash; sponsored by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Limited &ndash; set the tone for the rest of the conference, with messages of making energy poverty history and creating an aligned message representing key themes of the opening session. Speakers included H.E. Gwede Mantashe, Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, South Africa; H.E. Bruno Jean-Richard Itoua, President of OPEC and Minister of Hydrocarbons of the Congo; Dr. Omar Farouk Ibrahim, Secretary General of the African Petroleum Producing Organization; H.E Yoweri Kaguta Museveni Tibuhaburwa, President of Uganda; H.E Filipe Nyusi, President of Mozambique; and Prof. Benedict Oramah, President of the African Export-Import Bank. The messages from the panel emphasized that AEW 2022 could not come at a more critical time for Africa's energy sector. With a series of large-scale developments underway, deals being signed and multi-sector projects being launched, Africa's energy sector is on the precipice of a revolution. "I am glad to join you at this important occasion. Energy is a necessity for the development of society, and for Africa, being the least developed continent in the world today, requires more energy. The discussion of energy access and development must therefore continue. So far, Africa has been the most important continent in terms of protecting the environment with current data showing that Africa's emissions are less than 3% of global emissions. For this, Africa should be applauded," stated H.E. Museveni. However, despite the success of reducing so few emissions, Africa still faces challenges of energy poverty and inadequate financing. In line with this, Prof. Oramah emphasized the need to scale up investment in Africa energy, stating that, "The AEW conference serves as an important platform for African countries to collectively articulate their position to share with the rest of the world at the COP27 event. Through this forum this week, the group of oil and gas producers will come up with a common message for going forward. We must not pursue decarbonization for the graveyard. Our transition must be sensible and pragmatic. It must address the development gap and the continent's ability to address climate change." Commenting on the need to improve financing, Dr. Ibrahim emphasized that, "Since the traditional financiers of oil and gas projects in Africa announced their commitment to ending fossil fuel financing in Africa, we have become very worried. Our economists and financial gurus have mostly failed us and the cost of this failure is easy to face. Capital can be found in many other places, including our own so-called poor countries. It is a matter of prioritizing our expenditure. Africa must begin to take its own destiny into its own hands. We cannot leave over 125 billion barrels of oil and 620 trillion cubic feet of gas stranded." As such, opening speakers emphasized the need for "A plan for Africa and energy issues in Africa. We are going to COP27 and I think it should be the starting point for having an African energy action place. This is the time to have an African voice to say what we really want, think and expect for our populations by using our natural resources, mainly oil and gas," stated H.E. Itoua. Meanwhile, H.E. Nyusi spoke about the impact the Russia-Ukraine conflict has had on global markets, stating that, "the suffocation that Africa is facing is not due to a lack of resources. Africa is home to 850 trillion cubic feet of gas in addition to other resources which can play an important role in addressing energy poverty. It is critical to continue reforming the regulatory environment in order to attract more investment. Finally, H.E. Mantashe delivered an opening address that centered on addressing energy poverty in Africa, stating that, "It is my honor to welcome you once again to this distinguished event that aims to make energy poverty history. It is an event where we recognize that energy is a catalyst for economic development and growth. Many people talk about 600 million without access to electricity, until we break that number down, then we are talking for sake of talking. Energy is more than just electricity. It is not only the connection that needs access, it is the ability to use electricity for cooking and heating and various other uses." With these remarks, AEW 2022 has officially begun, with an exciting deal-signing session set to follow the opening ceremony. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Week (AEW).

The Minister of Aviation Sen. Hadi Sirika has said Nigeria will soon get a national carrier. Sirika said this when he appeared before the House of Representatives Committee on Aviation for 2023 budget defense in Abuja on Tuesday. The Minister said that President Muhammadu Buhari was also expected to commission one of the two cargoes at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja in a few days time. Sirika said the national carrier would first concentrate on domestic operations before venturing into an international operation. According to him, the national carrier of Nigeria is on its way to be launched with Boeing 737 and followed by international operation. He said the aviation sector had recorded significant improvement in the last few years. He added that the Murtala International Airport, Lagos and Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja witnessed tremendous changes under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.

Sirika said that the contract for Cargo terminal at the airports were abandoned by the contractors, adding that the President directed that they be investigated, prosecuted and the monies recovered. He however, said, that because the ministry did not have prosecuting powers, it could not go ahead. ' We reported to EFCC now in the last three and half years, they confirmed to me that they have finished the investigation. This is worrisome.' Rep. Nnolim Nnaji, the Chairman of House committee on Aviation, said the budget defence was intended to have full year implementation report to guide the committee on the consideration of 2023 budget. He said the committee would within the the next few weeks embark on oversight of three international airport terminal slated for concession. 'The committee has noticed with great concern the omission of one of the critical security and safety agency of the ministry, the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency,' he said.

Bayelsa State Government has solicited assistance from the Federal Government, agencies of the United Nations(UN), International donors, multinational companies, and other relevant stakeholders in its efforts to mitigate the effect of the flood on the affected communities. The Secretary General of the All Africa Africa Association for Small and Medium Enterprises, (AAASME), who is also a Technical Advisor of Economic Development and Liason to the Governor of Bayelsa state, Dr Ebiekure Jasper Eradiri said the calls became imperative noting the impact of the flooding on the people. Eradiri who attributed the flooding to the impact of climate change on the country submitted that entrepreneurs in the state are worst-hit, as they lost their means of livelihood to the flooding Describing the natural disaster as a Triple C impact, the AAASME chieftain stressed the need for the global business community to rally around all the affected states in the country. According to him, 'Bayelsa state is blessed with natural resources and known to lead a positive drive for SMEs subsector as well as entrepreneurs. 'The global effect of Covid19 crisis and climate change considered as the triple C have impacted economic livelihoods, especially in the climax of ravaging floods which left severe damages, displacing about 1000 persons. 'The penultimate week before the flood disaster an economic conclave tagged Bayelsa to the World Expo; The Bayelsa Economic, Business and Investment Summit held in Yenagoa with the highlight being a presentation of a proposed private sector input for a 30-year economic development plan, this is a roadmap/ pathway to economic growth. 'Sequel to the outcome of the confab, activities towards realizing shared economic prosperity have been disrupted by the flood disaster emanating from climate change effects with Bayelsa state being the receiver of all flood waters flowing through to the Atlantic Ocean. 'It is imperative to invite independent assessment of the situation and a clarion call for global support to rebuild Bayelsa is in order at this time of ongoing COP27 event in Egypt. \</doc>

The African Development Bank ( HYPERLINK http://www.AfDB.org www.AfDB.org ) had several productive engagements around its strategic priorities at the just concluded 77th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) meetings in New York. Meeting highlights included an urgent call for increased financing to mitigate the effects of climate change and food insecurity. African Development Bank Group President Dr Akinwumi Adesina led the bank's delegation to the meetings and played an active part in discussions leading to an international declaration to end malnutrition and stunting. The bank's engagements reflect its strategic priorities as African countries, which it supports, struggle with the lingering impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as food and fuel price spikes arising from Russia's war in Ukraine, and climate change. Climate change was a recurring theme in many of the bank's UNGA discussions, especially the need for urgent financing for the countries most at risk from climate change. Climate change has assumed greater urgency with the next UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) due to be held in Sharm El-Sheik, Egypt in less than two months. COP 27 or "the African COP," as it is being called, presents an unprecedented opportunity for a unified African voice to demand that the global community move beyond talk to concrete action on financing for climate adaptation and mitigation. Speaking at the 2nd ministerial meeting on climate and development, Adesina joined US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry and other participants in urging developed countries to deliver on the pledges they made at COP26 in Glasgow last year, and under the 2015 Paris Agreement. John Kerry's words were unambiguous: "We are late. We must act. I'm fed up with saying the same thing too many times in the same meetings. Business as usual is the collective enemy. It's time for action," he told the meeting. Adesina echoed this call for urgent action. He warned: "Africa is suffering, Africa is choking, and is in serious financial distress for what it did not cause. There must be a greater sense of urgency, not in talking, but in doing and delivering resources that the continent needs very desperately." Click here ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3Ehj9IJ https://bit.ly/3Ehj9IJ The African Development Bank Group joined the Global Leadership Council in a new initiative to scale up clean, reliable energy and address global warming. As a first step, the Council will focus on efforts to break down barriers to just energy transitions in developing countries. While developing countries are currently responsible for only 25% of global CO2 emissions, this share could grow to 75% by 2050, according to an analysis published by the Alliance. Developing countries currently receive only a fraction of financing to develop clean energy, despite representing nearly half of the world's population. The General Assembly allowed the African Development Bank Group to demonstrate particular leadership in efforts to end hunger, nutrition, and stunting across Africa. Under the Presidential Dialogue Group on Nutrition, inspired by the African Union's designation of 2022 as the "Year of Nutrition," the African Development Bank Group head joined African presidents to sign a landmark commitment to stop childhood stunting. According to the Global Nutrition Report&mdash; considered the most comprehensive accounting of the state of nutrition worldwide&mdash;more than 30% of children in Africa are stunted. The Dialogue Group is an initiative of the African Development Bank's African Leaders for Nutrition platform, the Ethiopian government, and Big Win, a philanthropic organization. In addition to Ethiopia, the platform counts the leaders of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda among its members. The African Development Bank's African Emergency Food Production Facility featured prominently at the Global Food Security Summit. Senegal's President Macky Sall, chair of the African Union, commended the bank for its swift launch of the $1.5 billion facility to avert a looming food crisis. The program is facilitating the production of 38 million tons of food. This represents a $12 billion increase in output in just two years. In furtherance of the African Development Bank's Group's Jobs for Youth in Africa program to create 25 million jobs by 2025 and related initiatives, the Bank president participated in a high-level session to discuss the Global Accelerator on Jobs and Social Protection for Just Transitions ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3SVfKTX https://bit.ly/3SVfKTX Speaking at the session, UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres urged governments across the world to quickly invest in quality job creation and the provision of social protection for those without coverage. The session was also addressed by various leaders from around the world including the President of the African Development Bank Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, Malawi's President Lazarus Chakwera, Uganda's Vice President Jessica Alupo, and Egypt's Minister for Planning and Economic Development Hala El-Said. African Development Bank President Dr. Akinwumi Adesina said: "We have to restructure our economies to be productive with education, infrastructure, energy and making sure we have productive sectors that can use people's skills and absorb that into the economy." In the sidelines of the General Assembly, Adesina also led a bank delegation to the World Health Organization (WHO) for meetings. The two organizations agreed to work together on quality health care infrastructure, vaccines, essential medicines, nutrition, and the African Pharmaceutical Technology Foundation. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus congratulated the African Development Bank for birthing the Africa Pharmaceutical Technology Foundation, which he said "could help in market shaping for pharmaceutical products." Adesina also held bilateral meetings with Kenya's new president, William Ruto; American billionaire and philanthropist Michael Bloomberg; and former US President Bill Clinton and former US Senator Hillary Clinton.

As part of its commitment to ensuring sustainable and responsible production of oil palm, cocoa, coffee, rubber and other tree crops, the Edo State Government has signed the Africa Sustainable Commodities Initiative (ASCI) Declaration at the United Nations (UN) Conference ( CoP27 ) in Sharm el-sheikh, in Egypt. The Declaration was signed by members from ten countries in Africa, making Edo State the front-runner and only sub-national to seal this process. According to the UN Conference, the declaration is targeted at ensuring that producer countries in Africa are at the forefront of defining the principles for the sustainable development of cocoa, rubber, palm oil, coffee and other commodities in a way that protects livelihoods and protects natural resources including forests. The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, said the event is a call for stakeholders in the tree crop sector to ensure that more sustainable efforts are committed to avert the negative environmental and social impact of tree crop commodities production. The governor who was represented by the Acting Team Lead, Edo State Oil Palm Programme (ESOPP), Mr. Churchill Oboh, said, "Edo State has developed principles and actions for sustainable oil palm production which addresses issues relating to deforestation, biodiversity protection, respect of community rights. These principles will be extended in the development of other tree crop commodities in the state. "We are using this medium to encourage other states in Nigeria and other countries in Africa to ensure production of agro commodities are carried out sustainably and in line with global best practices." The signing of the Declaration took place at the Ghana pavilion and the signing was done by the Honourable Minister of Environment, Mohammad Abdullahi on behalf of Nigeria. The ASCI builds and expands upon principles agreed at CoP22 in 2016 for the palm oil sector. Nigeria's Minister of Environment, Mohammed Abdullahi said the Government of Nigeria is devoted to using oil palm development as a force to encourage reforestation, noting, "At the start of our journey in Edo State, it was agreed that any principles for sustainable oil palm development must include both oil palm and forestry companies, stressing the interconnected nature of the two sectors. "We want oil palm development to be a route to reforest Nigeria, not a cause for deforestation." \</doc>

The Federal Government is set to pioneer a voluntary Carbon Market on the continent. According to the government, the carbon market is a new and innovative climate change solution that will create, over the period of an energy transition, millions of new jobs in Nigeria. It stated that this is part of its effort to attain the global net-zero emissions target. A statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Office of the Vice President, Laolu Akande, revealed that the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, is a member of the recently formed international Steering Committee for the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative which is aimed at facilitating the emergence and growth of the market in Africa. It further stated that other members of the committee, which would be announced at the COP27 meeting in Egypt, are former President of Colombia, Ivan Duque Marquez; President of the African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina, among others, including officials of the United Nations, USAID, Gates Foundation, and other international private sector players. The statement read in parts, "ACMI's estimates suggest that Nigeria alone could produce up to 30 million carbon credits per year by 2030, which at $20/credit would be worth over half a billion dollars annually. \\xa0"The jobs would span the period of the energy transition, starting from the time the market is able to kickoff, till 2060." It said the committee will be inaugurated at the forthcoming International Climate Change Conference in Egypt. According to the statement, the Carbon Credit initiative will prioritise the use of environmentally friendly energy sources for domestic and industrial purposes. It added, "As part of this vision, Nigeria aims to pioneer innovative climate solutions that will benefit Africa and the world. One of these solutions is the production and sale of carbon credits, which have enormous potential for Africa that is only beginning to be explored." \</doc>

Last week, I wrote that Nigeria lacks sophistication for issue-based campaigns because, too often, politicians talk with utter ignorance yet arrogance on 'issues.' Without doubt, one major culprit is Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC), who often blusters and talks frivolously on issues. The latest victim of his verbal incontinence is climate change, an existential threat to Nigeria and many other countries. Recently, speaking at the interactive session of the Arewa Joint Committee in Kaduna, Tinubu made ridiculous and thoughtless comments about climate change. On the Richter scale of absurdity, his metaphor of 'church rat' and 'poisoned holy communion' was shocking. Describing climate change in Nigeria, Tinubu said: 'It's a question of how do you prevent a church rat from eating poisoned holy communion.' Obviously, the 'church rat' is Nigeria, which is Â£s poor as a church rat.' And the 'poisoned holy communion' is climate change, caused by burning fossil fuels, which may have immediate benefits but also come with devastating consequences. The short-term 'benefit' of burning fossil fuels is that they are cheap sources of energy, especially if a country has large reserves of coal, oil and gas. That 'benefit' is Tinubu's 'holy communion.' However, the 'holy communion' is 'poisoned' because fossil fuels are the drivers of climate change, which has wreaked havoc around the world, including in Nigeria. You must wonder which fantasy world Tinubu inhabits. Why would the West succumb to Nigeria's threat? Well, 'they will' because it's 'their' climate change. How utterly ridiculous! Some took offence at the religious insults in Tinubu's 'church rat' and 'poisoned holy communion' metaphor. But far more offensive is that, for someone who wants to be Nigeria's president, he lacks the capacity to think deeply about what he says, especially when he speaks extempore, unscripted. Essentially, Tinubu was saying that because Nigeria, the 'church rat,' is poor, it must 'eat poisoned holy communion,' that is, live with climate change and commit hara-kiri; after all, eating poison can kill! Well, it's worth noting that not every 'church rat eats poisoned holy communion.' Not every poor country chooses to live with climate change. For instance, Kenya is poorer than Nigeria, with a GDP of $98bn (2020), compared to Nigeria's $432.3bn (2020) and a GDP per capita of $1,550 (2020), compared to Nigeria's $2,097 (2020). Yet, Kenya has achieved real success on climate change. It set a target of 100 percent renewable energy generation and has nearly reached it. Why? Because it prioritises tackling climate change. But Tinubu displayed appalling ignorance on climate change. In the same Arewa forum comment, he said: 'We are a poor nation. They banned coal. They say firewood is not to be fetched. They say we need to plant trees and they are not giving us money.' Continuing, he said, 'We need to open our eyes. We need to tell the West, if they don't guarantee our finances and work with us to stop this, we are not going to comply with their climate change,' adding, with a dismissive shrug of his shoulders: 'They will do it.' Now, a key plank of Tinubu's campaign strategy is that he's clever and knowledgeable, and, thus, can solve Nigeria's problems. But smart people are not frivolous or reckless with words. So, how clever and knowledgeable is Tinubu? Well, to find out, let's unpack his climate-change comment! First, he said 'their' climate change, meaning the West's. He gave the impression that if Nigeria took action to tackle climate change, it would be doing so for the West's benefit, because, in his view, climate change is the West's problem, not Nigeria's! But really? Did Tinubu miss President Buhari's speech at the 26th United Nations ' Climate Change Conference , COP26, in Glasgow, United Kingdom, in November last year? Well, if he missed the statement, here's a key extract from it. 'I do not think anyone in Nigeria needs persuading of the need for urgent action on the environment,' President Buhari said at COP26, adding: ''Desertification in the North, floods in the centre, pollution and erosion on the coast are enough evidence.' Continuing, Buhari said: 'For Nigeria, climate change is not about the perils of tomorrow, but what is happening today.' So, which part of that statement does Tinubu disagree with? Does he disagree with Buhari on the devastating impacts of climate change in Nigeria? Extreme floodings are currently devastating lives and communities across Nigeria. Yet Tinubu went to Kaduna, one of the states badly affected by the floods, to spew utter gibberish about climate change. Tinubu said, 'We are not going to comply with their climate change.' Well, we've dealt with the use of the offensive word 'their.' But Tinubu's broader point was that Nigeria won't 'comply' with climate change rules, such as those agreed at COP 15 in Paris in 2015 and at COP 26 in Glasgow last year. But this exposes Tinubu's utter ignorance of Nigeria's international and domestic commitments. I mean, is Tinubu not aware that Nigeria pledged at COP 26 to reach net zero carbon by 2060? President Buhari declared at COP 26: 'Nigeria is committed to net zero by 2060.' Is Tinubu also not aware that, in November 2021, President Buhari signed the Climate Change Bill into law? That Nigeria now has a Climate Change Act that incorporates the 2060 net zero target? Furthermore, is he not aware that Nigeria recently launched the Energy Transition Plan (ETP), which has the twin-goals of tackling the climate crisis and energy poverty? So, would Tinubu throw all these commitments away if he became president? Well, he said he would first ask the West to 'guarantee our finances and work with us to stop this'. But if they don't give Nigeria money, 'we are not going to comply with their climate change.' He was confident the threat would work. 'They will do it,' he said matter-of-factly! You must wonder which fantasy world Tinubu inhabits. Why would the West succumb to Nigeria's threat? Well, 'they will' because it's 'their' climate change. How utterly ridiculous! He should ask the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, how far hectoring the West about 'just energy transition' and defunding fossil fuel projects has worked. Recently, Vice President Osinbajo went to the US to seek global support for Nigeria's Energy Transition Plan. He met with officials from the World Bank Group, the US Treasury, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and, ultimately, the US vice president, Kamala Harris, who praised Osinbajo's leadership on climate change. While in the US, Vice President Osinbajo floated the idea of a debt-for-climate-swap (DFC), under which the West would cancel Africa's bilateral and multilateral debts, and, in return, Africa would use savings from the debt relief to fund climate action programmes, such as Nigeria's ETP. Truth be told, the debt-for-climate-swap idea won't get traction with the West, due to their view about the moral hazard of debt forgiveness, and their antipathy to it. However, diplomatic efforts and rational advocacy for global partnerships and support are constructive ways of addressing the issue, rather than threatening that 'we are not going to comply with their climate change' if they don't give us money. But what about private finance? Tinubu claims he's a genius in attracting foreign investors. 'I brought Enron to Nigeria,' he brags. So, why can't he see the opportunities for climate investments? Last week, the International Finance Corporation, IFC, an arm of the World Bank, said Nigeria could get $70bn share of the $1trn climate change investment opportunity coming to Africa. Significant global private capital - about $25trn - is available for climate change investments, the question is how a country taps into it. Truth is, Nigeria needs international support to tackle climate change. Well, it won't get it by threatening the West, but by setting out credible plans to decarbonise its economy. That wisdom eludes Tinubu, who has an overblown sense of his own ability! \</doc>

African Development Bank (AfDB) President, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina has said that the right of African countries to use their natural gas reserves should be reflected in any deal at the COP27 climate talks, even as some nations push to see the use of the fuel curtailed. Agreeing on a deal on fossil fuels is among the key sticking points at the talks, with some countries including India keen on phasing down the use of all such fuels, including gas, sources said. A preliminary document from the conference hosts made no mention of fossil fuels, although it forms the basis of any agreement, the all-important final wording has yet to be hammered out. 'Africa must have natural gas to complement its renewable energy,' African Development Bank President Akinwumi Adesina said on the sidelines of the U.N. conference held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. He said even if Africa were to triple its production of natural gas from current levels, its contribution to global emissions would only rise by 0.67 percent. With the world currently on course to miss its climate goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average by mid-century, one focus at the conference has been on countries accelerating their shift to renewable energy. Dr. Adesina pointed out that the AfDB is seeking to raise $25 billion through the African Adaptation Acceleration Programme, the biggest created by any comparable lender. He added that it has also put 85 percent of its investments between 2016 - 2021 into renewable energy; still, natural gas is needed to balance out the electricity supply given the intermittent nature of renewables. 'We must recognise the special nature of Africa. Africa has the highest level of energy poverty in the world. My interest is how Africa uses natural gas as part of its energy mix to provide electricity for 600 million people today that don't have access to electricity,' Dr. Adesina said. Developed countries have emitted around 2,400 gigatonnes of climate-damaging carbon emissions, since the industrial revolution, leaving only around 400 gigatonnes left if the world wants to hit its temperature goal, Dr. Adesina further said. According to him, 'And so Africa, that did not really emit, should not now be penalised for not even being able to use a little bit of gas to complement its natural resources.' \</doc>

Nigeria, Sept. 12 -- "Gas is critical as a transition fuel to power Africa's industrialisation, solve energy poverty and generate resources for energy transition" is a phrase you would hear often at the Africa Pavilion at the UN's Conference of Parties (COP) or anywhere climate justice and energy transition is being discussed. In preparation for COP 27 , Nigeria's government recently launched its Energy Transition Plan (ETP), which is purported to be its homegrown, data-backed and multi-pronged strategy to achieve net zero emissions by 2060 while solving energy poverty and lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty. The ETP focuses on five critical energy sectors - Power, Cooking, Oil and Gas, Transport and Industry and is estimated to cost $1.9 trillion. However, there are critical questions that Nigeria's Energy Transition plan must grapple with if its success is anchored on gas being a critical transition fuel. Gas infrastructure is expensive and investments are interdependent. Who will finance it? Future gas demand is unpredictable. Where is demand going to come from? Nigeria's 2060 net neutrality goal. Is the ETP feasible? This article will consider each of these questions in turn. Gas infrastructure is expensive and investments are interdependent. Who will finance it? Gas infrastructure, from exploration to processing to transport and end use can be expensive. Each stage costs billions of dollars. Investments are also interdependent, in that exploration will likely not occur if processing, transportation and end use are not in place and vice versa. Therefore, new investments must be coordinated. International Oil Companies (IOCs) are walking away from new exploration and choosing projects more carefully. They are focused on producing assets, and exploration in countries where investment is cheaper and easier to implement. IOCs are even walking away from already-planned projects, and we have seen unprecedented $87 billion IOC write-downs, Q4 2019 - Q2 2020 (OPL 245) with many more divestments expected. Local companies, including NNPC/ NPDC, do not have the financial or technical resources to implement many of the projects, therefore, production costs will grow and production levels can be expected to decline. READ ALSO: Halt fresh oil licensing processes - Ijaw leaders tell Buhari Multilateral development finance institutions, along with US and EU governments' opposition to funding for gas projects on climate grounds are growing. So, most public funds for gas projects will likely come from a handful of Asian countries. Funding Nigeria's gas ambitions such as a trans-Saharan pipeline to export gas from Bonny to Europe through Niger and Algeria (estimated to cost $12 billion) or the Nigeria-Morocco pipeline (estimated to cost $25 billion) or any of the frontier exploration projects proposed under the Petroleum Industry Act 2022 will struggle to find financiers. The same is likely true of new gas-powered electricity generation and LNG terminals. Future gas demand is unpredictable. Where is demand going to come from? Gas demand from domestic and export markets is uncertain. The top export destinations for Nigeria's petroleum products (India, Spain, Netherlands, United States and China) have all announced ambitious carbon neutrality goals of between 2030 and 2050. This means that by the time exploration, and liquefaction or pipeline infrastructure construction is completed in about ten years, demand may have plateaued or plummeted. Domestic demand for gas is difficult to model and getting the demand and timing wrong can be costly. Gas supply contracts often come with penalties that can make over or under-supply costly. Domestic demand from the power sector faces several challenges as the sector grapples with lingering liquidity crises. Infrastructure and market required for industrial, cooking and transportation uses are yet to be developed to incentivise targeting those markets. Financiers will require firm offtake contracts for projects to happen so these investments have to be made concurrently. Under the ETP, Nigeria expects to spend $1.9 trillion between now and 2060 to meet its goals. The plan estimates that business as usual will attract about $1.49 trillion in investments leaving a deficit of ~$410 billion in "incremental funding", translating to an average of $10 billion per annum in incremental funding over the period. The authors of the plan see an opportunity here to create almost a million jobs in the process. The plan accounts for investments of about $405 billion in the power sector ($270 billion in generation and $135 billion in transmission and distribution), and between $3.5-12 billion investment in gas commercialization (exploration, production and transportation) and to end flaring by 2030. Details of other investments can be found in the investor presentation here. Toward COP27 , Nigeria is looking to raise an initial $23 billion for immediate investments. The central challenge is that this plan assumes that the gas infrastructure required, which could take up to 10 years to build, would be put up in record time (including financing, engineering and construction) in time for the markets (export and domestic) to still require the supply. It also assumes that all the segments of the plan, particularly the all-important transmission and distribution investments required to bring in more centralised power generation will happen in step (see more about the power sector challenges here). An audacious goal if you ask me, and I reckon most investors will think the same. Meeting Nigeria's 2060 net neutrality goal. Is the ETP feasible? Nigeria's Energy Transition Plan is ambitious, but is it feasible? If the ETP is followed, Nigeria will reduce emissions by first moving away from dirty fuels such as firewood, diesel and petrol to gas as a less dirty alternative in the transition to cleaner alternatives by 2060. The table below shows the path along the five relevant sectors: Nigeria's 2060 net neutrality goal: the path along the five relevant sectors These ambitious goals require that infrastructure be built at a pace unprecedented in developed countries let alone in Nigeria with the attendant investment risks and dearth of technical expertise, especially within the context of international oil company divestments. The goals would also require significant public acceptance, grassroots infrastructure in rural areas and grant funding to replace firewood with LPG and provide off-grid electricity to millions. The political will and capital to do this will probably have to come from a bipartisan agreement to sustain the plan regardless of who wins the presidential election and be translated to the state and local government levels - not a mean feat. The plan assumes that business as usual will generate $1.5 billion in financing, and only an incremental $410 billion additional is required. Given Nigeria's current fiscal state, and the reluctance of new capital investment in the light of the security and foreign exchange environment, it is unclear that the business-as-usual scenario is plausible, let alone the additional financing. Finally, the plan would require significant technology exchange. Technologies like the clinker method for cement production or hydrogen production, or even electric vehicles and their supporting infrastructure need to be localised urgently to meet the goal. The challenges to meeting the goals seem insurmountable, and the execution pathway would be vastly different from what the plan proposes in the face of market, financing and technological realities. But if we commit to these ambitious goals regardless of political expediency, nothing is impossible. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Premium Times.

Thailand has appointed the first Muslim woman governor, a sign of 'improvement of Muslim women in politics,' according to observers. Pateemoh Sadeeyamu, 57, has been appointed as the new governor of southern Pattani province. The Thai Cabinet approved the elevation on Tuesday. Has Buhari made Nigeria better than some developed countries, as claimed by Yahaya Bello? Preparation for 2023 hajj begins next month-NAHCON 'This is a huge development. Being a Muslim and a woman holds many challenges in Thai politics,' Yasmin Sattar, vice dean for Academic, Research and Foreign Affairs at Prince of Songkla University, Pattani, told Anadolu Agency on Wednesday. 'We could see the improvement of Muslim women in politics,' Sattar said of Sadeeyamu. Of the 77 provinces, four southern provinces of Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat, and Songkla have seen conflicts for several decades with National Revolutionary Front as the main rebel group. Sadeeyamu's elevation as provincial governor is seen as 'leading to the positive perception of many Muslims.' This could lead to more trust in the Thai state, which is crucial to ending the conflict, said Sattar regarding peace efforts between the Thai government and insurgent groups in the southern regions. Beginning her career three decades ago, Sadeeyamu served in the southern provinces of Ranong, Yala, and Pattani. She also served as director of a central administrative office of the Southern Border Provinces Administrative Centre before being appointed as deputy provincial governor of Phatthalung and later Narathiwat from where she was picked to head the governorate of Pattani province. The insurgency in southern Thailand originated in 1948 as an ethnic and religious conflict in the historical Malay Patani region. Southern Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat, and Songkhla provinces have a large Malay-Muslim community - Patani - with 1.4 million residents, according to government data. The Thai government imposed martial law in three Muslim-majority provinces in southern Thailand - Pattani, Narathiwat, and Yala - following deadly violence in 2004. According to the monitoring group Deep South Watch, more than 7,000 people were killed and 13,000 injured in the armed conflict from 2004-2020.

For 16-year-old Falimata, the impact of floods goes beyond the loss of property; it is the loss of schooling. In faraway Likdir - one of the hardest-hit communities by the catastrophic flooding in Yobe State, access to school was suddenly denied her and hundreds of her peers. According to her, this year's flood wiped away her parent's farm and blocked the road that led to her school. She said: 'We haven't experienced a large volume of flooding in our community before. This year's floods have destroyed homes, wiped away my parent's farm, and blocked the road that leads to our school. 'We don't have clean water. We have a shortage of food and have difficulty accessing medical services. I now stay at home without going to school and I don't know how long this will last. My dream is to be educated and support my community at large.' According to figures from the United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT), there were 1,424 schools potentially exposed to maximum flood water. A breakdown of the data of schools affected by flood state showed that 114 schools were affected by flood in Adamawa, 122 in Anambra; 103 in Bayelsa; 298 in Delta; 154 in Kogi and 142; and Rivers State. In the first week of October, the Bayelsa State Government ordered that public primary, secondary, and private schools in the state should stop academic activities for more than a month. The state government said the decision became necessary to protect the lives of instructors and pupils as floodwaters continue to inundate portions of the state. The Director, Planning, Research and Statistics in the Ministry of Education, Agala Damini, said on behalf of the Permanent Secretary that 18 schools in Kolokuma/Opokuma, Nembe, Ogbia, and Yenagoa Local Government Areas are expected to wait until Monday, October 10, before embarking on the flood break. The flood rapidly engulfed Adagbabiri, Swali, Azikoro, Amassoma, Agudama Epie, Igbogene, Sagbama communities, and Nembe Kingdom. This is not the first time the government would be closing down schools because of flood. In 2020, the state governor, Douye Diri, directed that schools in the state be closed due to rising flood waters that had taken over homes, schools and farmlands. He gave the directive after leading a team on a visit to some of the flooded communities in Yenagoa and the Southern Ijaw Local Government Area, claiming that the decision was taken to avert further danger to lives. Also, flood took over a Methodist Primary School at Agada in the Ipokia Local Government Area of Ogun State. It was learnt that the school, which is the only primary school in the community, had never been renovated, except for some interventions by the alumni association since it was founded in 1929. The buildings were said to be old and decrepit, with the classrooms leaking. The residents noted that the school lacked enough teachers and chairs for the pupils. A teacher revealed that many of her colleagues rejected postings to the school because of its condition and the distance of the community to the town. She said: 'I accepted the posting to this community because this is my home. Many teachers don't want to come here because it is far. 'When it is about to rain, we always ask the pupils to go home because of the leaking roof. There is nowhere you can hide when it rains here. Flood disturbs us and nothing has been done by the state government to renovate this school. It has remained like this since it was established.' A mother of three, Ajoke Shonde, who said all her children attended the school, lamented that the condition of the school had posed a high-risk for the pupils and the teachers. 250 schools destroyed - Save the Children International According to a humanitarian group, Save the Children International, widespread flooding over the past three months has thrown the lives of more than 1.25 million children in Nigeria off course. The organisation noted that no fewer than 250 schools in Nigeria have been destroyed and millions of people forced to flee their homes. It said flooding has taken a serious toll on children's learning. Globally, Save the Children explained that the widespread flooding over the past three months had thrown the lives of about 19 million children off course in the top five most impacted countries. It said children in Pakistan, Nigeria, India, Chad and South Sudan witnessed the most extensive flooding globally between August and October this year. 'Flooding in these five countries affected a total of 38.7 million people, according to The International Disasters Database, with thousands of people killed and millions displaced,' the organisation said. It added: 'In Nigeria, where about 19 million people were already experiencing crisis-levels of hunger or worse, extreme flooding has destroyed hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland. More than 1.25 million children have been affected by the worst floods to hit Nigeria in a decade. With at least 250 schools destroyed and millions of people forced to flee their homes, flooding has taken a serious toll on children's learning.' The devastating impact of this year's flooding has brought to attention once again, the issue of climate change. This week's COP27 summit holding in Egypt presents an opportunity to get the climate emergency under control. According to the group, the climate crisis is changing the world as we know it, with grave implications for children. One-third of the world's children population is living with the dual impacts of poverty and high climate risk, a recent Save the Children report said. The research also found that 80 per cent of children are estimated to be affected by at least one extreme climate event a year. The group's Global Director, Child Poverty, Climate and Urban, Yolande Wright, said: 'It is extremely alarming how many countries have suffered from record-breaking flooding this year, let alone in the past three months. When looking at the total scale of how the climate crisis is affecting children around the world, it is almost unimaginable. 'About 38.7 million people around the world have had their lives turned upside down by extreme flooding in the five worst affected countries, including about 19 million children. Many of these children are still reeling from the effects of the floods and require urgent assistance. ' COP27 Wright said it would take months, if not years, to repair the flood damage in all five countries. However, the scale of need required for sustainable and resilient reconstruction likely exceeds most of the countries available resources. 'Save the Children is calling on governments at COP27 to support the creation of a new loss and damage climate finance mechanism to help address the cost of the impacts of the climate crisis to children's rights. This includes supporting communities already hit by climate impacts.' Educationist speaks A Lagos-based educationist, Mrs. Dideolu Adekogbe, urged governments of flood ravaged states to plan an education intervention programme for the pupils to cover up. Adekogbe, who is the Lead Consultant, Flourish-Gate Global Consult and Convener, Bring Back Primary6 Movement, said: 'Yes, the flood has impacted education negatively and it's so devastating than COVID-19 because during COVID-19, people were in their homes but in this case of flood, families have been displayed from their natural homes to live like refuges and many could not even take anything. 'Most displayed people are accommodated in school facilities and learning is disrupted. 'So, the idea of online class doesn't apply here because devices may not be available, but what recommendation I will give is what I saw happening in Delta State, where classes are organised in small, groups/spaces in the camp. This may not be so structured, but it will be engaging. 'The government needs to be intentional in their care and love for the people. This flood is avoidable if government takes proactive steps. There are preventive measures that could have averted this incident but because of lack of value for the life of the citizen, they did nothing like building dams. This is really bad. 'For pupils to regain their lost grounds, the education ministry is expected to have relocated some of the pupils to no-flood zones with adequate provision of accommodation, feeding and clothing, so that learning can happen seamlessly. 'Government should plan an education intervention programme for the pupils to cover up, which means there should be an extended first term/ class. When the school vacates in December, classes should hold for such individuals. 'Government should not wait for calamities like this to plan. They should be futuristic because of the world we live in. Things are likely not going to be normal again and so, there must be plan to match up with incidences like a hybrid learning plan. There should be preemptive programmes of online learning going side-by-side the physical classes so that switching online will be easier.' \</doc>

It\' s eye-opening to consider that more than half of the world\' s best solar resources are in the Middle East and Africa (MEA). When you combine this vast untapped potential with a rapidly evolving renewable energy landscape, formidable people power from a growing youth population and thriving entrepreneurial scene, it\' s clear that MEA has an increasingly important role to play in innovating towards a way out of the climate crisis. There is a rousing incentive to act with urgency. Though MEA may have the lowest contribution to greenhouse gas emissions in the world, it\' s the most vulnerable region to the effects of climate change, especially Africa. Home to many of the planet\' s key suppliers of fossil fuels, the region is also pivotal in enabling the shift towards new sources of energy. Already, there is a huge focus from governments to invest in sustainability, and investment in clean energy from the UAE alone totals $40 billion. But much work is still be done at a far greater scale and that work is dependent on three things: people, money and digital technology and data. It\' s the cost-efficient and highly scalable nature of the cloud, for example, that enables energy startup, M-KOPA Solar, to manage the energy systems of half a million homes in East Africa, bringing affordable clean energy to around 2 million people. Technology is paramount, not only to the shift towards renewable energy, but to all aspects of climate adaptation.  The climate crisis is taking a significant toll on the Middle East and Africa. But we live in a new technological era with the potential to power dramatic transformation across every sector of society. Digital solutions offer a way to progress towards a greener and ultimately more prosperous future. Together, we find ourselves at a historic intersection of tremendous opportunity, says Sherif Tawfik, Chief Sustainability Officer, Microsoft Middle East and Africa. The exponential rate of technology adoption in the region will help drive this opportunity. Almost half of business leaders say more than 50 percent of their assets are in the cloud, meaning powerful foundations are already in place to create solutions to MEA\' s greatest climate change challenges. The agriculture industry, for example, sustains 70 percent ( HYPERLINK http://bit.ly/3AWiolE http://bit.ly/3AWiolE HYPERLINK http://bit.ly/3EPkhls http://bit.ly/3EPkhls The Kenyan National Agriculture Platform is working with Microsoft to drive digitalization of agriculture through an app called AgBot ( HYPERLINK http://bit.ly/3GWXDdk ). The AgBot is a one-stop-shop for half a million farmers where they can access services and information to increase their productivity. Further work is now being done on the app to incorporate data analysis for more informed decision-making. Further north in the UAE, multinational corporations like Etihad Airways ( HYPERLINK http://bit.ly/3ONn2Ii http://bit.ly/3ONn2Ii Implementing innovation at a greater scale It\' s clear enterprising organizations in MEA are already using technology for climate adaptation in exciting and impactful ways.

Download logo Today, World Bank Group President David Malpass visited the decommissioned Komati coal-fired power plant in South Africa. The visit follows the World Bank Group's Board approval last week of the Government of South Africa's request for a $497 million project to decommission and repurpose the Komati coal-fired power plant using renewables and batteries, while creating new opportunities for the affected workers and communities. This is Mr. Malpass's first trip to South Africa as World Bank Group President, and it comes ahead of COP 27 in Egypt. During COP 27 , President Malpass will highlight the World Bank's activities to integrate climate and development, the need for impactful investments in key systems transitions, including in the energy sector, and the importance of concessional and grant financing for developing countries as they undertake investments in global public goods to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To meet its climate change and energy security targets, the Government of South Africa is implementing the Integrated Resource Plan 2019, which aims to retire 12 GW of aging coal fired power plants by 2030 while installing 18 GW of renewables. The power sector is a major contributor to GHG emissions in South Africa, accounting for 41% of its CO2 emissions. "I am encouraged to see South Africa taking steps to produce more electricity while finishing the closure of the 60-year-old Komati coal plant. Moving toward an efficient lower carbon growth model will require large investments in new capacity and grid upgrades to absorb renewables. These are important steps to repair the ailing energy sector and provide reliable access to electricity for businesses and people," said World Bank Group President, David Malpass. "The Komati project recognizes the social challenges of the transition, especially for coal-reliant regions like Mpumalanga. Helping affected workers and communities is an important component of the project." The Just Energy Transition Project at the Komati coal fired power plant is a demonstration project that can serve as a model for future projects, in South Africa and around the world. It has three focal areas: mitigating climate change through reducing carbon emissions; improving energy security through repurposing the project area with renewables and batteries; and creating socio-economic opportunities for workers and communities impacted. The project will provide learning experiences through a cycle of piloting, monitoring, assessing, documenting, and information sharing on decommissioning and repurposing coal plants in a sustainable and inclusive manner. "We welcome President Malpass's visit to South Africa to support Eskom's project to decommission and repurpose the Komati coal fired plant. The program is in line with our broader Just Transition Framework recently endorsed by our cabinet. We cannot walk this road alone. The fact is that the poor and middle-income countries like South Africa will be disproportionately affected by climate change. The success of our ambitions will depend greatly on financial support from our global partners," said Enoch Godongwana, Minister of Finance for South Africa. The visit reaffirms the World Bank Group's commitment to partnering with South Africa for better development outcomes for all of its people. The World Bank Group remains the largest multilateral financier of climate action in developing countries, having delivered a record $31.7 billion for climate related investments in the 2022 fiscal year. This is complemented by the launch of Country Climate and Development Reports (CCDRs) as new core diagnostic reports that integrate climate change and development considerations which can help countries prioritize the most impactful actions that can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and boost adaptation, while delivering on broader development goals. For South Africa, the recently released CCDR shows that the country could achieve both its development and climate goals by embracing a triple transition that is low-carbon, climate-resilient and just.

James Cleverly, the UK's Foreign Secretary, revealed that a \Â£395 million investment in Propcom+ will help at least four million Nigerians, including two million women, increase productivity and adapt to the effects of climate change while lowering emissions at the ongoing COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The UK government's investment in agriculture through the Propcom Mai-karfi program in Nigeria is being built\\xa0 by Propcom+. The new \Â£395 million Propcom+ program will work to solve major obstacles to Nigeria's sustainable agricultural development. It will assist in the development of agricultural policies, initiatives, and investments that are climate resilient and that provide nutrition, boost production, adapt, and create resilience while lowering emissions and safeguarding and restoring natural ecosystems. The new Propcom+ program encourages the gradual transformation of Nigeria's rural economy in order to enable inclusive and resilient growth. The new initiative will increase rural communities' and small-scale farmers' ability for climate-smart agriculture. Together with Nigeria's thriving private sector, it will focus on agriculture to boost production, strengthen climate resilience, pursue lower emissions, prevent and reverse biodiversity loss, and address some of the root causes of violence and insecurity in Nigeria. Cleverly stated: "The Glasgow Climate Pact gave the world the tools to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees and build a secure and sustainable future. Now is the time for all countries to step up their action on climate change and deliver the tangible change needed. The UK will continue to play a leading role in this mission. The funding we have announced will support countries which are facing the devastating impact of climate change, to adapt effectively." Nigeria is very vulnerable to climate change and land degradation, according to Ben Llewellyn-Jones, the UK's deputy high commissioner in Lagos, Nigeria. "Climate risks are increasing, diminishing productive capacity, and contributing to worsening food insecurity. Farmers are on the front line and highly dependent on seasonal rainfall making them increasingly vulnerable to the changing and unpredictable climate." "Tackling climate change and biodiversity loss is a key UK international priority and we remain committed to supporting inclusive and climate resilient growth in Nigeria through the Propcom+ programme which will build on the successes and lessons from previous engagement and deliver on adaptation and resilience, and on nature for climate and people," Llewellyn-Jones added. \</doc>

It's eye-opening to consider that more than half ( HYPERLINK http://bit.ly/3tJNDfO http://bit.ly/3tJNDfO There is a rousing incentive to act with urgency. Though MEA may have the lowest contribution to greenhouse gas emissions in the world, it's the most vulnerable region to the effects of climate change, especially Africa. Home to many of the planet's key suppliers of fossil fuels, the region is also pivotal in enabling the shift towards new sources of energy. Already, there is a huge focus from governments to invest in sustainability, and investment in clean energy from the UAE alone totals $40 billion ( HYPERLINK http://bit.ly/3Fgb7Q4 http://bit.ly/3Fgb7Q4 But much work is still be done at a far greater scale and that work is dependent on three things: people, money and digital technology and data. It's the cost-efficient and highly scalable nature of the cloud, for example, that enables energy startup, M-KOPA Solar, to manage the energy systems of half a million homes in East Africa, bringing affordable clean energy to around 2 million people. Technology is paramount, not only to the shift towards renewable energy, but to all aspects of climate adaptation. "The climate crisis is taking a significant toll on the Middle East and Africa. But we live in a new technological era with the potential to power dramatic transformation across every sector of society. Digital solutions offer a way to progress towards a greener and ultimately more prosperous future. Together, we find ourselves at a historic intersection of tremendous opportunity," says Sherif Tawfik, Chief Sustainability Officer, Microsoft Middle East and Africa. The exponential rate of technology adoption in the region will help drive this opportunity. Almost half of business leaders say more than 50 percent of their assets are in the cloud, meaning powerful foundations are already in place to create solutions to MEA's greatest climate change challenges. The agriculture industry, for example, sustains 70 percent ( HYPERLINK http://bit.ly/3AWiolE http://bit.ly/3AWiolE HYPERLINK http://bit.ly/3EPkhls http://bit.ly/3EPkhls The Kenyan National Agriculture Platform is working with Microsoft to drive digitalization of agriculture through an app called AgBot ( HYPERLINK http://bit.ly/3GWXDdk ).

One of the key challenges for Africa in confronting the climate challenge is how to finance the necessary transformation of regional economies. Flows of climate finance from the Global North on the scale required remain more of a promise than a reality. Part of the solution, as obtained in other climes, is to unlock the vast potential of carbon markets. The realisation is dawning across Africa that private-sector-led, voluntary carbon markets represent a major opportunity to accelerate economic development and simultaneously curb greenhouse gas emissions. But seizing this opportunity will take thoughtful and deliberate action, including by African governments. That's why we're excited to be taking part in a new initiative to be launched at the COP27 Climate Summit at Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The African Carbon Markets Initiative seeks to support a dramatic increase in the production of African carbon credits while ensuring that carbon credit revenues are transparent, equitable, and create good jobs. Crucially, these must be high integrity credits that are used to supplement direct decarbonisation and which deliver real climate action. Global demand in VCMs (as measured by retirements of carbon credits) has nearly quadrupled in the last five years, driven principally by companies buying credits to help meet their climate pledges. Demand for African credits is also increasing, but from a low base, and the continent currently produces only a small proportion of its potential. Boosting the supply of credits would enable much-needed sustainable investment in sectors ranging from renewable energy and clean cookstoves to agriculture and forestry. Our experience(s) in government in Colombia and Nigeria show the potential of carbon markets, but also the hard work that will be required to realise it. The Colombian Voluntary Carbon Market Platform was launched in 2016 as part of a government effort to meet Colombia's climate targets by stimulating demand for carbon credits. Between 2016 and 2019, Colombian carbon credits grew more than four-fold to become a $20m market, leading to, among other impacts, the planting of over 180 million trees. But it didn't happen by accident. It was a top presidential priority and required extensive coordination across society, including collaboration with the Colombia Stock Exchange to begin carbon trading and the launch of the first green taxonomy in Latin America. In the same vein, Nigeria has its own ambitions to be a climate leader in Africa, set out in its 2021 Climate Change Act and commitment to net-zero by 2060. Last month, the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari(retd.), inaugurated Nigeria's National Council on Climate Change. The government is committed to using carbon credits as a tool for achieving Nigeria's climate goals while financing sustainable economic development. We estimate Nigeria could produce between 25 and 30 million tons worth of carbon credits annually by 2030, generating over $500m per year. The nascent carbon credit market faces numerous challenges to growth in many parts of Africa, including a lack of project developers capable of operating at scale, a complex regulatory landscape, inadequate methodologies for valuing and certifying credits, and concerns about integrity. The Africa Carbon Markets Initiative, where we sit on the steering committee alongside twelve other African leaders and carbon markets experts, will use COP27 to launch an initial road map for action to address these challenges that touch every part of the VCM ecosystem. One key focus will be supporting African governments in establishing voluntary carbon market country plans  along the lines of the successful effort undertaken in Colombia in recent years. Nigeria will be one of the first countries to launch a plan, with the goal of rapidly increasing the development and sale of carbon credits. These plans will aim to support carbon credit production by clarifying government responsibilities, setting out market incentives and establishing transparent regulation of the sector within the context of each government's commitments under the Paris Agreement on climate change. This latter point is of central importance. There has been some confusion around Paris Agreement rules on carbon credits, which state that when two countries trade carbon credits, to avoid double counting, only one of these two countries can use the credit towards their Nationally Determined Contributions  their target for reducing emissions. However, for sales to foreign corporations there is certainty: buyers can, with high integrity, use African credits without concerns around double counting. Our view is that this approach is fully in line with both the letter and the spirit of international climate agreements. This way, funding from foreign buyers in the VCM provides the resources to help African countries meet their NDCs, which they have made clear cannot be achieved without international financing. We recognise that some buyers may require a commitment that host countries will not use sold credits towards their NDCs, either to drive additional impact or to comply with regulations in their home countries. African countries can choose to make these commitments for a portion of credits produced, with an expected premium in price, but we do not believe they need to play a major role in corporate voluntary carbon credit use. The ACMI steering committee has set the ambition that 300 megatons of African credits will be retired annually by 2030  19 times the 2020 level. This sounds daunting, but actually it merely requires demand and supply to continue growing at roughly the rate they have been growing in recent years. By 2050, the committee has set an even more impressive goal of 1.5 gigatons, mobilising $120bn in capital annually. At this level, carbon markets would have become a major industry for the continent and could support over 100 million jobs. ACMI aims to eliminate the barriers to continuing growth, and we invite governments across the region to get behind its important mission.

The is boosting the promotion of resilient, green and sustainable growth, with the launch of the African Green Bank Initiative. The initiative, which was presented at the just-concluded UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt, will support the implementation of African countries' Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Part of the African Financial Alliance on Climate Change (AFAC), the Green Bank Initiative will be supported by the African Green Finance Facility Fund (AG3F). AG3F will provide technical assistance to governments and financial institutions in creating and capitalising green facilities, co-invest alongside those in green projects and provide de-risking instruments to increase private sector mobilisation. Launching the initiative, African Development Bank vice president for Energy, Power, Climate and Green Growth, Kevin Kariuki, said the African Green Bank model would help increase the continent's access to global climate finance. 'The Green Bank Initiative is a powerful tool for reducing financing costs and mobilising private sector investments in climate action in Africa,' Kariuki said. He said multilateral development banks and international financial institutions had a crucial role in enabling local financial institutions to develop a green pipeline of projects and ease their access to resources. The African Green Bank initiative, which will be endowed with a trust fund of $1.5 billion, was conceived as part of measures to facilitate access to global finance from the current three per cent to 10 per cent annually by 2030. Kariuki said the initiative was based on an assessment by the African Development Bank and the Climate Investment Funds on the potential of Green Banks in six African countries, namely Benin, Ghana, Mozambique, Tunisia, Uganda, and Zambia. 'The assessment revealed that green banks have significant potential for attracting new sources of catalytic funds when supporting low-carbon, climate-resilient development through blending capital and mobilising local private investment for green investments in Africa,' he said. Kariuki said the initiative would bolster the capacity of local financial institutions to build a robust pipeline of bankable green projects, while de-risking investments and entrenching long-term investor confidence toward climate-resilient and low-carbon projects in Africa. 'It will do so through investing in sectors such as energy efficiency and renewable energy, climate-smart agriculture, resilient infrastructure, and nature-based solutions,' he said. African countries still face significant challenges in financing their climate transition. While investment needs resulting from NDCs are estimated at $2.8 trillion by 2030, funds invested on the continent still represent a limited share of global green finance flows, and the share covered by the private sector remains limited. \</doc>

Today, Francesco La Camera, the Director General of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and Gerd M&uuml;ller, the Director General of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) have signed a joint declaration on advancing sustainable energy through the fundamental role of green hydrogen. In their statement made at the UN Climate Change Conference COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, both Organisations' leads declare to jointly advance the transition towards sustainable energy through green hydrogen in pursuit of access to energy, energy security and economic development. Francesco La Camera, IRENA Director-General said: "The world is still not on track to achieve universal access to sustainable and affordable energy by 2030. Globally, 733 million people still have no access to electricity. This is not acceptable. By partnering with UNIDO, we want a change and facilitate greater international collaboration to amplify ambition and accelerate progress. Advancing the transition to renewables and green hydrogen is a strategic choice to bring affordable energy, jobs, economic growth and a cleaner environment to the people and communities on the ground." "Energy is the basis for all development. It is the decisive motor," said Gerd M&uuml;ller, UNIDO Director General. "Green hydrogen is an immense opportunity, especially for developing countries. With their vast renewable energy potential, many can be green hydrogen producers. This is the chance for low-carbon industrialization, and jobs for millions of people. The efforts of UNIDO and IRENA are complementary. We support an energy transition and must make sure that it is a just transition. Developing countries need the inputs from our two organizations to make this happen." Concretely, both sides agreed to facilitate information exchange amongst key stakeholders and develop effective enabling mechanisms for green hydrogen production and its industrial up-take within the framework of UNIDO's Global Programme for Green Hydrogen in Industry, IRENA's Coalition for Action and the global Alliance for Industry Decarbonization. They will also develop joint knowledge products to inform policy makers to foster the business case for green hydrogen. Cooperation on stakeholder and outreach activities relating to green hydrogen aims at supporting countries' pathways to net-zero and accelerate economic transformation.

African leaders on Monday called on their counterparts from richer, polluting nations to increase funding for projects to help them adapt to climate change. Countries on the continent are seeking to raise $25 billion of investments in the next three years for adaptation projects, including improving agricultural resilience and updating infrastructure. "If we want our continent to thrive, we have to adapt to climate change \- and to achieve this, adaptation financing needs to start flowing at scale," Ghana President Nana Afuko-Addo told the Africa Adaptation Summit in Rotterdam on Monday. The African Development Bank said it had already committed half the amount needed for the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Programme. They were looking for the world's big polluters to step in. Britain, Norway, France, and Denmark announced $55 million in new contributions on Monday. But Senegal's President, Macky Sall, said he was disappointed by how few of their leaders had turned up for the event. "I cannot help but note with some bitterness the absence of leaders from the industrial world," said Sall, who is also chairperson of the African Union. "I think if we made the effort to leave Africa to come to Rotterdam, it would be easier for the Europeans and others to be here because they are the main polluters". Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte was the only European leader to attend in person, alongside heads of state from Senegal, Ghana, Gabon, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ethiopia. World powers meeting in Glasgow last year pledged to double the funding for such "adaptation projects" for developing countries to around $40 billion a year by 2025. They are expected to meet again in two months time in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt for the UN climate summit COP27 \- dubbed "the African COP" \- with climate finance a major focus. (Reuters/NAN) \</doc>

United Nations Secretary-General, Ant\'f3nio Guterres, has reiterated his stance that the world is fast slipping away from the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celcius, adding that a new approach is needed for the goal to be attained. Guterres has therefore proposed a Climate Solidarity Pact with the world's most developed countries, known as the G20, who are meeting at the G20 Summit in Bali, Indonesia, on Monday. He said, 'Our world is facing the most pivotal, precarious moment in generations. People everywhere are getting hit from every direction - battered by runaway climate change and squeezed by a cost-of-living crisis. Geopolitical divisions are triggering new conflicts and making old ones even more difficult to resolve. The G20 is ground zero for bridging divisions and finding answers to these crises and more. First, climate - the defining challenge of our age. I have just come from the COP27 Summit in Sharm el-Sheikh. The goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees is slipping away. We are dangerously close to tipping points at which climate chaos could become irreversible. Science tells us that global heating beyond that limit poses an existential threat to all life on earth. But global emissions, and temperatures, continue to rise. I tend to agree that insanity consists in doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. We need a new approach.' Guterres added that he has 'proposed a historic pact between developed and emerging economies - a Climate Solidarity Pact that combines the capacities and resources of developed and emerging economies for the benefit of all. G20 countries are responsible for 80 per cent of global emissions. G20 leaders can make or break the Climate Solidarity Pact. 'Under this pact, they would make extra efforts this decade to keep the limit of 1.5 degrees alive. Wealthier countries and international financial institutions would provide financial and technical assistance to help emerging economies accelerate their renewable energy transition. The Climate Solidarity Pact can save lives, livelihoods, and our planet. 'It can help end dependence on fossil fuels while providing universal, affordable, sustainable energy for all.' He also spoke on the war in Ukraine and the attendant energy crisis. He said the crisis is an opportunity for the fastest transition to renewable energy. He said, 'On energy, the war in Ukraine has clearly demonstrated the dangers of our addiction to fossil fuels. It is the best possible argument for the fastest possible transition to renewable energy.' The European Union and 19 other nations make up the G20, sometimes known as the Group of Twenty. It strives to address important global economic concerns like international financial stability, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and promoting sustainable development. \</doc>

The Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, on Wednesday, called for a $10bn initial support package for Africa to meet its year-on-year investment target in renewable energy. This was as he said Africa's increasing energy gaps require decisive and urgent collaboration to take ownership of the continent's transition pathways. According to a statement signed by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande, Osinbajo made the argument in his remarks delivered at the global virtual launch of Nigeria's Energy Transition Plan, a roadmap to tackle the dual crises of energy poverty and climate change. The statement is titled 'Osinbajo launches FG's energy transition plan as Nigeria seeks $10b initial support package.' The Vice President noted that Nigeria would need to spend $410bn above business-as-usual spending to deliver its Transition Plan by 2060, which translates to about $10 billion per year. Therefore, "the average $3bn per year investments in renewable energy recorded for the whole of Africa between 2000 and 2020 will certainly not suffice," he said. Related News Osinbajo inaugurates new National Council on Infrastructure Surgery: Lawan wishes Osinbajo quick recovery Surgery: NMA commends Osinbajo's confidence in health sector Highlighting the need for a peculiar transition plan, the Vice President said "for Africa, the problem of energy poverty is as important as our climate ambitions. Energy use is crucial for almost every conceivable aspect of development. "Wealth, health, nutrition, water, infrastructure, education, and life expectancy are significantly related to the consumption of energy per capita." He revealed the government's current efforts in this regard saying, "we have an inter-ministerial Energy Transition Implementation Working Group, which I chair. "We are currently engaging with partners to secure an initial $10bn support package ahead of COP27 along the lines of the South African Just Energy Transition Partnership announced at COP26 in Glasgow." Nigeria Country Director for World Bank, Mr. Shubham Chaudhuri, said the bank plans "to commit over USD 1.5 billion towards the Energy Transition Plan on renewable energy, on power sector reforms, on clean cooking, and wherever opportunities arise." \</doc>

The Pop Beach Club, conveners of the Rite on the Beach Festival, has said the Nigerian waterways were in need of healing, noting that the plastic waste which has found its way into the ocean can cause existential threats for humans. The Founder, Rite on the Beach Initiative, Akintunde Disu, disclosed this in an interview with our correspondent during the Annual Beach Clean-up Exercise which took place at the Ilashe and Ibeshe beaches at the Western Peninsula of Lagos. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, at least 14 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every year, and plastic makes up 80 per cent of all marine debris found from surface waters to deep-sea sediments. Sunday PUNCH reports that marine species ingest or are entangled by plastic debris, which causes severe injuries and death. Speaking, Disu said the country was in a pollution quagmire and the ocean has been overrun with plastics that are generated from the cities. He said, "As we all know, we are facing an extinction crisis. So, we are only trying to get prepared because there will be winners and there will be losers. As terrible as it sounds, it brings a lot of opportunities. COP27 "The floods that have just happened have shown us that it is only going to get worse if no action is taken. This is why we are devoted to bringing about behavioural change and trying to solve these problems. We believe that it is only communities that can solve these problems." The beach cleanup is the start of an initiative called Ocean Guardians by Rite on the Beach. According to Disu, the initiative seeks to socialise the cleaning up of the beach responsibly. The Right on the Beach Festival is an annual academic festival that seeks to use science and research combined with community action to galvanise young scholars to understand the threats and opportunities surrounding climate change and global warming providing base data to support the need to take urgent action to build up resilience for future generations. It kicked off with a symposium on Monday, November 14, 2022, titled, "Flight or Flourish", which addressed issues around climate change as an existential crisis. The guest speakers discussed issues such as conservation, ecotourism, financial markets and Web 3 Development. \</doc>

The Federal Government has concluded plans to formally inaugurate the National Climate Change Council and its Secretariat, pursuant to the Climate Change Act 2021. The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), had in November 2021, signed the Climate Change Bill into law. This was the basis for the establishment of the climate change council. A statement released by the presidency revealed the government's approach to mobilising Nigerians to transition the country to a low-carbon economy and society in line with global best practices. It read, "The Climate Change Act 2021, signed into law by President Buhari on November 2021, provides an overarching legal framework to achieve Nigeria's long-term climate goals. These goals include meeting Nigeria's Nationally Determined Contributions; among which is President Buhari's pledge, at the COP 26, for Nigeria to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2060.

"The act thus requires a whole-of-government approach to mobilise all Nigerians to transition our country to a low-carbon economy and society. The NCCC is the implementing body charged with superintending the CCA and coordinating government and society in transitioning to a low carbon economy. "Given the existential import if its mandate, it necessarily transcends any single government ministry, department or agency. The council is thus a reflection of this. It comprises broad membership from government, organised labour, the private sector and civil society. The NCCC is supported by a secretariat that is headed by a Director General. "As part of the process of putting this implementing mechanism in to effect the government is aware of the need to promptly appoint a director general to lead the secretariat upon inauguration. Hence the president's directive to screen the recommended candidates, from whom the pioneer director general will be unveiled and announced." The statement concluded \</doc>

Despite the promise of a worldwide green recovery in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments around the world spent $18trillion on fossil fuel subsidies between 2018 and 2018 a figure that dwarf record growth in renewables within this period, a new report tracking renewable energy report said. It warns that the global clean energy transition is not happening, making it unlikely that the world will be able to meet critical climate goals this decade, as the second half of 2021 saw the beginning of the biggest energy crisis in modern history, exacerbated by the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, and unprecedented global commodity shock creating an energy crisis that seemed to have shifted focus away from clean energy goals. Issued by REN21, a global community of renewable energy actors from science, academia, governments, non-governmental organisations and industry, REN21's Renewables 2022 Global Status Report (GSR 2022), is the the 17th consecutive edition with over 650 experts in 55 countries participating. According to the authors, the report provides proof of what experts have been warning about: the overall share of renewables in the world's final energy consumption has stagnated - rising only minimally from 10.6% in 2009 to 11.7% in 2019 - and the global shift of the energy system to renewables is not happening. 'Although many more governments committed to net zero greenhouse gas emissions in 2021, the reality is that, in response to the energy crisis, most countries have gone back to seeking out new sources of fossil fuels and to burning even more coal, oil and natural gas,' said Rana Adib, REN21 Executive Director. In the electricity sector, record additions in renewable power capacity (314.5 gigawatts, up 17% from 2020) and generation (7,793 terawatt-hours) were unable to meet the overall increase in electricity consumption of 6%. In heating and cooling, the renewable share in final energy consumption increased from 8.9% in 2009 to 11.2% in 2019. In the transport sector, where the renewable share went from 2.4% in 2009 to 3.7% in 2019, the lack of progress is particularly worrying, as the sector accounts for nearly a third of global energy consumption, the report said.

Lip service to climate commitments The report noted that while 135 countries pledged to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 only 84 of these countries had economy-wide targets for renewable energy, and only 36 had targets for 100% renewables. The United Nations Climate Change Conference Despite important green recovery measures in many countries, the strong economic rebound in 2021 - with global real gross domestic product (GDP) growing 5.9% - contributed to a 4% rise in final energy consumption, offsetting the growth of renewables. In China alone, final energy consumption rose 36% between 2009 and 2019. Most of the increase in global energy use in 2021 was met by fossil fuels, resulting in the largest surge in carbon dioxide emissions in history, up more than 2 billion tonnes worldwide, the report said. The report stated that the Ukraine war exacerbated a global energy crisis, creating windfall profits for fossil fuel companies while billions of people face the threat of energy poverty. The year 2021 also marked the end of the era of cheap fossil fuels, with the largest spike in energy prices since the 1973 oil crisis. By the end of the year, gas prices reached around ten times the 2020 levels in Europe and Asia and tripled in the US, leading to a spike in wholesale electricity prices in major markets by the end of 2021. The Russian's Federation's invasion of Ukraine deeply aggravated the unfolding energy crisis, causing an unprecedented commodity shockwave that weighed heavily on global economic growth, rattling the more than 136 countries that are reliant on fossil fuel imports. 'The old energy regime is collapsing before our eyes - and with it, the global economy,' said Adib. 'Yet crisis response and climate goals must not be in conflict. Renewables are the most affordable and best solution to tackle energy price fluctuations. We must boost the share of renewables and make them a priority of economic and industrial policy. We can't fight a fire with more fire.' The report urged policy makers to regard the Russian threats to halt critical exports of natural gas and oil, particularly to Europe as an opportunity to transition to renewables. To address the crisis, the European Union and national and local governments have updated clean energy targets and pushed numerous measures to accelerate the energy transition, yet they also continue to subsidise fossil fuels. It said the coal, oil and natural gas industries have been the main beneficiary of the energy crisis and governments' responses, gaining both profits and influence. The GSR 2022 documents that despite renewed commitments to climate action, governments still opted to provide subsidies for fossil fuel production and use as their first choice to mitigate the effects of the energy crisis. Between 2018 and 2020, governments spent a whopping USD 18 trillion - 7% of global GDP in 2020 - on fossil fuel subsidies, in some cases while reducing support to renewables (as in India). This trend reveals a worrying gap between ambition and action. It also ignores the many opportunities and benefits from transitioning to a renewable-based economy and society, including the ability to achieve more diversified and inclusive energy governance through localised energy generation and value chains, the report said. Countries with higher shares of renewables in their total energy consumption enjoy greater energy independence and security. 'Instead of putting renewables on the back burner and relying on fossil fuel subsidies to reduce people's energy bills, governments should directly finance the installation of renewable energy technologies in vulnerable households. In the end, the renewable energy path will come out cheaper, despite the upfront investment,' said Adib. 'We call for short- and long-term targets and plans to shift to renewable energy, coupled with clear end-dates for fossil fuels,' said REN21 President, Arthouros Zervos. 'The uptake of renewables must be a key performance indicator across all economic sectors.' 'The energy transition is our lifeline,' said Spanish Vice President and Minister for the Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, Teresa Ribera. 'It will enable innovative business models and forms of organisation, transform value chains, redistribute economic power and shape governance in new, more people-centered ways. With the right investments in technology, renewables are the only energy sources offering every country in the world a chance for greater energy autonomy and security.' \</doc>

Nigeria's Vice President Yemi Osinbajo says only strong partnerships and coordination among African countries can guarantee the mobilisation of resources required for a just energy transition. Osinbajo's spokesman, Laolu Akande, in a statement on Wednesday in Abuja, said the vice president sent a recorded message to an African Union event at the ongoing CoP27 in Egypt. The message was for the unveiling of the 4D Digital Green Industrial Corridor and launch of the African Union Transition Fuels Oversight and Regulatory Management Accelerator (TRANSFORMA). TRANSFORMA is a 4D initiative to fast-track the Digital Green Industrial Corridor between the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) member states. According to the vice president, the case of the African continent, particularly with respect to the just energy transition, is cogent and irrefutable. "Tackling the combined challenges of COVID-19 recovery, climate change and overall sustainable development requires significant resources that can only be delivered through strong partnerships and coordination. "For instance, the Climate Policy Initiative estimates that Africa needs about 2.8 trillion dollars between 2020 and 2030 to implement our Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. He said that it was exciting to see that the launch came as other initiatives such as the African Carbon Market initiative was being announced. "Many of our challenges and priorities are shared. African governments are tasked with eradicating poverty, providing opportunities for our expanding populations, delivering robust healthcare solutions and unlocking prosperity for future generations. "Beneficial role of Pan-African cooperation on these issues has been established. "Reports from the World Bank estimate that the AfCFTA could raise income on the continent by over 450 billion dollars by 2035 and lift 50 million people out of extreme poverty. Importantly, the continent could see foreign direct investment increase by between 111 per cent and 159 per cent under the AfCFTA. "Maximization of this potential which is what the 4D Digital Green Industrial Corridor and TRANSFORMA propose to do must be a priority", Osinbajo said. He emphasised the need for stakeholders to be united in order to attract more attention. Other leaders who spoke at the event included President Felix Tshisekedi of the Democratic Republic of Congo and President Hakainde Hichilema of the Republic of Zambia. \</doc>

We will take a quick look at some of the critical figures and data in the energy markets. We will then look at some of the key market movers early this week before providing you with the latest analysis of the top news events taking place in the global energy complex over the past few days. We hope you enjoy. f66a7bc4 fcf00abf Chart of the Week Russian Oil Exports Remain Robust Despite Headwinds - The prospect of EU sanctions kicking in soon has so far failed to dent Russian crude exports as seaborne flows rose to 3.1 million b/d in October, up 3% on the month and in line with pre-war figures. - Total exports to EU countries have reached 800,000 b/d, slightly above pre-February levels, however, most of those deliveries have gone to the Mediterranean. - At the same time, Russia's product exports have been declining as exporters struggle to compete with Asian and Middle Eastern refiners, with the Asia pivot mostly limited to fuel oil so far. - With the foreign ministers of India and Russia meeting this week, the former's top diplomat Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said India will continue buying Russian oil because it benefits the country. Market Movers - U.S. energy company Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) is reportedly seeking to sell its 50% stake in the Cove Point liquefied natural gas facility in Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, worth several billion dollars. - U.S. oil major ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) is set to take upto a $2 billion loss on the Santa Ynez offshore oil and gas field in California, idled since 2015 after a pipeline spill. - The German government seems to be inclined to block the Chinese takeover of a chip factory owned and operated by Elmos (ETR:ELG), the first European intervention in the semiconductors industry. Tuesday, November 08, 2022 China first giveth but then it taketh away, if one could recap happenings in the oil market over the past couple of days. The pre-weekend surge in oil prices, driven by reports that Beijing is working on a plan to soften zero-COVID restrictions with the aim of easing day-to-day business operations, was first beaten down by top officials scorching the speculation and then aggravated by surging COVID cases in the country. Amidst expectations of a U.S. crude stock build-up last week, the second half of this week might not be that rosy for oil. Island States Want Big Oil to Pay for Climate Damage.The start of the COP27 climate summit in Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh saw leaders from poor countries criticizing oil companies for driving global warming, saying they should pay the damages as the 'planet is burning'. Will There Be No More Drilling? A campaign rally held in New York state witnessed U.S. President Biden saying there will be no more oil drilling on federal land and in federal waters, meaning that despite the IRA deal with Senator Manchin the White House remains intent to halt leasing. IMF Calls for $75/MT Carbon Price. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the price of carbon needs to be at least 75 per metric ton globally by the end of this decade if climate goals are to succeed, setting the tone for the recently launched COP27 climate talks in Egypt. China Hope Propels Copper Higher. Having registered the single largest one-day gain since January 2009 last Friday, up 7.1% that day, copper prices remain supported on hopes of China gradually easing its zero-COVID restrictions despite ongoing case spikes, trending at $7,880 per metric ton. A quarter of U.S. Coal Plants Gone by 2030. Accordingto the US Energy Information Administration, 23% of the currently operating 200GW of coal-fired generation capacity will be phased out by the end of this decade, pressured by more price-efficient renewable energy sources and natural gas. Egypt Doubles Down on Wind Farms. The governments of Egypt and the UAE agreed to build one of the world's largest wind farms in Egypt, with the 10GW capacity assumed to produce 48 GWh of clean energy annually, offsetting some 10% of the country's current CO2 emissions. Guyana Wants More From New Blocks. Guyana will offer 14 new offshore exploration blocks, three of them deepwater, in its new licensing auction coming up, having revamped upstream terms to a 10% royalty rate (five times what ExxonMobil has) and a 10% corporate tax rate. Trinidad Asks for U.S. Sanction Waiver. The government of Trinidad and Tobago has asked the White House to authorize Venezuelan gas imports to restart an idled liquefaction train in the Caribbean islands, with a view to tap production from the stalled 4.2 TCf Dragon field. No Easy Job of Freeing a Grounded VLCC. Indonesian authorities have stated it could take up to a month to free a recently sanctioned Djibouti-registered supertanker that ran aground off the country's Riau Islands in late October, presumedly carrying Iranian crude. New Gas Discovery in Offshore Israel. Mediterranean-focused oil company Energean (LON:ENOG) madeanother commercial gas discovery offshore Israel, with the Zeus-01 exploration well hitting a structure that is estimated to contain more than 13 bcm (0.5 TCf) of recoverable gas reserves. Canada Wants to Tax Share Buybacks. The federal government in Canada intends to introduce a 2% share buyback tax in a move expected to increase its revenue by 1.6 billion across five years, however industry associations warn such a move would impact investment decisions from 2024 onwards. Corruption Undergirds Mexico's Flaring Problem. According to the latest reports, Mexico's national oil company PEMEX struck a deal with the country's energy regulator in 2016 to invest over 3 billion to fix its flaring problems, however, walked away from the deal and keeps on flaring huge quantities. ENI Resumes Venezuelan Oil Deliveries. Italy's oil major ENI (BIT:ENI) has been assigned two 1-million-barrel cargoes for November loading in Venezuela, after a four-month hiatus resuming its oil-for-debt deal that was authorized by the U.S. government earlier this year.

Nigeria, Oct. 22 -- In arguably one of the most successful Nigerian albums released in 1989, which made waves all through the 1990s, titled Ace by afro-juju creator, Sir Shina Peters (full name Oluwashina Akanbi Peters), 'seven' is projected as a lucky number. On many fronts also, the number seven is believed to be unique and magical. There are seven continents, seven days in a week, seven colours that make up the rainbow, and so on. Nigeria's Fourth Republic, which started in 1999, will see citizens go to the general polls for the seventh time in 2023 to elect the president, federal legislators, governors in 28 states, and legislators in 36 states. This is the second time in the election cycles in which the incumbent president will not be running for office, as he will be completing the two maximum statutory terms of four years each. This, therefore, makes the election an important one, owing to the current state of affairs of the nation. With public campaigns by political parties officially commencing, according to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), a few weeks ago, voters have a chance to listen to the plans of the candidates on a host of issues. Top on the national agenda is insecurity and economic matters. For instance, data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) shows that Nigeria recorded 12,665 security-related attacks between 2015 and June this year, with 32,694 deaths - the highest ever recorded under any dispensation. Although Nigeria's lot improved on the Global Terrorism Index (GTI), ranking as the sixth country most impacted by terrorism, having occupied the fourth position since 2017, it can be argued that terrorism is just one area of concern when dealing with insecurity. The September inflation rate, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), hit 20.77%, making it the highest since September 2005, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasting it to rise to 22% due to increasing food and energy prices. Several factors contributed to the issues citizens have grappled with and now is the time to ask relevant questions from the candidates vying for elective positions, both at the federal and state levels. The issue of climate change is not usually a priority during campaigns and election debates. So, the response of the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was interesting to note during the Arewa Joint Committee interactive session with presidential candidates, and it generated reactions on the basis of his metaphor of "preventing a church rat from eating a poisoned holy communion." A video clip of the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) has also surfaced online, in which he stated that "we can't be talking about climate change when people are taking cover from bombs." This clearly shows that the political class is somewhat disconnected from the realities of climate change. It is instructive that both comments are connected to Nigeria's economic status as a developing country and the heightened insecurity issues that have overwhelmed authorities. Every stakeholder in Nigeria - politicians, policymakers, the media and citizens - must understand that the issues affecting the country today have some roots in years of inadequate and proactive response to the impacts of climate change. In the 1960s, Lake Chad was one of Africa's largest freshwater bodies and a source of livelihood for about 30 million people. The water body has dried up by 90% since then, due to overuse and the effects of climate change. Inadequate planning and alternatives led to the loss of farmlands in Nigeria and farmers became less and less able to have a means of livelihood. With the absence of vegetation, herders also began moving away more from the core north for grazing purposes. This was what led to the clashes between farmers/dwellers and herdsmen in North Central Nigeria. When the loss of livelihoods of Northern farmers intersected with forced child marriages and a high birth rate, it was only a matter of time before Nigeria's poor infrastructural development over the years caught up with a population that increased by 161 million between independence and 2020. It was only a matter of time before out-of-school children grew up to become a massive and willing recruitment pool for terrorists and bandits. We need not mention that reduced production of food crops economically meant the country has had to import most of what the population would consume, thereby weakening the naira. Year after year, flooding, which is one of the many results of climate change due to rising sea levels, has repeatedly occurred. The recent episode that has ravaged 31 states, killed over 500 people and displaced over one million, reminds us that more needs to be done to adequately adapt to climate change. When COVID-19 became a pandemic, some world leaders were vocal about holding China responsible for this, because if it had managed the outbreak better locally, it would have not turned into a global crisis. While this debate was ongoing, countries rolled out plans to ensure the pandemic was contained. The use of face masks, observation of physical distancing, lockdowns and so on were activated worldwide, before vaccines were approved. So, climate financing for developing countries, on one hand, is rightly a top issue in the climate change conversation but on the other hand, adapting to the impact of climate change relies on proper government policies and leadership. In a nutshell, waiting for the global North to take responsibility for financing climate change mitigation and adaptation alone cannot be the strategy of a serious presidential candidate on climate change. According to the United Nations (UN), climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, mainly caused by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels. The burning of these fuels, like coal, oil and gas, generate Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the earth, trapping the sun's heat and raising temperatures. The top five emitters of carbon dioxide (C02), one of the GHGs, and the primary driver of global climate change globally - China, the US, India, Russia and Japan - account for 58% of the total emissions. Also, while the top 10 GHG emitters contribute over two-thirds of global emissions, the 54 countries in Africa contribute less than 4% of global emissions. Therefore, the world cannot successfully fight climate change without significant action from the top 10 emitters. We must hold these nations responsible for emitting GHG in quantum numbers, but it goes beyond this. According to the World Bank Groundswell reports, by 2050 Sub-Saharan Africa could see as many as 86 million internal climate migrants (moving within their countries' borders) in the absence of urgent global and national action to mitigate climate change. At the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in Glasgow, President Buhari pledged that Nigeria will attain NetZero (zero carbon emissions) by 2050. The question of 'how' must be asked towards the elections because 85 million Nigerians do not have access to grid electricity. This represents 43% of the country's population and makes Nigeria the country with the largest energy access deficit in the world, according to the World Bank. Those on the grid suffer from epileptic supply and grid collapse, with a large population depending on petrol and diesel-powered generators. Coastal communities in Nigeria are suffering from the impact of climate change. In some cases, contracts awarded under the shore protection and erosion control programmes, never saw the light of day, with several billions of naira disappearing. The Ayetoro and Abari communities in Ondo and Delta States are case studies reported in the media. If the global North shows up with finance, what will the funds be used for? How is Nigeria implementing the revised Nationally Determined Contribution document submitted to the UN in 2021 subnationally? How is Nigeria responding to drought, and desertification, which contributes to the insecurity and insurgency in Northern Nigeria? How is waste disposal being treated subnationally and what are the steps taken to nip in the bud sand mining and illegal logging activities leading to deforestation? These and much more are the burning issues tied to the climate change subject. The current administration had a three-point agenda when canvassing for votes in 2015 - security, building a sustainable economy and fighting corruption. It is ironic, therefore, that climate change is interwoven with all three. The sooner the right questions are asked and political office seekers come up with actionable plans on climate change towards the seventh general election cycle since 1999, the better for Nigeria to mitigate and adapt to its impact.

Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, has called for a wider use of gas as a replacement for "dirtier fuels", saying doing so would "arrest deforestation while ensuring that the country has the necessary energy baseload for industrialisation." Receiving the United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate Change, John Kerry, on Tuesday night at the State House, the VP said other developing countries would also benefit from the adoption of gas as a transition fuel. "The use of gas as a transition fuel would not only help in stemming deforestation, it would also advance Nigeria's broader development goals, especially because Nigeria has one of the largest gas reserves in the world," a statement signed on Wednesday by the Senior Special Assistant to the Vice President on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande, read. According to the statement titled &lsquo;Energy Transition: Why Nigeria should benefit more from its gas reserves, by Osinbajo,' the VP highlighted the need for Nigeria to continue the exploration and use of gas as a way of arresting deforestation, transiting from dirtier fuels such as diesel, kerosene and petrol, while at the same time ensuring that the country had the necessary energy baseload for industrialisation. Noting that Nigeria had one of the largest gas reserves in the world and should benefit from its exploitation, Osinbajo also highlighted the significance of Nigeria's Energy Transition Plan, which was Africa's first. IBM named technology partner for COP27 IBM, UN partner for climate change conference US plans $12bn for climate action in Nigeria Before the US trip a fortnight ago, the Federal Government had launched the Energy Transition Plan at a global virtual event. In addition to a review of the Energy Transition Plan, including a discussion about its implementation, both Osinbajo and Mr Kerry also discussed the issues of renewable energy sources and the global transition. In his remarks, Mr. Kerry spoke highly of the plan and also for the efforts already being made in Nigeria to step up the use of renewables, especially solar and hydropower, as major components of the energy mix. \</doc>

Download logo Today, President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi received Prime Minister of Italy, Mrs. Giorgia Meloni, on the sidelines of the COP27 World Climate Summit. The Spokesman for the Presidency said President El-Sisi welcomed the Italian Prime Minister's visit and her participation in the Climate Summit. The President congratulated her once again on assuming her post recently, expressing his appreciation for the extended bilateral relations between the two countries. He looked forward for Prime Minister Meloni's visit to Egypt to give new impetus for developing these relations, which are based on deep historical ties with political, economic, security and cultural dimensions. The Italian Prime Minister affirmed her country's mutual keenness to strengthen bilateral cooperation with Egypt, which would open up prospects for construction and achieve the common interests of the two friendly countries and peoples. Prime Minister Meloni stressed that for Italy and the European continent Egypt represented a pivotal pillar for security and stability in the Middle East and the Mediterranean Basin. The meeting focused on ways to develop economic, trade and investment relations, in addition to joint industrial cooperation with Italy. Joint cooperation in the file of energy security was also discussed. It is considered one of the most important paths of partnership between the two sides during the past years, particularly through the partnership with Eni company in the field of natural gas. The talks also touched on the possibility of implementing electricity interconnection with Italy, to capitalize on the rich and diverse capabilities in Egypt, which will contribute to addressing the challenge in Europe and most world countries to deal with the energy crisis. Visions were also exchanged regarding coordinating efforts between Italy and Egypt as a leading partner of the European Union in the fight against illegal immigration. The Italian Prime Minister commended Egypt's efforts in this regard, which contributed to preventing the departure of any illegal immigration boat from Egyptian coasts since 2016. President El-Sisi affirmed Egypt's readiness to cooperate with the relevant Italian agencies in this regard, based on Egypt's full commitment to combating this phenomenon. The meeting tackled the latest developments in issues related to Mediterranean security, mainly the Libyan file. The two sides agreed on the need to work to preserve the unity and sovereignty of Libya, and push for holding presidential and parliamentary elections, preserving national Libyan institutions, and strengthening the role of security authorities in combating terrorism. The talks also touched on the issue of the Italian student "Regeni ", and cooperation in order to reach the truth and achieve justice.

They are falling like ninepins, and the Tories have now given the weary people of Britain yet another prime minister. And what a catch: stupendously wealthy, youthful &ndash; the youngest in two centuries &ndash; and a lawbreaker. As Chancellor of the Exchequer in the government of Commons that he had attended no illegal gatherings. The statement released in response to the fine was ice cool, belying the fact that he had become the first Chancellor ever charged with an offence while in office. &ldquo;I understand that for figures in public office, the rules must be applied stringently in order to maintain public confidence.&rdquo; He respected &ldquo;the decision that has been made and have paid the fine.&rdquo; The outcome was always likely: not paying could have landed him in an even stickier situation. Being sly with regulations is obviously something that runs in the family. Sunak&rsquo;s wife, Akshata Murty, ran into some trouble earlier this year when attention was brought to her non- the Indian IT giant Infosys, from which she received &pound;11.6 million in dividend income last year. Declaring one&rsquo;s domicile to be in another country can be a fine money saver: in this case, &pound;2.1 million a year. But Murty wanted to be generous and gracious &ndash; at least for her husband&rsquo;s political ambitions. &ldquo;I understand and appreciate the British sense of fairness and I do not wish my tax status to be a distraction for my husband or to affect my family.&rdquo; The new prime minister&rsquo;s coming to power is a perfect statement of the leader estranged and continentally distant from voters, a person evidently bored by his time as a banker and keen to make a showing in parliament. &ldquo;In his technocratic aloofness,&rdquo; George Eaton suggests, &ldquo;Sunak resembles an IMF official poised to impose a &lsquo;structural adjustment programme&rsquo; on a stricken developing world economy.&rdquo; The analogy is not out of place, given what Trussonomics has done to Britain in a matter of weeks. While Sunak distanced himself from his predecessor&rsquo;s loopy variant of steroid-fed Reaganomics, the inner Thatcherite&rsquo;s heart continued to beat to the rhythm of nostalgia. As Thatcher&rsquo;s own Chancellor, Nigel Lawson, said of Sunak, he was &ldquo;the only candidate who understands Thatcherite economics.&rdquo; He is, to illustrate the point, very much in favour of fiscal tightening and keeping public spending thin, and, like the Iron Lady he so adores, happy to tout tax rises if needed. Thatcher, it should be remembered, raised the Value Added Tax (VAT) from 8 per cent to 15 per cent and imposed the infamous poll tax otherwise advertised as a &ldquo;Community Charge&rdquo;. chosen words of a leaked video, &ldquo;shoved all the funding into deprived urban areas&rdquo;, it was make sure areas like this are getting the funding they deserved.&rdquo; The area in question was the During Sunak&rsquo;s tenure and the &ldquo;levelling up&rdquo; programme of Johnson, the wealthiest parts of Britain received amounts of money up to 10 times more per capita than the poorest, showing how Tories can be socialistic to the class of their own choosing. Sajid Javid&rsquo;s wealthy constituency of Bromsgrove in Worcestershire was earmarked to receive &pound;15 million, or &pound;148 a head. Eight local authorities counted as some of the poorest in Britain received less than &pound;10 a head from levelling up funds. His economic embrace of Brexit was filled with hubristic assessments, some of this evident in a report authored for the Centre for Policy Studies in 2016. &ldquo;Brexit will provide the UK with new economic freedom, and the Government should take the opportunity to create Free employment regionally where it is most needed, and promote trade.&rdquo; The report obsesses over the presence of 3,500 Free Trade Zones spread across the globe, with the US deserving a special mention: 250 FTZs &ldquo;which employ 420,000 people and handle &pound;750bn of merchandise.&rdquo; Airy predictions about what free ports would do to the unshackled British economy are offered, including 86,000 jobs &ldquo;if they were as successful as the US Foreign Trade Zone programme.&rdquo; Such a rarefied market world says little about civic duties and citizenship. It speaks volumes that Sunak expressed scepticism about lockdowns and has preferred to take climate change less seriously than others, even within his own party. The issue of whether planning permission is going to be given to opening the UK&rsquo;s first coal mine in a generation &ndash; in Sunak even had to be persuaded to change his mind attending the upcoming COP27 conference to be held in Egypt. On Twitter, he rationalised his about face, characterised by Green MP Caroline Lucas as a &ldquo;screeching U-turn&rdquo; on the climate change conference: &ldquo;There is no long-term prosperity without action on climate change. There is no energy security without investing in renewables.&rdquo; The change of heart suggested a weakness to the Labour opposition. &ldquo;The prime minister,&rdquo; according to the party&rsquo;s climate policy spokesperson Ed Miliband, &ldquo;has been shamed into going to COP27 by the torrent of disbelief that he would fail to turn up.&rdquo; The only reason for still much time for the markets, and everybody else, to be spooked.

Cecilia Ologunagba The United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Saturday highlighted the importance of a single global economy as geopolitical divides threaten to spark new conflicts and make older ones harder to resolve. Guterres said at a press conference in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh that the global economy could not afford to be split into two opposing camps. The UN chief was speaking to journalists a day after addressing regional leaders attending the 12th Summit between the UN and the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). "As I told yesterday's summit meeting, we must avoid at all costs the division of the global economy into two parts, led by the two biggest economies the United States and China," he said in a statement. "Such a rift, with two different sets of rules, two dominant currencies, two internets, and two conflicting strategies on artificial intelligence, would undermine the world's capacity to respond to the dramatic challenges we face." He said ASEAN countries were well placed to bridge this divide, stressing that "we must have one global economy and global market with access for all. " The UN chief also reported on some of the issues discussed at the summit, including the situation in Myanmar which he described as "an unending nightmare for the people of that country, and a threat to peace and security across the region." Myanmar's military seized power in February 2021 and since then, the country has been in the grip of a political, human rights and humanitarian crisis. Guterres said ASEAN had taken a principled approach to the issue through its Five-Point Consensus. The plan was adopted in April 2021 and calls for an immediate cessation of violence, constructive dialogue among the parties, the appointment of a Special Envoy, the provision of humanitarian assistance, and a visit to the country by the Special Envoy. "I urge all countries, including ASEAN members, to seek a unified strategy towards Myanmar, centred on the needs and aspirations of the country's people," he said. The war in Ukraine, the global energy and food crisis, and the climate emergency were also on the agenda at the day-long summit. "In these turbulent times, regional organisations including ASEAN are essential to building global solutions," Guterres said. The secretary-general travelled to Cambodia from Egypt, where the COP27 UN climate change conference is taking place. Guterres is calling for a Climate Solidarity Pact for developed and emerging economies to combine resources and capacities to defeat climate change. He is also pushing for leaders to reach an agreement on a financial mechanism to support countries that suffer loss and damage from climate-related disasters. The UN chief will travel next to Bali, Indonesia, for the G20 summit of the world's major economies, which begins on Tuesday. \</doc>

The British Deputy High Commissioner to Nigeria, Mr Ben Llewellyn-Jones, has disclosed that Nigeria is among the top 10 of the world's most climate vulnerable countries, though contributing one per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. He made this known at a Media Dialogue in commemoration of the International Day for Climate Action organised by the Deputy British High Commissioner in collaboration with Sterling One Foundation recently. The theme of the Day was "The Transition to a Circular Economy- Partnerships to Solve Pressing Challenges." Llewellyn-Jones said that Coastal states face extensive risks from storm surges, with inland flooding and pollution prevalent in the Niger Delta region; gully erosion in the southeast, and chronic aridity and riverine flooding in the North. He said that the middle-belt is at risk to aridity, compounded by high-tensions between farmers and pastoralists (land rights, water access). He listed agriculture, water and the health sectors as key sectors impacted by climate change in Nigeria. "70 per cent of the populations rely on climate-dependent resources. Just about 55 per cent of the 200m plus population have access to electricity. "Fuel wood and charcoal are the major sources of energy for the rural population," Llewellyn-Jones said. He noted that the deforestation rate in the country was over 3.7 per cent per annum. He said that from 2013 to 2020, 99 per cent of tree cover loss in Nigeria occurred within natural forest. "With Nigeria's population set to double to 400 million by 2050, without action to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change in Nigeria, there will be increased pressure on natural resources (resulting in conflicts) and emissions profile. "As well as climate impacts such as flooding which in 2022 has impacted 31 of 36 states, affecting over 1.4m people, displacing 808,000, and leaving over 300 dead. "The impact of climate change without action could cost between six per cent and 30 per cent of Nigeria's GDP by 2050. "COP26 which the UK hosted in Glasgow in November 2021 concluded with 197 Parties agreeing the Glasgow Climate Pact, reaching consensus on the need for urgent climate action," Llewellyn-Jones said. He said that the text of the Pact saw Parties address the issues important to African countries, including strengthening international cooperation on adaptation and loss and damage and urging developed countries to at least double adaptation finance by 2025. "Our COP Presidency will end in November 2022. "Our objective in 2022 was to maintain the momentum that parties built at COP26, and use this to support success in other key fora - including the 15th Conference of Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity or CBD COP15 which will hold in December 2022 in Canada. "We have been working closely with the incoming-Presidency of COP27 , Egypt, to build a partnership that aligns priorities and plans, secures the legacy of the Glasgow Climate Pact and delivers impact and progress on the Paris Agreement goals in Sharm el-Sheikh at COP27 ," Llewellyn-Jones said. He said that the global context has changed but the goals are ever more urgent: According to him, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has thrown into stark relief the link between climate change, energy security and the vulnerability caused by our reliance on fossil fuels (and volatile markets). "The media must also take up its responsibility as gatekeepers and the fourth estate of the realm to advocate for and educate every Nigerian on the importance of climate action," Llewellyn-Jones said. Also speaking at the event, Chief Executive Officer(CEO), Sterling One Foundation, Mrs Olapeju Ibekwe, said that the recent flooding across some states in the country was a sad reminder of the devastating effects of climate change. According to her, communities in eight Local Government Areas in Anambra were completely submerged by flood two weeks ago, causing huge economic and human losses. "As we are gather in this room today, thousands of people are displaced and unimaginably distressed in Lokoja, Kogi states where homes, business investments have been lost," " It is reported that 76 people died in Anambra trying to escape the flood," Ibekwe said. While reeling data from the National Emergency Management Agency ( NEMA), Ibekwe said that human loss to flooding in 2022 alone had been put at 500 deaths and I, 546 injuries. According to the CEO, the media has a special role to play in reporting responses to the rising incidences of flooding, heatwave, water shortage, deforestation and other consequences of climate change. Ibekwe said that the International Day for Climate Action was set aside to take stock of the progress achieved and to appraise the rest of the journey with a view to determining the most effective steps to achieve the global goal of cutting emissions and going green. She said that the state of the Climate in Africa 2020 Report warned of the continent 's disproportionate vulnerability. She said that the report estimated that by 2030, up to 118 million extremely poor Africans would be exposed to droughts, floods and extreme heat. "The report estimates that the investment in climate adaptation for sub Saharan Africa would cost between 30 to 50 dollars each year over the next decade or roughly two to three per cent of GDP. "Enough to spark job opportunities and economic development while prioritising a sustainabie and green recovery. "There has never been a more urgent need to revive damaged ecosystems than now and we need urgent action to address these pressing issues. "We must shift from harming the planet to healing it. "Unfortunately, in Nigeria, we still experience ignorance, apathy, carelessness, and lack of sustained commitment when it comes to issues around climate change," Ibekwe said. She said that the role of the media in communicating climate change and actions, effectively breaking down the implications and setting agenda was more critical now than ever. Ibekwe said that time was running out and nature is in emergency mode " To keep global warming below 1.5 degrees this century, we must halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. "Without action, exposure to air pollution beyond safe guidelines will increase by 50 per cent within the decade and plastic waste flowing into aquatic ecosystem will nearly tripple by 2040," Ibekwe said. \</doc>

President Muhammadu Buhari Wednesday in New York expressed his confidence that Nigeria's energy transition plan would put the nation on the path of prosperity and guide the rapid expansion of related industries, with 840,000 jobs created by 2060. President Buhari stated this at a closed-door meeting with the Secretary General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. He revealed that a careful implementation would create significant investment opportunities as it will engender the establishment and expansion of industries related to solar energy, hydrogen and electric vehicles. 'It will guide Nigeria's rapid transition to renewable energy and result in significant job creation with up to 340,000 jobs created by 2030 and up to 840,000 jobs created by 2060 driven mainly by power, cooking and transport sectors.' He restated the commitment of the Nigerian government towards ensuring that there is a rapid and strategic transition to renewable energy in response to the world-wide efforts for the preservation of the environment. Highlighting some of the details in the plan, the President said that through the use of emerging technologies and alternative fuels such as hydrogen, bioenergy and waste-to-energy, a pathway would be created for accelerated decarburization of energy systems and harnessing of new and diverse technologies towards low carbon development while aligning to our broader developmental aspirations in a fair and just manner. The plan has also sets out a timeline and framework for the attainment of emissions reduction across five key sectors, including power, cooking, oil and gas, transport and industry. The President added that, 'gas will play a critical role as a transition fuel in Nigeria's net-zero pathway, particularly in the power and cooking sectors. 'The clean energy goals of the plan include modernizing the power sector with large-scale integration of renewable energy, enhancing energy efficiency and conservation; and is expected to generate 250 gigawatts of installed energy capacity with over 90% made up of renewables.' He commended Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi for his tireless efforts in the preparations for the COP27 coming up in November, this year and assured him of the support of the Nigerian Government. \</doc>

As the impact of climate change becomes more severe, IBM - COP27 technology partner has announced the new members of its global pro bono social impact program - The Sustainability Acceleration Program. The new members are United Nations Development Programme, Sustainable Energy for All, Net Zero Atlantic, Miyakojima City Government, and Environment Without Borders Foundation. Through the IBM Sustainability Acceleration program, the organisations will be supported to accelerate the transition to clean energy for vulnerable populations. 'With the IBM Sustainability Accelerator, we are convening experts and using innovative technologies to help tackle the toughest environmental challenges our planet faces; and transitioning to clean energy is a critical step right now,' said Justina Nixon-Saintil, vice president of Corporate Social Responsibility and ESG at IBM. 'With this new cohort, helping marginalized communities get just and equitable access to sustainable energy resources not only helps the world achieve the goal of UN SDG7 but can help in the larger global energy transition.' The program will apply IBM technologies, such as hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence, and an ecosystem of experts to enhance and scale projects focused on populations vulnerable to environmental threats, including climate change. IBM has previously announced it plans to select five organizations for this program each year and expects to provide $30 million worth of services by the end of 2023. After evaluating more than 100 submissions from around the world, IBM selected the organizations that were chosen as the clean energy cohort. The selection process considered the applicant's commitment to supporting communities that are especially vulnerable to environmental threats, its ability to increase access to affordable clean energy services, and its strategic focus and transparency on measurement and reporting, among others. UNDP will work with IBM to increase access to sustainable, affordable, and reliable energy in African countries, focusing on those furthest left behind. Sustainable Energy for All will work with IBM to build an intelligent model to project energy needs based on current and future human activity. Net Zero Atlantic is collaborating with IBM to create an interactive digital tool that will geospatially display the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of possible energy system futures for Nova Scotia. The Miyakojima City Government is working with IBM to support the development of a renewable energy strategy including a microgrid on Miyakojima Island, a distant community facing severe climate issues due to typhoons in Japan. Environment Without Borders Foundation's collaboration with IBM will be aimed to develop a platform to forecast, track, and communicate clean energy usage options in Egypt. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, disruptions to global supply chains, and diversion of fiscal resources to keep food and fuel prices affordable have affected the pace of progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 7) of ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. \</doc>

The UK Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly, has announced as part of UK adaptation-related actions a \Â£395 million Propcom+ investment that is set to benefit at least four million Nigerians, including two million women, to increase productivity and adapt to the effects of climate change while at the same time reducing emissions. He made the announcement on Monday at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Propcom+ is an eight-year, UK International Climate Finance programme supporting climate resilient and sustainable agriculture. Propcom+ builds on the UK Government investment in agriculture through the Propcom Mai-karfi programme in Nigeria. A statement from the British Deputy High Commission in Lagos, stated that this new \Â£395 million Propcom+ programme is set to help address key barriers to sustainable agricultural development in Nigeria. It will support the development of climate-resilient agricultural policies, actions, and investments that deliver nutrition, increase productivity, adapt and build resilience while reducing emissions, and protect and restore natural ecosystems. For example, through the adoption and scaling of practices such as heat and flood tolerant crop varieties and integrated soil fertility management. The new Propcom+ programme involves supporting inclusive and resilient growth by promoting the progressive transformation of NigeriaSpound Ss rural economy. The new programme will build the capacity of small-scale farmers and rural communities in climate smart agriculture. It will work with NigeriaSpound Ss vibrant private sector on agriculture to increase productivity, improve nutrition and food security, enhance climate resilience, pursue lower emissions and halt and reverse biodiversity loss, as well as helping to tackle some of NigeriaSpound Ss underlying drivers of conflict and insecurity. Cleverly said: Spound oeThe Glasgow Climate Pact gave the world the tools to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees and build a secure and sustainable future. Now is the time for all countries to step up their action on climate change and deliver the tangible change needed. The UK will continue to play a leading role in this mission. The funding we have announced will support countries which are facing the devastating impact of climate change, to adapt effectivelySpound UK Deputy High Commissioner in Lagos, Nigeria, Ben Llewellyn-Jones said: Spound oeNigeria is extremely vulnerable to climate change and land degradation. Climate risks are increasing, diminishing productive capacity, and contributing to worsening food insecurity. Farmers are on the front line and highly dependent on seasonal rainfall making them increasingly vulnerable to the changing and unpredictable climate. Spound oeTackling climate change and biodiversity loss is a key UK international priority and we remain committed to supporting inclusive and climate resilient growth in Nigeria through the Propcom+ programme which will build on the successes and lessons from previous engagement and deliver on adaptation and resilience, and on nature for climate and people.

Nigeria, July 4 -- The Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) has entered a joint venture pact with Dutch energy and commodity trader Vitol to plough an initial $50 million into projects targeted at cutting back carbon emissions in Africa's biggest crude producer. The duo is setting sights on projects of high integrity and huge impact and with potential for carbon avoidance and removals, according to a statement seen by PREMIUM TIMES. NSIA and Vitol are stepping up efforts to collaborate with domestic non-governmental organisations with experience of having completed similar projects that have had proven social impact and furthered the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. The initiative aims to garner "voluntary market carbon capital from the partners and the third parties" in a bid to support the drive towards a more equitable energy transition on the continent and provide sustainable climate solutions for all. "NSIA is committed to playing a leading role in advancing climate solutions that help to lower Nigeria's carbon emission as an integral part of ESG strategy," said NSIA CEO Uche Orji. READ ALSO: Reps panel threatens to stop funds to NSIA over budget row "NSIA expects that its partnership with Vitol will be key to establishing and accelerating carbon reduction and avoidance in Nigeria by providing an enabling platform to trade carbon credits, while channelling investments in sustainable projects to deliver emissions reduction results." Carbon credit, a tradeable permit that enables the holder to emit a particular quantity of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases, is one of the latest financial products used by the global energy industry to fight climate change. Last week, Africa's seventh biggest oil producer Gabon said it hopes to sell 90 million of the 187 million carbon credits it plans to create between now and the COP27 meeting scheduled for November in Cairo. That is worth $275 million in money terms. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Premium Times.

The International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Microsoft, through its Africa Transformation Office (ATO), have partnered to promote food security and agriculture, leveraging digital transformation platforms. The partnership, which was showcased in a session during Adaptation and Agriculture Day at COP27 in Egypt, follows from the United Nations identification of Zero Hunger as one of its Sustainable Development Goals. This goal, according to a statement by Microsoft in Lagos, seeks to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. The IFC -Microsoft partnership, the statement reveals, makes digital tools and training resources more accessible to small-scale farmers and agriculture-linked small businesses, adding that a suite of digital agriculture solutions has been put in place to address capacity constraints and inefficiencies in the supply chain of African agribusinesses. 'The partnership is delivering digital agriculture products that support African agribusinesses to strengthen food security and develop greater resilience against climate change,' says Kunle Awosika, Managing Director for Microsoft ATO. Awosika noted that agriculture contributed about 25 percent of Africa's GDP and 70 percent of its employment, pointing out however, that the supply chains of many agribusinesses in Africa were fragmented and suffered from poor information flows. Read also: How to utilise UK global talent visa's opportunities - Adesemowo He added that many farmers relied on traditional agronomic practices and technologies that were under increasing pressure from climate-related shocks. 'Digital technology can improve the operation of key supply chains in the food system through greater agricultural efficiencies, improved business practices, traceability, food safety and, access to finance,' he said. 'Through the partnership, digital tools such as Microsoft's AgBot and community training applications are integrated with IFC's Agribusiness Leadership Program to provide better information, newer technologies, and management capacity training to agribusinesses, farmers and cooperatives. Henrik Elschner Pedersen, IFC's Director for Manufacturing, Agribusiness and Services in Africa, pointed out that 'digital technology can improve the operation of key supply chains in the food system by boosting production and improving business practices, promoting traceability and increasing access to finance.' Pedersen noted, however, that the use of digital tools in Africa's agriculture sector remains limited, often because of infrastructure, affordability, awareness, and regulatory issues, adding, 'IFC and Microsoft are working together to change this so that more agricultural players in Africa can leverage the power of the digital economy.' Current research estimates that smallholder farmers account for 80 percent of the farming community, with an estimated 33 million smallholder farmers, but they are often hard to reach, residing in remote areas, and lack access to skills, knowledge and agricultural support services. Awosika believed that the changing climate presents new future opportunities for farmers in relation to emerging markets for carbon credits, regenerative agriculture, and the application of nature-based services. \</doc>

The third Aswan Forum for Sustainable Peace and Development ended on Wednesday, with calls to tackle the multiple crises, new and old, facing the African continent. Egyptian President Abdelfattah El-Sisi launched the proceedings on Tuesday, with a call for a united response to the continent&rsquo;s ills. He reminded the audience of ministers, development representatives, civil society groups, and others, that Africa was still gripped by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. &ldquo;The Forum is being held at a critical time, where the global community is facing several political and economic challenges that affect food and energy security. This sheds light on the food crisis Africa is facing, which requires measures and procedures to address these growing risks,&rdquo; the Egyptian leader said. This year&rsquo;s edition of the Forum takes place in the context of an increasingly volatile international situation. Disruptions in energy and commodities markets have resulted in price spikes that are negatively affecting many African countries that rely on food and fuel imports. In addition, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has deepened food shortages. Participants at the two-day event include heads of state, and representatives of the United Nations, African Union, and the African Development Bank, which is a strategic partner of the Aswan Forum. On Tuesday, much of the focus was dedicated to the global climate conference, COP 27 , also to be held in Egypt, in November this year. Many speakers highlighted the mismatch between Africa&rsquo;s needs and the resources on offer, especially when it comes to climate finance. The continent contributes just 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Yet the region is bearing the brunt of extreme weather events, and suffering a serious funding deficit. United Nations Secretary General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres reminded the audience of the wide range of problems confronting Africa: &ldquo;We need action &mdash; now&hellip;We need to silence the guns across Africa, and address conflict&rsquo;s many roots &mdash; by tackling inequalities and discrimination, and strengthening governance, institutions, public services and justice systems. And we need bold climate action.&rdquo; African Union Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat recounted the steps that the pan-African body had taken to address the Covid-19 pandemic, including a climate change and resilience development strategy and action plan, adopted earlier this year. He listed proposals to help Africa address the climate crisis. These include securing the $100 billion annual funding that developing nations promised in 2015 toward climate action in developing countries. He said this should be central to COP 27 negotiations. He also urged African countries to insist on their just transition model, which calls for a more gradual switch to low-carbon energy forms to accelerate development. During a panel discussion, African Development Bank Acting Vice President and Chief Economist Kevin Urama said it was time to consider an alternative approach to the continent&rsquo;s funding. &ldquo;There are several reasons climate finance is not flowing to the most climate-vulnerable countries in Africa. The structure of climate finance mirrors the global financial architecture, which is structured in a way that it flows to countries that have capacity to prepare bankable projects and have low-risk profiles,&rdquo; said Urama, who is in charge of the Bank&rsquo;s Economic Governance and Knowledge Management Complex. Urama said: &ldquo;Going into COP 27 , there is a need for developed countries to meet their commitments to make available $100 billion to developing countries for climate adaptation and mitigation. Because climate finance does not flow to the most climate-vulnerable countries, there is a need for a portion of the $100 billion in climate finance to be set aside for the most-climate vulnerable countries in Africa, which we classify as African Development Fund countries.&rdquo; The African Development Bank estimates that Africa will need $50 billion annually by 2050 to adequately address climate adaptation alone. To implement the Nationally Determined Contributions, climate targets required by the landmark Paris agreement, it will cost Africa about $1.6 trillion between now and 2030. That amounts to about $128 billion annually. Yet, current climate finance flow to the continent between 2016 and 2019 was about $18.3 billion annually. This leaves an annual climate finance gap of $118 billion. &ldquo;There is a need for innovative financing mechanisms to fill the gap to head off climate catastrophe for the world. This should be a common agenda for the global community. Because when there is greenhouse gas emissions anywhere, there are climate risks everywhere,&rdquo; said Prof. Urama. The African Development Bank&rsquo;s participation in the Aswan Forum forms part of the Bank&rsquo;s leading role in building resilience. Other efforts include its collaboration with the Sahel Alliance ( http://bit.ly/3QCRDc9 http://bit.ly/3QCRDc9 HYPERLINK http://bit.ly/39JHvhb http://bit.ly/39JHvhb Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Development Bank Group (AfDB).

Our planet faces unprecedented and interrelated crises of climate change, biodiversity loss, and a global pandemic. Nationally, Nigeria is also confronting our complicated history of ethno-religious upheavals, which now dovetails into widespread atmosphere of angst and hopelessness amidst ingrained political corruption. Worryingly, the maladies are more cancerous among the country's youthful population. This is because they are the ones that would have picked up the gauntlet to help the nation fight climate change and environmental degradation. Therefore, the imperative of embracing youth-oriented climate change and environmental initiatives can never be overemphasised. A fortnight ago, the Ewah Eleri Climate Justice Fellowship was unveiled to a global audience by the award-winning indigenous non-governmental organisation, Connected Development, popularly known by its initials, CODE. Five young Nigerians \- three journalists and two climate activists \- emerged as the inaugural fellows. The winners will serve as technical advisers to the Nigerian government at the ongoing Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, which started on November 6 and is expected to end on November 18, 2022. The fellowship will also serve as an opportunity for the fellows to engage signatory governments on plans for nations of the world to jointly address climate change and its impacts; as COP27 presents the chance to turn the Glasgow outcome into action through implementing climate change adaptation, mitigation and financing strategies. In order to understand the complete outlook of the fellowship, it is important to examine the concept of climate justice, and to also situate the relevance of the person for whom it was named after; Ewah Eleri. This is where climate justice champions come in. They spearhead advocacy pathways that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a socially just way \- known as "just transition." Through the media, social and legal systems, these citizens continue on the trail to prove that a just transition is possibly a more effective vehicle to a sustainable future. A special focus is placed on the role of 'Most Affected People and Areas,' that is, groups overall disproportionately vulnerable to or affected by climate change, such as women, racial minorities, young, older and poorer people. The main factor in the increased popularity and consideration of climate justice was the rise of grassroots movements \- such as Fridays for Future, and Extinction Rebellion (which this column has discussed in previous interventions). Interestingly, CODE is a regional leader in grassroots movement. With a presence in more than 10 African countries, the organisation works to improve public governance in Nigeria and across the continent by empowering marginalised communities to demand high levels of accountability and transparency from their governments. With its Follow The Money Initiative, CODE has directly impacted millions of lives by enabling grassroots citizens to demand better from their government and directly influencing government policy to ensure that public funds work for public good. Hamzat Lawal, a young Nigerian, is the founder and chief executive of CODE. Exactly 10 years ago, the Nigerian government was moved into action by Lawal's voice which reverberated over the entire global digital space, hinged on the #SaveBagega when more than 400 Zamfara children died as a result of lead poisoning in their community. Through this young Nigerian's eco-advocacy, monies were mobilised and the contaminated rural communities, ravaged by lead-ridden artisanal gold mining, were remediated in order to prevent further deaths and health impacts. However, young 'Hamzy' did not fall from the sky. He is an ordinary Nigerian who was privileged to come under the tutelage of a climate champion who built his capacity, raised his confidence, and gave him a place in the global climate niche. The philosophy for the fellowship is encapsulated in the words of Lawal: "Over 15 years ago, Ewah Eleri gave me an opportunity. I remember that ICEED will not hire you if you do not have at least a master's degree. I was the first to be hired with a secondary school certificate; perhaps, because of my ICT skills, values and whatever Ewah saw in me at that time. I have never said this before, but Ewah actually enrolled me into the university. He bought the university admissions form for me and enrolled me at the University of Abuja, from where I now have a degree in Political Science. "Ewah has continued to show transformational leadership, building the next generation of climate justice leaders. At that time, he pushed me to all the relevant green networks, providing funding and recommendations, and putting me on the global map. "Ewah embodies values. These are values that talk about service, not for self, but service to the community and environment. This is a true example of a godfather. Someone who ensures that you have the right mind, right skills. I believe that Ewah is a model for mentorship, where people should come and learn. My career started as a climate change activist because of Ewah Eleri, so let's start this fellowship in his honour." As a matter of fact, the story of the Nigerian environmental sector will not be complete without bringing into the picture the efforts of Ewah, founder of the International Centre for Energy Environment and Development, who after being trained oversees came home to provide green solutions to sustainable development challenges in his country. ICEED, with the World Bank, worked on the first-ever rural electrification strategy for Nigeria in 2001 and provided technical assistance for the establishment of the Rural Electrification Agency and the Rural Electrification Fund. It supported the Energy Commission of Nigeria in the development of the Renewable Energy Master Plan. It designed efficient biomass cookstoves and trained today's successful entrepreneurs. It established the first Nigerian International Standards Organisation-accredited stove-testing laboratory, and has project footprints in more than half of all the states in the federation. It formed and launched the Nigerian Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, made up of Nigerians delivering services in the budding cookstove industry. Perhaps, the most fundamental of ICEED's contributions is its direct influence on Nigeria's response to global climate change, as it provided the research that underpinned Nigeria's positions on climate change negotiations and trained our negotiators at the UNFCCC system. From 2007 to 2011, it produced policy research for Nigeria's positions on international climate change negotiations. Even now, at the ongoing COP27 , Ewah is one of the developing world's green experts who came together under the World Future Council's platform to blaze sustainable pathways towards a renewable energy future by exploring multiple opportunities to make renewables a political priority for energy, climate action and development in countries most affected by climate change. In view of this, there is a need to design relevant mentorship channels for the Ewah Eleri fellows, even as they return from Egypt, so as to empower them with the knowledge and networks to birth younger and eager climate champions. This is the way to impact future generations, while replicating the "Hamzy phenomenon," which I believe is the vision of the fellowship from the get-go. \</doc>

A yearly investment of $25billion is needed to deliver universal energy access in Nigeria and other African countries by 2030, the Africa Energy Outloot report has said. The report acknowledged the huge potential in the renewable energy sector on the continent. On climate finance to enable Africa meet its energy needs and climate goals, the report revealed that this would require over $190 billion each year from 2026 to 2030, with two-thirds going to clean energy. The report, however, asserts that the continent's industrialisation relies in part on expanding gas use, which is a change of tune from International Energy Agency (IEA's) own report on Net Zero by 2050, which called for no new investment in fossil fuels. The UN climate talks, COP27 , being held in Africa, suggesting fossil fuel investment on the continent most vulnerable to climate change is concerning. Climate justice activists among them 350Africa.org oppose this push for gas expansion in Africa, saying this notion, which is not aligned with the pathway to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees, would only further the interests of the fossil fuel industry and developed nations at the risk of impoverishing African nations. Its Regional Director, Landry Ninteretse, said: 'Despite recent discoveries of gas reserves in countries such as Mozambique, Senegal, Mauritania, Tanzania and South Africa, global bodies such as the IPCC indicate that a phase out of all fossil fuels, including gas, is needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.'' In its report last year, the IEA called for no investment in new fossil fuel supply projects. Climate and energy crises are caused by the continued dependence and addiction to fossil fuels. Pushing for the exploitation of gas in Africa will primarily benefit the fossil fuel industry and western societies seeking to fill the gap left by shortages from Russia, while failing to meet the real and pressing energy needs of ordinary people. Rather than engaging in opportunistic and exploitative pursuit of fossil fuels from Africa, developed countries historically responsible for the climate crisis should massively increase their financing of ambitious renewable energy plans that respect the social, economic and environmental rights of Africans.' \</doc>

During a panel discussion held at the African Energy Week (AEW) 2022 ( HYPERLINK https://AECWeek.com/ https://AECWeek.com/ Entitled; 'How ESG has become the driving force in the energy sector,' the panel discussion was moderated by James Carter, Partner at DLA Piper, UK and included Jorian Hamster, Senior Associate, DLA Piper; Festus Kapembe, ESG Manager, ReconAfrica; Michiel Coenraads, Partner, DLA Piper UK; Julien Perez, VP Strategy and Policy, OGCI and Liesl Esau, HSE & EC Lead, bp Southern Africa, as speakers. According to Hamster, "ESG is not just decarbonization, it is not just renewables. By only focusing on decarbonization, we are missing the meaning, importance and benefits of ESG in maximizing energy developments, ensuring energy security and in transferring the benefits associated with the exploitation of resources to the local communities and economies. Today, we are seeing global investors just signing deals when they see that it is renewables and stepping back when it is hydrocarbons, yet even in massive renewables developments ESG is not being prioritized." Speaking in regard to how ESG is shaping energy market trends, Coenraads stated "What we are seeing is a huge change of capital from fossils to renewables. Focus on ESG projects is about $600 billion and on non ESG at $400 billion. Banks are moving away from investments in carbon chains and many internationals have committed to net zero meaning it is difficult for majors to finance infrastructure to get oil out of the ground because they need to decarbonize hence they are now diversifying assets. Shell for instance has been told to reduce emissions by 45% by 2030." Commenting on the increasing exits by majors across some of Africa's hydrocarbon-rich basins in prioritizing ESG targets set in home countries, Hamster added that "Risks does not mean you have to diversify, you have to work together with all parties involved including governments and develop mechanisms to work around maximizing both ESG and energy developments." Perez added that with companies prioritizing ESG, there will be a continued increase in renewables investments and in electrification but if investments in gas and new baseload power capacity additions stops, it will cause a huge crunch on the energy system. He said "We should continue investing in fossil fuels and at the same time use new technologies such as drones, data analytics and satellites to track the environmental impacts of these projects. We need to develop and employ innovative decarbonization mechanisms and strategies in our oil and gas projects. World players need to be guided on what ESG means." The panel also explored what Africa as a continent needs to get out of the upcoming COP 27 summit in Egypt. Hamster said "There is something circular about these COP summits especially around climate financing and the commitments keep on being not delivered. There needs to be practical solutions and implementation not just promises. African voice in ESG, the energy transition and environmental issues needs to be heard and included in global frameworks." According to Kapembe, "In addition to just maximizing commitment and budgets in environmental and social spending, African companies and leaders need to raise issues around what is affecting the African population at COP 27 . In as much as we can explore renewables, we need to make use of the resources available in vast quantities in the continent. The African team needs to have a united voice from the African background and have commitments that can help us sustain developments that will address both the environmental and socioeconomic development goals. Africa has a lot to contribute to addressing global energy transition but needs to be listened to." Perez added that "It seems Europe and the west are talking to each other and not listening to the whole world. If we do not resolve the issue of ESG, climate change and energy poverty together, we are all going to lose. In terms of ESG, Africa has a lot to benefit in regard to accelerating renewables investments and developments as well as the implementation of smart technologies. For climate activists, the fossil fuel industry is not a threat and for the fossil fuel sector, ESG is not a challenge but a business opportunity." Esau highlighted the need for the implementation of campaigns aimed at increasing ESG awareness across the entire energy value chain from policymakers, energy producers, retailers, transporters and consumers.

Governments of maritime nations have been urged to put stronger policies in place to give low-carbon hydrogen producers, shippers, and consumers the confidence needed to invest in green fuel ships, according to a new report published by the Tyndall Centre at the University of Manchester. The report was commissioned and welcomed by the International Chamber of Shipping which called on governments attending COP27 to send 'stronger market signals' to the shipping industry to reduce fears that new ships built to transport low-carbon fuels would never be used. The new report, which highlighted the major role the shipping sector, will play in transporting the green fuels necessary to meet global climate goals, found a gap between announced government-led projects and what is required. It called for the creation of far stronger national policies on low-carbon fuels. It identified growth in low-carbon hydrogen and sustainable bioenergy as essential to meeting the Paris Climate Agreement's goals but said that lack of enabling policies from governments, such as guaranteed markets and prices for producers and consumers, was holding back investment in the shipping infrastructure needed to support the global energy transition. 'The world needs 50-150 million tons of low-carbon hydrogen by 2030, but there is a major gap between this and what is planned, already-announced projects will only produce 24 million tons by 2030, according to the International Energy Authority. Worryingly, only 4 percent of these projects have a final investment decision. Gender gap in maritime industry too wide, unacceptable \Â£d- Haastrup Commenting, Alice Larkin, the report co-author said: 'New green fuels are essential to meeting the Paris climate goals, and there is a pivotal role for the shipping sector in transporting them. But production of green fuels must be scaled up to meet the Paris goals.' The report said that the sea transport of ammonia and bioenergy in the coming decades could match shipments of gas and coal today, but it requires around 20 large new ammonia carriers a year, to link green hydrogen producers with consumers. 'Given the two-three years timelines for constructing new vessels, shipping industry representatives said they needed certainty on hydrogen production as soon as possible to be able to justify the necessary investments in new infrastructure. The report further identified several potential considerations for government policy to increase its effectiveness at enabling investment. 'These include introducing mandates for increasing percentages of green hydrogen, creating 'production credits for the production of hydrogen, or providing guaranteed markets and prices for producers and consumers. Such measures are already being trailed in the USA, Germany, and India. Guy Platten, secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping said: 'The shipping industry knows it has a huge part to play in global decarbonisation in the coming decades, transporting the new green fuels the world's economy needs. But for us to invest, governments need stronger policies to de-risk green hydrogen production. 'National Hydrogen strategies must include an explicit focus on supporting the transport infrastructure needed for both imports and exports. The industry is ready to respond but we urgently need stronger market signals and infrastructure investment to make this a reality,' Platten added. \</doc>

The Federal Government is spending nine per cent of the country's Gross Domestic Product to address climate change in Nigeria, the Minister of Environment, Mohammed Abdulahi, said on Wednesday. Nigeria's GDP was worth $440.78bn in 2021, according to official data from the World Bank. Nine per cent of this figure is $39.67bn; hence, Nigeria may spend around this amount in tackling climate change, based on the disclosure of the Federal Government. Abdulahi disclosed this while addressing African leaders during the inauguration of the African Carbon Market Initiative, a side event organised by the Climate Action at the ongoing COP27 in Egypt. He spoke on the efforts being made by the Federal Government to mitigate climate change and its impacts across the country, according to a statement issued in Abuja by the Federal Ministry of Environment. "Abdullahi revealed that Nigeria submitted a highly ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions and is spending up to nine per cent of its GDP in addressing climate change," the ministry stated. The minister told participants that in 2021, Nigeria became the first African country to design a detailed Energy Transition Plan to tackle energy poverty and climate change, as well as deliver universal access to energy by 2030 and net-zero by 2060. He also told the gathering that Nigeria was going through severe climate change issues. Abdullahi called on African leaders to take decisive actions to mitigate the impact of climate change, stressing that the continent was at a critical time with respect to the world's climate future. Outlining some devastating effects of climate change in Nigeria and other parts of the world, Abdullahi said, "Our actions today and over the next few decades will determine the fate of future generations and the planet. "This year, we witnessed disastrous extreme weather events from terrifying wildfires in the United States, to unprecedented heat waves in India, Pakistan, and Europe, to powerful floods in my country, Nigeria. The minister continued, "In addition, we are witnessing increased desertification, erosion and pollution; the impacts of which are too severe to ignore. "These glaring climate signals indicate that we do not have the luxury of time when it comes to the impacts of climate change." Speaking further, Abdullahi emphasised that Africa, despite contributing the least to both historical and current emissions, was currently shouldering the brunt of the impact of climate change to a disproportionate level. This, he said, called for accelerated climate action. He stressed that African leaders should strongly demand urgent and decisive climate action from developed countries that were most responsible for the emissions that cause climate change. "We cannot afford any more delays; our people and nations are on the line," Abdullahi stated. He called the attention of investors and the international community to the investment opportunities inherent in the Energy Transition Plan of Nigeria, advocating continued global collaboration in the drive to tackle climate change. \</doc>

On December 3rd, 2022 in Agadir, the 6th edition of the African Forum of Territorial Managers and Training Institutes targeting Local Governments (FAMI6_2022) came to an end. Download document: HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3HbJidl https://bit.ly/3HbJidl The Forum was held over 6 days, from November 28th to December 03rd, 2022 at the Training Center of the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of the Ibn Zohr University in the city of Agadir, Morocco. The theme chosen for this edition was: "The challenge of training and capacity building of Local Elected Officials and Local Government Staff in Africa in Climate Action". This important annual meeting of Territorial Managers, held just one week after COP27 , was organized by United Cities and Local Governments of Africa (UCLG Africa) through its African Local Government Academy (ALGA), in partnership and with the support of the European Commission, the Directorate General of Local Authorities of the Ministry of the Interior of Morocco, the Region of Souss-Massa, the Prefectural Council of Agadir Ida- Outanane, the Provincial Council of Tiznit, the Provincial Council of Taroudant, the Ibn Zohr University and the Training Center of the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of Agadir, the National Agency for the Development of Oasis and Argan Zones (ANDZOA), the National Associations of Local and Regional Governments of Morocco (namely ARM, AMPCPP and AMPCC), the Ecological Transition Agency ADEME of France, the 4C-Maroc Center, the Office of the United Nations Project on Governance, Directorate of Public Institutions and Digital Governance (DIPGD) of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNPOG/ DPIDG/ UN DESA), as well as the Ministry of Energy Transition, and Sustainable Development, and the Municipal Council of Agadir. During the six days of proceedings, more than 300 participants attended the Forum from 40 countries, including 33 African countries. These delegations took part in and contributed to the work of: An official opening ceremony, under the chairmanship of the Honorable Mr. Karim ACHENGLI, President of the Souss-Massa Region Council and the Honorable Mrs. Jeannette NYIRAMASENGESHO, President of the Rwandan Association of Local Authorities (RALGA) of Rwanda , President of the Ngororero District Council of the Western Province, President of the Association of Local Governments of East Africa, having represented the Honorable Mrs. Fatimetou ABDEL MALICK, President of UCLG Africa, President of the Permanent Gender Committee of UCLG, President of the Region of Nouakchott, Mauritania; Four (4) Plenary Sessions on issues related to Climate Action; Eight (8) parallel workshops on climate challenges and capacity building challenges; Three (3) Master classes having focused on the concepts and approaches of Climate Action, Decentralized Cooperation and e-Learning; One (1) Training of Trainers Seminar on Climate Action for the benefit of 26 beneficiaries from different African countries, within the framework of the Partnership Agreement with ADEME; Three (3) field visits. A closing, recognition, and certification ceremony; A tree planting by the African Delegations. How can we create an enabling environment for the Localization and Territorialization of Climate Action? What has COP27 How to enable Local Governments to benefit from Climate Finance? What are the challenges in terms of education, training, and capacity building? How to promote decentralized multi-actor cooperation that can be at the service of climate action? The takeaway from these debates is that we find ourselves in a turbulent context as well as a deep world division generating crises; that only 10% of climate finance benefits to the local and territorial levels; that the challenges in terms of training and capacity building are enormous and that it is time to act to enable Local Elected Officials and their civil servants s to take ownership of Climate Action, and integrate it into their Governance and planning . The proceedings and contributions led to the following 20 main recommendations: Need to increase public funding in terms of volume and as a share of adaptation and resilience funding (Need to mobilize the 140 to 300 billion US dollars needed annually by 2030). Need to strengthen and make more coherent the architecture of concessional climate finance, which includes the Green Climate Fund, the Global Environment Facility, the Climate Investment Funds, the Adaptation Fund as well as the concessional windows of the multilateral development banks, as well as the Global Infrastructure Fund. Need to become aware of and know how to take advantage of the many opportunities for financing climate action. Need to increase local climate finance for localized climate action, to better understand the role of the local and territorial dimension of climate action in Africa, if we are to thrive as a community of nations, with local governments as a driver of sustainable development. Need to localize and territorialize NDCs, because everything is done in cities; concrete actions must be taken at this level. Need to raise awareness and territorialize political actions related to climate change and involve women and young people in Climate Action. Need to give more space and importance to cities in the context of the localization of the Climate Agenda and put in place mechanisms to facilitate access to international climate finance, because only 10 % of climate finance is found locally. The diversification of energy sources (highlighted by COP27 , starting from the importance of the mix of clean energies). Need to take Africa to the next level and provide incentives that leverage innovations already underway in the region that will have greater impact (e.g. acting for the informal sector and encouraging youth participation). Need to prioritize financial innovation (80% of climate finance in Africa comes from public resources) and therefore there is an urgent need to increase private sector finance in climate action. A paradigm shift is needed in Africa's climate narrative; the continent's current narrative must shift from projecting responsibility and risk to projecting investment and opportunity. Need to transform Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and Commitments into clear investment plans with a clear return on investment in the different areas prioritized in the NDCs. The urgency of harnessing empirical evidence on key gaps and opportunities to be filled to scale up these successes and create targeted incentives that will need to be applied to enable them to progress. Need to increase support for holistic capacity development assessments at the national, subnational, and local levels. Need to apply a multi-stakeholder approach by involving a wide range of actors and stakeholders, at all levels of governance (national, subnational, and local). Develop long-term capacity building interventions. Developed countries should ensure that more climate finance is available for stand-alone capacity building programs at the national, subnational, and local levels and to increase coordination among entity capacity building service providers of developed and developing countries. Need to invest in conflict prevention through a supportive and facilitating environment. Capacity building for the promotion of the Culture of Peace and the art of negotiation. "We attach importance within UCLG Africa to the efforts of our Academy: ALGA. We will try to follow up on the implementation of all the recommendations that will come out of this important meeting", declared, through a video intervention, the President of UCLG Africa, the Honorable Mrs. Fatimetou Abdel Malick.

Global Center on Adaptation ( HYPERLINK http://www.GCA.org www.GCA.org ) CEO Professor Patrick Verkooijen welcomed President Uhuru Kenyatta as the Global Champion for the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP) at the Leaders Dialogue on Adaptation Action in Africa in Nairobi on Thursday, 07 July. President Kenyatta has been a key driving force behind the AAAP, an Africa-led, Africa-owned initiative jointly developed by the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) and the African Development Bank (AfDB) which is mobilizing US$25 billion for climate adaptation in the areas of food security, resilient infrastructure, adaptation jobs, and climate finance by 2025. As the Global Champion for the AAAP, President Kenyatta will continue, in his personal capacity, carrying forward his bold leadership on climate adaptation in Kenya to mobilize the global community to honor their commitment of doubling global climate finance. &ldquo;Africa &ndash; indeed the world &ndash; is confronting multiple global shocks that are reverberating through our economies. The catastrophic drought in the Horn of Africa, exacerbated by climate change, is threatening lives and livelihoods, and needs an immediate response. Many African nations, including Kenya, are suffering losses of about three percent of GDP per year because of the present climate threat,&rdquo; President Kenyatta said. &ldquo;I accepted the role of Global Champion for the AAAP to give impetus to the critical actions and global finance needed to address the climate and food crisis today, and to build a more resilient continent. AAAP is Africa&rsquo;s plan that puts Africa&rsquo;s youth and jobs at the center of the adaptation agenda for a green, prosperous Africa.&rdquo; President Kenyatta&rsquo;s support as Global Champion for the AAAP is critical ahead of the &lsquo;African COP&rsquo; at Sharm El-Sheikh in November 2022 for accelerating adaptation action and to drive substantive contributions to the AAAP at the Africa Adaptation Summit: GCA High-Level Dialogue for COP27 , which will be held at the GCA headquarters on Monday 5 September. AAAP&rsquo;s catalytic interventions have already rapidly delivered impact at scale by mainstreaming adaptation into projects worth over $3 billion since 2021. In a statement to the press, Professor Patrick Verkooijen stated that, &ldquo;Africa is tired of waiting &mdash; I am deeply honored to continue working alongside President Kenyatta for Africa to build forward better by financing a greener, more resilient, and prosperous continent that puts people in the driving seat.&rdquo; &ldquo;Adaptation is not only possible; it makes economic sense. Investing in climate adaptation is good for our health. Good for our planet. And good for our economies.&rdquo; Global leaders congratulated President Kenyatta on his appointment. Ban Ki-moon, Chair of the Global Center on Adaptation and 8th Secretary General of the United Nations said: &ldquo;Your Excellency, I know your proven leadership on climate adaptation in Africa. You are and will be the strongest voice for mobilizing the global community, for making sure countries honor their climate finance commitments, for making sure they will get behind the largest adaptation initiative on this great continent.&rdquo; Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director, International Monetary Fund said: &ldquo;Mr. President, your leadership has already inspired others to step-up and accelerate action to tackle global warming, and there is no one better to champion adaptation in Africa, including the financing that is so badly needed [&hellip;] This is why the AAAP and its upstream financing facility is so important.&rdquo; Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General, World Trade Organisation said: &ldquo;I would like to commend my brother, Uhuru Kenyatta, for being a driving force behind the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program. His strong voice and leadership will inspire others to scale up and accelerate the actions required to adapt to climate change. As an eminent international statesman, President Kenyatta&rsquo;s leadership on this issue is much appreciated and is a powerful example to others.&rdquo; Dr Akinwumi A. Adesina, President of the African Development Bank Group said: &ldquo;I would like to applaud the decision of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, former UN Secretary-General of the United Nations, now the Chairman of the Global Center on Adaptation and, of course Professor Patrick Verkooijen, Chief Executive Officer of the Global Center on Adaptation, in selecting you, President Kenyatta, as the global champion for Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program. The timing is right, just ahead of COP27 , the Africa COP, in Egypt. It is time to turn promises into resources. It is time to turn exaltation into execution. It is time to turn hope into reality. And for that we need a champion, a tested leader, with a respected global voice. President Kenyatta is a doer. President Kenyatta is a climate friendly leader. President Kenyatta&rsquo;s dynamism, voice and leadership will help as we drive for greater financing for climate adaptation for Africa.&rdquo; Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Global Center on Adaptation (GCA).

The international organisations made the commitment on Wednesday at the official global launching of the Energy Transition Plan by Yemi Osinbajo, vice-president Shubham Chaudhuri, Nigeria country director, World Bank, said the international bank aims at committing over $1.5 billion towards the country's energy transition plan. 'We plan to commit over $1.5 billion towards the Energy Transition Plan on renewable energy, on power sector reforms, and potentially hydropower, on clean cooking, and wherever opportunities arise,' he said The policy and institutional reforms that will be necessary are also part of the agenda and we hope to be able to provide support for the fundamentally imperative of energy access but in a way that is consistent with the energy transition, what I think of as the NEAT imperative. 'The Nigerian Energy Access and Transition (NEAT) imperative is what we here at the World Bank are absolutely committed to supporting.' On his part, Adam Cortese, chief executive officer (CEO), Sun Africa, a renewable energy solutions company, said it was in the final stage of talks with the US EXIM Bank on a $1.5 billion financing package. 'The launch of Nigeria's Energy Transition Plan has further accelerated our efforts, proving Nigeria to be fertile grounds for investments in the sector. We are in the final stages of discussion with US EXIM Bank on a USD 1.5 billion financing package,' Adam said. We are truly excited about the future and we are looking forward to helping Nigeria lead by way of example in Africa.' Speaking at the official unveiling of the transition plan, Osinbajo said Nigeria's energy transition requires a significant scale of resources which includes spending $410 billion by 2060. He added that Nigeria has set up an inter-ministerial energy transition implementation working group and is 'currently engaging with partners to secure an initial $10 billion support package ahead of COP27 ". At COP26 in Glasgow last year, President Muhammadu Buhari announced Nigeria's ambition to achieve net-zero by 2060 drawing on insights from the country's Energy Transition Plan which was developed through the Energy Transition Commission to chart out Nigeria's unique energy transition pathway. The plan supports the country's objectives of achieving universal access to energy by 2030 and a carbon-neutral energy system by 2060, while also providing enough energy to power the industry and other productive uses. \</doc>

The African Refiners and Distributors Association (ARDA) has stepped up its campaign for the use of cleaner fuel and a just energy transition that will give consideration to Africa's particular circumstances. The Association, which is made up of participants in the African downstream petroleum sector, made a number of remarks during the 27th Conference of Parties ( COP27 ), which was held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. They noted the necessity for an energy transition but cautioned against moving too quickly in order to harm Africa's overarching development goals. Anibor Kragha, executive secretary of ARDA, stated that the key to achieving a sustainable energy transition is to concentrate on cleaner transportation fuels, advance the adoption of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and decarbonize refining operations as well as storage and distribution infrastructure. Kragha sees gas as a crucial option, especially as an economic policy tool to balance the global climate mitigation agenda and the urgent need to end energy poverty in Africa. This is because of the continent's expanding population and the challenge of energy security. The African Union and its strategic partner, AfroChampions, have partnered with innovative governments across Africa, private sector enablers, and industrialists to create a model multi-stakeholder innovation platform to showcase the most recent improvements in industry best practices. This is the context in which Kragha's perspective on the use of gas is being presented. According to the Executive Secretary, achieving the necessary energy transition across the continent will require sustainable financing, proper regulation, standardization, and strategic policies. Speaking on another session hosted by IPIECA and organized by the US Chamber of Commerce, World Steel Association, and US Council for International Business, Kragha said that an energy transformation should encompass all facets of the economy. Kragha observed that, despite the fact that different climate adaptation and mitigation projects are prioritized, a just transition remained sacred along all value chains. Kragha said ARDA is doing everything it can to attract funding into the downstream sector of the petroleum industry to accelerate the transition to cleaner fuels in the sector. He lamented that the global south, and Africa in particular, are suffering from climate-related impacts while facing significant challenges as well as opportunities on the transition to net zero. ARDA and other stakeholders on the continent are working on a unique African Downstream Energy Transition Roadmap, which highlights the need for investments in strategic storage and distribution infrastructure that would support cleaner fuels on the continent's path, according to Kragha at a side event hosted by Colombia. While Africa's contribution to global cumulative CO2 emissions is very small (2.73%) compared to other continents with levels over ten times that, Kragha said. Additional remarks were made at an IPIECA side event on  Enablers of a Net-Zero Emissions Future in the Global South. Kragha emphasized the need for a strong financial strategy to support the roadmap for the energy transition, noting that doing so would require addressing issues related to the environment, social issues, and governance (ESG), and that African Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) would have to play a key role to make sure success. \</doc>

From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, and Canadian Deputy Prime Minister, Chrystia Freeland, have agreed on the need for deepening bilateral relations between Nigeria and Canada, with a focus on improving trade, strengthen ongoing educational collaboration, continuing dialogue on the global energy transition issues and climate change. According to a by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity Office of the Vice President, Laolu Akande, this was the highlight of the meeting between both leaders in Ottawa, the capital of the North American country on Monday. During his interaction with top Canadian parliamentarians, including senators and cabinet members led by Freeland, Osinbajo noted that, "we are hoping for much more that we can do together." Freeland, who is also his country's Finance Minister, had earlier expressed similar sentiments while welcoming the Vice President. She observed that the Canadian government values its relationship with Africa, especially Nigeria, and has been "looking forward to this visit for a long time," adding that the relationship with Nigeria is "very important to us." On the global net zero emissions targets, and energy transition, Osinbajo reaffirmed the view that gas ought to be adopted as a transition fuel, a notion he said garnered traction at the recent COP27 conference in Egypt, even though still widely unacknowledged in the West. "We believe we must use our gas as transition fuel; we have huge gas reserves. We would like to continue to use our gas during the transition," he said while explaining that the Federal Government's Energy Transition Plan is focused on renewable energy, including the ongoing Solar Power Naija Programme, which was launched under the Economic Sustainability Plan. Responding, the Canadian Deputy Prime Minister, who wondered whether countries such as Nigeria are already struggling to get financing for gas projects said, "we will be happy to keep talking with you on that, " adding that the use of Natural Gas makes sense, and noting that the dialogue should continue. Both leaders exchanged notes on some of the common and peculiar economic challenges in their respective countries, including fiscal and monetary challenges, subsidies, financial inclusion, social investments programmes and strategies to support the vulnerable, among others. Osinbajo and Freeland also discussed the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), observing that the market provided opportunities for mutual benefits, not only for African countries, but also Canada which is desirous of contributing to its development and also tapping into the continental market. Besides Freeland, other top parliamentarians who met with the VP at the meeting included the Honourable Ahmed Hussen \- Minister of Housing, Diversity and Inclusion; the Honourable Marci Ein \- Minister for Women and Gender Equality; the Honourable Rob Oliphant \- The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs; MP Michael Coteau \- Member of Parliament for Don Valley East in Toronto; Senator Marie-Fran\'e7oise M\'e9gie \- Senator from Quebec and Senator Hassan Yussuff \- Senator from Ontario.

Nigeria has been asked by the United Nations (UN) to accelerate the implementation of national climate change plans (including the Nationally Determined Contributions, Energy Transition Plan, and Climate Change Act) and increase its ambition to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060. During a visit to Nigeria to engage with the government on the implementation of national climate change plans, Nigel Topping, the UN High Level Champion for COP26, made this call. During his visit, he met with top government officials, leading private and financial sector leaders, civil society organizations, and climate change activists in Abuja and Lagos to discuss the benefits of a green transition, as well as to better understand the challenges and how to overcome them, and to advance the UK government's overall effort to boost climate action in Nigeria. "I congratulate Nigeria on its ambitious NDC, the Energy Transition Plan announced at COP26 in November, and the passage of the Climate Change Act that followed," Topping said. Now is the time to put these policies into action. "It is critical to mobilize both state and non-state actors - including enterprises, academia, and civil society - to enhance Nigeria's investment climate so that the country can attract the right investments that would expedite the country's transition to a low-carbon, resilient economy." "With the UK as the current COP Presidency and following the historic COP26 event conducted in Glasgow last November, and ahead of COP27 in Egypt later this year, it was crucial for us to have Nigel Topping here in Nigeria," said Ben Llewellyn-Jones Obe, the British Deputy High Commissioner in Lagos. His visit serves as a timely reminder of how hard the UK is working around the world with its partners, such as Nigeria, to ensure that every effort is made to deliver on and put into practice the promises made by the UK, Nigeria, and the rest of the world to combat climate change." In January 2020, Topping was named the UK Government's High Level Climate Champion for COP 26 to help accelerate climate change action from businesses, investors, organizations, cities, and regions, and to coordinate this work with governments and parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). \</doc>

Global securities regulators under the auspices of the International Organisation for Securities Commissions (IOSCO) yesterday outlined the actions it undertakes to protect investors by mitigating greenwashing in financial markets, to contribute to sustainability disclosure standards benefitting issuers and investors, and to promote well-functioning carbon markets. IOSCO has set out its expectations that both disclosures and assurance standards should be ready for use by corporates for their end-2024 accounts. Corporate disclosures underpin valuations in financial markets; sustainability disclosures will play the same role. Chair, IOSCO Board, Jean-Paul Servais said that in 2023, the ISSB will issue its standard for climate disclosures and general requirements while IOSCO will move promptly to decide on endorsement and will develop a support programme for its members to assist them in moving forward immediately should IOSCO decide to endorse these standards. He said IOSCO also supports the efforts of the ISSB in seeking to be inclusive through its capacity building partnership initiative. He also highlighted the importance of maximizing interoperability of standards and aligning key climate disclosures. Interoperability across the world will be an important factor in IOSCO's endorsement decision. IOSCO believes close alignment between the ISSB and those jurisdictions seeking to implement their own sets of standards is essential to ensure capital flows to where it is most needed. He also stressed the importance of well-functioning carbon markets. 'Carbon markets have a big role to play in moving us to net zero, but they must be made efficient, liquid and free from conflicts of interests and undue political interference. 'We are committed to bringing liquidity, transparency and integrity to these markets, as we have done successfully with all other financial markets,' Servais said while speaking on stage at COP27 . IOSCO also yesterday published a consultation paper setting its recommendations on how to establish sound and well-functioning compliance carbon markets and a discussion paper seeking industry views on the role of financial markets regulators in voluntary carbon markets. Vice Chair of the Sustainable Finance Task Force, Rodrigo Buenaventura, stressed the importance of mitigating greenwashing to ensure trust underpins sustainable finance. 'Greenwashing can occur throughout the investment value chain. As a result, there is a need to involve all relevant stakeholders in preventing and addressing it. Through its Call for Action, IOSCO is now calling upon all voluntary standard setting bodies and industry associations operating in financial markets to promote specific good practices among their members to counter the risk of greenwashing,' Buenaventura said. IOSCO published a call for action earlier this week, asking all voluntary standard setting bodies and industry associations operating in financial markets to promote good practices among their members to counter the risk of greenwashing related to asset managers and ESG rating and data providers. Voluntary initiatives have thus far played an important role in seeking to build the foundations of a well-functioning sustainable finance markets, but IOSCO believed their actions are no longer sufficient. According to IOSCO, governments and regulatory authorities must take further action and IOSCO will work with its members to use the tools within its remit to assist in building sound and well-functioning sustainable finance markets. \</doc>

AstraZeneca and the Egyptian Ministry of Health have launched the Accelerating Change Together; Cancer Care in Africa (ACT;CCA) programme - a platform for partners to co-create cancer care solutions that close the gaps in existing patient care pathways, from diagnosis through to treatment and beyond. The announcement made at the margins of the ongoing COP27 climate talks had government representatives, health experts, patient advocates, and private sector representatives sign the ACT;CCA Coalition Declaration to reaffirm their joint commitment to advancing equitable cancer outcomes for all Africans. 'While cancer treatment developments are moving quickly, equitable access to these innovations is not there for all,' said Pelin Incesu, area vice president for the Middle East and Africa, AstraZeneca. 'Our ambition is to nurture the cancer care ecosystem in Africa, bringing together local stakeholders to co-create solutions and encourage long-term investment that leads to equitable cancer outcomes,' Incesu said. 'We need joint action to reverse the alarming increase in Africa's cancer burden, by addressing the unique barriers to cancer diagnosis and treatment, as well as building capacity that helps to make innovative care accessible to patients.' Over 700,000 deaths occurred due to cancer across the region in 2020 and across Sub-Saharan Africa the current mortality rates are reaching 70 per cent in diagnosed cases, health experts say. An estimated 2.1 million new cancer cases and 1.4 million deaths are expected annually by 2040 across the continent. Breast, and prostate cancers are among the top three most prevalent. According to AstraZeneca, ACT;CCA focuses on driving impact in lung, breast and prostate cancer through capacity building, early screening and diagnosis and patient empowerment. An AstraZeneca-led effort to revolutionize the way cancer is diagnosed and treated to drive improvements in patient outcomes. Over the next three years, ACT;CCA aims to drive screening and diagnostics covering one million people across cancer types, and to provide training for more than 10,000 healthcare professionals across 100 oncology centres. The programme is led by a steering committee of doctors, oncology institutions and advocacy groups to guide policy intervention, share learning across borders, and put cancer patients at the centre. Members will meet on a regular basis to drive progress on cancer initiatives. Mohsen Mokhtar, a professor of Clinical Oncology and managing director of Cairo University Cancer Center, President of Can-Survive-Egypt, said collaboration was key to improving cancer outcomes. 'Each country joining the coalition invests heavily in cancer care programmes. We understand that by working together to develop a network that stretches beyond borders. 'We can close the gaps across the patient care pathway and provide solutions that improve outcomes and transform the patient journey not only for our own citizens, but across the continent.' Also, Mary Nyangasi, head of National Cancer Control Programme in Kenya, highlighted the disparity in care. 'In some areas, the lack of disease awareness, limited diagnostic capabilities, and an absence of structured programmes for early detection and access to treatment mean that equitable cancer care is not there for all.' The initiative will also be launched in Algeria, Morocco and Kenya to focus on local initiatives under the ACT;CCA umbrella. \</doc>

The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Wednesday in New York, sold world leaders on Nigeria's plan and commitment to ensure a rapid and strategic transition to renewable energy in response to the world-wide efforts towards net-zero. "It will guide Nigeria's rapid transition to renewable energy and result in significant job creation with up to 340,000 jobs created by 2030 and up to 840,000 jobs created by 2060 driven mainly by power, cooking and transport sectors," Buhari told his counterparts at a Leaders' Closed-Door Meeting on Climate Change convened by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Antonio Guterres. This is according to a statement signed late Wednesday by the Special Adviser, Media and Publicity, to the President, Femi Adesina, titled 'At meeting on climate change, President Buhari reiterates Nigeria's strong commitment to energy transition plan.' The meeting which was held on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York comes barely two months to the COP27 in November. Buhari stressed that his regime had, in August 2022, launched a home-grown, data-backed, multi-pronged energy transition plan, which is the country's framework in achieving net-zero emissions by 2060. Related News UNGA77: Nigeria ripe for investment, Buhari woos investors UNGA: Buhari promises credible polls, seeks debt forgiveness FG should sanitise recovered assets disposal Highlighting some of the details in the plan, the President said that through the use of emerging technologies and alternative fuels such as hydrogen, bioenergy and waste-to-energy, a pathway would be created for accelerated decarburization of energy systems and harnessing of new and diverse technologies towards low carbon development while aligning to our broader developmental aspirations in a fair and just manner. He said, "The plan also sets out a timeline and framework for the attainment of emissions reduction across five key sectors: power, cooking, oil and gas, transport and industry&hellip;gas will play a critical role as a transition fuel in Nigeria's net-zero pathway, particularly in the power and cooking sectors. "The clean energy goals of the plan include modernizing the power sector with large-scale integration of renewable energy, enhancing energy efficiency and conservation; and is expected to generate 250 gigawatts of installed energy capacity with over 90 per cent made up of renewables." Expressing his confidence that the plan would put the nation on the path of prosperity, Buhari said that a careful implementation would create significant investment opportunities as it will engender the establishment and expansion of industries related to solar energy, hydrogen and electric vehicles. "It will guide Nigeria's rapid transition to renewable energy and result in significant job creation with up to 340,000 jobs created by 2030 and up to 840,000 jobs created by 2060 driven mainly by power, cooking and transport sectors." \</doc>

Many Nigerians do not understand climate change. But its devastating effects are here with us. Flooding has claimed about 500 lives, according to the Nigerian Meteorological (NiIMET). Communities are submerged in almost every state and desertification has debilitating effect on vegetation. Experts say the message should be better communicated to achieve its target. British Deputy High Commissioner Ben Llewellyn-Jones wants the media to intensify climate action advocacy. Okwy Iroegbu- Chikezie reports. Thousands of people are negatively impacted by climate change .There are reports about communities being submerged by flood and farmlands destroyed, leading to hunger and starvation. At a media dialogue in commemoration of the International Day for Climate Change at his residence, British Deputy High Commissioner Ben Llewellyn-Jones urged the media in Nigeria to do more in their reportage and advocacy for action against climate change. Its theme was: 'Transition to a circular economy - partnerships to solve pressing challenges.' Llewellyn-Jones sensisitised media gatekeepers, editors and reporters on the need for concerted action to tackle climate change. He said climate change was a common concern for countries, adding that it was an urgent and potentially- irreversible threat. 'We are at a critical moment for the future of our planet. Temperatures are rising, storms are raging and crops are failing across the world. 'Considering the impact of climate change and of course COVID-19, building back a fairer, greener and more resilient recovery and safer economy should be the priority of governments and gatekeepers across the globe, including the United Kingdom and Nigeria, he said Llewellyn-Jones went on: 'It is very crucial that we, as stakeholders, educate the media on the importance of generating compelling stories and reports that have the potential to galvanise people's action for sustainable development in Nigeria.' He noted that Nigeria contributes about one per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. According to him, the country is among the top 10 of the most climate-vulnerable countries. He said that coastal states faced extensive risks from storm surges, with inland flooding and pollution in the Niger Delta; gully erosion in the Southeast, and chronic aridity and riverine flooding in the North. Llewellyn-Jones said the Middle Belt was at risk of aridity, compounded by high-tensions between farmers and pastoralists (land rights, water access). He listed agriculture, water and the health sectors as key sectors impacted by climate change. Fuel wood and charcoal are the major sources of energy for the rural population, Llewellyn-Jones said, noting that deforestation rate in the country was over 3.7 per cent per annum. According to him, from 2013 to 2020, 99 per cent of tree cover loss in Nigeria occurred within natural forests. 'Urbanisation rate is about 4.3 per cent per annum, with over 52 per cent of the population living in urban centres. 'With Nigeria's population set to double to 400 million by 2050, without action to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change, there will be increased pressure on natural resources (resulting in conflicts) and emissions profile. 'Climate change causes flooding which in 2022 affected 31 of 36 states, affecting over 1.4m people, displacing 808,000, and leaving over 300 dead. The impact of climate change without action could cost between six per cent and 30 per cent of Nigeria's GDP by 2050. 'COP26 which the UK hosted in Glasgow in November 2021 concluded with 197 parties agreeing to the Glasgow Climate Pact, reaching a consensus on the need for urgent climate action,' Llewellyn-Jones said. He said the pact saw parties addressing issues important to African countries, including strengthening international cooperation on adaptation, loss and damage, urging developed countries to double adaptation finance by 2025. 'Our COP Presidency will end in November, 2022. Our objective in 2022 is to maintain the momentum that parties built at COP26, and use this to support success in other key fora - including the 15th Conference of Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity or CBD COP15 which will hold in December in Canada. 'We have been working closely with the incoming Presidency of COP27 , Egypt, to build a partnership that aligns priorities and plans, secures the legacy of the Glasgow Climate Pact and delivers impact and progress on the Paris Agreement goals in Sharm el-Sheikh at COP27 ,' Llewellyn-Jones said. Read Also: Nigeria's role in achieving global climate change He said there was the need to urgently work together to accelerate the shift to clean power generation, including increased solar, wind deployment and greater energy efficiency, which are the most effective route to climate and energy security, and long-term prosperity. 'The media must also take up its responsibility as gatekeepers and the fourth estate of the realm to advocate for and educate every Nigerian on the importance of climate action,' Llewellyn-Jones said. Chief Executive Officer Sterling One Foundation Mrs. Olapeju Ibekwe said the media was critical in reporting the devastating impact of climate change across the world, noting that the flooding across some states was a sad reminder of the devastating effects of climate change. According to her, communities in eight Local Government Areas in Anambra were completely submerged by flood two weeks ago, causing huge economic and human losses. 'As we are gathered in this room today, thousands of people are displaced and unimaginably distressed in Lokoja and Kogi states where homes, business investments have been lost. 'It is reported that 76 people died in Anambra trying to escape the flood,' Ibekwe said. National Emergency Management Agency Reeling data from the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Ibekwe said human loss to flooding this year alone had been put at 500 deaths and I,546 injured. According to her, the media has a special role to play in reporting responses to the rising incidences of flooding, heatwave, water shortage, deforestation and other consequences of climate change. International Day for Climate Action Ibekwe said the International Day for Climate Action was set aside to take stock of the progress achieved and to appraise the rest of the journey with a view to determining the most effective steps to achieve the global goal of cutting emissions and going green. Climate in Africa She said the state of the Climate in Africa 2020 Report warned of the continent 's disproportionate vulnerability. The report estimated that by 2030, up to 118 million extremely poor Africans would be exposed to droughts, floods and extreme heat, Ibekwe added. Sub-Saharan Africa 'The report estimates that the investment in climate adaptation for sub-Saharan Africa would cost between 30 to 50 million dollars each year over the next decade or roughly two to three per cent of GDP. 'Enough to spark job opportunities and economic development while prioritising sustainabie green recovery. 'There has never been a more urgent need to revive damaged ecosystems than now and we need urgent action to address the pressing issues. 'We must shift from harming the planet to healing it. 'Unfortunately, in Nigeria, we still experience ignorance, apathy, carelessness, and lack of sustained commitment when it comes to issues around climate change,' Ibekwe said. She said the role of the media in communicating climate change and actions, effectively breaking down the implications and setting agenda was more critical now than ever. Ibekwe said time was running out and nature was in emergency mode 'To keep global warming below 1.5 degrees this century, we must halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. 'Without action, exposure to air pollution beyond safe guidelines will increase by 50 per cent within the decade and plastic waste flowing into aquatic ecosystem will nearly tripple by 2040,' Ibekwe said. \</doc>

Ms. Catriona Liang, the British High Commissioner to Nigeria, said the United Kingdom (UK) still views Nigeria as a top ally and priority in many areas of shared interest. She stated this while reflecting on the life of the late British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, at a press briefing in Abuja. Even though Nigeria and Britain have long-standing diplomatic ties, Liang claimed that the Queen always helda special place in her heart for Nigeria. "The strength of the relationship between us and Nigeria, for me, one of the absolute foundations was because of the Queen in her role as being the head of the state for a while and her role as head of the Commonwealth and now passed to her son. When I did my credentials to her in my last diplomatic assignment to Nigeria, "She mentioned her love for Africa and love of the commonwealth and she mentioned her two visits to Nigeria in 1953 for twenty days, visiting all over the country for the first time and in 2003, for the commonwealth head of government gathering. "King Charles III, the then prince of Wales, I assure us he follows Nigeria closely and will continue to maintain the interest and affection for Nigeria, as the biggest and most important country in Africa. Related News "The Queen, the King and the entire family have seen the role Nigeria plays as significant and important. Her visit has inspired the amazing spirit of the people of Nigeria, it's been very helpful to me to have that strong bond. She was passionate about Africa and the Commonwealth generally, but personally, I think Nigeria had a special place in her heart. "She took her responsibility very seriously, since the transition from the empire to the Commonwealth. She invested a huge amount of leadership and positive energy in creating the commonwealth family. "We see the success of the commonwealth because people are beginning to join the Commonwealth, that's the club that is successful and is growing from strength to strength, Her leadership has brought nations together across Africa, the Caribbean, the Pacific and the coast of Australia", she added. Speaking of the new King, Liang said King Charles III remains committed to addressing the issue of climate change, the same as the Queen did. "One of the things she was passionate about is the environment and climate change, the King was aware of it and has identified the importance of protecting the environment. "King Charles is also very passionate about the environment, that's the area of focus as we head towards COP27 , we will continue to strengthen our relationship. And other areas are the history of the Commonwealth. He had to modernise the commonwealth to engage the youth and know what they want", Liang said. \</doc>

Mobile telephone users in Nigeria and other parts of the world are becoming more interested in second-hand products as well as sustainability at large, meaning devices are used for longer while device recycling schemes are more frequently used. According to the new report of the Global System for Mobile Communication Association (GSMA), in the past seven years, the mobile phone replacement cycle has increased by 10 months, from 24 months in 2014 to 34 months in 2021 globally. This trend, GSMA said in the report entitled: Strategy Paper for Circular Economy: Mobile Devices, published at the weekend ahead COP27 , is expected to continue with the refurbished mobile device market predicted to be worth more than $140billion by 2030 compared to $49.9billion it was in 2020. The report laid out devices with as long a lifetime as possible, made with 100 per cent recyclable and recycled content; 100per cent renewable energy, and where no device ends up as waste as it two visions for the industry: This ambition is backed up by a newly developed 'circularity model' for the mobile industry, which lays out the principles that operators should consider as they aim to build a circular supply and manufacturing chain by 2050, based on two overarching concepts of 'maximised longevity' and 'zero waste'. Benue gets mobile trucks for tuberculosis testing, treatment Speaking on the new initiative, Head of Climate Action at GSMA and Mobile Sector Lead for the UN Climate Champions, Steven Moore, said: 'The mobile industry is making real progress on circularity, but there's a lot more to do to reduce the environmental impact of devices we rely on every day to stay connected. By setting out a new vision of systemic change for the sector, we're laying the groundwork for the mobile industry to reduce material waste and increase the longevity of devices.' Head of Sustainability at Tele2 who led the development of the strategy paper, Erik Wottrich, also said: 'An increased circularity for devices has a huge potential to reduce negative environmental impact, and at the same time to enable new business models that can generate new business opportunities. This is a great step forward for us as an industry, but there is still much work to be done. Tele2 is proud to have led the development of the strategy paper as we are committed to advancing the circular economy by developing new customer offerings based on a circular business model, which will be key for us to reduce our negative climate impact and to achieve our scope 3/value-chain science-based target.' On the environmental repercussions, the report noted that mobile phones play an essential and positive role in the lives of people around the globe, connecting people to loved ones, enabling digital inclusion and delivering economic progress. 'However, over their life cycle, they also have environmental impacts - both positive and negative. Mobile phones contribute to carbon reduction by reducing the need to travel, but also cause environmental impacts of their own. 'Of the life cycle of a mobile phone, the majority of environmental impact - around 80per cent - is in its manufacture. Over 50 different materials can currently be found in an average smartphone, including plastics, ceramics, rare metals, copper and silicon. Mining for these materials can cause negative environmental and social impacts. Manufacturing and assembly also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel use. \</doc>

During COP27 , that took place in Egypt, world leaders have grappled over what must be done to curb global warming. Seven years ago, world leaders signed an international treaty to limit global warming to well below 1.5\'b0C. The ramifications and severity of climate change vary depending on where you live. In Africa, climate-related problems have been significant including the current floods in Nigeria and droughts in Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya as few examples to mention. Climate change needs to be seen as a critical matter and dealt with in the same manner as a pandemic. The actions we take today will determine the scale and impact of the ramifications. In treating it as a pandemic, we must remember some of the lessons and act accordingly. A key lesson is that collaboration is key to making a difference and it is an ecosystem driven approach. An Ecosystem concerted and sustained approach Organisations: Organisation, no matter how big or small, define how their operations and value chains impact climate change and what they can do to mitigate the effects. At Ericsson, we have prioritized the elimination of sources of emissions within our operation and value chain which follows a 1.5\'b0C reduction trajectory as part of our Net Zero target for 2040. Organisations need to take a bold step in investing in digitalisation. This will help reduce carbon emission as well as drive efficiency in every sector of the economy. Individuals: Individual responsibility and dedication are critical in addressing climate change concerns. Decisions such as choosing to invest pension funds in organisations that are environmentally responsible will put pressure on providers to help fight the climate crisis. Cutting down on business travel is another good example of how companies and individuals can make an impact on reducing carbon emissions. Leverage Technology and Innovations Technology can play a major role in supporting global climate action. These could include solutions that help various sectors manage their emissions and data driven insights that can help make informed decisions affecting climate. At Ericsson, our 5G technology is supporting industrial sectors, such as energy, agriculture, manufacturing, and transportation, towards a low-carbon economy. Private and Public Partnership and Commitment Ericsson contributed to the Exponential Climate Action Roadmap report launched at the Global Climate Action Summit 2018. The report shows the potential for all sectors to halve greenhouse gas emissions by around 2030. Across Africa, we partner with our customers to find innovative solutions that address environmental sustainability. Anticipate Multidimensional Impact Similar to the pandemic, climate change has a multidimensional impact. It has the power to derail the progress we have made in sustainable development, further deepen the economic divide, and harshly affect the marginalized in society. Understanding the worst-case scenario will help us address the challenge effectively. In summary, the fight against climate change cannot be won alone. It will require collaboration of the entire ecosystem while the use of technology and innovation across all sectors of society, along with the proper policy direction and specific solutions, to achieve a 1.5\'b0C future target. We need to think of climate change as a looming pandemic. Our individual actions today and the interventions by all stakeholders will determine its scale and impact. We have the power to drive this change, and it must act with urgency! \</doc>

By Emmnuella Anokam The Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) said Nigeria's energy transition journey must be driven and guided by credible information and data on the country's energy security. NEITI said Nigeria must not be allowed to be rushed into hasty energy transition without a thorough analysis of its comparative advantage and implications, resources, economy and livelihoods of citizens. The Executive Secretary of the agency, Dr Orji Ogbonnaya Orji, said this at its National Stakeholders Dialogue on Energy Transition on Thursday in Abuja. Orji said NEITI had commenced work along with other partners to make Nigerians and stakeholders gain insight into the risks and opportunities associated with energy transition. He said NEITI, working with international Secretariat of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), had commissioned a study to examine actual implications and impacts of energy transition on the Nigeria's oil and gas sector of the economy. According to him, the report of this study will soon be published and will be widely disseminated to all the stakeholders present at the dialogue. "As the world transits from the use of fossil fuel to cleaner and sustainable energy, transparency and accountability is critical to the process, including the reporting of emissions, disclosure of climate risks and overall governance of the energy industry. "Nigeria must prepare to mainstream transparency and accountability mechanism into her energy transition agenda to avoid the pitfalls of her past and present energy sector," he said. Orji said Nigeria, being an oil and gas dependent country, was vulnerable to the risks and challenges of energy transition, adding that, the global energy transition agenda was already reshaping the oil and gas landscape. He said the outcome of the dialogue was expected to feed into the country's transition plan and its implementation. Ms Nafi Chinery, West African Regional Manager, Natural Resources Governance Institute (NRGI) Anglophone, appreciated Nigeria's desire for energy transition. According to Chinery, African continent's average per capital electricity consumption sits at about 600 kilowatt hours per year, compared with the world average of about 3.200 kilowatt hours. She said when compared the consumption with the European Union, U.S and China, it threw up much stark variations. "The current global discussions around energy transition places a responsibility on Africa to develop robust plans that will aid the transition towards Net-Zero emissions. "This will mitigate future impacts of climate change on the continent and reduce the costs of adaptation. "Nigeria's emphasis on gas as a transition fuel aligns with the thinking of most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and the African Union Commission in the run up to COP27 ," he said. Also speaking, Mr Gabriel Okeowo, Country Director, Budgit Foundation, an NGO, said transition to renewable energy would be a great potential for Nigeria and the continent at large. He said the private sector would continue to support the Nigerian government to achieved its aims. (NAN) ( http://www.nannews.ng www.nannews.ng ) ============ Edited by Salif Atojoko \</doc>

From Adanna Nnamani, Abuja In an effort to improve climate conditions and quality of health for sustainable living among residents, the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Olusola Sanwu-Olu has signed the C40 Clean Air Cities Declaration. Endorsing the C40 Clean Air Cities Declaration, shows the state recognises that breathing clean air is a human right, and commits to working toward safer air quality. Sanwu-Olu signed the pact alongside Abidjan, Accra, Addis Ababa, Dakar, Ekurhuleni, Freetown, Johannesburg, Nairobi, and Tshwane efforts to improve air quality. The governor who announced this in a statement made available to Journalists, in Abuja recently, said that he was proud to join the mayors and governors of nine other African cities in making an unprecedented, ambitious commitment to improve air quality with the signing of the C40 Clean Air Cities Declaration. He said. "The need to breathe clean air is more important than the licence to pollute it. Lagos has committed to improving air quality and I appeal to the responsibility of every citizen, because together we can", he said. The chair of C40 Cities and the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said that: "With COP27 being held in Africa later this year, I am delighted to welcome ten new African signatories to the C40 Clean Air Cities Declaration. "As Chair, I am determined to do more to support cities in the global south, who are on the frontline facing the worst consequences of climate change." Khan said he is focusing C40's resources on helping cities around the world accelerate their efforts to tackle the climate emergency, reduce toxic air pollution, and address inequalities. He lamented that the world is at a crossroads, adding that efforts must be made to allow cities around the world to become greener, fairer, and more prosperous for all. On his part, United Nations Special Envoy for Climate Ambition and Solutions, President of the C40 Board, and 108th Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg noted that many of the world's fastest growing cities are in Africa, adding that the ten mayors can help show cities everywhere how to protect public health, fight climate change, and expand economic opportunity all at the same time. \</doc>

Since 2015, underinvestment has remained one of the key issues for the global oil and gas industry, the secretary general of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) said. Mohamed Hamel made this known during the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and GECF third high-level meeting Energy Dialogue, at the OPEC secretariat, in Vienna, Austria. The Meeting was co-chaired by Haitham Al Ghais, OPEC Secretary General and Mohamed Hamel. In Nigeria's context, divestments from onshore and shallow water fields by multinational oil companies have crimped the country's oil output. The bulk of the country's oil output which used to come from onshore fields has now shifted to deep-water fields, which vandals cannot easily sabotage. In August this year, Austin Avuru, the executive chairman and founder, AA holdings Limited identified increasing divestment by multinationals by IOCs as reasons for Nigeria's struggling oil output. Furthermore, Haitham in his opening address said meeting the world's growing demand for energy; correcting public misperceptions about the oil and gas industry; reducing energy poverty: none of these issues can be tackled by any one organization acting on its own. They require cooperation, openness and dialogue. He said, 'Our cooperation with the GECF is an utmost priority for OPEC. It is consistent with the ethos of all our energy dialogues, as all parties benefit from constructive dialogue, open and transparent use of data and the exchange of best practices.' Hamel added, 'both our organizations also share a lot of ground on the environmental agenda'. The Secretaries General emphasized that the oil and gas industry has an important role to play in a just and inclusive energy transition and supports the need to reduce emissions, bolster efficiency and embrace innovation. 'Events in 2022 have underscored the importance of ensuring that there is an investment-friendly climate for the industry,' according to a statement by GECF. Furthermore, the meeting highlighted the importance of data and knowledge exchange, which contributes to improved accuracy of data flow. Going forward, the two Organizations will intensify participation in yearly data and statistically focused meetings. They will continue to engage under the Joint Organizations Data Initiative (JODI). Furthermore, the meeting resolved to continue and strengthen cooperation; increase knowledge sharing by participating in each other's events; and work together on environmental matters in the build-up to the 27th Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC ( COP27 ) to be held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Also, It noted the progress that has been achieved since the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between OPEC and the GECF in October 2019. 'The two Organizations have intensified cooperation across a range of areas over the last three years,' the statement by GECF said. 'For example, both organizations now contribute to each other's flagship publications - the World Oil Outlook (WOO) and Global Gas Outlook (GGO) - on a reciprocal basis.' In addition, the leaders agreed to hold the next High-Level Meeting of the OPEC-GECF Energy Dialogue in 2023. OPEC and GECF have common Member Countries and shared values. Algeria, Equatorial Guinea, IR Iran, Libya, Nigeria, and Venezuela are members of both. OPEC Member Countries Angola, Iraq, and the United Arab Emirates are GECF Observers. \</doc>

The United Nations High Level Champion for COP26, Nigel Topping, has emphasised the importance of enhanced resilience to climate change, even as he rallied support for green energy transition during his two-day official visit to Nigeria. Topping who visited Nigeria last week, engaged with the government on the implementation of national climate change plans, including the Nationally Determined Contributions, Energy Transition Plan and Climate Change Act and ramp up ambition towards meeting Nigeria's net-zero by 2060 goal. He was appointed by the UK Government High Level Climate Champion for COP 26 in January 2020, to help drive action from businesses, investors, organisations, cities, and regions on climate change and coordinate this work with governments and parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Speaking during the visit, Topping said: "I congratulate Nigeria on its ambitious NDC, the Energy Transition Plan presented at COP26 last November and the subsequent passing of the Climate Change Act. Implementation of these policies are now key. "The mobilisation of both state and non-state actors - including businesses, academia and civil society - is essential to improve the investment climate of Nigeria so that the country can in turn attract the right investments that will accelerate the transition into a low-carbon and resilient economy." British Deputy High Commissioner in Lagos, Ben Llewellyn-Jones, said: "With the UK as the current Presidency of COP and following the historic COP26 event held in Glasgow last November, and ahead of COP27 in Egypt later this year, it was important for us to have Nigel Topping here in Nigeria. "His visit is a timely reminder for all of us about how hard the UK is continuing to work around the world with our partners, like Nigeria, to ensure that every effort is made to deliver on and bring in to effect the commitments made by us, by Nigeria and buy the rest of the world to tackle Climate Change." A statement from the Press and Public Affairs officer, British Deputy High Commission, Ndidiamaka Ezde, revealed that during his visit, he met with top government officials, leading private and financial sector leaders, civil society organisations and climate change activists across Abuja and Lagos, and discussed the opportunities of a green transition, understand the challenges and how to overcome them, as well as advance the UK government's overall effort to boost climate action in Nigeria. \</doc>

Ike Amos Dublin, Ireland - Few days after President Muhammadu Buhari officially flagged off crude oil exploration in the Kolmani River oil and gas field, located between Bauchi and Gombe states, the government of Niger State said it has commenced the search for crude oil in the Bida Basin of the state. Simplified geological map of Bida basin showing the approximate location of the study In a statement by the Federal Ministry of Petroleum in Abuja, Governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, disclosed that the search was as a result of evidence of large quantities of the commodity in the inland basin in the state. Bello, who was represented by Secretary to the Niger State Government, Alhaji Ahmed Mutane, at the 7th National Council of Hydrocarbons meeting which took place in the state, posited that there is a proven presence of commercially viable hydrocarbons in the Bida Basin of the State. To this end, he added that the state government had engaged Whitepages International Company Limited, as a consultant, in collaboration with the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University and the Federal University of Technology. He disclosed that the state and its partners would be seeking to explore and harness the hydrocarbon opportunities in the Bida Basin, adding that so far, the result had been impressive. Furthermore, Bello expressed optimism that achieving the Energy Transition Plan in Nigeria was attainable, if the leadership of the country is able to strategically outline the right policy directions and draw up implementable frameworks for the supervisory agencies correctly. Also speaking, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, restated the government's eagerness and commitment towards achieving its Net-zero emission targets by 2060. Sylva, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum Resources, Ambassador Gabriel Aduda, stated that already, Nigeria had commenced the mitigation and adaptation of proactive measures towards achieving its net-zero emission targets by 2060. He further noted that the recently concluded U.N Climate Conference ( COP27 ) held in Egypt, offered another opportunity for Nigeria to identify opportunities for cooperation and collaboration with other countries and international organisations that would help accelerate mitigation and adaptation of proactive measures towards achieving its Net-zero emissions targets. The Minister stated that, Nigeria as a major oil producing country on the African continent was not only committed to Net-zero by 2060 and its Energy Transition Plan but was among the first 50 to have launched its guidelines for the management of fugitive methane and greenhouse gases emissions in the upstream oil and gas sector. He added that this was expected to be gazette by the first quarter of 2023, after which the Nigeria Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) shall forward to all stakeholders, six months compliance directives to reduce Nigeria's emission footprints and increase its air quality. He said: "As a member of the African Petroleum Producers' Organization, Nigeria is committed to working and supporting other member countries who desire to develop their methane management guidelines and fostering cooperation and collaboration for cleaner processing of fossil fuels. "Oil and gas are a major development resource for Africa and will be for a long time to come. We are however putting measures in place to ensure cleaner processes and processing to mitigate the impact of methane and greenhouse gases." Sylva also noted that one of the gains recorded in Nigeria's oil and gas sector with the signing of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021 was the creation of regulatory frameworks with clear and non-overlapping mandates for the growth and development of the oil and gas sector.

THE World Bank and the US Export-Import Bank (EximBank) have pledged over $3 billion to the implementation of Nigeria's energy transition plan. The international organisations made the commitment on Wednesday at the official global launching of the Energy Transition Plan by the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo. Shubham Chaudhuri, Nigeria Country Director, World Bank, said the international bank planned to commit over $1.5 billion towards the country's energy transition plan. 'We plan to commit over $1.5 billion towards the Energy Transition Plan on renewable energy, on power sector reforms, and potentially hydropower, on clean cooking, and wherever opportunities arise,' he said. 'The policy and institutional reforms that will be necessary are also part of the agenda and we hope to be able to provide support for the fundamentally imperative of energy access but in a way that is consistent with the energy transition, what I think of as the NEAT imperative. 'The Nigerian Energy Access and Transition (NEAT) imperative is what we here at the World Bank are absolutely committed to supporting.' On his part, Adam Cortese, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Sun Africa, a renewable energy solutions company, said it was in the final stage of talks with the US EXIM Bank on a $1.5 billion financing package. 'The launch of Nigeria's Energy Transition Plan has further accelerated our efforts, proving Nigeria to be fertile grounds for investments in the sector. We are in the final stages of discussion with US EXIM Bank on a $1.5 billion financing package,' Adam said. 'We are truly excited about the future and we are looking forward to helping Nigeria lead by way of example in Africa.' Speaking at the official unveiling of the transition plan, Osinbajo said Nigeria's energy transition requires a significant scale of resources which includes spending $410 billion by 2060. According to him, 'Energy use is crucial for almost every conceivable aspect of development; wealth, health, nutrition, water, infrastructure, education, and life expectancy are significantly related to the consumption of energy per capita. 'Nigeria would need to spend 410 billion dollars above business-as-usual spending to deliver our transition plan by 2060, which translates to about 10 billion dollars per year. 'The average $3 billion dollars per year investments in renewable energy recorded for the whole of Africa between 2000 and 2020 will certainly not suffice.' He added that Nigeria has set up an interministerial energy transition implementation working group and is 'currently engaging with partners to secure an initial $10 billion support package ahead of COP27 .' At COP26 in Glasgow last year, President Muhammadu Buhari announced Nigeria's ambition to achieve net-zero by 2060 drawing on insights from the country's Energy Transition Plan which was developed through the Energy Transition Commission to chart out Nigeria's unique energy transition pathway. \</doc>

Marketing professionals, the Managing Director, P&G Nigeria, Mokutima Ajileye; and business and marketing professional, Oare Ojeikere, at the Advertisers Association of Nigeria, Chief Marketing Officer Forum on Friday with the theme, &lsquo;The evolving role of the CMO&rdquo; in Lagos. Ajileye said, &ldquo;Adaptability is about change and change itself is inevitable, hence the continuous need for CMOs to make sure they follow the current trends and quickly adapt to new developments in the industry. This adaptability is necessary because CMOs must see themselves as business leaders who have the duty to focus on increasing the growth of their brand.&rdquo; She urged CMOs to know that volatility, disruption and various changes in the marketing industry were more now than ever before. According to her, there was a need to move swiftly and be on top of their game in order to remain a force to reckon with in the industry. Related News Experts to discuss mental health in workplace Experts urge marketers to redefine roles Experts want common position for Africa at COP 27 She advised that neutrality was not an option for brands nowadays but, CMOs need to make sure that their brands stood for social cause anytime it arose in order to warm their brands into the minds of the consumers. CMOs, she noted, needed to safeguard consumers by having a clear vision of consumers' wants and needs. They must also operate against the backdrop of increased consumers' expectations and address them with great sensitivity. While Ojeikere, speaking on &lsquo;Changing role, capability and deliverable: Implication for business and marketers', said, &ldquo;CMOs and other brand custodians need to realise that the marketplace has significantly changed, making their relevance diminish in significance. CMOs must realise that consumers can no longer be pushed around in the face of fierce competition occasioned by tougher and more strong players, increasing commoditised products and worsening economy. \</doc>

From Adewale Sanyaolu, New York President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday called for outright\~ debt cancellation for countries facing the most severe challenges. Buhari stated this in his statement at the General Debate of\~ the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA 77) holding in New York, United States of America. Though, he did not single out Nigeria in the debt forgiveness plea, available fstatistics put Nigeria's external debt at\~$39.69 billion as of March 2022. The Nigerian leader explained that the multifaceted challenges facing most developing countries have placed a debilitating chokehold on their fiscal space. This, he said, equally calls for an urgent need to address the burden of unsustainable external debt\~ through a global commitment\~ to the expansion and extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative to countries facing fiscal and liquidity challenges. On energy transition, he tasked global leaders and Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) on the need to make funding and technology available to achieve energy transition success. As a first step, he said every stakeholder\~ must all commit to releasing the financing and the technology to create a stable and affordable framework for energy transition. Buhari added that Development Financial Institutions must prioritise de-risking energy projects to improve credit access to renewable projects, adding that there should be no countries "left behind" in this equation. Fortunately, he said Nigeria now knows what it can do to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis and the related energy challenge. He maintained that sky-rocketing energy costs worldwide are, in part, the product of conflict and supply disruptions to Europe and the Americas. ''Yet, we are all paying the price. It is, therefore, our expectation that this UNGA 77 and the upcoming COP 27 will help galvanise the political will required to drive action towards the fulfilment of the various existing climate change initiatives." \</doc>

The Minister, Sadiya Umar Farouq made this known at a Side Event at COP 27 , on Wednesday, held in Sharm El Shiek, Egypt where world stakeholders are meeting to proffer solutions to mitigate extreme climate changes. Farouq said that climate change-induced hydro-meteorological events were causing devastating humanitarian crises in Nigeria hence the urgent need to scale up climate change adaptation efforts. 'The Nigerian Government through the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development is scaling up climate change adaptation efforts in Nigeria so as to build community resilience and adaptation practices to mitigate and reduce the consequence of climate change. 'The reason we are here is to harness and discuss good practices, programs and strategies that other countries are using to reduce vulnerabilities of Climate Change. We want to know how to build adaptive capacities and resilience in line with national and international policies and commitments in Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation. 'Specifically, we want to know how to identify and map out climate change risks better and generate political will to implement and finance national adaptation projects, as we harmonize inputs and launch a people-centered climate change adaptation in coordination with key partners like the Ministry of Environment and other relevant MDAs. 'We will work with the Nigerian National Adaptation Plan which seeks to reduce vulnerability of communities to the impacts of climate change by building adaptive capacity and resilience. The Plan also advocates the integration of climate change adaptation into relevant new and existing policies, programs and activities as well as in development planning processes and strategies,' the Minister said. According to her, the recent large-scale displacements, infrastructural damage and loss of farmlands following extreme flooding have led to disruption of livelihoods, increased risk of hunger as farmers are unable to grow crops as well as heightened fear of the outbreak of malaria, cholera, diarrhea and other waterborne diseases. Among the panelists who discussed Scaling Up of Climate Change Adaptation Efforts in Nigeria were Amjad Abbashar, Chief of United Nations Office For Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), Regional Office For Africa, Sylvia Wabbes agronomist with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on emergency and resilience for agriculture and food-based livelihoods systems, Dr. Pasang Dolma Sherpa, Executive Director of Center for Indigenous Peoples' Research and Development (CIPRED), Halima Bawa-Bwari, Director Federal Ministry of Environment and Head of Vulnerability and Adaptation Division in the Department of Climate Change and Dr. Abubakar A.

This is coming twenty seven years after his execution on 10 November 1995 alongside eight other Ogoni leaders. According to a statement released to Daily Sun Correspondent in Warri to mark the day by Kome Odhomor, Media/Communication Lead, Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF), Ken Saro-Wiwa while he was alive was quoted to have said: "We are going to demand our rights peacefully, non violently and we shall win. I tell you this, I may be dead but my ideas will not die." These words remain emblazoned on his tomb. "Twenty seven years after his execution on 10 November 1995 alongside eight other Ogoni leaders, their spirit lives on and the struggle they led continues to inspire the resistance to ecological crimes by extractive companies in Nigeria and around the world", the statement reads. In his remarks, Nnimmo Bassey, an environmental activist and the Director Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF) stated that "Today as we remember Ken Saro-Wiwa and the eight Ogoni leaders who were wrongfully executed by the Nigerian state on November 10 1995, we also call to mind the several earth and human rights defenders who have been martyred across the world by, or for, fossil fuel and mining corporations. "Blood has flowed, our lands have been polluted, and the world is heating. We demand justice for our heroes, a halt to dependence on fossil fuels  the real climate action and a restoration of all polluted lands and reparation for ecocide." The statement further said; "As the World discusses the deteriorating climate concerns at the ongoing COP27 , the need to shift away from dirty energy has never been more urgent. "In honour of climate protectors whose lives were brutally cut short the UNFCCC needs to have a clause in the negotiated climate convention that ensures protection of those upholding the rights of nature, planet and people," says Makoma Lakelakala of Earthlife Johanesburg Celestine Akpobari, Team Leader at Peoples Advancement Centre, Nigeria, shared that "On this occasion, we want to remind the world that the situation of things in Ogoni and are far worse than they were in the days of Ken Saro-Wiwa. "It has been said during this climate change conference that the world is on a speed lane to climate Hell, but I want to say that Ogoni people have been there all these years." Akpobari further stated that " the planned forceful resumption of oil operations in Ogoniland should be halted as it is capable of provoking conflict. We also resist the new scramble for African oil and gas." Emem Okon, Director Kabetkache Women Development and Resource Centre in Nigeria noted that "As we remember Ken Saro-Wiwa and other martyrs today, we pledge to carry on with their messages, and insist that all The death of the Ogoni leaders followed a brutal crackdown by the Nigerian government on peaceful demonstrators who were frustrated by the destruction of their land and livelihoods. Ken Saro-Wiwa was executed along with the eight Ogoni leaders: Saturday Dobee, Nordu Eawo, Daniel Gbooko, Paul Levera, Felix Nuate, Baribor Bera, Barinem Kiobel and John Kpuine. Twenty-seven years later, despite witnesses accepting they had been bribed to testify falsely against the activists, justice has still not been served. We demand an exoneration of Ken Saro-Wiwa and all martyrs of extractivism", the statement added. \</doc>

Oil spill pollution in Bayelsa State, a part of the Niger Delta region Mkpoikana Udoma Port Harcourt - Stakeholders in the Niger Delta region have vowed to carry out legal action against the ongoing onshore and shallow water divestment by multinational oil companies over the environmental contamination caused by oil and gas activities in the area.They said the international oil companies, IOCs, must first remediate the environment before the divestment.The stakeholders at the Conference on Oil Company Divestment in the Niger Delta, accused the oil majors of taking criminal flight in the name of divestment, in order to evade responsibility for decades of air, land and water pollution in the region.Executive Director of We The People, Mr Ken Henshaw, warned that if the oil companies were not held accountable now, the entire Niger Delta region would become like Oloibiri, which he described as  abandoned museum of fossil fuel monuments. Henshaw said the oil companies were not being asked to stay, but only to restore the environment the way it was in 1956 before oil and gas exploitation and the concomitant pollution became the norm.He maintained that global appetite for crude oil was reducing by the day as more countries were pulling out of the fossil fuel sector because of climate change concerns and wondered what will happened to the contaminated Niger Delta environment when the country eventually moves to cleaner sources of energy.According to him,  We must hold these companies accountable today because tomorrow will be too late. We will use all available legal means to hold the companies accountable. The people of the Niger Delta will go to court. We have been slow already. We should have gone to court already. In the coming weeks, the people of Niger Delta will institute a class action halting the divestment by oil multinationals. We are not asking them to stay, we are simply asking them to assess the level of environmental damages they have caused, restore their health and livelihoods and fix their environments before you go. If you rent a house, when you're packing out, you restore any damaged property in the house back to how you met it. The Niger Delta today is not how the oil companies met it in 1956, and we will use every legal method to hold them accountable. Similarly, Executive Director of Policy Alert, Mr Tijah Bolton-Akpan, regretted that the Petroleum Industry Act provides widow for oil multinationals to divest criminally. The just concluded COP27 was anchored on loss and damage; which loss and damage is greater than the damages incurred by the Niger Delta communities for 65years of criminal extraction of oil and gas from our backyards? Loss and damage should be the next lens from which the divestment by IOCs from the Niger Delta should be looked at, he said.On his part, the spokesperson of the Pan Niger Delta Elders Forum, Chief Ken Robbinson, lamented that regulatory agencies have all been compromised, corollary with the weak laws in the country. The major reason why the Niger Delta environment is in a mess is because regulation is very poor. We need stronger institutions. Also, a Public Health Physician and Environmental Advocate, Dr. Bieye Briggs,explained that pregnant women in the region were already at risk of birthing newborn babies with birth defect, and called for immediate halt on hydrocarbon pollution in the region. Cancinogenous effects of hydrocarbon pollution alter the normal formation of the human organs. Pollution contributes to infant mortality, through preterm delivery, low birth weight, acute respiratory distress syndrome, congenital malfunctions, pneumonia etc, he stated.

By Vivian EmoniThe Cardinal Onaiyekan Foundation for Peace (COFP), on Thursday planted 150 trees at the Science Primary School, Kuje, in FCT, and urged government to provide seedlings to schools to mitigate impact of climate change in the country.The Executive Director of the foundation, Rev. Sister Agatha Chikwelue, said that the aim of the exercise is to commemorate 2022 International Children's Day.Chikwelue said that the essence of planting the trees in the school was to support the government curb the impact of climate change in the FCT.She said that the theme of the 2022 international children's day is "Equity and inclusion for Every Child".According to her, "we are here Thursday to commemorate the 2022 International Children's Day," saying that the UN set the date for the celebration on Nov. 20, 1959.She said that the foundation decided to mark the day earlier because Nov. 20 is a Sunday and might not be able to gather enough children in schools."So, we decided to choose Thursday to be able to gather enough children in the school and rejoice with them."Celebrating with the children is to make them understand their importance in the society. I always say that there is no future without children. There is no sustainability without children."When we talk about the future of humanity, then we're talking about children. Every year we have this culture of celebrating with children."For this year's celebration, we decided to make it a little bit different by focusing our attention on tree planting because of what is happening today in our environment."As we are talking, we all know that the climate change conference COP27 in Egypt was held because of the level of destruction of the environment that has led to climate change," she said.The Executive Director warned Nigerians to desist from activities that could damage the environment, adding that these are architects of the menace.She said the foundation decided to visit the children to educate them on the importance of protecting the environment, and making them environmentally conscious."We decided to go towards the sub satellite towns in the FCT, so that we will be able to get more children who are living in the community."They will know the importance of tree planting and how to hold their teachers and parents responsible."Let them always remind their parents and teachers to always plant trees and whenever they cut one tree they must replace it with five trees."This is one of the best ways to checkmate and mitigate the impact of climate change," she said.Chikwelue also called on the private sector and other relevant stakeholders to support the project by providing seedlings and offer other possible ways to ensure that climate change and other environmental challenges are tackled effectively.The Head Teacher of the school, Mrs Asabi Boyi, said that the school authority would ensure that the trees are monitored adequately.Also speaking at the event, the Head of Department, Primary School Services, Local Education Authority Project, Mr Danladi Sule, said that tree planting helps to curb the impact of climate change in environment.Sule called on government and other relevant Nigerians to cultivate the habit of planting trees as such would address the environmental challenges in the country.Speaking on behalf other students, Miss Nana Musani appealed to the government to provide access to education to children, adding that most students are out of school.According to her, "we also need free writing materials, furniture, and other supports from government and meaningful Nigerians.

African and other global leaders meeting in Rotterdam say the continent is at a tipping point for climate adaptation COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheik, Egypt, African and other global leaders have rallied in Rotterdam, to highlight the urgency of climate adaptation funding for the continent. Former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and GCA Co-Chair said: 'The world has a fever. It burns hotter and higher with every day that passes... Statistics tell us that Africa is where the fever is at its most intense and people at the most vulnerable.' GCA Co-Chair and Honorary Chairman of Royal DSM Feike Sijbesma spoke about the importance of support from the global private sector. He said 80% of the funding for adaptation needs to come from the private sector in both the developed north and the developing south. GCA Chief Executive Officer Patrick Verkooijen emphasized the disastrous impacts of climate change hitting all parts of the world. He said it is in Africa, however, that climate shocks will hit the hardest. He said Africa was resolute about its economic advancement and would not stop. 'Adaptation in Africa is like climbing a mountain. With all of you here today, we have the dream team that will climb the mountain together.' Verkooijen added: 'The next summit after today is Sharm El-Sheikh, the Africa COP. But success in Egypt will hinge on whether Africa's needs are met or not. Africa has the commitment and the plan. That plan is the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAA-P). It is Africa-developed and Africa-owned. It was launched by Africa's leaders, who are here today. It is the vehicle for delivering the Africa Adaptation Initiative.' Established in 2020 by the GCA and the African Development Bank, the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program lies at the center of climate action on the African continent. Participants acknowledged Verkooijen's and Adesina's joint efforts as the driving forces behind the program. African Union Chairperson, President Macky Sall of Senegal, President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana, who is Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, and President Felix Tshisekedi of the Democratic of the Congo conveyed a unified message: the international community must deliver on its pledge to double adaptation finance and to scale adaptation action for Africa. President Sall expressed disappointment at the absence of industrialized country leaders at the summit. The African Union Chair said if African leaders could be in Rotterdam in person to discuss such a crucial issue as climate adaptation in Africa, the very least they expected was that their European counterparts-whose countries are among the world's biggest polluters-would also have been present at the summit. This sentiment was shared by Presidents Akufo-Addo and Tshisekedi, African Union Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat and UN Deputy Secretary General Amina Mohammed, among others. Mohammed said: 'A bird only flies with two wings, and the representation at this table is lopsided.' The UN deputy chief added that it was not Africa's fault that it is in its current position, given that it contributes very little to global carbon emissions. She pondered on what the situation would have been if the roles had been reversed. Mohammed said the COP26 Glasgow pact was at risk of failing if the developed world did not make good on its promises of delivering $100 billion a year for climate action in developing countries. In his intervention ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3KRxQDi https://bit.ly/3KRxQDi The African Development Bank chief explained that in the face of the deluge, Africa does not have the resources to tackle climate change. He said the continent receives only 3% of global climate financing. He noted that if this trend continued, Africa's climate financing gap could reach between $100 billion to $127 billion per year through 2030. Adesina said: 'The current climate financing architecture is not meeting the needs of Africa. New estimates by the African Economic Outlook of the African Development Bank show that Africa will need between 1.3 and 1.6 trillion dollars from 2020 to 2030, or $118 billion to $145 billion annually to implement its commitments to the Paris Agreement and its nationally determined contributions.' The African Development Bank chief said the African Adaptation Acceleration Program's upstream facility at the GCA had already helped to generate $3 billion of mainstreamed climate adaptation investments by the African Development Bank, from agriculture to energy, transport, water, and sanitation. Adesina spoke of the African Development Bank's African Development Fund (ADF), its concessionary lending arm as one of the ways to address the climate financing gap. He said the 16th replenishment of the fund, currently underway, presented a unique opportunity for full financing of the $12.5 billion in financing for the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program. The African Development Bank chief explained that the African Development Fund had introduced a Climate Action Window that would hopefully mobilize $4 billion to $13 billion for climate adaptation for the Fund's member countries. 'This will be used to support 20 million farmers with access to climate resilient agricultural technologies, access of 20 million farmers and pastoralists to weather-indexed crop insurance, reviving 1 million hectares of degraded land, and provision of renewable energy for about 9.5 million people. Adesina said commitments by developed countries to provide $100 billion annually in climate finance for developing countries was long overdue. 'Africa cannot wait,' he emphasized. 'This is the time to support the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program. This is the time to support the ADF 16th replenishment. This is the time to support the Climate Action Window of ADF-16.' World Trade Organization Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala also lent her voice to the clarion call for additional resources for Africa adaptation funding. Speaking about the role of trade in climate adaptation, she said trade policies should be integrated into global climate action as an amplifying force for financing and other climate-related support provided to vulnerable economies. The summit's five-point Communique ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3AYZbyO https://bit.ly/3AYZbyO COP27 will depend on whether the needs of Africa, the world's most climate-vulnerable continent, are met with finance flowing into such key country-led adaptation programs as the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program. This is a collective effort, we need every sector, every contribution possible to see off the climate crisis in Africa, and the private sector, in particular, has a massive role to play.' \</doc>

Within the framework of development cooperation with the WBG, and as one of Egypt's largest multilateral development partners, Al-Mashat will be participating in a variety of events on accelerating the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and enhancing efforts towards the green transition, especially ahead of COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh. Some of the minister's activities will include the Intergovernmental G24 Ministers and Governors Annual Meeting; the Global Food Security Symposium organized by Citibank in cooperation with George Washington University and the Elliott School of International Affairs; and the World Economic Forum's Digital Payments Executive Roundtable. Moreover, Al-Mashat will participate in several events organized by the development partners and private sector such as, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the European Investment Bank (EIB), Amazon Web Services, and the Rockefeller Foundation, as well as being a speaker in the IMF's "Promoting Inclusive Growth in the Middle East and North Africa: Challenges and Opportunities in a Post-Pandemic World". While in Washington, Al-Mashat will also hold several bilateral meetings with Sergio Pimenta, the IFC's Regional Vice President for Africa; Jurgen Voegele, the WBG's Vice President for Sustainable Development Practice Group; Minister Azucena Arbeleche, Uruguay's Minister of Economy and Finance; Gelsomina Vigliotty , European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice President for Mashreq Region; Junaid Kamal Ahmad, the Vice President for Operations of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA); and Badr Mohamed El Saad, the Director General and Chairman of the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD). Egypt and the WBG share a development cooperation portfolio of 14 ongoing projects worth $6.8 billion, as well as 23 projects with technical support and consultancy. Recently, The Ministry of International Cooperation announced the approval of a $400 million development financing agreement to develop sustainable infrastructure in the transport sector in Egypt, supporting the transition towards low-carbon transport along the Alexandria-the 6th of October-Greater Cairo Area (GCA) railway corridor, as well as $500 million for food security. Last June, a high-level delegation from the Board of Executive Directors of the World Bank Group visited Cairo, and a statement was issued by the Bank, during which the World Bank Group's commitment to continue supporting development priorities in Egypt was issued.

Download logo "The fight for natural resources is a common trigger for conflict in many places. When I was in Uganda, I saw what an immense impact climate change and loss of biodiversity have on people's lives," says Anna Merrifield, Director of the recently created Unit for Climate and Environmental Diplomacy at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Anna Merrifield has been a diplomat for nearly two decades. She has worked in Finland's embassies in Tunisia and South Africa, among other countries. She served as Deputy Head of the European Union Delegation to Uganda as her latest assignment. The four years in Uganda confirmed Merrifield's view of the significance of climate and environmental issues for development policy and, more broadly, for foreign policy. "Developing countries need us to support them in adapting to the challenges and problems created by climate change," Merrifield says. A key learning from the years in Africa was to understand the disparity of perspectives. "In Europe, the bulk of news coverage is now focusing on the energy concerns of households. They are major problems for people, and they can affect the daily lives of us all. However, they are global concerns, too, as the Russian invasion of Ukraine is having dramatic adverse effects on Africa, Asia and the Middle East. In many countries, first the pandemic took away jobs and then drought wiped out crops. Now the price of food has reached a level that forces people to choose between school fees and food," Merrifield describes the worsening food security in the world. "We must show the developing countries that we have not forgotten them now that Europeans have had to focus on Ukraine and on countering the effects Russia's aggression has on Europe." Swift action is needed to adapt to climate change Drought and lack of jobs are driving migration flows, first to big African cities and then to Europe. "Climate issues are also part of foreign and security policy. That is why people in Finland should be interested in them. For example, China's ongoing water crisis may have greater consequences for the global economy than the COVID-19 pandemic," Merrifield says. Finland has invested heavily in climate action in recent years. Around 12 per cent of Finland's development cooperation appropriations go directly to climate projects. Climate resilience and environmental protection are crosscutting objectives of development cooperation, too. Finland is set to raise its annual share of international climate finance to around EUR 200 million in the coming years. "In the COP27 As a new Director of the Unit, Merrifield wants to integrate international climate and environmental matters into mainstream foreign policy. "Climate diplomacy is already part of all our work. In the future, we should pay more attention to safeguarding biodiversity, because it is our lifeline," Merrifield says. "Finland has a lot to offer not only in terms of policies but also as a supplier of solutions and as a promoter of sustainable climate and energy policy. The new unit will focus on bringing different policy areas and solutions on the same table. By working together, we can be a bigger global player than our size would suggest," says the new Director of Unit.

Download logo The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has welcomed a total US$ 4.1 million contribution from the Government of Iceland and the Government of Norway to support thousands of people facing severe hunger at the peak of the lean season in Malawi. The joint contribution - comprised of US$3.6 million from Norway and US$500,000 from Iceland - will provide critical humanitarian assistance to some 270,000 people through cash-based transfers in the districts of Balaka and Chikwawa where smallholder farmers have been heavily affected by climate shocks and rising food prices. "We commend the Governments of Norway and Iceland for their strong commitment to ensuring the food security of the most vulnerable during this exceptionally difficult lean season," says Paul Turnbull, WFP\' s Country Director in Malawi. "As world leaders and experts meet at COP27 in Egypt, we must highlight the urgent need to help communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis and invest in durable solutions." Some 3.8 million people are estimated to be acutely food insecure and in need of food assistance between October 2022 and March 2023 according to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report - over 130 percent increase compared to the same time last year. Malawi has been heavily impacted by the global food crisis where the devastating effects of natural disasters have been exacerbated by rising prices of food, energy and fertilisers caused in part by the conflict in Ukraine. "Norway reiterates its commitment to a more food secure and resilient Malawi," says Her Excellency Ingrid Marie Mikelsen, Ambassador of the Kingdom of Norway to the Republic of Malawi. "Norway recognises the long-standing expertise of WFP and other players to provide essential and opportune assistance in times like these to ensure more people do not slip into hunger." Coordinated interventions will ensure the most effective and wide-reaching response possible thanks to resources mobilised both by the Government of Malawi, humanitarian and development partners. "Iceland remains steadfast in its support to vulnerable Malawians at risk of hunger," said Inga D\'f3ra P\'e9tursd\'f3ttir, Head of Mission of the Embassy of Iceland in Malawi. "The increasing risk of climatic shocks worsens a vicious cycle of food insecurity, which is why Iceland partnered with WFP to help vulnerable families to mitigate and manage the impacts of these shocks." The Government of Malawi is grateful to Norway and Iceland for their generous contribution to the 2022-2023 lean season response," said Charles Kalemba, Commissioner of the Department of Disaster Management Affairs. Their support will ensure less Malawians go hungry and that Malawi can remain focused on its development goals." The cooperation between the Nordic nations is not only based on political history and geographical location, but also on common values   such as democracy, trust, transparency, equality, equity and sustainability. Both Iceland and Norway have provided catalytic funding to WFP school feeding in Malawi and were the first supporters of the home-grown school feeding model that began in 2014. Norway currently provides direct financial support to WFP\' s home-grown school feeding in addition to supporting the UN Joint Programme on Girls Education, a US$ 40 million programme implemented jointly by WFP, UNICEF and UNFPA. Norway was also a key supporter of WFP activities during the COVID-19 Urban Cash Initiative (CUCI) response in 2020. Since 2014 Iceland has supported WFP school feeding activities in Mangochi and, more recently, has expanded support to include and resilience-building activities in the same district. Additionally, Iceland supported WFP activities linked to the national COVID-19 response as well as provided support to flood victims in Chikwawa district earlier this year.

By Ismaila Chafe President Muhammadu Buhari has called on African countries and their Arab partners to work hard and be more united to realise common objectives. According to a statement by the President's spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina, the president made the call at a bilateral meeting with the President of Palestine, Mahmoud Abbas, in New York,United States, on Wednesday. "The rest of the world need to be apprised on current state of things between Palestine and Israel in order to commit to the way forward. "There should be a better collaboration between African countries on one side and our Arab bothers to get to the end of this matter," he said. The Palestinian President had visited his Nigerian counterpart to thank him for being a consistent supporter of the Palestinian cause even as he reflected it in his (Buhari's) address at the floor of the General Assembly and to solicit his support by rallying other African countries to their side. He regretted that the Palestinian issue had dragged for a long time without commensurate progress, adding that "there is a daily loss of lives on the Palestinian side." Abbas added that Palestinians had decided to pursue a peaceful path towards resolving the matter by relying on nations like Nigeria to help in a peaceful resolution of the Two-State solution as recommended by the United Nations Resolution. Meanwhile, the Nigerian leader also met with Mahamadou Issoufou, former President of Niger Republic and Special envoy of the UN and African Union on Joint Strategic Assessment and Governance Situation in the Sahel. He stressed the essence of a collaboration between the Lake Chad Basin Commission and the Green Great Wall. According to him, this is imperative in order to combat the desertification spreading across some African states. He said it would also help in finding practical solutions to the displacement of over 30 million persons whose means of livelihood depended on the shrunken Lake Chad. The president expressed optimism that with his wealth of experience and capacity, Issoufou would get the job done. The former Nigerien leader had informed President Buhari that they required Nigerian support to raise funds for their activities especially as desertification was spreading across a number of African countries. He noted that most of the countries were severely challenged. Issoufou added that the committee needed to visit the countries involved to know their specific needs and would, at this instance, be in Nigeria in October this year. He requested Buhari to convene a side event at the COP27 meeting in November in Egypt so that it could come up with a rich outcome for the committee to use as a basis for its report.

The United Nations High Level Champion for COP26, Nigel Topping, visited Nigeria from the 14th to 16th June, to engage with government on the implementation of national climate change plans, including the Nationally Determined Contributions, Energy transition Plan and Climate Change Act, and ramp up ambition towards meeting Nigeria's net-zero by 2060 goal. Topping was appointed the UK Government's High Level Climate Champion for COP 26 in January 2020 to help drive action from businesses, investors, organisations, cities and regions on climate change and coordinate this work with governments and parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). During his visit, he met with top government officials, leading private and financial sector leaders, civil society organisations and climate change activists across Abuja and Lagos, and discussed the opportunities of a green transition, understand the challenges and how to overcome them as well as advance the UK government's overall effort to boost climate action in Nigeria. The visit included a site visit to the Nile University, Abuja, where he engaged with young students on climate ambition and renewable energy; and a tour of two project sites in Lagos - PriVida Project, a UK renewable energy business, founded in 2013 to facilitate renewable technology transfer from developed countries to Africa hereby reducing carbon emissions significantly; and EKO Atlantic, to understand what the Lagos State Government is doing to improve climate resilience, including with support from UK Aid programmes. Speaking on his visit to Nigeria, Topping said: 'I congratulate Nigeria on its ambitious NDC, the Energy Transition Plan presented at COP26 last November and the subsequent passing of the Climate Change Act. Implementation of these policies are now key. 'The mobilisation of both state and non-state actors - including businesses, academia and civil society - is essential to improve the investment climate of Nigeria so that the country can in turn attract the right investments that will accelerate the transition into a low-carbon and resilient economy.' The British Deputy High Commissioner in Lagos, Ben Llewellyn-Jones OBE said: 'With the UK as the current Presidency of COP and following the historic COP26 event held in Glasgow last November, and ahead of COP27 in Egypt later this year, it was important for us to have Nigel Topping here in Nigeria. His visit is a timely reminder for all of us about how hard the UK is continuing to work around the world with our partners, like Nigeria, to ensure that every effort is made to deliver on and bring in to effect the commitments made by us, by Nigeria and buy the rest of the world to tackle climate change.' \</doc>

Download logo Some 50 participants from seven countries in the Western Sahel and Lake Chad Basin took part in an interactive training on integrating disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation into development decision-making in Nouakchott, Mauritania, on 23&ndash;25 August, the first of its kind in West Africa, at the invitation of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Sweden in partnership with the ECOWAS Commission. "In practice, disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation complement each other; they are two sides of the same coin with a common goal, which is to reduce the vulnerability of communities to current and future extreme weather events," explained Anna Tj&auml;rvar, Counsellor at the Swedish Embassy in Addis Ababa and Programme Officer for Environment, Climate Change and Renewable Energy in a video address. The high costs of the impacts of disasters and climate change related to droughts, fires, floods, and epidemics justify a different approach to development that considers the multiple underlying risks to which people are exposed. "Development gains remain fragile and are being challenged by new threats, including the impacts of climate change. These threats are interconnected, crossing national borders, and occurring simultaneously," said Cheikh Fall, United Nations Resident Coordinator a.i. in Mauritania. For this training, the Sahel Resilience Project supported by Sweden partnered with the UNDP Regional Bureau for Africa, UN agencies such as FAO and Unicef, and regional institutions, namely the African Union and ECOWAS Commissions and the Niamey-based AGRYMET/CILSS climate centre to help build the capacity of government officials in seven partner countries from the Sahel. "The training is timely as countries prepare for COP27 on climate change, where climate risk and development issues will be widely discussed," Mr. Fall underlined. The ECOWAS Vision 2025, and the Hydro-Met initiative, have led to significant advances in member states' policies in environment, agriculture, food security, disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. "Climate variability and extreme events are now major risks to sustainable development, and there is compelling scientific evidence that these threats will accelerate in the coming decades," said Mohammed Ibrahim, Head of the Disaster Risk Reduction and Humanitarian Affairs Division at the ECOWAS Commission in Abuja. "The integration of climate risk management into development planning and decision-making processes is now making it possible to exploit the synergies between development, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction," added Mr. Ibrahim. The approach introduced to participants at the Nouakchott training was developed by UNDP Crisis Bureau and Bureau for Policy and Programme Support in response to repeated requests for practical guidance on integrating disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation into development and the 2030 Agenda.[3] As a long-term strategic process, risk-informed development aims to integrate disaster and climate risks into development planning and budgeting processes at national, sub-national and sectoral levels. It recognizes the complexity of risk contexts, which are also characterized by insecurity, epidemics, and economic volatility. At the end of the three-day training, participants return to their respective countries in the Western Sahel and the Lake Chad Basin with a menu of concrete actions to advance risk-informed development in line with the African Union's Agenda 2063.

(AP) After a moment when hopes dimmed that the United States could become an international leader on climate change, legislation that Congress is poised to approve could rejuvenate the country's reputation and bolster its efforts to push other nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions more quickly. The head-snapping turn of events, which has generated a joyful case of whiplash among Democrats and environmentalists, is a reminder of how domestic politics is intertwined with worldwide diplomacy. Advocates feared that last month's breakdown in negotiations in Congress had undermined efforts to limit the catastrophic effects of global warming. Now they're energized by the opportunity to tout an unprecedented U.S. success. "This says, 'We're back, baby,'" said Jennifer Turner, who works on international climate issues as director of the Woodrow Wilson Center's China Environment Forum in Washington. The legislation, which also has provisions on taxes and prescription drugs, includes about $375 billion over the next decade for clean energy development and financial incentives for buying electric cars, installing solar panels and weaning the power grid off fossil fuels. Although the proposals were downsized during difficult negotiations, it's the single biggest investment in climate change in U.S. history, and a significant shift from years of inaction that limited Washington's clout overseas. Read also:\~Blinken heads to Congo after stop in South Africa The Senate passed the legislation on Sunday, and the House is expected to approve it on Friday. Then it goes to President Joe Biden for his signature. Poor nations remain concerned that rich countries like the United States have not fulfilled financial commitments to help them cope with global warming and transition to clean energy, something the legislation does not address. But Biden can still point to it as evidence that the U.S. political system can address the world's most pressing problems. "Our ability to have credibility on the global stage depends on our ability to deliver at home," said Ali Zaidi, the White House deputy national climate adviser. "We are the pace car. That helps other people go faster and faster." After President Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris climate accord, Biden entered office pledging to rejoin the fight against global warming. He set an ambitious new target for reducing greenhouse gas emission  at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030  and began proposing policies to put the country on track. The legislation that Biden is expected to sign is estimated to reduce emissions between 31% to 44%, according to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm. Further regulatory steps by the administration could close the rest of the gap. "It's good that finally the U.S. is trying to catch up after years of dragging its feet on climate change and this investment will go a long way to undoing some of the harm caused by the administration of President Trump," said Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa, a think tank based in Nairobi, Kenya. The movement on the bill comes just three months before the next U.N. conference on climate change, which is known as COP27 and will take place in Egypt. "Let's hope this legislation is the start of more international cooperation in the lead up to the COP27 summit, where the most vulnerable get the support they need," Adow said. Although the U.S. will still face entrenched skepticism, the progress in Washington may also give John Kerry, the White House's special envoy on climate, more momentum going into the conference in November. "It puts wind in his sail, it gives him a real credibility boost," Turner said. "This will change the whole dynamic." Several experts said the U.S. will be empowered to put more pressure on China, India and other nations that have high emissions but have been unwilling to cut back for economic reasons. "This restores some diplomatic legitimacy to the U.S. as an influential player in international climate negotiations," said Scott Moore, director of China Programs and Strategic Initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania. Shayak Sengupta, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation America, a Washington-based affiliate of a think tank in India, was less enthusiastic. "Considering that this bill is long over due after years of U.S. climate inaction, many countries may view this as the 'bare minimum' of the U.S.'s historical and moral responsibility for climate," he said. Sengupta emphasized that poor nations are still looking for rich countries to fulfill their $100 billion commitment for financial assistance to address global warming, an issue that's been a sore spot during international negotiations. There will be no shortage of other challenges, too. If Republicans retake Congress or the White House, they could unravel Biden's progress. Supply chains could struggle to accommodate increased demand for equipment like solar panels and batteries. China's foreign ministry on Friday announced the country is cutting off direct climate talks with the U.S. in response to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's trip to Taiwan, severing a rare point of longstanding, if sometimes tumultuous, cooperation between the two countries. However, experts said China will still take notice if the U.S. succeeds in becoming a clean energy powerhouse. "For a while now, China has been leading in clean energy investment globally," said Xizhou Zhou, an expert in climate and sustainability at S&P Global, a global research firm. "They will probably see this legislation as a competitive move." Deborah Seligsohn, an expert on China's politics and energy at Villanova University and a former U.S. diplomat in Beijing, said the result could be lower prices globally. "To the extent the U.S. starts really investing in things that compete with key Chinese businesses  in solar, wind, electric vehicles, batteries  I think you're going to see Chinese businesses interested in ramping up their competitiveness in these industries, by making better products and bringing prices down," she said. That could have a ripple effect around the world. Vibhuti Garg, an energy economist focused on India, said U.S. investment in clean energy research could pay dividends in poorer nations that don't have the same resources to develop new technologies. "The U.S. can share the technology know-how with other countries, especially the Global South," she said. Aditya Ramji, from the Institute of Transportation Studies at University of California, Davis, said that cooperation  along with financial help  will be critical. "At some point there will have to be discussions on how they can provide intellectual property access or lower costs to countries like India and others to leverage electric vehicle technology," he said. Climate activists said the U.S. legislation is just one step on a larger path towards climate action. More progress is needed to put the world on track to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), a target that some scientists believe is slipping out of reach. "We need to fight for political commitments in other countries," said climate activist Luisa Neubauer, a leading figure in the Fridays for Future activist movement. "That's the only way we will manage to turn this from a year of fossil fuel backlash to a year of climate justice," she said. \</doc>

<Text> Prof. Osinbajo stated this in his remarks delivered at the global virtual launch of Nigeria's Energy Transition Plan, a roadmap to tackle the dual crises of energy poverty and climate change. Speaking on the need to have a peculiar transition plan, the Vice President said "for Africa, the problem of energy poverty is as important as our climate ambitions. Energy use is crucial for almost every conceivable aspect of development. Wealth, health, nutrition, water, infrastructure, education, and life expectancy are significantly related to the consumption of energy per capita." The VP highlighted the significant scale of resources required to attain both development and climate ambitions. Nigeria would need to spend $410 billion above business-as-usual spending to deliver our Transition Plan by 2060, which translates to about $10 billion per year. "The average $3billion per year investments in renewable energy recorded for the whole of Africa between 2000 and 2020 will certainly not suffice," he added. Additionally, the Vice President noted that "we have an inter-ministerial Energy Transition Implementation Working Group, which I chair. We are currently engaging with partners to secure an initial $10 billion support package ahead of COP27 along the lines of the South African Just Energy Transition Partnership announced at COP26 in Glasgow." At the virtual event, Mr. Shubham Chaudhuri, Nigeria Country Director for World Bank said the bank plans "to commit over USD 1.5 billion towards the Energy Transition Plan on renewable energy, on power sector reforms, on clean cooking, and wherever opportunities arise." In a similar vein, Mr. Adam Cortese, CEO, Sun Africa stated that "the launch of Nigeria's Energy Transition Plan has further accelerated our efforts, proving Nigeria to be fertile grounds for investments in the sector. We are in the final stages of discussion with US EXIM Bank on a USD 1.5 billion financing package." Speaking on the effects of Climate Change in Africa, Prof Osinbajo explained that "climate change threatens crop productivity in regions that are already food insecure, and since agriculture provides the largest number of jobs, reduced crop productivity will worsen unemployment. "It is certainly time for decisive action, and we just cannot afford to delay. African nations are rising to the challenge. All African countries have signed the Paris Agreement and some countries, South Africa, Sudan, Angola, and Nigeria have also announced net-zero targets." Giving more details on energy poverty in Africa, the VP noted that "the current lack of power hurts livelihoods and destroys the dreams of hundreds of millions of young people. "And although Africa's current unmet energy needs are huge, future demand will be even greater due to expanding populations, urbanization, and movement into the middle class. "It is clear that the continent must address its energy constraints and would require external support and policy flexibility to deliver this. Unfortunately, in the wider responses to the climate crisis, we are not seeing careful consideration and acknowledgement of Africa's aspirations." Underscoring the importance of collaboration, the Vice President then noted that "we developed our Energy Transition Plan to engage with the rest of the world in a serious, thorough and data-backed manner. <P/></Text> \</doc>

Lack of climate finance is a major barrier preventing Nigeria and other developing countries form acting on climate change. In the previous article we outlined serval ways in which the Nigeria could leverage the Climate Change Act to unlock climate finances for the country covering appropriation, green bonds and greening national and sub-national borrowing plans. Today we conclude by looking at other key sources. Private Sources and Institutional Investors The domestic market for issuance of financial instruments is active and presents a ready platform for redirecting flows to climate related interventions. Our analysis suggests that since 2019, the issuance levels has increased from N12.8 trillion to 2021s N19.8 trillion. However, the component of green instruments is less than 0.4 percent and has been declining in the period. At about N16 trillion, the resources listed on the NGX is significantly more than the Federal Government's planned borrowings. This provides a compelling case for the need to engage the private sector actively in raising the levels. The Climate Change Council (CCC) clearly has a role to play in engaging private sector finance through advocacy with the money market operators, the regulators, pension fund operators as well as the stock exchanges. Here the two most promising avenues for mobilization and redirection of resources in the capital markets would be Corporate issuance and Pension Fund and Money Market Subscriptions to issuances. Pension fund presents as much N25.7 trillion that can be accessed. PFAs have continually increased their exposure to green instruments, from 0.25 percent in 2019 to 0.62 percent in 2022. The CCC could set a target to increase this to 1 percent of total assets. The CCA contains a provision that its Council may borrow money from financial organizations or other institutions for the purpose of executing its mandate under this Act. (Section 17 PART IV). Such borrowings could be through the issuance of climate instruments (green, sustainable, sukkuk, social or a hybrid). These could be absorbed by the resources available to the institutional investors mentioned above. Multilateral and bilateral sources, according, to the OECD, remain the biggest sources of climate finance. It would auger well for the CCC, to retain this as an essential option in not just mobilizing resources but catalyzing other sources of funding. Multilateral and bilateral sources are diverse and covers both adaptation and mitigation. Engaging with domestic public resources, domestic private resources (outlined in the sections above) will be a key part in demonstrating the level of seriousness and establishing the institutions that will help Nigeria to attract international finance. The NCCC can work closely with the Office tasked with the implementation of the ETP to set up a national just transition platform that can mobilize billions of foreign assistances to scale up climate action in Nigeria. Proactive/strategic action is key Evidence from the GCF shows that Nigeria has only been able to mobilize $118m from the green climate fund, compared to South Africa's $600m. South Africa recently set a record at COP26 when it announced that it had reached an agreement with a consortium of donor countries to receive $8.5 billion to support her energy transition and implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC). COP27 is now half way and nothing much has been heard in the form of a deal for Nigeria. Nigeria must not attend merely as spectators or to make commitments that it will struggle to fulfill. Investments in climate technologies can unlock new revenue for Africa - AVEVA With the devastating impact of climate change in Nigeria so evidently demonstrated by the unprecedent flooding events in the country, it is time to put in place a robust and long-term plan to enhance climate mobilization to underwrite green and climate resilient investment for Nigeria. \</doc>

If Africa is to meet its 2030 climate goals and implement the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDCs), climate finance on the continent must hit $277 billion, a new study on the Landscape of Climate Finance in Africa says. The study, commissioned by the Financial Sector Deepening Africa, the Children's Investment Fund Foundation, and UK Aid finds that total annual climate finance flows in Africa - both domestic and international was $30 billion, which is just 11percent of the needed $277 billion. The study, the first of its kind analysis to map climate finance flows in Africa by region, sector and source, identifies entry points, financing gaps and opportunities for new investments for investors and climate negotiators. Barbara Buchner, CPI's global managing director, said that 'Africa offers a wealth of climate-related investment opportunities. New value chains are taking root as the continent's industrial mix extends beyond extractives and other traditional sectors.' 'However, public and private actors must act with scale and speed to help bring Africa's climate goals to fruition. While the investment opportunities are substantial, the social, economic, and environmental benefits which could be realized are even greater.' The research identifies that private sector financing in Africa remains low at 14 percent of the total climate finance on the continent which is lower than other regions such as South Asia at 37 percent, East Asia and Pacific at 39 percent and Latin America and Caribbean at 49 percent. According to the study, the Southern African region bears the financing gap in absolute terms, mainly attributed to high climate finance needs of South Africa alone, estimated at $107 billion, combined with one of the lowest regional levels of climate investment. The study finds that Africa's climate finance is in 10 countries that account for more than 50percent of the total, including Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Kenya, Ethiopia and South Africa. It states that Africa strikes a better balance between adaptation and mitigation than other regions. 'Mitigation accounted for 49percent ($14.6 billion) of climate finance flows in Africa, followed by 39percent ($11.4 billion) towards adaptation, and 12 percent ($3.5 billion) to dual benefits,' says the study. 'This is a positive trend, given Africa's disproportionately high vulnerability to climate change. Yet funding for both adaptation and mitigation must still increase by at least six and 13 times, respectively.' Read also: Private sector should combat climate change - Stakeholders The research calls for the need to boost funding for agriculture, forestry and other land use as it records only 16 percent of the total climate finance for the period. 'Despite the sector's economic and social importance, and implications for food security, gender, biodiversity, and water security, it drew only 16 percent of the total climate finance in Africa.' Speaking on the study, Mark Napier, chief executive officer, FSD Africa, said climate finance would be critical for enabling Africa to adapt to the growing impact of climate change. 'Public and the much larger sums of private sources of financing remain critical components of climate finance for Africa. The research findings, represented in this new report, the Africa Landscape of Climate Finance, provide the first independent, comprehensive, and accurate analysis of the funding that is currently available to Africa,' Napier said. 'This data is crucial to set the context for negotiations at COP27 and our ability to measure global progress on climate finance.' \</doc>

A suite of digital agriculture solutions addresses capacity constraints and inefficiencies in the supply chain of African agribusinesses. The partnership makes digital tools and training resources more accessible to small-scale farmers and agriculture-linked small businesses. The United Nations identifies Zero Hunger as one of its Sustainable Development Goals. This goal seeks to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. In a session during Adaptation and Agriculture Day at COP27 in Egypt, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Microsoft through its Africa Transformation Office (ATO) showcased their partnership to support digital transformation in Africa's agriculture sector to support the achievement of this goal. The partnership is delivering digital agriculture products that support African agribusinesses to strengthen food security and develop greater resilience against climate change. Agriculture contributes about 25 percent of Africa's GDP and 70 percent of its employment. However, supply chains of many agribusinesses in Africa are fragmented and suffer from poor information flows. Additionally, many farmers rely on traditional agronomic practices and technologies that are under increasing pressure from climate-related shocks. Digital technology can improve the operation of key supply chains in the food system through greater agricultural efficiencies, improved business practices, traceability, food safety and, access to finance. Through the partnership, digital tools such as Microsoft's AgBot and Community Training applications are integrated with IFC's Agribusiness Leadership Program to provide better information, newer technologies, and management capacity training to agribusinesses, farmers and cooperatives. 'Digital technology can improve the operation of key supply chains in the food system by boosting production, improving business practices, promoting traceability and increasing access to finance. However, the use of digital tools in Africa's agriculture sector remains limited, often because of infrastructure, affordability, awareness, and regulatory issues,' said Henrik Elschner Pedersen, IFC's Director for Manufacturing, Agribusiness and Services in Africa. 'IFC and Microsoft are working together to change this so more agricultural players in Africa can leverage the power of the digital economy.' Current research estimates that smallholder farmers account for 80 percent of the farming community, with an estimated 33 million smallholder farmers, but they are often hard to reach, residing in remote areas, and lack access to skills, knowledge and agricultural support services. 'The changing climate presents new future opportunities for farmers in relation to emerging markets for carbon credits, Regenerative Agriculture, and the application of 'Nature-based Services'. However, these new opportunities need to be underpinned by robust management and reporting systems. These are precisely the systems that are supported by the new suite of digital tools,' says Kunle Awosika, Managing Director for Microsoft ATO. The package of digital tools provides users with the opportunity to upskill in areas such as more productive climate-smart farming practices and the application of 'farming as a business'. The digital tools delivered through the partnership are leveraging Microsoft's agritech chatbot known as the AgBot, which provides extension and advisory services to smallholder farmers using either feature phones or smartphones, via SMS, WhatsApp and Telegram. The AgBot provides a key platform that farmers can use to access information such as weather alerts, crop advisories, pest diagnosis, and market prices. Stakeholders in the agriculture ecosystem including governments, IFC, the development partners, and private companies can also access the platform to deliver information to users. To date, over 500,000 farmers are actively using the AgBot to access information and to improve productivity. Microsoft Community Training (MCT) is an Azure cloud powered platform that supports personalised and localised learning for a large-scale mobile-based community. The IFC Agribusiness Leadership Program content aimed at SMEs and farmer organizations has been made available on the MCT platform. 'By using digital channels, agronomic and business sensitive information is delivered directly to smallholder farmers to help improve productivity as well as mitigate the risks associated with climate change and unexpected weather events. Combined, the digital tools encourage improved farming practices, more sustainable and resilient farming practices and greater efficiencies in resource use,' says Awosika. \</doc>

Two months to the 27th global climate summit ( COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheik, Egypt, African and other global leaders have rallied in Rotterdam, to highlight the urgency of climate adaptation funding for the continent. The meetings co-convened by the President of the African Development Bank Group Dr Akinwumi Adesina, CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) Professor Patrick Verkooijen, and African Union Commission Chair Mousa Faki Mahamat was unanimous about the need for concrete action and finance. Former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and GCA Co-Chair said: "The world has a fever. It burns hotter and higher with every day that passes&hellip; Statistics tell us that Africa is where the fever is at its most intense and people at the most vulnerable." GCA Co-Chair and Honorary Chairman of Royal DSM Feike Sijbesma spoke about the importance of support from the global private sector. He said 80% of the funding for adaptation needs to come from the private sector in both the developed north and the developing south. GCA Chief Executive Officer Patrick Verkooijen emphasized the disastrous impacts of climate change hitting all parts of the world. He said it is in Africa, however, that climate shocks will hit the hardest. He said Africa was resolute about its economic advancement and would not stop. "Adaptation in Africa is like climbing a mountain. With all of you here today, we have the dream team that will climb the mountain together." Verkooijen added: "The next summit after today is Sharm El-Sheikh, the Africa COP. But success in Egypt will hinge on whether Africa's needs are met or not. Africa has the commitment and the plan. That plan is the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAA-P). It is Africa-developed and Africa-owned. It was launched by Africa's leaders, who are here today. It is the vehicle for delivering the Africa Adaptation Initiative." Established in 2020 by the GCA and the African Development Bank, the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program lies at the center of climate action on the African continent. Participants acknowledged Verkooijen's and Adesina's joint efforts as the driving forces behind the program. African Union Chairperson, President Macky Sall of Senegal, President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana, who is Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, and President Felix Tshisekedi of the Democratic of the Congo conveyed a unified message: the international community must deliver on its pledge to double adaptation finance and to scale adaptation action for Africa. President Sall expressed disappointment at the absence of industrialized country leaders at the summit. The African Union Chair said if African leaders could be in Rotterdam in person to discuss such a crucial issue as climate adaptation in Africa, the very least they expected was that their European counterparts whose countries are among the world's biggest polluters would also have been present at the summit. This sentiment was shared by Presidents Akufo-Addo and Tshisekedi, African Union Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat and UN Deputy Secretary General Amina Mohammed, among others. Mohammed said: "A bird only flies with two wings, and the representation at this table is lopsided." The UN deputy chief added that it was not Africa's fault that it is in its current position, given that it contributes very little to global carbon emissions. She pondered on what the situation would have been if the roles had been reversed. Mohammed said the COP26 Glasgow pact was at risk of failing if the developed world did not make good on its promises of delivering $100 billion a year for climate action in developing countries. In his intervention ( HYPERLINK http://bit.ly/3KRxQDi http://bit.ly/3KRxQDi The African Development Bank chief explained that in the face of the deluge, Africa does not have the resources to tackle climate change. He said the continent receives only 3% of global climate financing. He noted that if this trend continued, Africa's climate financing gap could reach between $100 billion to $127 billion per year through 2030. Adesina said: "The current climate financing architecture is not meeting the needs of Africa. New estimates by the African Economic Outlook of the African Development Bank show that Africa will need between 1.3 and 1.6 trillion dollars from 2020 to 2030, or $118 billion to $145 billion annually to implement its commitments to the Paris Agreement and its nationally determined contributions." The African Development Bank chief said the African Adaptation Acceleration Program's upstream facility at the GCA had already helped to generate $3 billion of mainstreamed climate adaptation investments by the African Development Bank, from agriculture to energy, transport, water, and sanitation. Adesina spoke of the African Development Bank's African Development Fund (ADF), its concessionary lending arm as one of the ways to address the climate financing gap. He said the 16th replenishment of the fund, currently underway, presented a unique opportunity for full financing of the $12.5 billion in financing for the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program. The African Development Bank chief explained that the African Development Fund had introduced a Climate Action Window that would hopefully mobilize $4 billion to $13 billion for climate adaptation for the Fund's member countries. "This will be used to support 20 million farmers with access to climate resilient agricultural technologies, access of 20 million farmers and pastoralists to weather-indexed crop insurance, reviving 1 million hectares of degraded land, and provision of renewable energy for about 9.5 million people. Adesina said commitments by developed countries to provide $100 billion annually in climate finance for developing countries was long overdue. "Africa cannot wait," he emphasized. "This is the time to support the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program. This is the time to support the ADF 16th replenishment. This is the time to support the Climate Action Window of ADF-16." World Trade Organization Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala also lent her voice to the clarion call for additional resources for Africa adaptation funding. Speaking about the role of trade in climate adaptation, she said trade policies should be integrated into global climate action as an amplifying force for financing and other climate-related support provided to vulnerable economies. The summit's five-point Communique ( HYPERLINK http://bit.ly/3AYZbyO http://bit.ly/3AYZbyO COP27 will depend on whether the needs of Africa, the world's most climate-vulnerable continent, are met with finance flowing into such key country-led adaptation programs as the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program.

To hasten the maritime sector's transition to net zero, the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) has proposed financial rewards to ships and energy producers that invest in low-emission fuels. In a paper to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), ICS proposes a 'fund and reward' system to catalyse the adoption of alternative fuels, which currently cost at least two or three times more than conventional marine fuel. The proposal combines various recent GHG reduction proposals from a number of governments, plus a flat rate contribution system previously proposed by ICS and INTERCARGO, and ideas recently put forward for a global IMO measure by the EU 27. Emanuele Grimaldi, chairman of ICS, said the fund will enable IMO member states to have a new opportunity to put in place a global economic measure that can kick-start the development and production of alternative fuels for shipping. 'These new fuels must start to become available in significant quantities on a commercial basis no later than 2030. Compromise is always difficult but, a proposal like this can enable everyone to come together. I hope this proposal will act as a bridge between the climates ambitions of both developed and developing countries so that no part of the global shipping industry will be left behind,' Grimaldi said. ICS said the 'fund and reward' system could be established by 2024 if governments can agree on the regulatory framework at the IMO. Read also: China has built 100 seaports in Africa - ambassador It said the reward rate would be calculated based on CO2 emissions prevented and funded via a mandatory flat rate contribution from ships per ton of CO2 emitted. ICS proposes that contributions from the global fleet be gathered in an 'International Maritime Sustainability Fund'. Such a fund, the body said, could raise billions of dollars annually, which would then be committed both to narrowing the price gap, globally, between existing high-carbon marine fuels and alternative fuels, as well as supporting much-needed investment in developing nations for the production of new marine fuels and bunkering infrastructure. The fund would reward ships according to annual reporting of the CO2 emissions prevented by the use of 'eligible alternative fuels'. For example, a ship powered by ammonia could receive a cost saving of more than $1.5 million annually. Coming ahead of COP 27 , the proposal is relevant as the total CO2 emissions from international shipping account for between 2 and 3 percent of the world economy's total greenhouse gas emissions. Guy Platten, secretary general of ICS said: 'We must narrow the significant price gap of new, costly, alternative fuels to accelerate their production and take-up, so we can reach a take-off point by 2030 on our pathway to net zero by 2050. But it is crucial that our industry also supports maritime greenhouse gas reduction efforts in developing countries.' \</doc>

Download logo The President of the Republic, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, has assured the global community of Ghana's full commitment to increasing the country share of renewable energy in the energy mix. Speaking at a High-Level Event on Sustainable Energy for All, organised by Bloomberg Philanthropies, on the sidelines of COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, President Akufo-Addo stated that "we will continue to increase the share of renewable energy in our electricity generation mix, as well as explore the options of hydrogen gas and other clean energy sources to meet our energy needs" According to President Akufo-Addo, "Energy transition has become a global responsibility for us all, especially in view of the impact of climate change, and the global energy crisis brought forth by the Russian invasion of Ukraine." With Ghana being a signatory to the Paris Agreement and other international conventions, which require the country to reduce her carbon dioxide emission levels, he indicated that it has become imperative for Ghana to develop plans and strategies toward the creation of a net-zero energy sector, whilst aggressively pursuing the nation's economic development. "Our updated Nationally Determined Contributions, under the Paris Agreement, affirm the country's resolve to address the impacts of climate change and build a resilient economy for our people", he stressed. President Akufo-Addo continued, "Ghana's position on energy transition is to continue the responsible exploitation of our natural resources for our development and transition at our own pace. The Government of Ghana is mindful of the actions of the developed countries in relation to energy transition, and their effect on us." To this end, he told the gathering that it has thus, become necessary for the Government of Ghana to develop an Energy Transition Framework that will guide the country, as the entire world moves towards realizing net zero The President also said that the Government of Ghana, being mindful of the implications of such a framework and its implementation on the entire economy, directed the Committee to undertake extensive stakeholder consultations, in addition to expert input, to produce the National Energy Transition Framework to guide its transition to a net-zero economy by 2070 in a just and equitable manner, as well as minimise possible stranded assets and job losses in the oil and gas sector. The total cost of the transition is estimated at five hundred and sixty-one billion dollars (US$561.8 billion), the President added. Energy Transition President Akufo-Addo also addressed the High-Level Meeting on "Just Energy Transition", where he indicated that Ghana has developed a National Energy Transition Framework to provide the vision and guidance for Ghana's energy transition. In preparing this framework, the President stated that all existing policies were considered and the programmes that are being implemented towards achieving Ghana's Nationally Determined Contributions. "Wide stakeholder consultations were held to ensure that the energy transition issues in various parts of the country were captured and addressed in the framework. These included organized and non-organized labour, market women, academia, Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAS), Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs), Development Partners (DPs) and the international community," he said. He explained that the Framework provides the optimal and sustainable pathway for fuel supply security, diversified energy mix and cost-efficient electricity generation, with an estimated generation tariff of less than US$4.5cents per kilowatt hour to accelerate the socio-economic development of Ghana. "Ghana aims to achieve universal access by 2024. The Energy Transition Framework will meet future electricity demand of 380 Terawatt-hours, with a corresponding installed capacity of 83 Giga-Watts. Ghana's diversified energy mix will include 21 Gigawatts of renewable energy installed capacity, which will provide the opportunity to enjoy a greater share in the renewable energy carbon credit market," he added. President continued, "the transition will mitigate 200 million tons of carbon dioxide of Green House Gas emissions, minimising energy-related indoor air pollution and associated diseases. It is estimated that forty-eight thousand, two hundred and eighteen (48,218) premature deaths will be avoided annually due to the improvement in air quality, resulting from the impact of the transition."

The Global System for Mobile Telecommunications Association, a telecoms organization, estimates that two billion mobile phones are sold worldwide each year (GSMA). In addition, according to the GSMA, which represents the interests of mobile operators around the world by connecting over 750 operators with close to 400 companies in the broader mobile ecosystem, including Nigeria, 85% of mobile phones are not formally recycled, which reduces opportunities to improve digital inclusion by extending access to reasonably priced used devices. The "GSMA's Strategy Paper for Circular Economy: Mobile Devices," which was released in advance of the COP27 climate summit in Egypt, featured this information. The GSMA outlined the following aim for the industry in its new strategy: devices with the longest possible lives, built entirely of recyclable and recycled materials, 100% renewable energy, where no equipment becomes waste. This goal is supported by a recently created "circularity model" for the mobile industry, which outlines the guidelines that operators should take into account as they work to create a circular supply and manufacturing chain by the year 2050. This circular supply and manufacturing chain will be based on the two overarching concepts of "maximized longevity" and "zero waste." Steven Moore, the GSMA's head of climate action and the UN Climate Champions' mobile sector lead, said: "The mobile industry is making real progress on circularity, but there's a lot more to do to reduce the environmental impact of devices we rely on every day to stay connected. By setting out a new vision of systemic change for the sector, we're laying the groundwork for the mobile industry to reduce material waste and increase the longevity of devices." "An increased circularity for devices has a huge potential to reduce negative environmental impact, and at the same time to enable new business models that can generate new business opportunities," said Erik Wottrich, head of sustainability at Tele2 and the person who oversaw the development of the strategy paper. Although this is a significant development for our sector, much work remains. Since we are dedicated to advancing the circular economy by creating new customer offerings based on a circular business model, Tele2 is proud to have been the driving force behind the development of the strategy paper. This commitment will be crucial for us to reduce our adverse effects on the environment and meet our scope 3/value-chain science-based target. Regarding the environmental implications, the report said that mobile phones play a crucial and beneficial role in people's lives all over the world by enabling digital inclusion, fostering interpersonal connections, and fostering economic advancement. It said that throughout the course of their lifetime, they also have environmental effects - both good and bad - and that mobile phones can cut down on carbon emissions by reducing the need for travel, but they also have their own effects on the environment. According to GSMA, over 50 distinct materials, including polymers, ceramics, rare metals, copper, and silicon, may currently be found in an ordinary smartphone. Of the life cycle of a mobile phone, roughly 80% of the environmental impact lies in its manufacture. According to the agency, mining for these elements may have detrimental effects on the environment and society. The usage of fossil fuels results in greenhouse gas emissions that also come from manufacturing and assembly. According to the GSMA, by 2030, extending the lifespan of every smartphone by one year may prevent up to 21.4 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually, which is the equivalent of removing more than 4.7 million cars from the road. In order to create a step-change in the circularity of the mobile device industry, the GSMA's study emphasizes the significance of including all supply chain participants. This includes operators, suppliers, manufacturers, and users, as well as repairers and recyclers. The replacement cycle for mobile phones has grown by 10 months in the last seven years, from 24 months in 2014 to 34 months in 2021, according to the telecoms authority. The market for reconditioned mobile devices was expected to increase in value from $49.9 billion in 2020 to over $140 billion by 2030, indicating that this trend would continue. \</doc>

A new report from London-based financial think-tank Carbon Tracker has urged Nigeria and other African petrostates to pay attention to solar investments that can bumper profits for petrol-dependent states as Europe's energy transitions gain momentum. According to the report, African petrostates betting on fossil fuel exports for wealth creation and energy security are making an imprudent choice, as the 'inevitable and irreversible' energy transition will slash demand, lower oil prices, and freeze investments from international oil companies. But new investments in solar development for Africa can now earn double-digit returns, says the report from London-based financial think-tank Carbon Tracker, 'making it one of the most profitable and least risky energy technologies on the planet.' The report, released during the COP 27 climate summit in Egypt, advises that with the continent receiving 50 percent more sunlight than the Global North, solar-not oil and gas-must be the 'backbone to Africa's new energy system.' The European Union has doubled its 2030 renewable target from 22 to 45 percent of capacity. So demand for gas will fall in the medium term-by more than 50 percent by 2040-with prices dropping in tandem and investment from global oil companies likely to decline. Initiative to unlock clean cooking access to 300m Africans by 2027 launched If African petrostates build costly new infrastructure, the Carbon Tracker report says they risk being stuck with stranded assets, poor returns, and reduced licencing and tax revenues, leading to major impacts on GDP and financial stability. 'The energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables is inevitable and irreversible,' said senior cleantech analyst and report author Kofi Mbuk. 'Across emerging economies, solar and wind offer the best route for economic development.' Findings showed Africa has an abundance of sunlight, with an irradiance (measure of the sun's intensity on land) 60 percent higher than the global average. Solar infrastructure spanning a mere 0.3percent of the Sahara Desert's area would be enough to meet the entire continent's electricity needs, the report says. 'Carbon Tracker expects that solar will outcompete operational coal and natural gas plants for electricity generation by 2030 across the entire continent,' says the report summary, and it is already cheaper to build new solar in South Africa than to run existing coal plants. Africa's deployment of solar infrastructure has been held back by lack of finance, poor electricity infrastructure, and political and social instability, the report says. It calls on African leaders 'to incentivize private investment by creating a stable regulatory environment with supportive revenue models for solar.' The report advised countries to adopt policies to build robust, efficient grid infrastructure and address instability challenges. And time is of the essence: 'If no immediate actions are taken by African governments within the [next] five years to introduce policies to aid a just transition with solar at the helm, we can rule out Africa's role, as the continent will not be able to meet any of the International Energy Agency's climate scenarios,' Carbon Tracker warns. \</doc>

The African Development Bank (AfDB) and the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) have featured two innovative mechanisms for scaling up adaptation action and finance. This is contained in a statement posted on AfDB's website, a copy of which was obtained by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). The bank said that the adaptation was reached during a joint event held on Sept. 1, on the sidelines of the Africa Climate Week in Libreville, Gabon. It said Ludovica Amatucci, a programme analyst at UNCDF, made a presentation on the Local Climate Adaptive Living Facility (LoCAL mechanism). According to Amatucci, the tool helps local governments and communities to tap into climate finance for locally-led adaptation, contributing to the implementation of the Nationally Defined Contributions under the Paris Agreement. 'Also, the tool helps local governments and communities on National Adaptation Plans and Sustainable Development Goal 13, which states to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.' Amatucci said that 'the LoCAL mechanism supports inter-governmental fiscal transfer systems target adaptation actions at the local level, while reinforcing transparency and reporting through those systems.' AfDB's Senior Climate Finance Officer, Kidanua Gizaw, said that the bank was piloting an Adaptation Benefits Mechanism (ABM) as a non-market, results-based finance tool to boost investments that enhanced the resilience of vulnerable communities and ecosystems. While lnes Josten, Project Manager of the Green Cooling Initiative at the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), explained that higher temperatures arising from climate change meant that traditional potato storage techniques in Kenya were no longer adequate. It also meant potato crops could be preserved as long as before. The statement said the first approved ABM methodology 'Potato storage using green cooling technology', presents a means to measure and quantify the benefits of modern, clean energy-based storage solutions in terms of saved wealth. It said the methodology was developed by Perspectives Climate Group and funded by GIZ. Accordingto the statement, adaptationof the methodology has become imperative as it reduces risk of rotting of potatoes. 'Applying this methodology to an ABM project would demonstrate better its added value and help to mobilise finance for clean technology to secure the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in Kenya and the region.' 'Flood damage reduction using a mobile flood barrier,' based on an ABM demonstration project in Lagos, Nigeria,' Saleh said. According to the statement, the ABM methodology enables mobilisation of funds by linking adaptation benefits to investments in the mobile flood barrier. Mr Kouassi Amani, a Project Lead of the 'Cocoa Climate Resilience' made an ABM demonstration project implemented by the International Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) in Cote d'Ivoire. He illustrated how the project could use the ABM to incentivise private sector investment in cocoa agroforestry for climate change adaptation in West Africa. The moderator, Gareth Phillips, AfDB Manager for Climate and Environment Finance, noted that the current adaptation finance levels were insufficient to meet the needs of developing countries. Philllips, however, said the private sector and local governments could play a crucial role in filling the gap. He said the AfDB and the UNCDF could also help to address the lack of credible adaptation metrics and indicators. He said this could be done by developing and using methodological tools, create incentives to attract a broad range of actors to engage in adaptation, and unlocking new financial streams. Africa Climate Week, forms part of a series of regional climate weeks being held globally. Participants came together to outline Africa's objectives for the upcoming COP27 in Egypt and unify and amplify the African voice to ensure action. \</doc>

The President made the call while speaking at a bilateral meeting with the President of Palestine, Mahmoud Abbas, in New York. President Buhari, in a statement issued by his spokesman, Femi Adesina, said the actualisation of the UN resolution which proposed a two-state solution to the crisis between Israel and Palestine required a platform to think creatively on how to engage the rest of the world on the matter. 'The rest of the world need to be apprised on current state of things between Palestine and Israel in order to commit to the way forward. There should be a better collaboration between African countries on one side and our Arab brothers to get to the end of this matter,' the President said. The Palestinian President had visited his Nigerian counterpart to thank him for being a consistent supporter of the Palestinian cause and to solicit his support by rallying other African countries. He regretted that the Palestinian issue had dragged for a long time without commensurate progress, adding that there is a daily loss of lives on the Palestinian side. Abbas added that Palestinians had decided to pursue a peaceful path towards resolving the matter by relying on nations like Nigeria to help in a peaceful resolution of the two-state solution as recommended by the United Nations Resolution. President Buhari had another meeting with Mr Mahamadou Issoufou, former President of Niger Republic and Special envoy of the UN and African Union on Joint Strategic Assessment and Governance Situation in the Sahel. President Buhari stressed the essence of a collaboration between the Lake Chad Basin Commission and the Green Great Wall in order to combat the desertification spreading across some African states as well as finding practical solutions to the displacement of over 30 million persons whose means of livelihood depended on the shrunken Lake Chad. The former Nigerien leader had informed President Buhari that they required Nigerian support to raise funds for their activities especially as desertification is spreading across a number of African countries and most of the countries are severely challenged. He added that the committee needed to visit the countries involved to know their specific needs and would, at this instance, be in Nigeria in October this year.

As talks advance at the 56th session of the subsidiary bodies meeting of the UN Climate Change Conference, held from June 6 to 16, 2022, in Bonn, Germany, climate justice civil society groups in Africa have joined their counterparts across the globe to call on African governments to demand loss and damage finance, adopt effective and workable non-market mechanisms needed to attain real zero and not net-zero. According to a statement by the groups, Africa's contribution is insignificant to the current climate crisis, yet the continent is the most adversely affected by its consequences. The groups held that Global North countries have failed to deliver their climate finance obligations and do their fair share of climate action. This has forced African governments to tap into their meagre consolidated funds to mitigate the climate crisis within their countries, a situation that has further increased the region's debt profile. The groups, therefore, called upon African governments attending this SB56 to set a stable foundation for an efficient Loss and Damage (LandD) finance facility to be established at COP27 and advance strong arguments to commit industrialized and wealthy countries to provide adequate LandD finance. African governments must also be at the forefront of developing a way forward for formalizing collaboration on non-market approaches to meet Paris commitments as part of Article 6.8. This plan should include technology transfer, finance, and other methods of collaboration to scale-up renewables, agroecology, keeping fossil fuels in the ground, and other proven means of preventing and reducing emissions. The groups stated that: 'We're expecting the highest-polluting countries and corporations alike to continue rolling out the greenwashing carpet while they parade a variety of meaningless (and sometimes outright dangerous) 'net zero' plans and pathways, that require little to no action and do not reduce emissions at the source. 'Africa must challenge and reject pledges made by polluting corporations and governments to achieve 'Net Zero' emissions, which are being used to shift additional burdens onto the African region and avoid responsibility for their role in the global share of emissions to date. 'Instead, our governments must commit to achieving Real Zero emissions reductions, embracing the concept of equity (each country does its fair share).' Akinbode Oluwafemi, Executive Director of Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa, said: 'The latest IPCC report is a strong indictment of the global north and a caution against ineptitude from governments of the Global South. As the world gathers in Bonn to review climate change commitments, it is only fair to accommodate the concerns of frontline communities and close corporate influence in our climate discourse. Hellen Neima, Regional Director, Corporate Accountability Climate Campaign, said: 'Africa, being the host of the upcoming 27th Conference of the Parties, must take this opportunity to shape what remains of the climate talk by unanimously demanding what is owed to her- Loss and Damage finance, a global goal on adaptation, and a workable non-market mechanism for real solutions. The groundwork for these must be laid now in on the ongoing 56th UNFCCC inter-sessional.' \</doc>

Nigeria, June 18 -- The UN high level champion for COP26,Nigel Topping, during his visit to Nigeria, said implementation is key if Nigeria is to achieve her net-zero goal by 2060. During his visit from June 14 to 16, Mr Topping congratulated Nigeria on its revised Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) which he described as ambitious, as well as the Energy Transition Plan presented at COP26 last November and the subsequent passing of the Climate Change Act. "Implementation of these policies are now key," he said. He added that mobilising both State and non-State actors - including businesses, academia and civil society - is essential to improve the investment climate of Nigeria so that the country can in turn attract the right investments that will accelerate the transition into a low-carbon and resilient economy. Nigeria, in July 2021, submitted its final updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) document to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a component of the Paris Agreement endorsed during the 21st UN Climate Change Conference also known as Conference of the Parties-21 (COP21) . In the updated NDC, Nigeria proposed to mitigate four greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), as against the three GHG (CO2, CH4 and N2O) proposed in the previous NDC submitted. The West African country recommits to its unconditional contribution of reducing carbon emissions by 20 per cent below business-as-usual by 2030, while it increases its conditional target to 47 per cent as against the 45 per cent captured in the 2015 NDC. However, President Muhammadu Buhari in Glasgow, November 2021, during the COP26, made a commitment that Nigeria will cut its carbon emission to net-zero by 2060. Mr Topping's visit to Nigeria is to engage with the government on the implementation of national climate change plans and ramp up ambition towards meeting these targets. The British Deputy High Commissioner in Lagos, Ben Llewellyn-Jones, said, "With the UK as the current Presidency of COP and following the historic COP26 event held in Glasgow last November, and ahead of COP27 in Egypt later this year, it was important for us to have Nigel Topping here in Nigeria." "His visit is a timely reminder for all of us about how hard the UK is continuing to work around the world with our partners, like Nigeria, to ensure that every effort is made to deliver on and bring in to effect the commitments made by us, by Nigeria and buy the rest of the world to tackle Climate Change," Mr Llewellyn-Jones said. Mr Topping also met with private and financial sector leaders, civil society organisations and climate change activists across Abuja and Lagos, where he discussed the opportunities of a green transition. He was appointed the UK Government High Level Climate Champion for COP 26 in January 2020, to help drive action from businesses, investors, organisations, cities, and regions on climate change and coordinate this work with governments and parties to the UNFCCC.

From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja The Federal Government, yesterday, launched Nigeria's Energy Transition Plan to tackle the chalenges of energy poverty, climate change and employment. Speaking at a virtual global meeting, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, said\~ among other things, the Plan would lift 100 million people out of poverty, reduce Nigeria's carbon footprint, drive economic growth and create jobs. He said it was time Nigeria and the African continent took ownership of transition pathways and design climate-sensitive strategies that address peculiar growth objectives. A statement by Laolu Akande quoted the VP as saying:\~ "Nigeria would need to spend $410 billion above business-as-usual spending to deliver our Transition Plan by 2060, which translates to about $10 billion per year. The average $3 billion per year investments in renewable energy recorded for the whole of Africa between 2000 and 2020 will certainly not suffice." He highlighted the significant scale of resources required to attain both development and climate ambitions saying Africa's increasing energy gaps required collaboration to take ownership of the continent's transition pathways and the action should be decisive and urgent. "For Africa, the problem of energy poverty is as important as our climate ambitions. Energy use is crucial for almost every conceivable aspect of development; wealth, health, nutrition, water, infrastructure, education, and life expectancy are significantly related to the consumption of energy per capita. Nigeria would need to spend $410 billion above business-as-usual spending to deliver our transition plan by 2060, which translates to about 10 billion dollars per year. The average $3 billion per year investments in renewable energy recorded for the whole of Africa between 2000 and 2020 will certainly not suffice." The vice president chaired the inter-ministerial Energy Transition Implementation Working Group. According to him, the group is currently engaging with partners to secure an initial $10 billion support package ahead of COP27 along the lines of the South African Just Energy Transition Partnership announced at COP26 in Glasgow. On the effects of Climate Change in Africa, he explained that climate change threatened crop productivity in regions that were already food insecure, and since agriculture provides the largest number of jobs, reduced crop productivity will worsen unemployment. "It is certainly time for decisive action, and we just cannot afford to delay. African nations are rising to the challenge. All African countries have signed the Paris Agreement and some countries, South Africa, Sudan, Angola, and Nigeria have also announced net-zero targets. "The current lack of power hurts livelihoods and destroys the dreams of hundreds of millions of young people. And although Africa's current unmet energy needs are huge, future demand will be even greater due to expanding populations, urbanization, and movement into the middle class. "It is clear that the continent must address its energy constraints and would require external support and policy flexibility to deliver this. "Unfortunately, in the wider responses to the climate crisis, we are not seeing careful consideration and acknowledgement of Africa's aspirations." On other aspirations of the roadmap, Osinbajo said explained that the Plan had the potential to create about 340,000 jobs by 2030, and 840,000 by 2060. He said it also presented a unique opportunity to deliver a true low-carbon and rapid development model in Africa's largest economy. The launch also featured remarks from government officials, including, ministers of environment, Mr. Mohammed Abdullahi; power, Abubakar Aliyu; power (state) Goddy Jedy Agba; works and housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola; finance, budget and national planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed;\~ group managing director of Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mr Mele Kyari;\~ managing director, Rural Electrification Agency, Ahmad Salihijo, deputy secretary-general, United Nations, Amina Mohammed, minister of petroleum and energies from Senegal, Dr. Aissatou Sophie Gladima and minister of electricity and renewable energy from Egypt, Prof. Dr. Mohamed Shaker El-Markabi. \</doc>

The United Nations is being urged to make a bold pledge and set a target of zero for\\xa0new\\xa0plastic pollution by 2040 in its upcoming\\xa0Global Treaty\\xa0to End Plastic Pollution. Plastic production and subsequent pollution are key drivers of climate change, the focus of discussion at COP27 in Egypt this week. In an article published today in the Nature Reviews Earth and Environment,\\xa0Professor Steve Fletcher, Director of the\\xa0Global Plastics Policy Centre\\xa0at the University of Portsmouth, sets out his reasoning for the ambitious target. The team from the University have advised the United Nations Environment Programme, G20, and World Bank on plastic policy, including the possible structure and content of the global agreement to tackle plastic pollution. Professor Steve Fletcher says "The treaty's target must be ambitious and meaningful, we are calling for the UN to aim for a minimum goal of 0%\\xa0new\\xa0plastic pollution by 2040.\\xa0 To achieve this, policymakers, businesses, researchers and wider society must go beyond the existing best available technology and practice and be radical in their thinking to develop a coordinated global strategy to tackle plastic pollution." The aim of the global treaty is to end plastic pollution, but there is no set target yet - this is something that is still to be discussed during the on-going negotiations.\\xa0 Professor Fletcher says: "the Global Plastic Treaty needs a target that is clearly defined.\\xa0 At present, there is ambiguity about what 'ending plastic pollution' actually means.\\xa0 For the treaty to work it's vital for there to be a single target and an agreed strategy." The paper explains that as well as a tightly defined target there needs to be aligned metrics to measure progress and that international policies should be delivered by harmonised action at a national level.\\xa0 Together, it is believed, these three components should lead to a systemic shift that is needed to end plastic pollution. There are nearly 200 nations committed to the development of the Treaty. With each country working with different financial, social and political priorities and obstacles, the University of Portsmouth team believe governments will have to stay focused in their quest to end plastic pollution. The authors of the article say it is critical that the target is clear, measurable, and has a timeframe that is relevant.\\xa0 They also feel it is not realistic to expect countries to clear up all existing plastic pollution. Instead they recommend efforts should be focused on stopping\\xa0new\\xa0plastic pollution entering the environment. Professor Fletcher and the team at the Global Plastics Police Centre say current national plastics policies only address a fraction of plastic pollution. They believe ambition is limited and policies often only extend the time before plastic becomes pollution, rather than tackling the root cause of the problem. They are calling for a globally coordinated approach that regulates the entire length of the international plastics value chains and confronts the environmental, economic and social impacts of misaligned plastic policies. Lead author, Antaya March, from the Global Plastics Policy Centre, University of Portsmouth, explains the challenges to be overcome: "Plastic is extremely useful, but mismanagement has led to a global pollution crisis that is exacerbating climate change. A complete transformation to a circular plastics economy is needed to radically reduce or eliminate plastic pollution while supporting necessary use." The research associate believes local issues are often the result of international problems. Ms March says: "Plastic value chains typically pass through multiple jurisdictions with different laws, rules and norms. At best, country-specific policies, such as bans on specific plastic products, do not have the reach to meaningfully affect global drivers of plastic pollution. At worst, they create international legal and policy inconsistencies that push plastic waste to places with the least capacity to deal with it safely. It is estimated that current commitments to tackle plastic pollution will only decrease plastic entering the environment by approximately 7% by 2040 compared to business as usual.\\xa0 This is why we need an ambitious target that all nations can work towards." Professor Fletcher says: "It is a huge achievement that the development of a global legally binding treaty by the UN to end plastic pollution is underway. But to be effective, the global treaty requires new levels of transparency, disclosure and cooperation to support evidence-based policymaking that avoids the fragmented and reactionary policies of the past. A system change needs to arise that fundamentally alters the way we behave and interact with plastic" \</doc>

Recent moves by President Buhari to implement Climate Change Act 2021, Nigeria's framework law to deliver green growth for sustainable economic development, are rubbing against bureaucratic infighting over the form and composition of the implementing mechanism the National Climate Change Council (NCCC) and its secretariat. The NCCC is chaired by the President with broad participation from government and civil society and is supported by a Secretariat headed by a Director General who is recommended by NCCC and appointed by the President. Because the NCCC is chaired by the President and Vice President and located within the presidency, it signals to the world that Nigeria is taking a whole-of-Government approach to low carbon development and is not merely delegating the issue to a line ministry. Recent pronouncements by the Minister of Environment, Mohammed Abdullahi, questioned both the 'humongous bureaucracy' CCA created and the composition of the NCCC. Such doubts as COP 27 approaches, may be misinterpreted as sending mixed signals to development partners interested in supporting Nigeria's energy transition. Recently, the Minister vented his frustration at the unwieldy 'humongous bureaucracy' of 'state and zonal directors' in the NCCC's secretariat. He went further adding that 'membership of the council also inadvertently takes out commissioners of the environment as members of the Climate Change Council. The secretariat has no directorates to support functions of the director-general, no transitional provisions in relation to functions of the department of climate change and the Climate Change Council.' The minister then announced that he had set up a technical review committee within the Ministry of Environment to initiate Â£mendments of the Act'. An internal ministry of environment technical review committee to amend the Act is the classic bureaucratic response to a bureaucratic problem. The Act's implementing structure appear designed to avoid capture by a single ministry and be nimble enough to respond to reform priorities across ministries departments and agencies and between the levels of government. While this may have drawbacks, the more pertinent question relating to structure and institutional transition is whether the NCCC and the secretariat can provide the framework for sustainable economic development achieved through low carbon means to occur across government and society. Here, the ministry of environment has specific inputs to make the climate diagnosis. The treatment plan or cure is actually provided by other stakeholders responsible for the policies, technologies and societal changes that make sustainable economic growth a reality. The treatment aspects of the CCA's objectives and NCCC's mandate involve inputs primarily from other agencies such as the petroleum, power, transport, water, works and housing sectors among others. The CCA and NCCC thus require a whole-of-government review, and not just a ministry of environment technical review. While, the Minister and the ministry are understandably territorial about the CCA and NCCC, the NCCC is unlike other councils or committees superintending particular sectors as with say communications with the Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC). The NCCC and its secretariat are crosscutting institutions that resemble the defunct Office of the Senior-Special-Assistant to the President on Millennium-Development-Goals (OSSAP-MDGs) and the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE). The BPE as secretariat to the National Council on Privatisation (NCP) closely resembles the NCCC and its secretariat. Both OSSAP-MDGs and BPE were created within the Presidency and operated on a whole-of-government premise rather than being hived-off from a parent-ministry - a kind of prodigal children as the Minister seems to think the NCCC and secretariat are. It is worth mentioning that the pioneering Director-Generals or leaders of both OSSAP-MDGs and BPE had successful non-civil service professional and managerial careers and brought that private sector drive, energy, can-do spirit and organisational discipline to the new institution. They also possessed the requisite stakeholder management skills to navigate social and political interests across all levels of government. This does raise questions, given the vast all-encompassing and existential challenge climate change poses, whether the Minister sees the proverbial forest from the ministerial tree. Seeing the forest from the ministerial tree generates the perspective needed to discern the internal inconsistencies in the Minister's position. As it is difficult to reconcile the minister's criticism of the CCA with his proud announcement, in the same breathe, 'that just last week, Mr. President appointed the pioneer director-general of the National Climate Change Council.' If the deficiencies in the Act can prompt the minister to review and recommend amendments, why then announce the appointment of a Director-General when the CCA expressly says that such an appointment can only be made after the NCCC recommends a Director-General to the President? Such an appointment and announcement fits squarely into the problems the CCA has that the technical review committee should have also reviewed. It is even more irregular when the appointment is announced by the minister or the ministry rather than the Presidency, which usually announces such appointments. It is unclear whether the appointment has been announced by the President or presidency at all. These irregularities and inconsistencies will not have gone unnoticed by the international community, private sector investors and interested parties to Nigeria's climate change objectives. In the end raising issues about the CCA while making unconfirmed pronouncements on staffing this close to the 27th Conference of Parties ( COP 27 ) in November in Egypt sends the signal that Nigeria is not ready politically, institutionally or policy-wise to receive the investment required to transition to a low carbon economy. This ultimately defeats the very objectives of the CCA. If Nigeria is to achieve the objectives in the CCA, the Minister and Ministry of Environment will need to play their indispensable part by not going it alone, but by being in lock step with the entire government and people of Nigeria. We all go farther on the road to net zero when we go together. Omikunle specialises in Energy Law and Climate Change and writes from Lagos. \</doc>

Download logo In the framework of the ongoing Twenty-Seventh Session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, the African Union Commission together with the Republic of Mozambique organised a high-level event on the Operationalization of the Africa Multi-Hazard Early Warning and Early Action System (AMHEWAS). The high-level event given the theme Catalysing Investments for the Operationalisation of AMHEWAS took place on 8th November was attended by African Heads of State and Government, ministers, heads of partner organizations, senior officials and other delegates. The event was hosted by H.E. Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, President of Republic of Mozambique and African Union Champion for Disaster Risk Management. President. Other dignitaries who attended the event included H.E. President of Botswana, H.E. President of Malawi, H.E. Vice President of Angola, and President of World Bank, President of IFRC, several African Ministers, among others. The objective of the high-level event aimed to achieve and promote the visibility of the Africa Multi-hazard and Early Warning and Action System, to share Africa's best practices with a wider global audience and generate feedback to improve the implementation of AMHEWAS and other resilience programmes; and Catalyse disaster risk finance and investment flows towards building multi-hazard early warning systems for a resilient Africa. The President of the Republic of Mozambique and African Union Champion for Disaster Risk Management (DRM), H.E President Filipe Jacinto Nyusi appealed to partners for increased funding for early warning and early action to support member states' efforts to reduce disaster losses and damages arising from climate and disaster risk that has continued to increase on the continent. The AU Champion for DRM emphasised that Africa's capacity to build resilience and invest in adaptation was being hampered by inadequate financial capacity, hence the need for support. In his opening remarks, H.E Moussa Fakli Mahamat, Chairperson of the African Union Commission said cognisance of the challenges of increased disaster impacts on the continent, the AU Commission has developed the Africa Multi-hazard Early Warning and Early Action System (AMHEWAS) Programme to contribute to reduced disaster losses and damage. The AMHEWAS programme is one of the many initiatives being implemented by the Commission to protect the people, development, assets and environment, he continued. The Chairperson highlighted other initiatives that the AU developed, including the recently developed African Union Climate Change and Resilient Development Strategy, the revised Integrated Africa Regional Strategy for Meteorology (Weather and Climate Service), and the Africa Programme of Action for the implementation of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030. Addressing the high-level event Prof. Petteri Taalas, the World Metrology Organization (WMO) Secretary General who also represented the UN Secretary General H.E. Antonio Guteres called on partners and governments to channel more resources towards Early Warning Systems to enhance early warning not just for disaster risk but also for marine and air transport. The World Bank President, David Malpass regretted the scale and magnitude of disasters that were affecting the continent and broad spectrum of society and announced that the Bank is committed to support Africa for climate risk financing. He pledged his organisation continued support to Africa on adaptation. On his part Francesco Rocca, the President of International Federation of the Red Crescent (IFRC) commended the African Union and its partners on the establishment the Africa Multi- Hazard Early Warning and Early Action System to save lives and property on the continent. He stressed the need to ensure that early warning messages were clear, concise and reach the last mile as well as lead to anticipatory action that saves lives. H.E Mami Mizutori, Special Representative of the UN Secretary General for Disaster Risk Reduction, and Head of United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) expressed her gratitude to H.E President Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, African Union Champion for Disaster Risk Management and President of the Republic of Mozambique for his continued leadership in ensuring that Africa has access to early warning systems and called on partners to support Africa to develop Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems to bridge the gap between early warning and early action as espoused by the Maputo Ministerial declaration on integrated early warning systems. The event as moderated by H.E. Amb. Josefa Sacko, Commissioner for Agriculture, Rural Development, Blue Economy and Sustainable Environment.

The 6th edition of the African Forum of Territorial Managers and Training Institutes targeting Territorial Communities (FAMI 6_2022) opened its work in the city of Agadir, on Monday, November 28 at the Training Center of the School of Medicine and Pharmacy of the Ibn Zohr University, and will continue until Saturday, December 03, 2022. The Forum is organized by the Pan-African Organization of United Cities and Local Governments of Africa (UCLG Africa), through its African Local Government Academy (ALGA), in partnership and with the support of the European Commission, the Directorate General of Local Authorities of the Ministry of the Interior of Morocco, the Souss-Massa Region, the Prefectural Council of Agadir Ida-Outanane, the Ibn Zohr University and the Training Center of the School of Medicine and Pharmacy of Agadir, the Provincial Council of Tiznit, the Provincial Council of Taroudant, the Municipal Council of Agadir, the National Agency for the Development of Oasis and Argan Zones (ANDZOA), the national associations of Local and Regional Governments of Morocco (ARM, AMPCPP, AMPCC), the ADEME energy management agency of France, the 4Cs-Morocco Center, the Office of the United Nations Project on Governance, Directorate of Public Institutions, and Digital Governance (DIPGD), and the Department of United Nations Economic and Social Affairs (UNPOG/DPIDG/UN DESA). The organizers of the Forum have chosen as the theme for this edition, which is being held one week after the closing of COP27 : "The challenge of training and building the capacities of Local Elected Officials and of Local Government Staff in Africa in terms of Climate Action". It is a week that promises to be fruitful on a scientific and academic level, through several segments: four Plenary Sessions on issues related to climate action, around fifteen Workshops and Master classes, as well as field visits to inquire about transformational projects and cultural heritage as a vector of peace and development. These are so many opportunities for discussion, sharing, peer learning, awareness, training, and capacity building. About 40 countries are represented at the Forum, including 33 African countries, with a strong presence of representatives of Governments, Local Governments, International Organizations, Territorial Managers, representatives of training institutions, as well as representatives from the private sector and civil society. The opening ceremony was moderated by Dr. Najat ZARROUK, Director of Development and of the African Local Government Academy (ALGA) of UCLG Africa, member of the Committee of Experts on Public Administration of the United Nations and President of the International Association of Schools and Institutes of Administration (IASIA), representing Mr. Jean Pierre ELONG MBASSI, Secretary General of UCLG Africa. This ceremony was marked: On the one hand, by the opening speech of the Forum on behalf of The Honorable Mrs. Fatimetou MINT ABDEL MALICK, President of UCLG Africa, President of the Permanent Gender Committee of UCLG, President of the Region of Nouakchott, Mauritania; her speech was read by The Honorable Mrs. Jeannette NYIRAMASENGESHO, President of the Rwandan Association of Local Authorities (RALGA) of Rwanda, President of the Ngororero District Council of the Western Province, President of the Association of Local Governments of East Africa. Mrs. Fatimetou MINT ABDEL MALICK declared: "Today, we have come here to amplify the role of African local governments as the most appropriate level of governance for the implementation of the Climate Agenda", and affirmed that "UCLG Africa remains committed and resolved to accompany and support its members and networks in the implementation of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), in access to climate finance and more particularly to the Green Climate Fund, as well as in the implementation of an awareness-raising, training and capacity-building and technical assistance program for their benefit, in order to enable them to develop climate plans and prepare applications that are eligible for funding by the Green Climate Fund. On the other hand, the opening speeches of the Partners of UCLG Africa, in particular that of the Honorable Mr. Karim ACHENGLI, President of the Council of the Souss-Massa Region, the Honorable Mr. Abdellah MESSAOUDI, President of the Prefectural Council of Agadir-Ida-Outanane, of the Honorable Mr. Abdelghani BOUAICHI, Vice-President of the Communal Council of Agadir, of the Honorable Mr. Lahcen AMROUCH, President of the Communal Council of Argana, Vice-President of the Provincial Council of Taroudant and Vice-Treasurer of the Moroccan Association of Presidents of Communal Councils (AMPCC), the Honorable Professor Abdelaziz BENDOU, President of Ibn Zohr University, as well as Mrs. Khadija SAMI , Regional Director of the Environment, representing the Ministry of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development. The various Partners were unanimous in thanking UCLG Africa for holding this 6th edition in the Souss-Massa Region around a theme that is of paramount importance because, in the words of the President of the Council of the Souss-Massa Region, Massa, this Region, aware of "the importance of the challenges of climate change and population growth, as well as of the strong pressure on natural resources, in particular water, got involved very early in the Climate Agenda." The President of the Prefectural Council of Agadir-Ida-Outanane affirmed the commitment of this Local Government, adding that its participation "is also part of the efforts of the Kingdom of Morocco under the wise leadership of His Majesty King Mohammed VI \- May God Assist him \- aimed at strengthening partnership and cooperation among the countries and peoples of African countries". For the Municipality of Agadir, "this meeting is an opportunity to reaffirm the commitment of the Municipality of Agadir in terms of environmental management in favor of the climate". As for the Representative of the AMPCC, he said he was "delighted with the fruitful cooperation with UCLG Africa", affirming that the future is promising for these two institutions to jointly carry out actions that produce added value for the Territorial Communities. The Representative of the AMPCC added: "To carry out territorial development actions as well as possible, we must have well-trained and initiated territorial managers, and I am convinced that during these days of training in this beautiful city of Morocco, you will improve your skills, because ALGA is known for its training courses which are very useful for territorial development operators". The President of Ibn Zohr University, who has made available to UCLG Africa and its Academy, the Training Center of the School of Medicine and Pharmacy with all its facilities, welcomed the delegations who made the trip to Agadir, before listing the important questions to be raised for "the good of African citizens": "How to produce without harming the environment? How to produce clean energy? In collaboration with local partners, there is innovation in agriculture, with young people carrying out important research work. \'bb The Representative of the Ministry of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development, who spoke last to leave the voice and priority to Local Authorities as privileged actors in Climate Action, expressed her sincere thanks to the organizers of the Forum for the choice of such a "strategic and priority" theme,", underlining that "Morocco has committed itself in a proactive manner and in perfect harmony with the international and regional effort in terms of climate action. Despite its very low contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, Morocco has already put itself on the path to decarbonization ". The opening ceremony of the FAMI_6 forum was crowned by a video message addressed to the participants by the Honorable the Director and Regional Representative of the African Office of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), Mr. Frank TURYATUNGA, who noted that " While Africa's ratification rate is impressive, up to 72% of NDCs lack an investment plan, which is essential for attracting the implementation capacity of local and international companies ". \- A Plenary Session dedicated to keynote speakers who recalled the main challenges of Climate Action and shared innovations in this area: The Honorable Mrs. Jeannette NYIRAMASENGESHO, President of RALGA who shared her country's experience and highlighted the role of Local and Subnational Governments in the fight against Climate Change; The Honorable Mr. Brahim HAFIDI, Director General of the National Agency for the Development of Oasis and Argan Zones (ANDZOA), Morocco; The Honorable Mr. Didier DOGLEY, former Minister of the Environment, Senior Expert in Sustainable Development and Climate Change, Seychelles; Professor Linda J.

Experts and environmentalists have recommended the need for people to shift from fossil fuel to clean (renewable) energy in order to tackle the menace of climate change rocking Nigeria and the rest of the world. Speaking on Wednesday, at a programme to mark World Emission Day, 2022, organised by the Dawn Project Initiative, in Lagos, the representative of the Bank of Industry&rsquo;s Renewable Energy Department, Mr. Idris Ibrahim, said the BoI would continue to encourage people to invest in an alternative source of energy through its funding. He said, "The BoI has weekly televised programmes on the Nigerian Television Authority and selected stations that air what the BoI is doing and how people can benefit from our services. "The bank holds a lot of engagement with stakeholders and customer forums, just to sensitise people to how they can be partakers of what the bank is offering. "Concerning renewable energy, the bank offers nine per cent on loans collected yearly, but a lot of people are not aware because they don&rsquo;t participate in these forums. We want to encourage as many people as possible not to be afraid and come take part so as to boost the industry and aid alternative sustainable energy sources.&rdquo; Combustion of fossil fuels such as petrol, kerosene, diesel, and coal has contributed to global warming, hence, the recommendations of experts that people should move to use clean energy such as solar, hydropower, wind, etc. Also, the Chairman, Lekki State Urban Forest and Animal Shelter Initiative, Desmond Majekodunmi, urged Nigerians to stop continuous pollution of the environment. He noted that the world had about 12 years left to save the planet from the effects of climate change before it became irreversible. Related News Environmentalist calls for end to pollution Africa and Climate Change: Conversation with US Senator John Kerry towards COP27 Energy crunch: China doubles down on coal spending He said, "More than ever before, it has become a necessity for us, especially as Nigerians, to begin to take our environment seriously and care for it. Globally, an estimated three to five million people die yearly as a result of waste and pollution deposited in the air and water around us. "Nigerians have a tendency to handle issues lightly, but this is not a joke. From the government to the grassroots, we cannot continue living like all is well, when the very environment we live in is degenerating before our very eyes. "We need to stop the pollution immediately. As humans, we have between eight and 12 years to effect the necessary change our environment needs before the damage becomes irreversible. Prevention, they say, is better than cure; we cannot continue destroying our home and be smiling.&rdquo; Majekodunmi, who is a founding partner of the Dawn Project Initiative, added that the irresponsibility in decision-making by the government had also contributed adversely to environmental damage in Nigeria. Adding that he was happy talking to a calibre of people who could effect positive change, the Senior Special Assistant to the General Manager, Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency, Dr. Adebola Odunsi, said awareness about climate change and its effects would take a collaborative effort from both the government and private individuals. He, however, noted that the Lagos State Government had policies in place to aid the free distribution of information and to encourage as much innovation in the space. He said, "Lagos State is willing to collaborate with institutions, the academia, international bodies and schools, to spread the message of climate change and instill this consciousness early in the younger generation. "The Ministry of Environment has a programme called the Environmental Bees Project, which is an extracurricular activity in schools that students are encouraged to participate in. It teaches them about the rudiments of environmental protection practices from the ground up, which they would, in turn, take back to their communities and families, thereby promoting sustainable and fair use of our environment.&rdquo; \</doc>

This year's midterm climate negotiation in Bonn, Germany, was heartrending. Going with what came out from the talks, the world may as well kiss our net-zero emissions dream goodbye. The developing world needs money to set our countries on the path to an emissions-free future, as agreed by the world. The Bonn Climate Change Conference, which took place from 6 June to 16 June, was expected to flesh out and tie up the major areas of collaboration between nations, especially regarding the Green Climate Fund. But it failed to deliver. The poor countries of the world are in dire need of green funds. But, it seems the longer they wait for the cash, the more the caskets are buried. The ordinary man in the street, who may not even understand the meaning of net-zero emissions, still has a grasp of the impacts of climate change &ndash; extreme weather events, storms, floods and droughts. This is because they suffer the effects of climate change more than the rich nations, yet they have less financial capacity to cope with these exigencies. At Bonn, the poor countries' negotiators argued that the climate change they are experiencing has been caused by carbon emitted by richer countries as they developed their economies. They said that Europe and the United States of America have a responsibility now to compensate them for this. But the US and Europe did not agree. Perhaps, they feared that if they paid for historic carbon emissions, it could put their countries on the hook for billions of dollars for decades or even centuries to come. The talks that ended in Bonn last week are a key item on the annual climate agenda, setting the stage for the United Nations-sponsored Conference of Parties, or COP, in November. For two weeks, negotiators worked to translate into action the big commitments made at the twenty-sixth COP in Glasgow last year, in preparation for COP27 later this year. Alas, it is like a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. During the last year's pre-COP negotiations, there was also no agreement. A target for rich countries to provide poor nations with $100 billion in aid each year to tackle global warming was missed, which effectively slowed down the climate talks at Glasgow, last year November. Senior officials from Britain, Canada and Germany, who had hoped to break a deadlock in negotiations later announced that current data showed the goal would not be reached until 2023 &mdash; three years later than agreed. The gloom is deepening; failure to fulfil the pledge first made in 2009 and reaffirmed at the 2015 Paris climate talks, has been a source of deep frustration for developing countries. Yet, the experts still maintained optimism and confidence that the $100 billion would be met in 2023, and importantly, projecting that the $100 billion would be exceeded in subsequent years, with up to $117 billion being mobilized in 2025. To be specific, they projected that over the 2021-2025 period, $500 million would likely be mobilized in public and private finance. Subsequently, the COP26 at Glasgow delivered a half-full cup. The package of decisions consists of a range of agreed items, including strengthened efforts to build resilience to climate change, to curb greenhouse gas emissions and to provide the necessary finance for both. Nations reaffirmed their duty to fulfil the pledge of providing 100 billion dollars annually from developed to developing countries. And they collectively agreed to work to reduce the gap between existing reduction plans and what is required to reduce emissions, so that the rise in the global average temperature can be limited to 1.5 degrees. Remarkably, for the first time, nations were called upon to phase down unabated coal power and inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels. Going from the above, there was still a window for optimism as we entered 2022. However, these hopes now seem lost when the Bonn conference became a manifest disappointment. After two weeks of talks, negotiations representing dozens of developing nations left Germany empty-handed as rich countries blocked their attempts to secure compensation for the damage caused by climate change. Related News Fossil fuels'll deliver climate chaos - UN Secretary-General Climate Change: FG to phase out kerosene usage by 2030 Red Cross warns against rise in global heat wave The debate around "loss and damage&rdquo; has been ongoing since the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was approved in 1992. While rich countries have recognized that global warming leads to disasters that are impossible to adapt to, they had never agreed that it warranted financial compensation. However, the final resolve to set up the 100-billion-dollar green climate fund for the developing world had made the world move forward. This is why the implementation is critical. Meanwhile, the issue is still expected to take centre stage at COP27 IN Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, end of this year. Now, in order to put this in perspective, we could look at Nigeria's latest promise to the world. A few days ago, the president, General Muhammadu Buhari (retired) renewed Nigeria's commitment for a safer and healthier global climate with the inclusion of elimination of kerosene lighting by 2030, increase in use of buses for public transport and reduction in burning of crop residues. He laid out these plans as they are contained in our country's updated Nationally Determined Contribution, while in a virtual meeting hosted by President Joe Biden of the US on Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate Change (NDCs are a set of pledged climate action plans of individual nations who are signatory to the UNFCCC). Herein lies the paradox: The American negotiators refused to make commitments towards the fulfilment of their pledge for the Green Climate Fund, while the American president hosts a green meeting expecting developing countries to fulfil their own commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. To be realistic, how can the teeming poverty-ridden population of Nigeria switch to green technologies without financial and technical support? In a country where cost of energy is skyrocketing on a daily basis, how could one be able to consider the environment first while looking for ways to survive the biting hardship? Could one actually choose not to burn the trees in his backyard for fuel because of environmental considerations, when there is no gas or kerosene to cook with? The truth is that the citizens of the developing world need money to adapt to the impacts of climate change. They are already living with loss and damages for decades now. They have families who have suffered so much for no fault of theirs. They have lost their houses, their crops, their lives, and no one is paying for these losses. They are running out of resources. They also need funds to change to green solutions that will cut down they carbon emissions. Surely, the rich countries understand this perfectly; yet, they drag their feet. The politics of loss and damage is complicated, and there is now so much international politics roped around it. Harjeet Singh of the Climate Action Network International said, "The European Union consistently blocked discussions on finance for loss and damage in Bonn. The last two weeks exposed its hypocritical stance, with major countries like Germany sourcing new fossil fuels abroad while denying support to developing countries facing devastation from climate-induced super storms and rising seas.&rdquo; Indubitably, the situation is now worsened by the war in Ukraine. The rich countries are also in a quandary; they face emerging existential concerns. They also fear potential military alliances even from some members of the developing world like China and India. Indeed, with the way things are going, they may soon start considering climate change and the environment less in their plans towards sustainability for their troubled citizens. This is why bridging the divide between the rich and poor on the climate change issue requires extra ambition and sincerity from world leaders. \</doc>

From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, New York President Muhammadu Buhari has urged African countries and their Arab partners to work harder and more collaboratively to achieve common goals. According to a statement by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, speaking Wednesday on the sidelines of the 77th United Nations General Assembly in New York, Buhari said that the implementation of the UN resolution proposing a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and Palestine required a platform to think creatively about how to engage the rest of the world on the issue. "The rest of the world need to be apprised on current state of things between Palestine and Israel in order to commit to the way forward. There should be a better collaboration between African countries on one side and our Arab bothers to get to the end of this matter," he said. The Palestinian president had paid a visit to his Nigerian counterpart to thank him for his consistent support of the Palestinian cause, which he reflected in his (Buhari's) address to the General Assembly, and to solicit his support by rallying other African countries to their side. He regretted that the Palestinian issue had dragged on for so long with little progress, adding that Palestinians are losing lives on a daily basis. Abbas went on to say that Palestinians had decided to take a peaceful approach to resolving the issue, relying on nations such as Nigeria to assist in a peaceful resolution of the Two-State solution, as recommended by the United Nations Resolution.

He emphasized the importance of collaboration between the Lake Chad Basin Commission and the Green Great Wall in combating desertification in some African countries, as well as finding practical solutions to the displacement of over 30 million people whose livelihoods depended on the shrinking Lake Chad. The president expressed optimism that with his wealth of experience and capacity, Issoufou will get the job done. The former Nigerien leader informed President Buhari that they needed Nigerian assistance to raise funds for their activities, especially since desertification is spreading across a number of African countries, with the majority of the countries severely challenged. He also stated that the committee needed to visit the countries involved in order to understand their specific needs, and that they would be in Nigeria in October of this year. He requested President Buhari to convene a side event at the COP 27 meeting in November in Egypt so that it can come up with a rich outcome for the committee to use as a basis for its report. \</doc>

Prof. Osinbajo stated this in Lagos while delivering the keynote address at the 60th Anniversary Dinner of the Oil Producers Trade Section (OPTS) of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), on Thursday. Speaking on the topic: 'Nigeria: Transitioning to Green Energy', the Vice President highlighted the Energy Transition Plan as Â£ comprehensive, data-driven and evidence-based plan, designed to deal with the twin crises of climate change and energy poverty.' 'We anchored the plan on key objectives, including lifting 100 million people out of poverty in a decade, driving economic growth, bringing modern energy services to the full population and managing the expected long-term job loss in the oil sector due to global decarbonization. 'The Private sector must up its participation in the transition to Green energy journey,' Prof. Osinbajo stated, adding that this includes 'greater involvement in the crucial conversations about what an economically just transition to zero emissions should be,' he said. Buttressing the need for more private sector participation in the Energy Transition Plan implementation, the VP pointed out that the off-grid Solar space in Nigeria 'is becoming one of the most exciting in the world.' COP-27 to initially provide the structure for the rollout of at least 1,000MW.' Adding that the private sector should also get involved in climate finance, especially the voluntary carbon markets, among others, Prof. Osinbajo urged the OPTS 'to take the lead in Solar to help drive improvements in our energy mix and also accelerate the transition to having 'energy' companies, not just oil companies.' 'We are particularly pleased with the good work that All-On and Konexa have been doing all with funding from Shell (a key OPTS member). We also have NNPC partnering with the Rural Electrification Agency to rollout Solar Mini-grids and Solar Home Systems across the country,' he further said. Aside from the need for more private sector participation in Nigeria's energy transition plan, the impact of climate change on the African continent, need to support fossil fuel projects in developing countries, and debt-for-climate swap deals were major highlights of the Vice President's speech at the event. Speaking further on the topic, the Vice President noted that climate change may likely be the most consequential subject globally in the next few decades, even as the significance of reducing global emissions to zero come to the fore. Noting the effects of global climate crisis such as floods, desertification, rising water levels and record high temperatures, Prof. Osinbajo stated that the developing countries are faced with two challenges; climate change and extreme poverty. Restating the importance of using gas as a transition fuel for Nigeria and others developing countries, he highlighted six aspects in reducing global net emissions to zero, as it relates to the developing world. \</doc>

Seplat Energy Plc, an indigenous energy company, has said the greatest business opportunity ahead of it is to supply the right mix of energy to support Nigeria's growth and balance the decarbonisation imperative with meeting today's energy needs. In doing so, the company said it remained committed to making positive social impacts and contributing to Nigeria's achievement of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Effiong Okon, Director, New Energy, Seplat said this while delivering a keynote speech at the 45th edition of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) Nigeria Annual International Conference and Exhibition (NAICE) themed: 'Operationalising a Clean Energy Transition for Sustainable Development in Africa' on Wednesday. Okon, who represented Roger Brown, CEO, Seplat Energy, said for a successful energy transition in Africa: 'We must support the goals of the Paris Agreement and align with society's objective to get the world to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, if not before.; as lower-emission hydrocarbons, particularly gas, have a role to play during energy transition by replacing diesel generators and biomass. 'Though hydrocarbon export will continue to be a mainstay of the Nigerian economy and will fund Nigeria's growth as well as its energy transition, the Oil and Gas Industry has a role to play as a responsible steward of Nigeria's oil and gas assets, including those that might be divested.' According to him, in the longer term, the reality and threat of climate change require the decarbonisation of energy systems in Nigeria, but sustainability and transparency must be at the heart of business operations and decision-making. Speaking on 'just transition' Okon noted that there is the need to balance decarbonisation with development, adding that: 'Global warming and climate volatility are existential threats to humanity and nature. 'However, we need to consider the reality in the continent. Poverty, hunger, unemployment, and population growth abound here,' he said. 'Africa contributes just 3.3 percent of global emissions. Most Africans (600 million) lack access to reliable energy, which hampers development.' He further said that the use of inefficient and costly diesel/petrol generators saps financial resources, drains foreign exchange, and creates pollution. 'Biomass use for cooking causes deforestation, health problems, and nearly 0.5 million premature deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa every year. 'The developed world's drive to impose decarbonisation on Africa will constrain development.' Making the case for gas, the Seplat Director said the developed-world pressures to abandon fossil fuels are being pushed back by recognition of the need to drive development with reliable energy. COP27 , he explained, would focus on how best to achieve this balance for the benefit of tomorrow's 2.5 billion Africans, of whom 500 million will be Nigerian, adding that given current low emission levels, Africa can achieve a disproportionate improvement in living stands through a globally small increase in emissions from cleaner gas for power and cooking. He called on players in the continent to leverage oil and gas revenues to cash flow transition, but also tap international transition funding where available, hence the need for good corporate governance. The Seplat Energy executive, therefore, urged industry operators to focus on quick wins first, which are: decarbonising the upstream and focusing on producing Â£dvantaged' low-carbon barrels with low Scope half (\'bd); end routine flaring and redeploying gas to power operations and local communities, and deploy renewables to power operations where possible, and share with local communities. He added: 'We need to develop gas as a transition fuel (Gas-to-power to replace diesel, move along value chain into power, e.g. business parks, large buildings; hybrid gas-to-power / solar offerings; and bottled gas products for domestic use. 'In addition, we can expand into renewables (hydro, wind, geothermal, blue/green hydrogen; and develop and monetise carbon capture and storage.' \</doc>

Fighting climate change The Conference of Parties ( COP 27 ), organised for nations to deliberate on tackling the global challenge of climate change, has officially kickstarted in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. This session of the conference is crucial to the African continent, which is most affected by the disruptive effects of climate change. The Nigerian government, for one, has expressed optimism about achieving the country's expectations for climate financing, and carbon trading, amongst other issues. Climate change costs Nigeria $100 billion per annum and could cost $460bn by 2050. Can the two weeks long conference help solve the country's climate change-induced problems? We will find out on the 18th of November. Naira hits N800/$1 Going by the official exchange rate, one can say the performance of the Naira is not all gloomy. This is because it has only dropped by 4% against the US dollar this year. However, from a larger economic view, this isn't commendable. The official exchange rate is largely used by the government, but engagement with the dollar is solely in the black market, translating to a 37% drop against the dollar. On Friday, the dollar was exchanged at N880.00 and sold at N885.00 on the parallel market as against the official rate of N439.38. There are projections that $1 will equal N1000 Naira before the year runs out. The Central Bank of Nigeria can not afford this, but how will this looming reality be averted? Increased export or Naira beautification? Twitter layoffs and the cost of verification The recent acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk is already coming at a cost for many people - from users (Tweeps) to workers. For example, Twitter users would have to pay $8 per month to get or remain verified. This has raised concerns from users who feel the badge of authenticity is better earned and monetizing it partly erodes its essence. We earlier reported how the business magnate started a series of layoffs, starting with top executives like CEO Parag Agrawal and chief financial officer Ned Segal amongst others. We further asked if this layoff would affect Africa's Twitter team. Sadly yes, there is already a trickle-down impact on the African Twitter team, which came into existence only 18 months ago after a symbolic launch of Twitter Africa operations in Ghana. Several members of the 20-person Twitter team in Africa have been laid off. Obviously, this development threatens the establishment of new offices on the African continent. But only time can tell what Musk has in plans for an African expansion. ICYMI: Market roundup The Nigerian naira started the week at 439.93 NGN/$1 to close at 439.38 NGN/$1.

President Muhammadu Buhari has called on African countries and their Arab partners to work hard and be more united to realise common objectives. According to a statement by the President's spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina, the president made the call at a bilateral meeting with the President of Palestine, Mahmoud Abbas, in New York,United States, on Wednesday. "The rest of the world need to be apprised on current state of things between Palestine and Israel in order to commit to the way forward. "There should be a better collaboration between African countries on one side and our Arab bothers to get to the end of this matter," he said. The Palestinian President had visited his Nigerian counterpart to thank him for being a consistent supporter of the Palestinian cause even as he reflected it in his (Buhari's) address at the floor of the General Assembly and to solicit his support by rallying other African countries to their side. He regretted that the Palestinian issue had dragged for a long time without commensurate progress, adding that "there is a daily loss of lives on the Palestinian side." Abbas added that\~ Palestinians had decided to pursue a peaceful path towards resolving the matter by relying on nations like Nigeria to help in a peaceful resolution of the Two-State solution as recommended by the United Nations Resolution. Meanwhile, the Nigerian leader also met with Mahamadou Issoufou, former President of Niger Republic and Special envoy of the UN and African Union on Joint Strategic Assessment \~and Governance Situation in the Sahel. He stressed the essence of a collaboration between the Lake Chad Basin Commission and the Green Great Wall. According to him, this is imperative in order to combat the desertification spreading across some African states. He said it would also help in finding practical solutions to the displacement of over 30 million persons whose means of livelihood depended on the shrunken Lake Chad. The president expressed optimism that with his wealth of experience and capacity, Issoufou would get the job done. The former Nigerien leader had informed President Buhari that they required Nigerian support to raise funds for their activities especially as desertification was spreading across a number of African countries. He noted that most of the countries were severely challenged. Issoufou added that the committee needed to visit the countries involved to know their specific needs and would, at this instance, be in Nigeria in October this year. He requested Buhari to convene a side event at the COP 27 meeting in November in Egypt so that it could come up with a rich outcome for the committee to use as a basis for its report. (NAN) \</doc>

President Muhammadu Buhari has called for the outright cancellation of debts for developing countries facing severe fiscal and liquidity challenges. Buhari made the call Wednesday in his farewell speech to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, revealed a statement. The president told the world leaders that multifaceted challenges facing most developing countries have placed a debilitating chokehold on their fiscal space. 'This justifies the need to address the burden of unsustainable external debt by a global commitment to the expansion and extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative as well as outright cancellation,' he said. As of October 2021, the World Bank revealed that the debt burden of the world's low-income countries rose 12 percent to a record $860 billion in 2020, while external debt stocks of low- and middle-income countries combined rose 5.3 percent to $8.7 trillion. The president also vowed to entrench credibility, fairness and transparency in the upcoming 2023 elections, adding that heavy investments have been made to strengthen the framework for free and fair elections. Consequently he noted that at the 78th UNGA, there will be a new face speaking for Nigeria as its president. Buhari also expressed concern that Africa and other developing nations, which produce only a small proportion of greenhouse gas emissions, are the hardest hit by climate change ''Fortunately, we now know what we can do to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis and the related energy challenge; as a first step, we must all commit to releasing the financing and the technology to create a stable and affordable framework for energy transition,' he said. The president said that Development Financial Institutions must prioritise de-risking energy projects to improve access of renewable projects to credit facilities, noting that no countries should be 'left behind' in this equation. He added that Nigeria expects UNGA 77 and the upcoming COP 27 to help galvanise the political will required to drive action towards the fulfilment of the various existing climate change initiatives. Regarding the ongoing Russia-Ukraine crisis, the president warned that the danger of escalation further justifies Nigeria's call for a nuclear-free world and a universal Arms Trade Treaty, which are necessary measures to prevent global human disasters. 'The war will have adverse consequences on all, hindering the capacity of the international community to work together to resolve conflicts elsewhere, especially in Africa, the Middle-East and Asia,' he said. He demanded that world leaders must find quick means to reach consensus on the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty with related commitments by nuclear weapon states. In his concluding remarks, president Buhari urged the leaders present to uphold values of justice, honour, integrity, as he reminded them that these are extraordinary times with interdependent challenges but enormous opportunities. \</doc>

Following thought-provoking messages and welcoming addresses from both private and public sector leaders, the third edition of the Angola Oil & Gas (AOG) conference and exhibition ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3VCWonI https://bit.ly/3VCWonI The discussion explored the topic \' The Right and Will to Develop: How to harness the resources of Angola and the region for an energy rich future\' . The speakers included H.E. Haitham Al Ghais, Secretary General, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC); H.E. Diamantino Azevedo, Minister of Mineral Resources, Petroleum and Gas, Angola; H.E. Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima, Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons, Equatorial Guinea; H.E. Didier Budimbu Ntubuanga, Minister of Hydrocarbons, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC); Hon. Tom Alweendo, Minister of Mines and Energy, Namibia; Foday Mansaray, Director General, Petroleum Directorate of Sierra Leone; and H.E. Cheikh Niane, Vice President of the Ministry of Petroleum and Energies, Senegal. The session was moderated by NJ Ayuk, Executive Chairman of the African Energy Chamber. Kicking off discussions, H.E. Minister Azevedo provided insight into the country\' s agenda, stating that  We have the objective of maintaining stability. Our strategy is to reduce production decline and maintain stability as far as oil production goes. Additionally, we would want to increase our refinery and storage capacity in order to reduce the imports so as to meet the domestic needs and to export oil derivatives. That is our key strategy. Providing insight into the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed with Angola, Hon. Minister Alweendo stated that,  The MoU we have signed has to do with the fact that not long ago, we announced that we made an oil discovery. We are the new kids on the block. We need to learn from those who have gone before us. There was no better country to learn from than Angola. Mansaray also provided insight into Sierra Leone\' s MoU signed with Angola, stating that  We are focused on African content. This signing today further strengthens our collaboration with Angola. The signing fosters our relationship with Angola so that we can learn the lessons that they have learnt in the past. We are gearing up for production. One of the companies who are exploring from the last licensing round are expecting 8.2 tcf of gas. We are a small country with new oil and gas and big ambitions. Following on from these remarks, H.E. Al Ghais shared insight into the upcoming OPEC meeting\' s agenda, stating that,  We will be going over all the market fundamentals and reviewing everything from a purely technical perspective. We are seeing high inflation and monetary policies taking place, high sovereign debt levels, supply chain issues, and yet we still see global economic growth at 2% \- however, this might be revised. We do not look at oil prices. We sit down with a method, with various bodies within OPEC sitting for two days going over all the economic fundamental parameters, supply and demand outlook and challenges and come up with a formulation of how the market will look like. Meanwhile, the conversation shifted to outcomes of the COP27 summit held in Egypt earlier this month, with much of the consensus being that in order to stimulate economic growth, industrialize nations and address energy poverty, the continent needs to prioritize oil and gas development.  The two problems our continent has is energy poverty and energy security. Until these challenges are solved, we cannot talk about the transition. We need to start bringing solutions. For energy poverty, we need to increase capacity and generation. We need to increase supply and it needs to come from everything: oil, gas, hydrogen and more. Secondly, regarding energy security, we need to secure and control our resources, stated H.E. Minister Lima. Finally, adding to these remarks the respective ministers of the DRC and Senegal provided insight into efforts being done to maximize resources.  We have launched a public tender. We do not have energy and need to start exploring what we have. It is not acceptable having our citizens dying without energy. We want to start drilling and developing our country. To have an energy transition you need to have energy in the first place. So, we have launched 30 blocks and a few companies will release their outcome in the next two weeks, stated H.E. Minister Ntubuanga. Adding to this, H.E. Niane stated that,  We are expecting first oil and gas in 2023. We are planning for Greater Tortue Ahmeyim which we are sharing with Mauritania to export up to 2.5 million tons per annum (mtpa). We are also working on FID for next year for the second phase of the project because we want to increase it to 10 mtpa. Our President, H.E. Macky Sall, stated that Senegal will continue to drill and use our hydrocarbon resources. Developed countries need to decarbonize while developing countries industrialize and we are working on this.

Beyond the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions globally, efforts being undertaken to address climate change must also take into consideration its implications on social justice and inequalities, especially for the poor and vulnerable in developing economies. This was the submission by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, yesterday at a Public Lecture he delivered on "Africa and Climate Justice" at Queen's University, Kingston, Canada on the last leg of his 3-day official working visit to the North American country. Buttressing his point on the concept of Climate Justice as a just and equitable transition to clean energy, Prof Osinbajo stated that "the notion of climate justice insists that in addition to discussions on greenhouse gas emissions and the need to reduce them, we also recognize that climate change is an inherently social issue with important social justice implications." Continuing, he argued that, "we need to reframe our climate action paradigm from merely a technical effort to cut emissions, to an approach that places people and addressing social inequality at the centre of our efforts. "This is based on the reality that while climate change is already affecting every inhabited region across the globe and no place on earth will be immune to its effects, the impact will be different across key regions and groups." The VP pointed out that it is the "poor and vulnerable, largely in developing economies," who "will be first to suffer and worst hit by the effects of climate change even though they are the least culpable for the climate crisis. " According to him, "the point that must be made is that it is unfair that while many global north countries recognize the need for a wide range of options and different paths to net-zero for themselves, the same courtesy is not necessarily extended to Africa." The Vice President added that "clearly, limiting the development of domestic gas projects, which is a critical energy transition pathway for Africa, violates enshrined principles of equity and justice, and poses dire challenges for African nations, while making an insignificant dent in global emissions. " He further observed that despite contributing to barely 3% 4% of global emissions, which is the least of any global region to emissions, "climate change as a threat multiplier is more evident in Africa than in any other region." Prof. Osinbajo then referenced current estimates which posited that Africa was warming faster than the global average and experiencing greater increases in the rise of sea-level. "The Sahel region has recorded vegetation loss leading to a sharp rise in conflicts between farmers and herders. Southern Madagascar is experiencing what the United Nations is calling the world's first climate change-induced famine. "In Nigeria, we are currently grappling with the catastrophic effects of floods that have affected about 34 States of our 36 States, displacing over 1. 4 million people, destroying over 100,000 hectares of farmland and causing about 600 deaths. The African Development Bank estimates that African economies are already between 5 15% smaller because of climate change," he observed. With agriculture providing the largest number of jobs for many developing countries, "reduced crop productivity will worsen unemployment gaps on the continent and result in grave socio-economic consequences," Prof. Osinbajo submitted, adding that "parallels of these multiplier effects can be drawn in other sectors from health to shelter and security. " Although the VP noted that reducing emissions from the energy sector is crucial for limiting global warming, the energy sector is one of the starkest examples of global inequality. He, therefore, emphasized in the lecture that the energy needs of developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, have to be taken into consideration, especially by most developed countries in their discussion around climate change and a just transition. For instance, he stated that while "Sub-Saharan Africa had about 52% of its population or about 568 million people without access to electricity in 2020, most developed countries have 100% energy access." He went on to point out that "Sub-Saharan Africa remains the only region with a rising number of people without access to clean cooking fuels and technologies, with 19 of the 20 countries with lowest clean cooking access rates in Africa. " The VP observed that, in practical terms, these energy deficits produce staggering effects. For instance, according to the International Energy Agency, the clean cooking deficits lead to 500,000 premature deaths from household air pollution in Africa annually. Prof. Osinbajo also noted that this electricity deficit has also worsened gender inequities as "millions of women and children suffer from critical health conditions, and half of secondary schools and a quarter of health facilities in Sub-Saharan Africa have no power. " He then predicted that because Africa's current unmet energy needs are huge, future demand will be even greater as populations expand. "For many gas-rich but energy-poor countries in Africa such as Nigeria, we recognize the role that natural gas, being a much cleaner fossil fuel, must play as a transition fuel in the short term to facilitate the establishment of base-load energy capacity and address clean cooking deficits in the form of LPG. But there has been strong resistance to this. Related News "Several global North nations have placed restrictions on the use of development funds for natural gas infrastructure in Africa with ripple effects in the private financial sector. " However, in calling for climate justice for developing countries, the Vice President noted that "one should emphasize that developing economies do not seek a free pass when it comes to climate action. "There is more than sufficient evidence of commitment to developing climate-sensitive, locally grounded transition pathways as many of us have done with our Nationally Determined Contributions. "There are also regional initiatives like the Great Green Wall initiative and the original vision was to create a wall of trees against desertification in the Sahel, the horn and across North Africa, but it has grown into a variety of sustainable land use practices designed to combat climate change and desertification and to address food insecurity and poverty." The VP added that regarding Nigeria's efforts towards combating climate change, "we have recently launched a detailed Energy Transition Plan which outlines pathways to universal energy access by 2030 and net-zero by 2060. "As a global community, we have to acknowledge the differences between groups in how they experience climate change; ensure that processes for making decisions about the impacts of, and responses to climate change are fair and transparent, and determine how the costs and benefits of climate action will be equitably shared. " Also, speaking on the outcomes from COP-27 in Egypt, Prof Osinbajo mentioned that "a big win at COP-27 was the loss and damage fund which is to compensate poor countries for climate change-related loss and damage." The Vice President then listed what a just approach to global energy transition should recognize: That developing economies must have universal energy access at levels sufficient for dignified livelihoods and economic growth; That energy transition must place energy access for both consumptive and productive uses, as well as the required policy flexibility, financial and technical support at the heart of climate action; That making capital available for the buildout of energy systems is central to reaching the goals of the Paris Agreement; That to meet its decarbonisation obligations, Africa needs both conventional capital flows and the development of innovative mechanisms like debt-for-climate investments and carbon trading; That we must lift inhibitive development finance restrictions and upscale technology transfers to ensure developing regions have access to the latest energy innovations and can build local industries on fair terms. Earlier in the day, the Vice President had met with principal officers of Queen's University led by the Interim Provost and Vice-President (Academics), Dr. Teri Shearer, where he was briefed on some of the initiatives of the University, including the One Million Teachers programme, developed by the institution's former graduate student, Hakeem Subair, who also spoke at the event. The One Million Teachers initiative is an education technology social enterprise startup which aims to attract and retain 1 million teachers (including in, but not limited to, Nigeria), and develop the capacity to train more in areas where classrooms are not available through its online platforms. Accompanying the VP to the university were the Nigeria High Commission to Canada, Ambassador Adeyinka Asekun and his wife Mrs. Olawunmi Asekun, Special Advisers Economic Matters, Ambassador Adeyemi Dipeolu; Social Investments, Maryam Uwais; and other top government officials. Other Queen's University officials who welcomed the VP included Vice Provost, International and Prof. of History, Dr. Sandra den Otter; Associate Dean of Teacher Education, Dr. Peter Chin; Assistant Professor and Queen's National Scholar, Faculty of Law, Dr. Oluwatobiloba Moddy and other senior management staff. Established in 1841, Queen's University is one of Canada's leading research-intensive academic institutions and is famous for its role in advancing the goals of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). \</doc>

The same would be true as other developing countries would also benefit from the adoption of gas as a transition fuel. Prof. Osinbajo stated this on Tuesday night when he received at the Presidential Villa, the US Special Presidential Envoy on Climate Change, Mr. John Kerry, who was on a working visit to Nigeria. Prior to his meeting with the VP, Mr. Kerry had also met with President Muhammadu Buhari. Speaking at the meeting with Kerry and the US delegation, the Vice President highlighted the need for Nigeria to continue the exploration and use of gas as a way of arresting deforestation, transiting away from dirtier fuels like diesel, kerosene and petrol, while at the same time ensuring that the country has the necessary energy baseload for industrialization. Pointing out that Nigeria has one of the largest gas reserves in the world and should benefit from its exploitation, the VP also highlighted the significance of Nigeria's Energy Transition Plan, which is the first in Africa. Recall that Prof. Osinbajo had discussed the Energy Transition Plan during his recent visit to Washington D.C., where the VP met with his American counterpart, VP Kamala Harris at the White House, among other top US government officials. Before the recent US trip, the Federal Government had launched the Energy Transition Plan at a global virtual event. In addition to a review of the Energy Transition Plan, including a discussion about its implementation, both the Vice President and Mr Kerry also discussed the issues of renewable energy sources and the global transition. In his remarks, Mr. Kerry had high praises for the plan and also for the efforts already being made in Nigeria to step up the use of renewables, especially solar and hydropower, as major components of the energy mix. Upon a request by the Vice President, the Special Envoy promised to assist Nigeria with the necessary expertise to scientifically determine the most appropriate energy mix that will move the country toward the goal of energy for all by 2030 and net zero carbon emissions by 2060, without compromising the country's energy security. The US Special Envoy also affirmed the readiness of the US Government to assist Nigeria in a bilateral partnership to realize its Climate Change adaptation and resilience capacity, thereby consolidating the nation's place as a model for other countries on the planet. He added that he looked forward to Nigeria presenting an inspiring position, which will no doubt attract all necessary global support at the upcoming COP 27 in Egypt later in the year. Mr. Kerry who was accompanied by other US officials including the American Ambassador to Nigeria, Ms Mary Beth Leonard, praised the VP's leadership in urging the global community towards a just transition and coordinating Nigeria's efforts on the climate change agenda. \</doc>

Download logo With Angola's oil and gas industry ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3AX1Wln https://bit.ly/3AX1Wln As such, Angola's premier energy event and the biggest to take place in Africa post- COP27 \- Angola Oil & Gas (AOG) 2022 ( HYPERLINK http://bit.ly/3UyBCpP http://bit.ly/3UyBCpP The session began with a keynote presentation by Miguel Baptista, Managing Director for Central, East, and Southern Africa at Schlumberger \- now SLB \- who discussed the company's strategies towards decarbonizing the oil and gas industry in Africa and bringing innovative and cost-effect solutions to energizing the continent.  The oil and gas industry has been, it is, and will be, the engine of growth for the Angolan economy. For the past few decades, Angola has evolved from a low-income country to a medium-income country and this evolution has been driven primarily by its oil and gas industry, Baptista stated, adding,  While the importance of the oil and gas industry cannot be question in Angola, we are living in an exciting and unique time in our country and a pivotal time for our planet as we work on the world's greatest balancing act. Moderated by Gon\'e7alo Falc\'e3o, Partner at Meyer Brown, speakers included Ian Cloke, COO, Afentra; Ezinne Nnebocha, Marketing and Sale Manager, SLB Angola; Matt Tyrell, Chief Geologist, DDMS Ida & Trois Geoconsulting, Xcalibur Multiphysics; Matthieu Wallach, Sales Director and General Manager, Southern Africa, Welltec; Frederic Jacquemin, Director for Contracts and Marketing, Noble Drilling and David Tony Nwakaji, Sales & Commercial Manager \- Sub Saharan Africa, Tenaris. The conversation kicked off with insight provided into the opportunities created for service companies in Angola ( http://bit.ly/3sJGHPo http://bit.ly/3sJGHPo ).  The marketplace has changed quite a lot now and as we look forward; we can start going towards the mature phases of exploration prospects, stated Ian Cloke, COO of Afentra, adding,  As I look at it, I think the demand for the service industry has to change to mimic what other well-established exploration and production countries have been doing. Meanwhile, speaking on the prospects of taking advantage of mature fields in Angola, Matt Tyrell, Chief Geologist for DDMS Ida & Trois Geoconsulting and Xcalibur Multiphysics, stated,  There's always been great optimism about new exploration here in Angola, but if you look at where the best success has been, that has consistently been in established areas. We need to not only think about new frontier bases, but exploration in established basins as well.  As a provider of technologies, we have the solutions, added Mathieu Wallach, Sales Director and General Manager for Southern Africa at Welltec, stating that,  We need to work with the oil companies to find the right solutions that will effectively minimize the effect of cost and carbon emissions. It can be by combining technologies and these questions need to notify and discover where to find real value. Thereafter, the discussion shifted to the role service companies play in driving sustainable oil and gas operations in Angola, with emphasis placed on the need to deploy specialized technologies that enable the market to grow in a climate-friendly manner.  We have to set goals and consider how they concretely work in practice. we are looking into renewable fuels, but towards the long-term, we need to also consider the logistics aspects, stated Frederic Jacquemin, Director for Contracts and Marketing at Noble Drilling. Additionally, speaking about Angola's position as Africa's largest oil producer ( HYPERLINK http://bit.ly/3y1Mseo http://bit.ly/3y1Mseo Finally, raising points on the opportunities for Angola to leverage modern technology to reduce emissions in the oil and gas sector, it was noted during the panel discussion that oil and gas is a requisite for Angola \- and the rest of Africa \- to empower itself and participate, practically, in the energy transition.  Over the course of these past few days, its apparent that the oil and gas industry is an engine for growth in Angola and several African countries, stated Ezinne Nnebocha, Marketing and Sale Manager at SLB Angola, concluding,  We know the harsh reality of energy access in Africa. As an operator, and even as a service company, we need to be clear about what we're doing. We will continue to operate, but how can we leverage practices, processes, and technology in a way that reduces emissions and promotes development?

By Vivian Emoni Abuja, Sept. 13, 2022 (NAN) The United States Government is to commit 200 million U.S. dollars to start-up process on Clean Energy Demand Initiative to help address climate change in the country. The U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, Mr John Kerry, made the commitment when his team paid a courtesy visit to the Minister of Environment, Mr Mohammed Abdullahi, in Abuja on Tuesday. Kerry, who also signed an Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the minister on the initiative, said the programme started in Glasgow. According to him, the initiative is a way by which companies and countries can make decisions to implement buying or production of green products. "The initiative is also to accelerate the marketplace creation, so that it will help transition programme faster and help to achieve a clean energy economy as well as dealing with climate crisis. "The minister has agreed in the letter of intent. We have 200 million dollars at the moment committed to the startup in the process of safety," he said. Kerry said the initiative would take a lot of billions of dollars and trillions of investment in the country. "We talked today about the ways in which we can be helpful to bring major amount of capital to the table with technology to help Nigeria, move faster to the clean energy economy. "That is the future and all of the citizens of Nigeria will benefit from cleaner air," he said. He said that the programme would provide job opportunities and develop economic as well as promoting a healthy environment in the country. "I will like to explore with you and listen to you to think through how we can work together as you implement your own climate change. "As you also think about the long term future and sustainability for Nigeria for the Africa, we will like to explore with you on how we can increase the ambition that you have set out already in your Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). "I congratulate you. Nigeria is taking a lead towards COP 27 and it is an opportunity to reduce emissions and deal with the climate crisis. "So, on that note, the initiative is a very important effort to try to send a signal to the marketplace and to bring your businesses to the table. "We are going to work together. I've got a good team here. "We are all working on this programme every day, trying to figure out the road ahead and I look forward to hearing your thoughts about that," he said. The minister said the MoU would help Nigeria to participate in the clean energy demand initiative being supported by the U.S. government. He said the essence of the initiative was to ensure a healthy and clean energy accessible in the country. He thanked the U.S. Government for the support and commitment in ensuring that environmental crisis is tackled in the country.

He said the essence of the initiative was to ensure a healthy and clean energy accessible in the country. He thanked the U.S. Government for the support and commitment in ensuring that environmental crisis is tackled in the country. Abdullahi said that the ministry was also committed to strongly work with the U.S Government for effective implementation of environmental programmes and achieve net zero in the country.

Download logo ITC's partnership with the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) supports innovative, green finance solutions, strengthens Africa's creative economy through tailored trainings - with 5,000 small businesses skilled so far - and promotes African business opportunities within the Caribbean region. ITC recognizes that &lsquo;Partnerships4Purpose' can contribute to impactful projects and sustainable outcomes. To celebrate the teamwork behind these efforts, ITC is proud to highlight game-changing initiatives that are made possible through strong and meaningful collaboration. When the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) came into force on 30 May 2019, Africa committed to expanding its business opportunities, streamlining its continental approach for trade regulation, and ensuring the free movement of goods and services. The AfCFTA is one of the flagship initiatives of the African Union to achieve its Agenda 2063. The agreement connects 1.3 billion people across 55 African countries with a combined GDP of $3.4 trillion, and provides an opportunity for industrialization, job creation, industry innovation and economic growth. The unique approach: Tailoring trainings to boost intra-African export potential Recent developments in the global economy present African businesses with several challenges that ITC describes as the four Cs - COVID-19, climate change, conflict, and costs. The AfCFTA offers an opportunity for businesses to adjust and bounce back from these challenges, provided the right mechanisms are in place for support. In its continued commitment to further intra-African export potential, Afreximbank has teamed up with ITC to support small businesses, especially women and youth entrepreneurs, to make the most of the Free Trade Area. The impact: Improved access to African trade opportunities for marginalized groups The pilot ran in C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Nigeria and Rwanda in 2020 and was then extended to include Ghana, Morocco and Zimbabwe. One week after its launch, the programme received almost 1,500 applications. It supports businesses at country level to trade continentally using a dual approach: it includes a free online component on the Afreximbank Academy, while ITC facilitates in-country workshops to train business owners, business support organizations and government stakeholders. Through the trainings, entrepreneurs can easily find tailored market opportunities for their businesses, identifying the highest export potential for their products and how to capitalize on potential financing opportunities. The trainees also have access to trade financing and trade facilitation interventions offered by Afreximbank to support intra-African trade. Over 5,000 small businesses have been trained so far. Next to English and French, the training will soon be available in Arabic and Portuguese as well. Moving forward: A vibrant African private sector The agreement will also establish a continental collaborative group to pave the way for African designers and artists to engage in the continent's vibrant creative economy. To secure investment opportunities for African businesses, the partnership will support the Pan African Private Sector, Trade and Investment Committee (PAFTRAC). The new partnership will also push for African businesses to pursue opportunities beyond their regional markets and consider international export opportunities in the Caribbean. With the increasing need for businesses to adopt sustainable approaches due to climate change, the partnership will promote the uptake of relevant and innovative green solutions at global events, including COP27 in November 2022. Through its partnership with Afreximbank, ITC continues to broaden its commitment to equip African women and youth-led businesses, maximizing the benefits of the AfCFTA agreement and thus trade across Africa.

Development lenders in Africa can seize the current global crises as an impetus to help the continent significantly increase food production. This was a common conclusion of panelists at this year's Finance in Common ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3VAI1Bm https://bit.ly/3VAI1Bm Participants agreed that development partners should work with governments and other policymakers to bolster the resilience of private businesses, especially those led by women. The panelists included Beth Dunford, Vice President for Agriculture, Human and Social Development at the African Development Bank; Ijeoma Ozulumba, Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer of the Development Bank of Nigeria; James Mwangi, Group Managing Director and CEO of Kenya-based pan-African Equity Group Holdings; and Admassu Tadesse, CEO of Trade and Development Bank. The panel discussion, unlocking smart and inclusive Recovery in Africa through the private sector, was one of several at the three-day summit that looked at how multilateral development banks can bring tangible solutions to Africa's development challenges. The African Development Bank and the European Investment Bank co-organized the summit under the theme; Green and Just Transition for a Sustainable Recovery to highlight the role of public development banks in Africa's recovery as the continent faced impacts from the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, and Russia's war in Ukraine. The meetings are taking place less than a month before the UN climate conference, COP27 , gets underway in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt. Dunford highlighted various initiatives by the African Development Bank to enhance financial inclusion, particularly by empowering women through digitization and capacity-building to make their activities bankable. "At the African Development Bank and in our gender strategy, we're looking into women's economic empowerment across everything we do," Dunford stressed. She added: "With every operation at the bank, there is the recognition that women's empowerment is the key for delivering on growth. The strategy is paying off by reducing poverty among families." Dunford said that the bank's Affirmative Finance Action for Women in Africa (AFAWA) program maintained its goal to bridge the $42 billion financing gap for women. She said the African Development Bank was also making sure there is space for the private sector as governments turn to the domestic market to mobilize credit amid tightening global conditions. Tadesse said Africa must use climate action to spur agriculture and climate-resilient infrastructure to rapidly boost food production. He said: "What really needs to be done now is refocusing on supply-side measures because climate change, the Covid-19 pandemic and the new shocks coming from the war in Ukraine have left behind serious supply problems. That's what is driving inflation, food insecurity, and energy insecurity and all fronts.". The Trade and Development Bank CEO said that the current food losses represent 8% of greenhouse emissions and that addressing them would be climate action. "If we're just to invest in agriculture, storage, and cold chains, just to stem the losses, that will significantly contribute to addressing climate change." Tadesse reiterated the call for channeling more International Monetary Fund Special Drawing Rights to Africa. "We want to see more SDRs flow through Africa, and if it doesn't flow, then it will be an opportunity lost." Panelists also discussed current exchange rate volatilities, increasing costs of credit, and good governance in managing the development of financial institutions. Drawing from the Development Bank of Nigeria's experience, Ozulumba said: "Governance is central to building a development bank, and Nigeria is a good role model with efficiency in operations." European Investment Bank Vice President Thomas &Ouml;stros moderated the panel. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Development Bank Group (AfDB).

Promising progress is being made in Africa's agricultural transformation. On my recent mission to Malawi, I witnessed the plans to create an Agricultural Transformation Agency in the country, a significant milestone in the journey towards fast-tracking transformation of the continent's food systems. This bold move by the government not only signifies commitment to take a holistic approach in dealing with hunger in the country, from the farm to the fork, but the creation of this body to coordinate different agencies' efforts also sets a good example for the rest of the continent. With eight years left towards the landmark 2030 when Africa, like the rest of the world, must have achieved the SDGs - notably the eradication of hunger, tackling food security will require global collaboration. It will require coordinated strategies, government commitment and large-scale action in mobilising resources needed to unlock Africa's ability to feed itself and the rest of the world. In just over one month (Sept 5 - 9), leaders from Africa and the world, scientists and farmers will convene in Kigali, Rwanda for the AGRF Summit, which resumes In-person sessions after the last two years of the Covid pandemic, when a hybrid format was adopted. Under the theme Grow, Nourish, Reward - Bold Actions for Resilient Food Systems, the summit will explore the action tracks that will accelerate food system transformation, especially after the 2021 UN Food Systems Summit, where over 30 African national pathways were charted, but which must now be turned into actionable strategies for the attainment of the Malabo, CAADP and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Currently, about 57.9 percent of the people in Africa are under-nourished, according to the recently released State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2022, which also projects that hunger could increase, making Africa the region with the largest number of undernourished people. These statistics cannot be ignored, we need everyone to come to the table and find solutions. We all want better results, we are all interested in feeding our communities and economies that can thrive from agriculture and so we must challenge each other and keep each other accountable if we are to eradicate hunger. Steps have already been taken by various stakeholders to deliver the innovations required to drive food system transformation, and these must be amplified for quicker impact. The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) has, for example, trained hundreds of seed scientists, who have released about 700 improved seed varieties for 18 different crops. Many of the commercialized varieties are of indigenous crops, which are already adapted to local conditions and have high nutrient values. Read also: Way out of high food inflation rate For agriculture to make sense, it must be viewed not just as a source of sustenance, but as a rewarding business. It is, therefore, important that we capitalise on the food trade opportunities enshrined in the African Continental Food Trade Area (AfCFTA) to create new markets for smallholder farmers, who on many occasions are forced to watch as their produce decays away for lack of local buyers. Outside the continent, we must continue collaborating with like-minded partners in advancing solutions for global challenges like climate change, which requires diverse technical capacity and financial resources to address. These are some of the agenda items that will define the conversations in Kigali, where participants will come together to derive actionable strategies for a food system transformation built on ambition, action and partnership. Engagements at the summit will drive towards achieving climate action, promoting innovation, advancing market development, and deriving the right formulas for nutritious diets. In addition, there will be numerous investment opportunities presented by both the private sector and governments, including through the Agribusiness Deal Room, which last year alone registered commitments worth $12.5 billion. I am looking forward to exceptional outcomes from this year's event, including detailed conversations on Africa's response to climate change ahead of the 27th Conference of Parties ( COP27 ), which takes place in Egypt later in the year. I invite you to reconnect and regroup with us, as we define the practical steps needed to transform and advance Africa's food systems at the AGRF 2022 Summit. Dessalegn is the former Prime Minister of Ethiopia, and the current chairman of AGRA and the AGRF Partner's Group \</doc>

More than 50 Greenpeace activists from across Europe on Monday attempted to disrupt the opening ceremony of one of the biggest gas conferences taking place in Milan but met heavy resistance from the police. Gastech 2022, taking place from 5-8 September in Milan, is the single largest global meeting place for natural gas, LNG, hydrogen, and low-carbon energies. Greenpeace Italy protested at the event's entrance by releasing green fumes and sounding alarms illustrating what they said is the fate of humans if oil and gas producers continued burning fossil fuels. 'Attention, please! This is not a drill. The climate emergency is well underway. Please do not believe the misleading advertisements of oil and gas companies. Greenwashing means climate hell,' Greenpeace said in a release. A giant balloon in the shape of planet Earth flew over the area in front of the fair bearing the messages 'Gas is green... washing' and 'End fossil fuels now!' 'Activists also hacked the advertising spaces with dozens of posters revealing what the oil and gas industry tries to hide: a grim reality of pollution, increasingly destructive extreme weather events, and conflicts over control of fossil fuels,' the group said in a release. Read also: Tackling Africa's energy poverty requires gas-driven strategy Federico Spadini, climate campaigner at Greenpeace Italy, said: 'We have brought our peaceful protest to this event because for 50 years it has brought together the companies most responsible for the climate crisis. 'But there is something we can do to put a stop to the influence of polluting companies and the inaction of politicians: ban advertisements and sponsorships of fossil fuel companies, which threaten the right to information and the health of people and the planet.' Gastech conference provides a forum for governments and CEOs to take stock of the evolving energy landscape; assess the state of the industry post-pandemic and navigate a route to a 'just' energy transition whilst managing the current gas supply crisis. The 50th edition of the event will gather Ministers, CEOs, policymakers, business leaders, engineers, innovators, and disruptors. Often timed 2-months ahead of COP-27 , the four-day exhibition and conference will provide a forum for exhibitors, sponsors, and speakers, to showcase to a global audience, their solutions to the challenges faced on the journey to net-zero, the organisers said. Gas companies from around the world including Nigeria's LNG, attend to discuss the latest trends, agree on deals and discuss strategies to lower emissions. However, Greenpeace activists say this is greenwashing after years of denying that burning fossil fuels accelerates climate change. 'When denial became impossible, advertising became a means of greenwashing and distracting the public from the fact that, beyond the fine promises, their main business remains one: extracting and burning fossil fuels,' said Silvia Pastorelli, Greenpeace EU climate and energy campaigner. Greenpeace Italy is calling on European citizens to sign the European Citizens Initiative, a petition that is officially recognised by the European Commission and seeks to allow EU citizens to participate directly in the development of EU policies. It will require one million verified signatures in the timeframe allowed to be legally recognised. \</doc>

Nigeria, Nov. 10 -- Africa's big message at the United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt is that the countries responsible for causing climate change must pay up. A significant acceleration in adaptation finance is needed, considering the UN Environment Programme's estimate that the 2020 target of US$100 billion a year won't be met until 2025 due to rich countries' unkept promises. Better access to international financing is vital, but it's equally important that African governments manage the funds accountably. The recent recurrence of devastating floods in Nigeria, and the country's history of mismanaging its Ecological Fund, highlight the challenge. In 2010, flood waters submerged about 90 000 hectares of farmland and in 2012, floods affected about seven million people. A year later, some 35 000 people were impacted, and in 2018, Nigeria declared a national disaster following severe floods. And since last month, residents in 34 of the country's 36 states have been struggling to cope with massive flooding. The recent disaster displaced more than 1.4 million people, killed over 600, and damaged or destroyed about 440 000 hectares of farmland. The disaster was linked to the release of excess water from the Lagdo Dam in Northern Cameroon, heavy rainfalls, overflow of local rivers, and the impact of climate change. While much has been said about the floods' effects, it's essential to consider how corruption and unaccountable spending of the Ecological Fund contributed to the problem. The Federal Government of Nigeria established the fund to address various ecological challenges in communities across the country. It was created through the Federation Account Act 1981, on the recommendation of the Okigbo Commission, and then modified in 2002. The fund initially constituted 1% of the Federation Account, and in 1992 this was increased to 3%. The aim was to devote a pool of money to projects that would ameliorate serious environmental problems nationwide. The fund now also covers flooding, which is a direct consequence of climate change. Data collated from the monthly Federation Account Allocation Committee reports show that between 2012 and 2021, Nigeria set aside N548 billion for the derivation and ecological funding account. Given that the country is at high risk for graft, sums of this magnitude are vulnerable to misappropriation and fraud - with dire consequences for citizens suffering the impact of climate change. Cases of corruption surrounding the administration of the Ecological Fund have drawn the attention of the National Assembly. House of Representatives members raised concerns that state and federal authorities were diverting ecological funds. In June, a probe was launched into the use of the fund over the past 10 years. After the recent floods, President Muhammadu Buhari questioned public criticism of the Federal Government since state and local authorities had received most of the ecological funds set aside for disaster management. However evidence suggests that corrupt spending of the fund cuts across all three tiers of government. Diversion and graft relating to the Ecological Fund have a long history in the country. The Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative audit report shows how the government's beneficiary agencies diverted or embezzled the fund over the years. In 2013, N2.5 billion was released from the fund to the Nigerian Army to relocate and develop a new barrack. In 2015, N1.47 billion was diverted to Gombe, Nasarawa and Yobe State governments to help cover the cost of damage to public property and places of worship during the 2011 post-election violence. The audit report noted that these expenditures don't qualify as costs that the Ecological Fund was created to support. In 2018, the former governor of Plateau State, Joshua Dariye, was convicted on a 23-count charge including money laundering and diversion of funds to private companies and individuals. This included N1.162 billion from the Ecological Fund meant for the state. In 2021, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission prosecuted Niger State's former governor for money laundering after he withdrew N800 million from the state's N2 billion Ecological Fund. Fraud and corruption will undercut climate change interventions and decrease the scale of adaptation infrastructure. Ecological funds need sound integrity and oversight frameworks to reduce their vulnerability to misuse. First, the National Assembly should intensify the ongoing probes into the use of the Ecological Fund over the past decade. Second, more transparency is needed on the budgeting and spending of the fund. Tolutope Agunloye, a Project Manager at the civic organisation BudgIT, told ISS Today that without citizen engagement, transparency doesn't automatically lead to accountability. Regular public releases of budgetary information can help advocates and civil society ensure that the fund is used to tackle environmental disasters.

Last month, Frans Timmermans, the European Union Commission vice-president and the person in charge of leading its work on the European Green Deal and the European Climate Law, delivered a revealing speech to a delegation of African leaders. Europeans, he said, have their own problems and would not worry about the effects of climate change in Africa. European countries might keep their climate finance pledges, but there are no guarantees. In his words, with inflation and other economic pressures upon Europe, the loyalty of European states lies with their people. He advised African leaders to take the path of clean renewable energy and to seek baseload only when it is green to do so. Although discordant to many in Africa, these words can also be liberating. More and more Africans are showing in small and big ways how uninterested they are in being told what to do, who to stand up for and when to stand up. This justified anti-neocolonial sentiment is also freeing Africans from perpetually waiting for the old colonial master's favour and focusing on what we -- and our leaders -- do for ourselves. But as far as the climate crisis goes, African leaders couldn't be more out of line. In justifying its plans to auction off the forest for oil, the Congolese government said it cares more about its people than gorillas, all the while trying to sell an area greater in size than Ghana. Some gorillas would indeed lose their habitat, but many more people would see their lands grabbed and water sources seized and polluted. In many cases, people would be displaced. This is in line with the intention of many African leaders to use COP27 to encourage more oil and gas activities, a move that will benefit the same neocolonial forces driving the fossil fuel industry, giving big oil and a handful of local elites another boost. Local people will be left with pollution, trashed ecosystems and extreme weather events. With all those fossil fuels being exported, European households may be heated this winter, but it won't do much (if at all) to end our energy poverty and connect 568 million Africans to the grid. The choice those African governments are making, apart from a few important outliers, perpetuates an extractivist colonial legacy, which sees no potential in the brains and the skills of Africans and only ascribes value to what is buried in our soil. It is and will remain a way of servicing the carbon-intensive lifestyle of rich countries while deepening hardship in African communities. We may be troubled by the speech of the EU's senior official and the broken finance promises from Global North countries, but we should be furious about the faith that many African leaders are putting in fossil fuels. I write this with hope, rather than with naivet\'e9. The loyalty of African leaders towards their people seems shaky, and the commitment by rich economies to pay for the loss and damages that their economic growth has created for us is questionable. Yet there is hope in organised communities who are resisting in the face of the climate crisis. It is these communities that are fighting to ensure the East African oil pipeline (a French and Chinese project) never sees the light of day. It is such communities that have told Chinese companies in Lamu, Kenya, that their coal project will not happen in their backyard. It is the same resilience and determination that communities on the Wild Coast of South Africa have shown, sending Shell and its plans for seismic blasting packing. It is ordinary people who are mobilised for justice for people and the planet making a difference, from courts to the streets. They are mobilised to demand clean air and respect for nature. They are changing the rules of the game that the old guard is pushing. They know that it is a neocolonial model of extraction and exploitation that has deepened hardship for many of them. They know that the multibillion-dollar projects are never about them. They know that the neocolonial model of extraction and exploitation is always about growing the profit margin of big multinationals and lining the pockets of elites who have remained in bed with the oppressors. Before the floods, droughts, contaminated water, or toxic air, they know they have no choice but to resist and fight the greed that puts profits before people and the planet. The resilience that African communities continue to show, in defending their lands, protecting the quality of the air they breathe and the decentralised economic gains that come with protecting the riches that nature has given them, is the hope of Africa in the face of the climate crisis.

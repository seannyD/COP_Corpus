India, Nov. 6 -- The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 opened today with the key aim of ensuring full implementation of the Paris Agreement. Discussions at COP27 begin near the end of a year that has seen devastating floods and unprecedented heat waves, severe droughts and formidable storms, all unequivocal signs of the unfolding climate emergency. At the same time, millions of people throughout the world are confronting the impacts of simultaneous crises in energy, food, water and cost of living, aggravated by severe geopolitical conflicts and tensions. COP27 is also taking place against the backdrop of inadequate ambition to curb greenhouse gas emissions. According to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, CO2 emissions need to be cut 45% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels to meet the central Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. This is crucial to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, including more frequent and severe droughts, heatwaves and rainfall. A report published by UN Climate Change ahead of COP27 shows that whilst countries are bending the curve of global greenhouse gas emissions downward, efforts remain insufficient to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Since COP26 in Glasgow, only 29 out of 194 countries came forward with tightened national plans. UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said " " COP27 sets out a new direction for a new era of implementation: where outcomes from the formal and informal process truly begin to come together to drive greater climate progress - and accountability for that progress. COP27 . The first is a transformational shift to implementation of the Paris Agreement and putting negotiations into concrete actions. The Egyptian COP27 Sameh Shoukry, Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs and COP27 President said: COP27 creates a unique opportunity in 2022 for the world to unite, to make multilateralism work by restoring trust and coming together at the highest levels to increase our ambition and action in fighting climate change.

The Honourable Bernard Davis, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, is part of the Canadian delegation attending the 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. COP27 signifies the importance for world leaders to implement and transform key climate related decisions into concrete actions. The conference will focus on raising ambition, building upon the previous Conference of the Parties, including the COP26 outcomes (Glasgow Pact) with an aim to address the climate emergency and promote coordinated action to tackle climate change impacts and reduce emissions. COP27 is focused on four overall goals: mitigation, adaption, finance and collaboration. Tomorrow (November 8), Minister Davis will be a panelist at an event hosted by the Ocean Frontier Institute at Canadas COP27 pavilion. He will speak on the important role our oceans play in the carbon cycle, as well as opportunities to enhance the potential of our oceans as a carbon sink and a carbon capture and storage solution, as they can absorb more carbon from the atmosphere than they release. The Provincial Government is committed to addressing climate change. Our actions include the implementation of a climate change action plan, a new renewable energy action plan, achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, establishing a Net-Zero Advisory Committee and advancing electrification and innovation to further the transition into more renewable energy sources. \</doc>

The United Nations Conference on Climate Change ( COP27 ), taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, until the 18th, should include a group of 12 senators on official mission. The application for participation in the event, which began on the 6th, was approved by the Plenary. In addition to the 12 parliamentarians, the president of the Senate, Rodrigo Pacheco, is also considering a possible trip to Egypt to accompany the discussions, which bring together world leaders around the motto Together for implementation. Participating countries discuss climate adaptation, mitigation of greenhouse gases, climate impact on finance and collaboration to curb global warming. They must also define key aspects for the implementation of the Paris Agreement and provide predictability for climate finance. Although all senators represent the Senate on official business, they do not form a single entourage. Each parliamentarian has different programs at the event. Senator Giordano (MDB-SP), for example, who is already in Sharm el-Sheikh, gave a lecture this Thursday morning (10th), on the importance of efficient treatment of solid waste as a solution against soil degradation. The correct treatment creates new possibilities for economic generation and preservation of the environment he highlighted. As a preparatory event for COP27 , the Senate held a thematic session in September, when it debated the agreements signed at COP26 and Brazils proposals for COP27 . For Senator Fabiano Contarato (PT-ES), one of the parliamentarians attending the conference, the countries continue with the challenge of combating the increase in global temperature and its consequences. He said that environmental management in Brazil has been dismantled in recent years, which has caused the country to regress in this area, ceasing to be a reference in environmental preservation strategies. In the session, Contarato highlighted as an example the harmful effects to the Cerrado biome. A study led by researchers from the University of Braslia UnB points out that the conversion of native Cerrado areas to pastures and agriculture has already made the climate in the region almost 1 C warmer and 10% drier. Not to mention the effects of global climate change, which could make the scenario even worse. Soon we will have COP27 , where we will be able to take, unfortunately, once again, the proof that Brazil is not assuming the commitments for the fight that takes place at an international level in the scenario of climate emergency - he said. President of the Environment Commission (CMA), Senator Jaques Wagner (PT-BA) will also be among the members of the entourage. During the approval of the report on the environmental impacts of illegal occupations in the Amazon in 2022 , in early November, Wagner recalled that Brazil took over, before more than 100 countries, at the United Nations Climate Summit (COP26), held in 2021 in Glasgow , in Scotland, the commitment to eliminate illegal deforestation by 2028 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030, through collective actions to halt and reverse forest loss and soil degradation. He said he was hopeful in relation to the environmental issue in the government of president-elect Luiz Incio Lula da Silva. Senator Eliziane Gama (Cidadania-MA), who will also go to Egypt, highlighted the importance of Brazil reinforcing its commitments to the goals assumed in previous editions of the conference. Brazil, in front of 100 countries, made commitments that are very important, such as zero deforestation and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Now, these goals need, above all, to be met. And to be fulfilled, they need a very energetic action on the part of the federal government, which is responsible for public policy - added the senator. Also participating in COP 27 will be senators Alessandro Vieira (PSDB-SE), Daniella Ribeiro (PSD-PB), Eliane Nogueira (PP-PI), Jean Paul Prates (PT-RN), Srgio Peteco (PSD-AC), Randolfe Rodrigues (Rede-AP), Renan Calheiros (MDB-AL) and Veneziano Vital do Rgo (MDB-PB). \</doc>

Lucknow, Oct. 21 -- The Uttar Pradesh government has been invited to host side events and would be part of the Indian pavilion at COP27 to be held at Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt from November 6 to 18. The theme for India Pavilion at COP 27 is 'LiFE -- Lifestyle for Environment'. The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , more commonly referred to as COP27 , will be the 27th United Nations Climate Change conference . UP's side event will focus on the sub theme 'Road to Resilience 2030: Innovative Approaches for Localising Climate Action at the District and Village Level', where the state government will showcase local climate action efforts and integration of climate concerns into local development planning processes, and India's Action on Afforestation . "UP's side event will address the overall theme of LiFE as it covers low carbon, climate adaptive, collaborative planning, and innovative financial mechanisms at grassroots level to achieve global ambition while adopting a citizen-centric approach," a government spokesman said here on Thursday. The side event will be hosted by the Government of UP in partnership with GIZ India (under CAFRI-MoEFCC project). "Climate change is threatening the achievements of the government's development objective and sustainable development goals at large. While climate change is a global concern, its impacts are felt more at the local level and requires local solutions catering to the needs of local communities by involving local governance institutions," the official said, adding that the localising climate actions further needs technology, finance and capacity for adaptation and mitigation. He said UP had successfully responded to the challenges of climate change via multi-stakeholder engagement, building upon the response to these changes by process of integration, adaptation, collaboration, and mitigation at local levels with the support of researchers, scientists, policymakers and practitioners from the state, India and abroad. "Due to its high reliance on climate sensitive sectors such as agriculture, water and forestry for resources and livelihoods, Uttar Pradesh faces an urgent need for adapting to the risks posed by climate change," said Manoj Singh, Additional Chief Secretary (Environment and Climate Change) of UP government. He said the state had been making significant efforts over the years to bring adaptation issues to the forefront. "As part of its State Action Plan on Climate Change, UP has done a comprehensive assessment on climate risk vulnerability and has prepared a climate vulnerability map of the state," he added. Singh said UP was taking climate action to the grassroots level. "Informed by this vulnerability assessment, the state has now embarked on mainstreaming climate adaptation at the local planning level. In line with the 73rd constitutional amendment, Panchayati Raj institutions and the gram panchayats represent the lowest level of the decentralised governance system," he pointed out. Ashish Tiwari, Secretary (Environment and Climate Change) said that they already had a mandate for the development of gram panchayat development plans (GPDP). "Communities are at the forefront of getting impacted by the changing climate. At the same time, effective community institutions are the first responders to such impacts. Therefore, it is important that their capacities are strengthened. Locally available resources like ecosystem services, schemes and programmes, knowledge and skills are important in such resilient planning," he said. On World Environment Day in June, the UP government hosted the conference of panchayats where the government kick-started a network of panchayats to deliberate on approaches and opportunities to empower panchayats for climate action. "More than 40,000 gram panchayats participated in the conference of panchayats as well as public-private actors," Tiwari said. The objective of the Conference of Panchayats 2022 was to deliberate on strategies that will strengthen capacities of local institutions and actors on emerging climate risks and uncertainties, develop evidence-based local solutions, and implement climate initiatives over the long-term. This supports the guiding principles of the SAPCC and the decentralised government system in India. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Pioneer.

At the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) this week, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack highlighted the U.S. Department of Agricultures initiatives and investments in climate-smart agriculture and forestry, noting that global food security depends upon the ability of farmers and producers worldwide to increase their productivity while strengthening their climate resilience and minimizing their climate impacts. As we face down the dual crises of climate change and food insecurity, USDA recognizes that changes to our agriculture and food systems can only happen at the needed scale and speed if farmers are at the center of our solutions, Vilsack said. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, the United States is making unprecedented investments in innovative approaches to climate change adaptation and mitigation. USDA is proud to play a pivotal role through our new Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities, once-in-a-generation investments through the Inflation Reduction Act, and other initiatives that position American agriculture as a leader in delivering climate solutions through voluntary, incentive-based, market-driven and collaborative approaches. It was an honor to highlight at COP27 the Administrations leadership role, and that of American agriculture, in tackling the climate crisis. \</doc>

India, Dec. 10 -- The 27th edition of the United Nations Climate Change Conference or Conference of the Parties, COP27 , concluded recently at Sharm El-Sheikh and made positive but limited progress. The Egyptian COP27 Presidency has defined the summit's four key goals. With mitigation, all parties, especially those in a position to "lead by example", are urged to take "bold and immediate actions" and to reduce emissions to limit global warming well below 2degC. With adaptation, parties have to ensure that COP27 makes the "crucially needed progress" towards enhancing climate change resilience and assisting the world's most vulnerable communities. The goal of finance called for making significant progress on climate finance, including the delivery of the promised $100 billion per year to assist developing countries. With collaboration, the UN negotiations stuck to the consensus-based approach, as reaching an agreement will require "inclusive and active participation from all stakeholders". Increasing climate risk requires a more strategic and broader approach to incorporate optimisation of consumption. Doing more with less, adopting circular economy principles and removing incentives for inefficient equipment, business models and lifestyles need to be at the forefront and centre of the conversation. Inspiration needs to be drawn from the words of Mahatma Gandhi that "the world has enough for everyone's needs, but not everyone's greed". This applies not only to energy, but also conserving water, building materials, transportation, food and textiles. Definitive progress was made on the long-standing carbon market process, but many operational decisions were postponed for future negotiations. Further, the negotiations remained confined to a relatively narrow agenda on fossil fuels and therefore missed the opportunity to comprehensively address all sources of GHGs. While COP26 focused on mitigation, the highlight of COP27 was creation of the 'Loss and Damage Fund' to support most vulnerable countries impacted severely by climate disasters. Countries in Asia (India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Philippines), Africa (Kenya, Malawi, Chad, Niger), Pacific Islands (Fiji, Tuvalu, Kiribati) and Caribbean Islands (Haiti) are amongst the most vulnerable and impacted. An area of particular attention is the inadequacy of current climate financing models. Global climate finance remains below the third of annual requirements. At COP27 , negotiators deliberated on setting a 'new collective quantified goal on climate finance' in 2024, taking into account the needs and priorities of developing countries. With millions of people in developing nations lacking access to reliable energy and depending on fossil fuels for their energy requirements adds to the carbon emission. Energy access will power the socio-economic aspirations of 2.8 billion people without electricity. For an equitable and inclusive green transition, a scaled-up and integrated approach is required to support the clean energy transition to distributed renewable energy and grid-based renewables and will reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Distributed renewable energy is relevant even for cities since they consume 60-80 per cent of energy and generate 70-75 per cent of GHG emissions. Hence, enabling energy transition will require significant effort in reforming urban planning and infrastructure delivery. Technology convergence across electricity, telecom, and transport present newer opportunities for reducing carbon footprints, improving quality of life, reducing cost, and enhancing long-term sustainability. Underground utility systems, which are gaining global popularity, can be integrated with the master plans. Such an approach will require new regulations and institutional structuring to include energy as a part of urban planning. Thus, a strategic approach to urbanization presents a large opportunity, given a strong positive correlation between per capita income and urbanisation. Last year, the Conference of Parties 26 (COP26) in Glasgow reiterated the global community's ongoing response to the Paris Agreement to tackle the climate crisis while declaring a state of global emergency. The goal to achieve net-zero global emissions by 2050 while keeping the increase in global average temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius in comparison to pre-industrial levels was well-intentioned. COP 27 balanced that with progress on adaptation and the creation of a loss and damage fund. Barbados Climate Envoy called the fund "a small victory for humankind". However, the overall ambition and, more importantly, action on all fronts need to be significantly and urgently scaled to achieve more significant victories in mitigating the global emergency.

At the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ), Sweden and the Netherlands became the latest nations to join the United States and partners in a public commitment to transition their government owned and operated fleets to zero-emission vehicles across all vehicle classes. Countries that have endorsed the Zero-Emission Government Fleet Declaration include: Australia, Canada, Germany, Israel, New Zealand, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States. By signing the Declaration, supporting governments commit to 100 percent zero-emission light-duty vehicle acquisitions for their government owned and operated fleet and aspire towards 100 percent zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty vehicle acquisitions by no later than 2035. Key Highlight:  For its fleet of 600,000 vehicles, the U.S. Federal Government is on track to meet President Biden's goal of 100 percent zero-emission vehicle acquisitions for light duty vehicles by 2027 and for all vehicle classes by 2035. Original Press Release: Nov. 17 -- Clean Energy Ministerial issued the following news release: At the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ), Sweden and the Netherlands became the latest nations to join the United States and partners in a public commitment to transition their government owned and operated fleets to zero-emission vehicles across all vehicle classes. During a COP27 "National governments are often a nation's largest fleet owner. Leading the way by going electric can accelerate an entire country's move toward cleaner transportation," said U.S. Federal Chief Sustainability Officer Andrew Mayock. "This is what climate leadership is all about. I applaud our fellow Zero-Emission Government Fleet nations for stepping up and I am excited to see the results of international collaboration forged through this initiative." Launched by the United States in September 2022 at the Global Clean Energy Action Forum under the Clean Energy Ministerial's Electric Vehicle Initiative, the Zero-Emission Government Fleet Declaration aims to reduce carbon and air pollutant emissions from government fleets and expedite the transition to clean transportation around the world. By signing the Declaration, supporting governments commit to 100 percent zero-emission light-duty vehicle acquisitions for their government owned and operated fleet and aspire towards 100 percent zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty vehicle acquisitions by no later than 2035. By transitioning a large vehicle fleet to a low- or zero-emissions fleet, a country can significantly cut its emissions, spur technological innovations, and drive down product manufacturing costs, which in turn can fuel additional consumer demand for electric vehicles. For its fleet of 600,000 vehicles, the U.S. Federal Government is on track to meet President Biden's goal of 100 percent zero-emission vehicle acquisitions for light duty vehicles by 2027 and for all vehicle classes by 2035.

India recorded "extreme weather events on 241 of 273 days" in the first nine months of the year, according to one study. Representatives from nations around the world are heading towards the concluding phase of the ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ) in Sharm el-Shaikh, Egypt. The conference has witnessed nations participating in discussions that emphasize climate finance, including adaptation and mitigation finance, by bringing the concept of 'loss and damage' into the forefront. The world's biggest emitters - China, the United States, the European Union and India - account for more than half of historical emissions of greenhouse gases. As developing and vulnerable nations like India continue to demand compensation from developed nations for climate-induced damages, we look back at global catastrophes which severely impacted life on Earth during the year. Pakistan floods: The worst in the country's recent history The World Meteorological Department cited a research analysis conducted as part of the World Weather Attribution group and said, "Human-caused climate change likely increased the intense rainfall that flooded large parts of Pakistan." Pakistan recorded 62 per cent less than normal rainfall in the month of March, and the warmest April preceding the monsoon season. Glaciers melted as a result of these heat waves, which led rivers to swell. Access to basic necessities became difficult for 33 million people of Pakistan's 220 million population. Extreme rainfall further triggered the most devastating floods from June to September. Over 1,500 people were killed, with millions being displaced and developing serious health issues such as skin infections, malaria and diarrhoea. A national emergency was declared on August 26, 2022. According to a Reuters report, the overall damages in the nation were estimated at about $30 billion. At COP27 Hurricane Ian in the US: Costliest climate-induced disaster of the year NASA data revealed that warm ocean waters in the Gulf of Mexico powered Hurricane Ian in the US towards the end of September, making it one of the strongest hurricanes to hit the country in recent memory. About 101 lives were lost, and monetary losses worth more than $100 billion, were suffered, according to Reuters. The escalation brought severe floods, relentless rains and strong winds to southwestern Florida. According to a New York Times report, "La Nia", a climate phenomenon, fueled "favorable conditions for hurricanes in the North Atlantic over the past three years." Warmer ocean waters strengthen and sustain such storms, it added. European droughts: Likely to have been the 'worst in 500 years' Europe was struck by two extreme heat waves in June and July. As per a quarterly disaster report published by insurance agency Aon in October, heat waves claimed approximately 16,000 lives. Following the deadly summer heat, many regions of Europe witnessed severe droughts since the beginning of this year, which worsened in the month of August. Water levels in Europe's biggest rivers - Rhine, Po, Loire, and Danube - shrunk, and dry conditions continue to prevail in different parts of the continent. Droughts in Europe made the "Hunger Stones" visible this year. These stones were used to mark desperately low river levels that would forecast famines. This one, in Elbe river, is from 1616 and says: "If you see me, cry" There is no time to wait. ActOnClimate pic.twitter.com/uZ0jOguzXv - Erik Solheim (@ErikSolheim) November 9, 2022 The Global Drought Observatory (GDO) report by the European Commission's research wing, declared 47% of the continent in "warning" conditions, while another 17% remained on alert. In an interview with the BBC, research commissioner Mariya Gabriel said that the heatwave and water shortages have "created an unprecedented stress on water levels in the entire EU." According to a report by World Weather Attribution, "human-induced climate change - especially high temperatures - increased the likelihood of observed soil moisture drought events." But even in the UK, heatwaves and drought pushed trees into their "survival modes," which made them turn into an autumnal shade in August. North America, mainland China and other parts of the Northern Hemisphere also saw extreme heat conditions during the summer of 2022. Spain and Portugal: Driest climate in 1200 years An atmospheric high-pressure system, which causes dry air to descend over subtropical regions in the Northern Hemisphere during winter and spring seasons, called Azores high, has the ability to block wet weather outlets. This caused dry conditions in Iberian peninsula in southwestern Europe, and the Mediterranean region. Spain and Portugal hence faced the driest weather in 1,200 years, along with wildfires. As The Guardian reported, scientists claim that the "most frequent Azores highs could only have been caused by the climate crisis, caused by humanity's carbon emissions." Rainfall in the region is likely to drop by 10-20% by 2100, severely impacting food production. India recorded natural disasters almost every day in 2022 According to a report by Centre for Science and Environment and Down To Earth magazine, India recorded "extreme weather events on 241 of 273 days" in the first nine months of the year. Thunderstorms, persistent rains, cyclones, droughts, heat waves, lightning, floods and landslides occurred all throughout these months. Himachal Pradesh recorded the highest number of deaths (359), followed by Assam and Madhya Pradesh. Overall, these disasters claimed about "2,755 lives, affected 1.8 million hectares (ha) of crop area, destroyed over 416,667 houses and killed close to 70,000 livestock." The CSE report describes these disasters as "the watermark of climate change." Besides these climate events, on the whole, increasing surface temperatures and global warming continue affecting our planet. According to a study by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), this year, the "June-August global land and ocean surface temperature were 1.6 above the 20th-century average of 60.1." Further, August was the sixth-warmest, and October the fourth-warmest, in NOAA's 143-year record. \</doc>

At this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released a comprehensive report on Nuclear Technologies and Climate Adaptation in Africa, describing how these technologies are already being widely used to build resilience on the continent. Africa has contributed very little to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and yet key sectors are already experiencing the damaging consequences of climate change. Over the past ten years, the IAEA has carried out almost 50 per cent of its climate change adaptation projects in Africa, more than in any other continent, aimed at increasing resilience and reducing vulnerabilities in multiple sectors. Key Highlight:  The United Nations has observed that increased temperatures or drought have sharply reduced agricultural productivity growth in Africa in the past six decades and caused regional economic losses of $70 billion in the past 50 years. Original Press Release: Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, Nov. 9 -- International Atomic Energy Agency issued the following news release: At this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released a comprehensive report on Nuclear Technologies and Climate Adaptation in Africa, describing how these technologies are already being widely used to build resilience on the continent. Africa has contributed very little to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and yet key sectors are already experiencing the damaging consequences of climate change. The United Nations has observed that increased temperatures or drought have sharply reduced agricultural productivity growth in Africa in the past six decades and caused regional economic losses of $70 billion in the past 50 years. "In nuclear science and its applications we have the tools to adapt to climate change conditions," said IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi. "The IAEA is at the centre of global efforts to make sure no one is left behind when it comes to benefiting from these indispensable assets." Over the past ten years, the IAEA has carried out almost 50 per cent of its climate change adaptation projects in Africa, more than in any other continent, aimed at increasing resilience and reducing vulnerabilities in multiple sectors. This includes land use management, soil erosion, climate-smart agriculture, food production systems, improved crop varieties, analysis of GHG emissions, water resource management, coastal protection and ocean change monitoring. The report describes various areas of intervention, supported by case studies offering concrete examples of how nuclear science and technology have benefitted Africa. Ocean, food, water: How nuclear technology helps Africa adapt to climate change The report highlights IAEA projects that support countries in Africa in cultivating and exporting food, including growing drought-tolerant crops and applying the sterile insect technique (SIT) to eradicate insect populations, such as tsetse flies, fruit flies and mosquitoes, that harm both human health and the economies. IAEA projects have also strengthened Africa's capacity to collect and analyse data on the quality of water in river basins and the ocean, allowing policymakers to put measures in place for better resource management, including water security in the Sahel and adapting to ocean acidification in coastal areas, which aims to protect the African fishing industry, and thus prevent environmental and social crises. The report emphasises the importance of partnerships in upscaling such projects. COP27 is an opportunity to forge and strengthen partnerships, and to raise awareness in decision making bodies, development organizations and financial institutions of the potential of nuclear science and technology to feature in national strategies, plans and programmes, including agri-food strategies and disaster risk reduction planning. IAEA experts will be available to discuss IAEA climate adaption projects as well as the use of nuclear power, not only for climate change mitigation but as a reliable, secure source of energy with stable costs that can enable the clean energy transition, at the IAEA COP27 pavilion, #Atoms4Climate, which will be open throughout the two-week event, until 18 November.

In advance of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) next month, public development banks meeting in Abidjan agreed on action points to tackle Africa's climate finance gap. The African Development Bank and the European Investment Bank co-organized the summit under the theme; Green and Just Transition for a Sustainable Recovery. It highlighted the role of public development banks in Africa's recovery as the continent faces impacts from the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, and Russia's war in Ukraine. In his closing speech, African Development Bank President Akinwumi Adesina said as Africa looks towards COP27 , development partners should collectively ensure that countries, especially the vulnerable ones in Africa, get the resources to adapt to climate change and support just energy transitions. Key Highlight:  The Bank chief noted that the role of public development banks and public financial institutions, which collectively deploy $2.3 trillion in annual lending per year, is crucial. Original Press Release: In advance of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) next month, public development banks meeting in Abidjan agreed on action points to tackle Africa's climate finance gap. The third Finance in Common summit ended on Thursday amid calls on the delegates to turn their commitments to do more in development financing for Africa into actions. The African Development Bank and the European Investment Bank co-organized the summit under the theme; Green and Just Transition for a Sustainable Recovery. It highlighted the role of public development banks in Africa's recovery as the continent faces impacts from the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, and Russia's war in Ukraine. In his closing speech, African Development Bank President Akinwumi Adesina said as Africa looks towards COP27 , development partners should collectively ensure that countries, especially the vulnerable ones in Africa, get the resources to adapt to climate change and support just energy transitions. "As we leave Abidjan, let us keep our determination strong. The world needs actions, not words. Let us turn our ideas into strong commitments, and let's turn those strong commitments into actions," urged Adesina. The Bank chief noted that the role of public development banks and public financial institutions, which collectively deploy $2.3 trillion in annual lending per year, is crucial. Adesina mentioned plans to launch the Alliance for Green Infrastructure in Africa, saying it would be a 'game-changer' in bridging the investment gap for green infrastructure. Rmy Rioux, CEO of the French development agency, AFD and chair of the Finance in Common executive board, expressed satisfaction with delegates' zeal to move forward with climate mitigation and adaptation in Africa for impact. However, he said, a lot needs to be done. "We demonstrated our collective firepower on climate finance -- but my feeling is that we are only scratching on the surface of what we can do, and to do together against environmental disruptions," Rioux stated. In a summary of the summit's outcome, he said it showcased a shared vision among Finance in Common members in favor of a sustainable investment policy for development. Thomas stros, Vice President of the European Investment Bank, said the three-day summit met its goals. Still, work must continue. "Thanks to this unique forum and the movement it represents - I feel confident that we, as public development banks, are more united than ever and heading in the same direction. The challenges are big, and so is our determination to work together," he said. He said public development banks are in a strong position to deliver a coherent message at the 2022 COP in Egypt. "This allows us to have an even greater impact in efforts to mobilize private sector finance for climate, environmental and social challenges, and for the Sustainable Development Goals." Dr. Hyginus 'Gene' Leon, President of the Caribbean Development Bank, said, "our greatest need is for a multilateralism that assures the equitable distribution of socio-economic benefits to meet diverse needs and a just transition towards development." In a video message, International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva stressed the role of public development banks in accelerating climate adaptation to save millions of lives and reduce the cost of natural disasters. She said: "Public development banks bring vital resources to build resilience to current and future shocks. They also connect the private sector and governments in leveraging concessional resources for sustainable development." There were messages from youth groups calling on delegates to deliver on their climate commitments and the respect for human rights across workplaces. "We would like to see you walk the talk with concrete actions by involving the youth and organizations working on the field," said youth leader Tatiana Houndjo. The 2023 summit will take place in Latin America. [Category: Banking & Finance, Banking, Events, ESG] \</doc>

Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our generation and future generations to come. Under the Paris Agreement, the European Union and its Member States have pledged to become thefirst climate-neutral economy and society by 2050. The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) reminds us to move from targets to climate action as we must work "together for implementation". The EBA is fully committed to delivering on a more resilient and sustainable financial system. Original Press Release: Nov. 9 -- Magyar Nemzeti Bank issued the following news release: Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our generation and future generations to come. Under the Paris Agreement, the European Union and its Member States have pledged to become thefirst climate-neutral economy and society by 2050. The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) reminds us to move from targets to climate action as we must work "together for implementation". Sustainability into the banking sector The EBA is fully committed to delivering on a more resilient and sustainable financial system. As part of the supervisory community, we subscribe to the international consensus that climate-related financial risks are material in the financial sector and need effective management and supervision. Climate resilience, sustainability of finance as well as making finance flows consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement are at the core of the EBA's efforts. Our pilot climate exercise showcased already in 2021 that a large share[1] of banks' exposures under scrutiny were allocated to sectors that might be sensitive to transition risk. We are continuously working towards more sustainability in the banking sector by enhancing market transparency and discipline and by translating sustainability considerations into risk management practices and supervision. Ultimately, the emergence of adequate, risk-based and proportionate rules on sustainable finance will foster banks' orderly transitioning while allowing them to play an important role in financing the net zero transition needs of our society and economies at large. Sustainability into the EBA's work priorities Next milestones of the EBA's work on ESG are to ensure robust management of ESG risks by institutions and adequate supervision, including through running climate stress tests. The EBA will continue to remain involved in the discussion on the prudential treatment of exposures to ESG risks in the financial system. As the market for sustainable finance develops, the EBA also stands ready to assist in the development of standards and labels and to contribute to the scaling up of the sustainable finance market. Sustainability into the EBA's organisation The EBA is fully mobilised to promote sustainable development as an organisation. The EBA is reducing its environmental footprint, in particular by limiting greenhouse emissions and by decreasing its energy consumption. As result of the continuous efforts, the EBA has been awarded the top European standard for its performance. The progress on sustainability objectives are reflected in the EBA annualpublic environmental statement.

India, Nov. 4 -- India hopes the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) at Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt is a meeting of "action", union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said on Thursday. "We expect action on climate finance, technology transfer and capacity building," Yadav said while adding that there have been enough promises by countries but not enough action. The unofficial theme of COP27 is also "implementation". The Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Implementation Summit will take place on November 7-8 when heads of state and governments are expected to speak on implementation of pledges they made in the past and in the Glasgow COP26 last year. Following the summit's inauguration, roundtables will be held to focus on six key topics: Just Transitions, Food Security, Innovative Finance for Climate and Development, Investing in the Future of Energy, Water Security, and Climate Change and the Sustainability of Vulnerable Communities according to COP27 Presidency. Yadav said India's overall approach at COP27 will be to emphasize on the lead it has taken in strong, ambitious and decisive climate actions, its calls for climate justice, and its focus on sustainable lifestyles through the Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE) movement launched by PM Narendra Modi and UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres on October 20. The country will also look for collaborations in technology development in renewable energy and hard to abate sectors and emphasize that climate action can be further accelerated through enhanced climate finance, technology and capacity building support, he added. The critical issues for India are climate finance; mitigation work programme; global goal on adaptation and loss and damage, the minister said. "We are very clear that we want a multilaterally agreed definition of climate finance. India doesn't recognise loans to be climate finance because it pushes vulnerable countries further into indebtedness so the only focus is on concessional and climate specific grants. On climate finance, India expects progress towards the target of mobilisation of $ 100bn/year by developed nations . There should be a decision on a new collective quantified goal (NCQG) on climate finance for the post 2025 period. It needs to specify (i) quantity of long-term finance (in trillions), (ii) quality, (iii) scope, and also for ease of access to finance and with methods of tracking flows of such finance in a transparent manner," Yadav said in a presentation. "When the definition of climate finance has not been arrived at, how is anyone claiming that climate finance is flowing to developing nations?," asked Leena Nandan, secretary, MoEFCC during the briefing. India's updated Nationally Determined contribution (NDC) is a significant contribution towards global climate action, Yadav said. This was announced in August and has two broad quantifiable goals- to reduce emissions intensity of its GDP by 45% by 2030, from the 2005 level and to achieve about 50% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030. India will strongly oppose all attempts to rewrite and redefine the provisions of the Paris Agreement, particularly uniform mitigation goals for all countries irrespective of development status, and call for sectoral or gas-specific mitigation goals, he added in the presentation. "Action on mitigation, must take into account historical responsibilities and different national circumstances of the Parties, as well as the needs for sustainable development in developing countries," he said. In a factsheet released by Centre for Science and Environment on Thursday, climate policy researchers said climate finance is expected to be a major issue at COP 27 . At COP 26 in Glasgow, developed countries noted with "deep regret" that the $100 billion target of climate finance, first determined in 2009, has not been delivered and is expected to be delivered only by 2023. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD's) latest estimate suggests that US $83.3 billion in climate finance was mobilized in 2020, but this has been contested by independent estimates. "Loss and Damage will be big at COP27 because impacts of the climate crisis are severe and frequent now. It is reparations for damages and will establish the polluters pays principle, which will be deterrence over large polluters," said Sunita Narain, director general, CSE during a briefing on Thursday.

Echoing the theme of the United Nations Climate Change Conference this year, which is more commonly referred to as COP27 , "Together for Implementation," New Taipei City joined efforts with Anchor Taiwan, an innovation ecosystem platform, and invited 20 chief sustainability officers to gather together on the final day of the summit on November 18, 2022. New Taipei City Secretary General Yao Ching-yu stated that her experience with diplomacy and international affairs has indicated to her that the charm and energy of cities may sometimes transcend national borders and have more varied influences over the global sustainable practices. She said, "On this year's Earth Day, New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih expressed his commitment to working with businesses to implement environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals. Our city government is the first to offer a platform for corporate ESG initiatives on our bilingual SDGs website, which has facilitated dialogues with the private sector." Key Highlight:  The participating companies were in industries ranging from traditional manufacturing to technology and of types ranging from foreign businesses to hidden champions, with a total market value exceeding NT$2 trillion. Nov. 25 -- New Taipei City Government, R.O.C (Taiwan) issued the following news release: Echoing the theme of the United Nations Climate Change Conference this year, which is more commonly referred to as COP27 , "Together for Implementation," New Taipei City joined efforts with Anchor Taiwan, an innovation ecosystem platform, and invited 20 chief sustainability officers to gather together on the final day of the summit on November 18, 2022. The participating companies were in industries ranging from traditional manufacturing to technology and of types ranging from foreign businesses to hidden champions, with a total market value exceeding NT$2 trillion. These sustainability officers engaged in an afternoon of in-depth cross-industry, cross-regional, and cross-generational exchanges in the form of roundtable discussions and interactive workshops, where they jointly considered the positioning and future of Taiwan's businesses and government within global sustainability. Cities' key role in sustainability New Taipei City Secretary General Yao Ching-yu stated that her experience with diplomacy and international affairs has indicated to her that the charm and energy of cities may sometimes transcend national borders and have more varied influences over the global sustainable practices. She said, "On this year's Earth Day, New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih expressed his commitment to working with businesses to implement environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals. Our city government is the first to offer a platform for corporate ESG initiatives on our bilingual SDGs website, which has facilitated dialogues with the private sector." This event, which was parallel to COP27 , was intended not to be a formal forum; the purpose was to create a space for industry leaders to engage in closed-door talks and launch potential action-oriented partnerships. What type of voice does Taiwan have on the world stage? The host of this event was Anchor Taiwan founder and CEO Elisa Chiu. She stated that Anchor Taiwan has always been dedicated to developing Taiwan's value proposition and international visibility. Regarding the issues of sustainability, in addition to passively responding to the demands of international brands and regulations, Taiwan should consider how it can take on a more active role in promoting and leading sustainability efforts. She said, "For example, Giant has used its position as a leader in the bicycle industry and called on its global supply chain to form the Bicycling Alliance for Sustainability and buy carbon credits for bicycling. This is a great example of active participation." How can businesses join forces with each other and cities for the common good? The representatives at this meeting included holding groups in traditional industries that will soon be 100 years old. A representative reported, "We have to revolutionize ourselves." The representative of a semiconductor business, whose products are common but unnoticed in our daily lives, stated, "ESG goals are the interface through which we communicate with our stakeholders." A representative from the largest one-stop sports equipment retailer in Taiwan said, "Scope 3 accounts for 86% of the carbon emissions from our products. In addition to the supply chain, extending the lifespan of our products is a challenge we're tackling." The representatives also brought an abundance of knowledge from their respective industries, which included software, textiles, electronics, passive components, finance, biomed, electromechanics, furniture, plastics, and construction. After the first round of roundtable introductions, cocreation workshops were held. The industry representatives were asked to engage in group discussions on the topics of "how will they voice for Taiwan if they are to participate next year in COP28," "opportunities for cross-industry collaboration," and "resources and assistance that local governments can provide." Humility is key, and make changes from "yesterday" The representatives, whose backgrounds include human resources, marketing, public relations, and risk control, engaged in discussions on how sustainability can be promoted from the perspectives of climate justice, biodiversity, and climate investment and financing. These representatives stated that more cross-industry collaboration should take place in the future. Of particular note is that women accounted for 80% of the sustainability leaders at this meeting. Sustainable practices are best implemented with effective communication, listening, and coordination. The chief sustainability officer of a company is typically subordinate to only one person but must demonstrate sufficient humility to ensure effective coordination among all departments and thus to identify a collective path forward. "Taiwan is the missing puzzle piece in the global sustainability map." The energy demonstrated this afternoon has inspired the New Taipei City team and the participating business representatives to continue to work together for the benefit of all.

At a meeting at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, MAN Energy Solutions - along with leading organisations across the shipping value-chain and the largest producers of green hydrogen - signed a 'Joint Statement on Green Hydrogen and Green Shipping'. The document commits all signatories to the rapid adoption of green hydrogen-based fuels during the current decade in order to achieve the full decarbonisation by 2050 of the shipping sector, one that currently accounts for 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Key Highlights: Signatories have agreed to pursue cross-sector collaboration to achieve:  commercially-viable, zero-emission, deep-sea vessels from 2030 with the intention of using exclusively zero-emission-powered ocean-freight services by 2040;  the scaling-up of green hydrogen production to 5.5 million tons per year by 2030;  the full decarbonisation of the shipping sector by 2050 at the latest. Original Press Release: At a meeting at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 CEO Uwe Lauber, signed the Joint Statement on behalf of MAN Energy Solutions and said: "Decarbonisation of the marine industry is a mammoth undertaking but, I believe, eminently achievable through cooperation with like-minded industry partners. At MAN Energy Solutions, we believe that hydrogen has a key role to play in getting to net zero and our recent, significant investment in our hydrogen subsidiary, H-TEC SYSTEMS, intends to quickly transform it into a mass-producer of PEM electrolyzers. More than anything, the world needs a massive amount of industrially-scaled, green hydrogen production to build momentum for the broad adoption of hydrogen as a maritime fuel." The Joint Statement was facilitated by Climate Change 'High-Level Champions' - UN nominees that connect governmental work with the voluntary and collaborative initiatives taken by cities, regions, businesses and investors - and nonprofit energy organisation, RMI. Besides MAN Energy Solutions, it was also signed by - among others - the Aspen Institute, the Global Maritime Forum's Getting to Zero Coalition, the Green Hydrogen Catapult, InterContinental Energy, and A.P. Moller - Maersk. Signatories have agreed to pursue cross-sector collaboration to achieve:  commercially-viable, zero-emission, deep-sea vessels from 2030 with the intention of using exclusively zero-emission-powered ocean-freight services by 2040;  the scaling-up of green hydrogen production to 5.5 million tons per year by 2030;  the full decarbonisation of the shipping sector by 2050 at the latest. They also called upon international authorities and national governments to support private-sector commitments with a correspondingly ambitious policy, and specifically asked the International Maritime Organization and member states to commit to a 100% emissions reduction within the maritime sector by 2050 with robust, interim targets.

By Rachael Nath, RNZ Pacific journalist A platform has been dedicated to bolster the Pacific leadership at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties - COP27 . Known as the Moana Blue Pacific Pavilion, the Fono or council aims to faciliate talanoa, or conversation, and knowledge-sharing on issues important to the Pacific, especially advocacy for ambitious climate action and the need for financing. More than 70 side events will be hosted at the Pavilion, providing a platform for Pacific people to tell their stories. Another space, the Pacific Delegation Office, has been set up for hosting meetings with partners and strategising negotiation approaches. New Zealand Climate Change Ambassador Kay Harrison said the platforms were a key part of ensuring the Pacific's voice was heard and considered. The two platforms are part of a Pacific partnership with New Zealand managed by the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP). Meanwhile, Tonga Meteorological Services Deputy Director Laitia Fifita said his department was attending the conference to share data on Tonga's climate, which had seen the appearance of four devastating cyclones over the last decade. "Not only is our director attending this meeting but also the head of government, and the King and Queen are also attending. "So it's a nationwide approach, taking relevant issues about the impacts of climate change on small island developing states including Tonga." COP27 kicks off this weekend in Sham El Sheikh, Egypt, with an estimated 45,000 people expected to attend. However, climate experts are not holding their breath for major breakthroughs at the annual conference, with some concerns rich countries will be missing in action. In one of the most iconic images relating to COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, Tuvalu Foreign Minister Simon Kofe spoke in knee-deep water to show rising seawater levels.

November 17 -- The UN Environment Program (UNEP) announced a new initiative at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ), the Nature for Cool Cities Challenge, which incentivises cities to use the cooling power of nature. The Nature for Cool Cities Challenge is a joint effort under the framework of the UNEP-led Cool Coalition. SEforALL, WWF, Mission Innovation, RMI, WRI, the University of Oxford, Durham University and other Cool Coalition members joined forces to set up this challenge. \~ By 2100, cities around the world could warm by four degrees Celsius on average, exposing the growing urban population to conditions that will damage human health, productivity, and quality of life. Cities are on the frontlines, dealing daily with the impacts of climate change. Solutions exist to cool the cities sustainably. The cities can turn to nature to reduce local temperatures and increase the resilience of their citizens. Nature-based solutions such as forests, green belts and parks in and around cities can deliver cooling services, without damaging emissions. \~ The cooling benefits of such solutions are well-documented, but they need to be better understood and leveraged to increase implementation and bring about change at a global level. "We have come to COP27 at a time of global crisis, but these crises are a reason to increase our climate ambition, not reduce it. The Challenge's goal - scaling up nature-based solutions to tackle climate change impacts in cities - is an important one," said WWF Global Lead for Climate and Energy, Manuel Pulgar-Vidal. "Cities play a key role in avoiding the most severe impacts of global warming and it is important that we champion ambitious and sustainable efforts to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change." \~ Municipalities, groups of municipalities, or regional governments will pledge to increase the number of high-quality nature-based cooling solutions by 2030, with demonstrable progress by 2025. They will have to agree on a quantitative and funding target for local spending, and at least three implementation actions to back their pledges. "In a warming world, cities have a critical role to play in achieving SDG 7, delivering sustainable cooling, and meeting the climate crisis. We urge them to embrace nature as a tool to cool their cities and pledge to scale up nature-based solutions by joining this challenge," said Sherry Kennedy, Director of Communications at SEforALL. "The Nature for Cool Cities Challenge will help us demonstrate the power of urban nature to adapt to the effects of extreme heat, avoid emissions, and reduce energy demand." In an effort to harness the power of nature for cooling in the Global South, the Cool Coalition partners convening the challenge will provide incubation support for a cohort of cities in low and lower-middle income countries that require assistance in defining their ambition. For the award winners, matching finance for implementation of their pledges will be provided, based on the value of investment committed, tiered by the income level of the country, alongside technical assistance, support for the development of partnerships and matchmaking. "To make peace with nature, we need to rebuild our cities with nature in mind," said Sheila Aggarwal-Khan, Director of UNEP's Economy Division. "But truly replicable nature-based solutions require partnership between local governments, the private sector, experts, and practitioners. It is decisive that financial institutions, investors, and businesses step up and help make this vision a reality." The Nature for Cool Cities Challenge will demonstrate urban nature-based solutions' ability to reduce the urban heat island effect, avoid emissions, and lower energy demand. One year from now, at COP 28, the Cool Coalition will showcase challenge participants, their pledges, and donor contributions that are helping cities deliver on their pledges. \</doc>

India, Nov. 8 -- British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Monday made a dramatic exit from an ongoing session of the COP27 summit by his aides. leaving people confused as to what had happened. A video of the incident was shared by director of UK-based website Carbon Brief - Leo Hickman. "UK prime minister Rishi Sunak has just been rushed out of the room by his aides during the middle of the launch for forests partnership at COP27 ," he tweeted. An aide had come onto the stage, according to Hickman, and whispered in Sunak's ear "for more than a minute", what seemed like a discussion of whether he should be leaving at the moment. At first, the UK Prime Minister did not leave the stage but when another aide came up to him to persuade again, he got out of the chair and left the room. Harry Cole, political editor at The Sun, later shared the video on his Twitter handle and said the Downing Street sources told him that it was "no biggie", just a late decision. "Downing Street sources insist this was no biggie but a late decision to meet with Germans and South Africans. Despite the imagery...," Cole said. There was no official statement from Downing Street on the video. The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 - was inaugurated in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh on Sunday. In his first international appearance since becoming the PM, Sunak said that the war was a reason to act faster in decisions tackling climate change. "We can bequeath our children a greener planet and a more prosperous future... There really is room for hope," he said. Sunak called on nations to honour the promises made in Glasgow Impact Pact and direct public and private finance towards the protection of the planet. The UK Prime Minister is also slated to hold several meetings with his fellow world leaders to discuss new partnerships on energy security, green technology and other environment-related policies.

It is the time of the year when, for two weeks, climate change takes global centerstage. The annual United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), beginning Sunday, is being held in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Shaikh amid fresh reminders that the window for meeting climate goals is closing fast. Latest assessments suggest that current action plans of countries to meet climate goals are falling woefully short. And yet, no major win is expected at the conference, as, amid a deepening energy crisis and prevailing economic gloom, there is little appetite among countries to scale up climate action. For a realistic chance to keep global warming within 1.5 degree Celsius, annual emissions would need to drop from the current level of about 50 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent to about 33 billion tonnes by 2030 and 8 billion tonnes by 2050, according to the newest Emissions Gap Report. Even for meeting the 2-degree target, emissions have to come down to about 41 billion tonnes by 2030 and 20 billion tonnes by 2050. This would require drastic action from all the major emitters, and looks unlikely right now. In the last one year, just about 25 countries have strengthened their 2030 climate action plans, with minimal potential to bend the emission curve. Impact of Ukraine War The energy and economic crisis caused by the Ukraine war is threatening to undo even the small gains made. Already, the consumption of fossil fuels has gone up. Countries have begun to secure more and more of traditional fossil fuels to deal with the uncertainty in the energy markets. The impact of the war - which shows no signs of ending - is likely to be felt for a long time, slowing down progress on climate action by several years. Dim expectations from Sharm el-Shaikh Though there would be usual calls for the need to urgently scale up climate action, the Sharm el-Shaikh meeting is unlikely to deliver anything concrete. Many countries, including India, had increased their climate pledges at the Glasgow meeting last year, and it would be unrealistic to expect them to do more this time. The impact of the war in Ukraine is likely to dominate the discussions in Egypt. Occurrence of frequent climate disasters - like the historic flooding in Pakistan - is expected to result in renewed demands for a loss and damage framework, through which affected countries can seek compensation for the damages caused by extreme events. \</doc>

Cairo, Nov. 8 -- A 16-year-old Hyderabadi boy Ankith Suhas Rao is representingIndiaat the 27th session of the Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt. COP27 , which began in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt on Sunday, November 6 and will continue until Friday, November 18. Ankith Suhas Rao, a class 10 student of Hyderabad Public School, Begumpet, is part of an elite group of five students (one each from North America, Egypt, India, Africa and the Philippines)- who have been selected to speak on behalf of youth at the summit. At the COP27 Ankith, who aspires to be a climate scientist, told News18, "We have taken it upon ourselves to tell people that climate change is happening and that it's happening very fast." As per media reports, Ankith said he was very happy to represent India at COP27 . "It's a great and wonderful educational opportunity. This will give me a broad exposure where I will be able to connect and influence other students to work on solutions to climate issues and contribute to building a better, safer and more sustainable world," he added. Rao is not the first student from the institution to attend a UN summit. At COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, Pavan Trishu Kumar was chosen to deliver a statement on behalf of students from 54 countries. Ankith, as part of this opportunity, will also be at the United Nations Climate Change Conference of Youth (COY17). In the 10-day programme, he will get a chance to interact with world leaders and other like-minded people. The United Nations Climate Conference COP27 , which will continue until November 18, kicked off in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on Sunday. The conference, which brings together leaders and representatives from nearly 200 countries, aims to clarify the rules of the new global climate compact, and aspires to take action on a range of climate issues, including- urgently reducing greenhouse emissions, building resilience, adapting to the inevitable effects of climate change and fulfilling climate action financing commitments from developed countries to developing countries. The beginning of such conferences dates back to 1992 when world leaders met in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro in what was known as the Earth Summit, which aimed to discuss climate issues and come up with an international plan of action to deal with environmental issues. The Earth Summit was also held to mark the 20th anniversary of what may be the first meeting of humans to discuss climate issues, in the Swedish capital, Stockholm, in 1972. The Rio de Janeiro summit was the first seed for the launch of the Conference of Parties (COP) on climate change, and it has been held annually since that time, leading to the 27th edition that was launched this year in Sharm El Sheikh, Sinai Peninsula, Egypt.

The biggest takeaway of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) that ended in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on Sunday was the agreement to create a 'Loss and Damage' fund for developing countries and those hit hard by climate disasters. This was the most significant outcome of the meet which disappointed on many other fronts. However, there was no clarity on the logistics of the funding as the EU and the US resisted all attempts to create a separate corpus. It was agreed to set up a transitional committee to work out the nitty gritty of the funding arrangement. Its recommendations are to be presented at COP28 next year, but there is every likelihood that the actual funding will take years to materialise. The agreement came after days of hectic wrangling with the conference extending for nearly two days beyond the scheduled close to thrash out a consensus draft. It was a victory for those nations hardest hit by climate change despite not being among the polluters as they do not have significant greenhouse gas emissions. Pakistani delegates, who cited the recent devastating floods in their country that killed over a thousand people, made an impactful presentation to reiterate the demand for such funding. The L&D fund will apply to those countries where the impact of climate change cannot be avoided either by mitigation (i.e. cutting greenhouse gas emissions) or adaptation (adopting practices to tackle climate change). The demand for such a fund, which has been 30 years in the making, was initiated by small island nations most at risk to the impacts of climate change. The fund will provide not only for economic damage to property but also cover loss of livelihoods, and the destruction of biodiversity and sites with cultural importance. This broadens the scope for affected nations to claim compensation. However, apart from this landmark agreement COP27 had nothing much to show. At COP26 in Glasgow it was agreed to phase out coal and the hope was that COP27 would take this pledge forward. India and other developing countries' proposal to phase out all fossil fuels did not make it to the final agreement. There was also disappointment that the agreement left out the call for peaking of emissions before 2025 so that temperatures do not rise above 1.5 degrees C from pre-industrial levels. The transition to green energy was not forcefully dealt with. The text of the agreement okaying low emissions fuel was seen as a loophole for use of gas, which though less polluting is still a fossil fuel. At Glasgow last year Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared that India would cut its emissions to net zero or become carbon neutral by 2070. India is the world's fourth biggest emitter of carbon dioxide after China, the US and the EU and Mr Modi's pledge to get 50% of India's energy from renewable resources by 2030 and reduce total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes was seen as significant and a pointer to real climate action. The Paris climate meet in 2015 was a landmark one but its promises remain unfulfilled. COP27 like other climate summits was marked by squabbling and frenzied discussions between the developed and developing nations, highlighting the familiar divide that has prevented any tangible action on the climate front. The need for urgent steps to tackle the menace of climate change is highlighted at every stage but as long as economics trumps the attempt to save the planet, there will be no discernible change. That rich countries have not expressed any real intent to reduce their carbon footprint is apparent from the reluctance to commit to carbon neutral goals. There is much more to be done on the climate front if future generations are to survive the impact of global warming. It is, therefore, incumbent upon nations, rich and poor, to work towards the goals of combating global climate change. COP27 delivered on one front, it is now imperative for leaders to work together to meet their lofty targets on emissions and temperature. COP28 will be held in the United Arab Emirates in 2023. What better venue to pledge climate goals than the oil-rich Gulf kingdom? \</doc>

The Caribbean is sounding a rallying call to the rest of the world to change how it finances climate action, including by taking gender into account when financing climate investments. "Today is remarkable because our region is courageous enough to call for a reset of the development financing agenda to address the needs of our most vulnerable. We offer new solutions for this. Let us rally as SIDs at COP27 to make development and private equity financing more inclusive, sustainable, and resilient," urged Vice-President of Operations at the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), Isaac Solomon. He was speaking on Thursday, November 10 at 'Gender Lens Investing for Caribbean Resilience'. "The Climate Policy Institute estimated that fewer than 5% of private, public, and blended climate finance was gender-responsive in 2020. The data shows that globally and regionally, gender-responsive and socially inclusive climate finance is still too low [yet] gender-smart and socially inclusive public and private climate investing is a game-changer," said the CDB Vice-President. Original Press Release: Nov. 14 -- Caribbean Development Bank issued the following news release: The Caribbean is sounding a rallying call to the rest of the world to change how it finances climate action, including by taking gender into account when financing climate investments. "Today is remarkable because our region is courageous enough to call for a reset of the development financing agenda to address the needs of our most vulnerable. We offer new solutions for this. Let us rally as SIDs at COP27 to make development and private equity financing more inclusive, sustainable, and resilient," urged Vice-President of Operations at the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), Isaac Solomon. He was speaking on Thursday, November 10 at 'Gender Lens Investing for Caribbean Resilience'. The panel discussion, coordinated by CDB and UN Women Multi-Country Office Caribbean, was held in the CARICOM Pavilion at COP 27 , the United Nations ' climate change conference currently underway in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Solomon stressed that as of now, the proportion of gender inclusive climate finance is not nearly where it needs to be. "The Climate Policy Institute estimated that fewer than 5% of private, public, and blended climate finance was gender-responsive in 2020. The data shows that globally and regionally, gender-responsive and socially inclusive climate finance is still too low [yet] gender-smart and socially inclusive public and private climate investing is a game-changer," said the CDB Vice-President. The reasons why this is needed were highlighted by Trinidad and Tobago's Minister of Planning and Development, Hon. Pennelope Beckles, who pointed to the disproportionate impact of climate change on the Caribbean region and the nexus between that and lingering gender inequality. "If you think about the aftermath of any hurricane in the Caribbean, women are a lot more impacted than men. They are the ones [expected] to do the cleaning and cooking when there might be no clean water, they have to protect families when shelter might be an issue and they themselves are in a vulnerable position and then they may also face challenges with matters we might not necessarily want to discuss, like hygiene and menstrual health," stated Beckles. She emphasised that these are key factors which must be considered and should be incorporated at the very outset when financing climate resilience investments. Anita Bhatia, Assistant Secretary-General, and Deputy Executive Director of UN Women elaborated on this point, emphasising that incorporating gender would ensure climate investments will actually be sustainable and long-lasting. "The way investments stand the test of time is to not only be commercially viable, but it must be inclusive, it must deliver social impact at scale and that means reaching the most vulnerable in a meaningful way," said b. Panellists also pointed out that there are compelling benefits of gender lens investing. Doug Hewson, Managing Director of Portland Private Equity (PPE), which manages multimillion dollar investment funds across the Caribbean, noted that while his asset management firm was made up of "financially motivated investors... we have a completely diverse general partner team because diversity leads to better decisions." Eminent trade specialist and former Executive Director of the International Trade Centre, Patricia Francis, who moderated the panel, underscored the value of gender inclusion in finance, saying: "If finance doesn't have gender lens, it won't be sustainable or successful. We have to look at all aspects of a project or an operation to ensure gender inclusion. This is not only the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do." Ensuring that gender lens climate investment can be powerful and impactful, also involves developing it in the right way and with the right framework, a point made by Sumayyah Cargill, Strategic Development Manager of the Bahamas Development Bank. "Without a robust system of local financing agencies, the pipeline to development financing is very slow, it's very random and very inefficient," she said. "Regional and national development finance institutions have a very important role to play and tremendous influence in how that financial ecosystem is actually structured," added Cargill.

Solaria has participated today, within the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), in the event organised by the Real Instituto Elcano and the London School of Economics & Political Science under the title "Climate governance towards net zero and resilience: strengthening cooperation between Latin America and Spain in the current context". At this event, which took place in the Spanish Pavilion, David Redoli, Solaria's Institutional Relations Coordinator, stated the need to place renewable energies at the centre of the strategic reconstruction of the European Union. The objectives of the founding treaties of the EU envisaged securing energy supply and achieving price stability and competitiveness. Key Highlights:  Solaria also stressed the need for a new, specific and mandatory regulatory framework to speed up the deployment of solar photovoltaic plants, which is essential to achieve 70% of the EU's energy being renewable by 2030.  In this sense, Redoli pointed out that we must succeed with the revision of the European Renewable Energy Directive and the European Commission's Proposal to establish a new framework to effectively accelerate the deployment of renewable energy in the 27 Member States. Original Press Release: Nov. 17 -- Solaria issued the following news release: Solaria has participated today, within the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), in the event organised by the Real Instituto Elcano and the London School of Economics & Political Science under the title "Climate governance towards net zero and resilience: strengthening cooperation between Latin America and Spain in the current context". At this event, which took place in the Spanish Pavilion, David Redoli, Solaria's Institutional Relations Coordinator, stated the need to place renewable energies at the centre of the strategic reconstruction of the European Union. The objectives of the founding treaties of the EU envisaged securing energy supply and achieving price stability and competitiveness. And there is no doubt that renewable energies make it possible to achieve these objectives today, while also helping to combat inflation. "We must never forget that the European Union was built on the foundations of energy. Today, it will be energy, once again, that will recast the European Union. And we will do so thanks to renewable energy," said David Redoli. Accelerating the energy transition Solaria, aware of its role as a benchmark company in the energy transition, has defended that the ecological transition must be accelerated, through a rapid and massive deployment of technologies such as photovoltaic solar energy. Renewable energies, and in particular solar photovoltaic energy, bring with them an essential triad: decarbonising our economies, electrifying our societies and increasing energy efficiency. In this sense, photovoltaic solar energy is undoubtedly the cornerstone of three major challenges we face as a society:  The fight against global warming  The need to achieve energy sovereignty for all nations, which translates into national security (avoiding dependence on foreign fuels).  The need to achieve cheap electricity prices Solaria also stressed the need for a new, specific and mandatory regulatory framework to speed up the deployment of solar photovoltaic plants, which is essential to achieve 70% of the EU's energy being renewable by 2030. In this sense, Redoli pointed out that we must succeed with the revision of the European Renewable Energy Directive and the European Commission's Proposal to establish a new framework to effectively accelerate the deployment of renewable energy in the 27 Member States. Social acceptance The Solaria representative underlined that developers of solar photovoltaic parks should bear in mind that only plants determined by sustainability and with limited environmental impact will be acceptable. Solar photovoltaic energy can be a driving force for rural development, as it helps to fix the population in areas affected by the demographic challenge, by creating local jobs (direct and indirect) in the different stages of the life cycle of each project (development, construction, operation and maintenance). And, in addition, because it generates wealth in the municipalities near the plants (both through the payment of taxes derived from their activity and the reactivation of nearby economies). "It is in our hands to promote a rapid and massive deployment of renewable energies throughout Europe, so that they become our main energy supply and, consequently, the basis of our progress, the progress of fairer, more prosperous, more sustainable, less polluting and, above all, freer, more autonomous and environmentally friendly societies", said David Redoli.

As the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) winds up, Canada is urging the international community to continue collaborating to address the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity loss. Today, during Biodiversity Day COP27 , the Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, announced that Canada is investing up to $855,000 to ensure that not-for-profit environmental groups and Indigenous partners can fully participate in the United Nations Biodiversity Conference (COP15), taking place in Montral from December 719, 2022. Over fifty groups will receive the funding, which is being coordinated by the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, to support their participation in the lead up to the Nature COP and facilitate many important events that will be accessible to the general public. The announcement comes as the Minister has been actively engaged in a number of high-profile events at COP27 dealing with nature and biodiversity, including a Canadian co-hosted ministerial meeting, Biodiversity Action (MoBA) at COP27 | A Final Push on the Road to COP15, attended by representatives from over twenty-five countries. Minister Guilbeault has also been conducting many bilateral meetings with partner countries with the message that conserving nature and halting the alarming biodiversity loss are fundamental in mitigating and adapting to climate change. Canada is taking a strong leadership role, along with international partners, in championing the development of an ambitious framework with clear targets and actions that also recognize the important role Indigenous peoples and communities play in conservation and biodiversity. Delegates from 196 countries are expected to gather in Montral for COP15. Canada continues to make progress on the goal toward thirty percent by 2030, having launched the largest conservation campaign in the countrys history, backed by multi-billion dollar investments in Budget 2018 and Budget 2021, available to the provinces and territories. Canada has also committed to ensuring that at least twenty percent of its $5.3 billion climate finance commitment supports projects that leverage nature-based climate solutions and contribute biodiversity co-benefits in developing countries over the next five years. Quotes Climate and nature are two sides of the same coin. The call to protect nature must receive the same attention as does the climate. Coming out of COP27 , Canada is excited to welcome the world to Montral for the Nature COP to come together and land commitments that will protect the natural environment that sustains us all. We are going to ensure the full participation of civil society groups, environmental groups, and Indigenous partners at COP15, because we know the importance of their work and their voices. Ive been able to rally support from many countries at a number of events at COP27 , with the hopes of an ambitious global framework to protect biodiversity to come out of Montral. For Canadas part, were driving progress to reach our commitment of protecting thirty percent of our land and thirty percent of our oceans by 2030. To get there, we have launched the greatest conservation campaign in the countrys history, fueled by multi-billion dollar investments available to the provinces and territories.

President Herzog: In a region undergoing accelerated desertification, Israel has the capability and know-how to deflect severe water shortages and to offer solutions to food insecurity. We are eager to share all our expertise and practical tools: that is what a Renewable Middle East is all about. President Isaac Herzog addressed the 27th United Nations Climate Change conference at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Following is the full text of his speech: COP27 . I thank the President of the Arab Republic of Egypt His Excellency Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and his government for hosting us here in beautiful Sharm el-Sheikh. As neighboring nations, Israel and Egypt are both fortunate to call this beautiful regionthe Middle Eastour home. However, this home we all love is also a global hotspot for climate change. With studies forecasting imminent, severe consequences for our region, the Middle East is on the brink of catastrophe. Here in Sharm el-Sheikh I wish to reiterate the State of Israels solid commitment, as relayed last year in Glasgow, to achieving net zero carbon emissions and to transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy by 2050. But Israel is prepared to assume far greater responsibility. Israel is prepared to lead the effort towards regional climate resilience. I intend to spearhead the development of what I term a Renewable Middle Easta regional ecosystem of sustainable peace. I envision that in the foreseeable future the solar energy produced in the deserts of the Middle East will be available for export to Europe, Asia, and Africa. For example, Israel and Greece are already working on electricity connectors to supply green electricity from Israel to Europe. I believe that the entire Middle East, all Middle Eastern nations, abundant with sun and technology, will have the ability to connect the rest of the world to a magnificent source of renewable energy. In a region undergoing accelerated desertification, Israel also has the capability and know-how to deflect severe water shortages and to offer solutions to food insecurity. We are eager to share all our expertise and practical tools: that is what a Renewable Middle East is all about. I invite you all to visit our beautiful pavilion here at COP27 and see some of these brilliant ideas for yourselves. Friends, this crisis threatens the very existence of the future we wish for our children. It transcends politics and geographic marginsand so must we. I say to all nations at COP27 and particularly to our neighbors, near and far: this state of emergency demands we work together. Not tomorrow: today. Let us turn the climate emergency into an opportunity to address twentieth-century conflicts, thereby advancing desperately needed twenty-first-century collaborations. Let us leverage vital regional partnerships as a path towards inclusivity, stability and prosperity, to form this shared, Renewable Middle East. The Prosperity Green and Prosperity Blue partnership, reflecting Jordan's intention to supply Israel with green electricity, and Israels intention to supply Jordan with desalinated water, with the direct involvement and support of the United States of America and the United Arab Emirates, is the ultimate example of creative, win-win-win partnerships, which will contribute to the stability of the entire region. In the spirit of our hosts in the region, I would like to teach from the Quran, which teaches us to be good to others, as Allah has been good to us, and to not seek to corrupt the land. And as our Holy Bible says, God settled man in the Garden of Eden, to till it and tend it. Let us save the world God gave us, for we have all been created in His image. \</doc>

October 25 -- Ahead of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP27 , in Egypt in November, the African Development Bank and the Global Center on Adaptation participated in a series of events at the Africa Climate Week to build consensus among African countries and stakeholders.\~ COP27 is described as Africa's COP and will significantly shape the future. To deliver on adaptation, a transformative adaptation agenda is needed now. Titled 'Adaptation Dialogue: Implementing the Vision,' the session called for strengthening collaboration on adaptation across the continent. The speakers highlighted the progress made by the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP) so far, notably its contribution to narrowing the adaptation gap and accelerating the implementation of the Africa Adaptation Initiative (AAI). The AAI represents Africa's bold and innovative step to galvanize the support needed to significantly scale up adaptation across the continent. Speaking on behalf of Dr. Kevin Kariuki, Vice President, Power, Energy, Climate Change and Green Growth, Al-Hamndou Dorsouma, Acting Director of Climate Change & Green Growth Department at the African Development Bank, underscored the urgent need for accelerated adaptation action. Dorsouma called for accelerated action against climate change while making rapid, deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to avoid a mounting loss of life, biodiversity, and infrastructure. He noted that progress on adaptation has been uneven so far, with increasing gaps between action taken and what is needed to deal with the increasing risks. Prof. Anthony Nyong, Senior Director and Africa Regional Director at the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA), highlighted the need to improve climate resilience and adaptation in Africa. He estimated the cost of climate change at $579 billion by 2030, with global finance skewed towards mitigation. Only 7.2% of global finance goes to climate adaptation. Tanguy Gahouma-Bekale, Special Advisor to the President of the Gabonese Republic and the Permanent Secretary of the National Climate Council, endorsed the AAAP as a primary vehicle for implementing the Africa Adaptation Initiative's mandate.\~ The program seeks to mobilize $25 billion to accelerate climate change adaptation actions across Africa. The AAAP is an Africa-owned and Africa-led response to the continent's expressed needs and priorities to reduce its vulnerabilities to climate change and harness the opportunities that result from climate change. Since its launch in April 2021, the AAAP upstream financing facility, managed by GCA, has enabled mainstreaming adaptation into investments worth over $3 billion. \</doc>

The 2022 edition of the WTOs World Trade Report presents new analysis and recommendations on how international trade and greater cooperation can amplify global efforts to address climate change and put the planet on a sustainable trajectory. The WTOs flagship publication, released on 7 November at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, also examines the consequences of climate change on trading patterns and future prosperity. This report is being launched at the same time as COP27 . What I hope to see emerge there and elsewhere is a trade and investment facilitation pathway in support of a just transition to a low-carbon economy, Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who is participating in the climate summit, said in her foreword to the report. The report argues that trade is a force for good for climate and part of the solution for achieving a low-carbon, resilient and just transition, she said. The Director-General will present the report at a high-level event for world leaders at COP27 on 8 November titled Time to Act: Implementing Trade-Related Contributions to the Global Response to Climate Change. The report conveys four main messages: first, climate change is a major threat to future growth and prosperity due to potential productivity losses, production shortages, damaged transport infrastructure and supply chain disruptions. Furthermore, without significant reductions in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, many countries are likely to find their comparative advantages changing, with agriculture, tourism and some manufacturing sectors particularly vulnerable to climate impacts. Second, trade is a force multiplier for countries adaptation efforts in the face of climate disruptions, reducing costs of technologies and critical goods and services. In the longer-run, open international markets would help countries achieve necessary economic adjustment and resource reallocation. This is particularly relevant for the most vulnerable economies least-developed countries, small-island developing states and landlocked developing countries. Third, trade can reduce the cost of mitigating climate change by supporting the reduction or prevention of GHG emissions and speed up the transition to a low-carbon economy and the creation of green jobs. WTO simulations presented in the report suggest that eliminating tariffs and reducing non-tariff measures on a subset of energy-related environmental goods could boost exports by 5 per cent by 2030, while the resulting increases in energy efficiency and renewable uptake would reduce global emissions by 0.6 per cent. Finally, the report emphasizes that international cooperation on trade-related aspects of climate policy is vital for making climate actions more effective, and the low-carbon transition more just, minimizing trade frictions and investor uncertainty. The report shows that, without global cooperation on ambitious climate policies, the world will not achieve the Paris Agreements goal of limiting the global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius. \</doc>

HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Vice Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, MD&CEO of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, Chairman of the World Green Economy Organization (WGEO) highlighted in a keynote today how the organization is driving effective measures and dialogues on climate action at the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ), held from November 6 to 18, 2022, at Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Co-hosted by the Global Compact Networks (GCN) UAE and Egypt, the session titled Accelerating Net-Zero Commitments, featured a series of multistakeholder dialogues addressing Egypt and UAEs climate agendas. Al Tayer furthermore emphasised key and expected outcomes of the COPs, how the summit accelerates climate action and private sector engagement with emission reductions, and how capacity building and knowledge sharing can scale up corporate commitments to science-based emissions reduction targets aligned with the 1.5? pathway through the UN Global Compact Climate Ambition Accelerator Program. WGEO strives to better educate stakeholders of the effective measures required to achieve the collective net-zero goals. Ayman Ismail, Chairman for the GCN Egypt, delivered the session's opening remarks. Other prominent attendees also included HE Ahmed Buti Al Muhairbi, Secretary-General of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, Waleed Salman, Vice Chairman for WGEO and Chairman for the GCN UAE, Abdulrahim Sultan, Director-General of WGEO, along with CEOs of leading firms engaged in climate action. Al Tayer said in his speech: COP 27 is a key platform that allows global stakeholders to have their voices heard. It also provides a forum for global cooperation and joint action to come up with game-changing and emissions-cutting measures that the climate crisis so desperately demands by creating practical opportunities for a sustainable economic growth and promoting holistic multilateral cooperation. The participation of the policy makers, corporate sector, and experts in COPs plays an important role in shaping the global climate agenda and accelerating progress on the delivery of the Paris agreement through negotiations, capacity building, knowledge sharing and partnerships. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region plays a pivotal role in the effective implementation of climate action. Holding COP 27 in Egypt, and COP 28 in the United Arab Emirates next year would provide the impetus to accelerate action against Climate change. To further spearhead the transition towards a green economy, the UAE Cabinet, Chaired by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, approved the UAE to join the Global Alliance for Green Economy, announced by the World Green Economy Organization (WGEO) during the World Green Economy Summit in Dubai 2022 to play a pivotal role in promoting climate action, food security and climate resilient development. The organization called for supporting this global alliance to accelerate the transition towards a green economy, achieve the goals of sustainable development and the implementation of the Paris Agreement by harnessing financing, technology, capacity building, and other factors that contribute to enabling the green economy. In support of the UAEs leadership in addressing climate change and the global climate agenda, the World Green Economy Organization (WGEO) has established many strategic partnerships and initiatives aiming at holistically addressing unprecedented challenges relating to climate change, including the hosting of the UNFCCC-WGEO Regional Collaboration Centre for MENA and South Asia. Moreover, WGEO received the Observer Member accreditation from the UNFCCC at COP26, Al Tayer added. The UAE supports the global efforts aimed at addressing climate change by offering effective solutions to support low-carbon local sectors, implementing pioneering projects that support its future strategies and aspirations and building a successful model for a new green economy that can attain economic sustainability while preserving the environment for current and future generations. In line with the vision and directives of our wise leadership, the UAE has launched the UAE Net Zero strategic initiative 2050, the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050, and the Dubai Net Zero Carbon Emissions Strategy 2050. These strategies aim to achieve net zero emissions and provide 100% of the total power production capacity from clean energy sources by 2050.Furthermore, in 2022, the first ever MENA Week was hosted by the UAE Government, represented by the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE), the World Green Economy Organization (WGEO), and Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), in collaboration with the UNFCCC, and accelerated the momentum towards COP 27 , Al Tayer said. These feats are not possible without the active participation of all stakeholders. The latest climate policy landscape and the UAEs nomination to host key climate dialogues provide the private sector with significant opportunities to reshape the way they operate and transform the way we do business. As we look forward to creating a better future for us and next generations, I would like to welcome global leaders and the corporate sector to be a part of this journey and promote successful green economic solutions that meet current and future economic and environmental needs, including achieving net-zero goals. On behalf of the World Green Economy Organization (WGEO), I would like to assert that we will continue to support the great efforts to foster this net zero transition and facilitate the collaboration between governments, the private sector, and the international community through our various initiatives, Al Tayer concluded. \</doc>

A new United Nations report on Climate Change published on 26th October , reports that, although countries are bending the curve of global greenhouse gas emissions downward, these efforts remain insufficient to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. The current food and energy crisis and its global impact is also a stark reminder of the fragile nature of the current energy and food system, which are still dominated by fossil fuels. The Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders is a community representing over 120 global CEOs in 26 countries and 12 industries, all committed to delivering corporate climate action in line with the Paris Agreement. Key Highlight:  As a multinational business, IKEA is committed to the Paris Agreement and to contribute to limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Original Press Release: A new United Nations report on Climate Change published on 26th October , reports that, although countries are bending the curve of global greenhouse gas emissions downward, these efforts remain insufficient to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. The current food and energy crisis and its global impact is also a stark reminder of the fragile nature of the current energy and food system, which are still dominated by fossil fuels. Ahead of COP27 United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 there is a chance to make this a historic turning point towards a cleaner, more affordable, and secure energy and food system accelerating the just transition towards net zero. In an open letter published and distributed on November 4th , the Alliance has called on peers in the private sector to set science-based targets in line with the Paris Agreement, with a clear roadmap that takes sector-specific pathways into account Collaborating within and across sectors and value chains to drive transparency, advocacy and action in alliances and initiatives while working with major industry and trade associations to advance alignment with the Paris Agreement Contributing to the development of internationally harmonized reporting standards. In this context and with world leaders meeting at COP27 and the G20 in November, the letter also calls on governments to set bold ambitions and follow through on commitments and deliver on the promise in the COP26 Glasgow Climate Pact . In addition, it asks to accelerate the green transition, for example by simplifying regulations, speeding up permitting processes and p rovide incentives including policies for emerging renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies on both the supply and the demand side. The Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders is a community representing over 120 global CEOs in 26 countries and 12 industries, all committed to delivering corporate climate action in line with the Paris Agreement. The Alliance aims to reduce one gigaton of emissions - equivalent to the size of Japan's annual emission output and is the only CEO-led community in the world aiming to drive change spanning the entire supply chain. "The latest United Nations climate report was clear; more governments need to set new goals and make deeper cuts to limit temperature rises to 1.5C. In Glasgow at COP26, there was positive movement which we applaud, but it's not yet enough", says Jesper Brodin, CEO, Ingka Group and co-chair of the WEF CEO Climate Leaders Alliance. Jesper Brodin "We need to come together and collaborate to do more. Ambitious goals, policies and investments in line with the Paris Agreement will accelerate action to reach net zero. This is the most important decade and we have it in our hands to change the course of climate change," he says. The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , more commonly referred to as COP27 , will be held from 6 to 18 November 2022 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. At COP27 climate action will be in the spotlight. It will have considerable attention and bring together the influential leaders in climate action from business, governments, and the climate community. As a multinational business, IKEA is committed to the Paris Agreement and to contribute to limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. This includes a commitment to become climate positive by 2030[], through reducing more greenhouse gas emissions than the total IKEA value chain emits, while growing the business and a commitment to reach net-zero by 2050 at the latest. IKEA believes that, together with partners, it can use its size and reach to play a role in accelerating climate action by influence and working together with governments and the private sector. As the largest IKEA retailer, Ingka Group through CEO Jesper Brodin, will be attending COP27 and taking part in several engagements and bilateral meetings during the conference, including a High-Level Roundtable on just transition with 20 Heads of State and other highest-level stakeholders, World Economic Forum (WEF) CEO Young Leader Dialogue on credible climate action, WEF plenary session moving from pledges to action, and a panel on driving action in the built environment. WEF CEO Alliance Members will be in person in Egypt during COP27 to discuss with world leaders, government officials and representatives of the NGO community how, together they can take positive action in tackling the climate crisis. About WEF: The World Economic Forum is the International Organization for Public-Private Cooperation. The Forum engages the foremost political, business, cultural and other leaders of society to shape global, regional and industry agendas. It was established in 1971 as a not-for-profit foundation and is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. It is independent, impartial and not tied to any special interests. Footnote: [] IKEA is committed to the Paris Agreement and to contribute to limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. This includes a commitment to halve the absolute net GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions from the total IKEA value chain by 2030. We will achieve this by drastically reducing GHG emissions through science-based targets and by removing carbon from the atmosphere through natural processes and storing it in land, plants and products through better forest and agriculture management within the IKEA value chain. We will contribute to further greenhouse emission reductions in society by going beyond IKEA, such as enabling customers to generate renewable energy at home.

During his speech, Mr Cassis stated that this year's edition must not be the one to abandon the 1.5C target. The conferences aim is to promote implementation of the Paris climate agreement. During his speech at the summit, which was opened on 7 November 2022 and attended by around 100 heads of state and government, Mr Cassis strongly emphasised the fact that climate change remains one of the greatest challenges of our time. Mr Cassis, who is also head of the FDFA, went on to state that "climate change has left a particularly devastating legacy this year" in reference to the floods in Pakistan as well as heatwaves and droughts in several parts of the world. He added that Switzerland would therefore continue to maintain its climate targets, despite the current energy crisis. Switzerland is committed to halving its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and to achieving climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest. Mr Cassis also lent his support to the ambitious commitments of the COP27 agenda, which includes a clear and concrete timetable for all states to divest from fossil fuels. In addition, he made a clear commitment to a work programme aimed at advancing climate policies in different countries and to strengthening climate adaptation, development and humanitarian efforts at the global level. Responding to needs in developing countries To meet the Paris climate agreement targets, COP27 Switzerland acknowledges the serious adaptation needs facing these countries, as well as the need to support them in mitigating and addressing the increasing loss and damage related to climate change. Against this backdrop, over the next four years Switzerland will, subject to parliamentary approval, contribute CHF 155,4 million to the Global Environment Facility, CHF 11,8 million to the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) and CHF 16 million to the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) in order to meet the target of doubling financing for adaptation. Both of these funds prioritise climate adaptation measures in LCDs and SIDS. Switzerland will also contribute an additional CHF 8 million to the World Bank's Disaster Risk Insurance and Financing (DRFI) programme to help strengthen the resilience of its partner states, as well as CHF 4 million to the CREWS initiative, which provides a funding mechanism to address the needs of LDCs and SIDS. This sum is in addition to Switzerland's current CHF 9 million contribution for developing early warning systems for all. Bilateral meetings on conference margins Mr Cassis signed a bilateral climate agreement with Morocco's Minister for Energy Transition and Sustainable Development Leila Benali on the margins of the conference. He also participated in a round table on food security. At COP27 The second week of COP27 will see environment ministers meeting to discuss issues at a high political level. Federal Councillor Simonetta Sommaruga, head of the Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications, will represent Switzerland at the meeting. COP27 will continue until 18 November. \</doc>

New Delhi, Nov. 22 -- The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) focused on implementing existing pledges rather than adopting stricter global emissions reduction targets, Moody's said in a report on Tuesday. "Aside from a broadly worded agreement to establish a loss and damage fund for poor countries most vulnerable to climate change, there was a lack of new major pledges," it said. According to the credit rating agency, the initiatives announced at the climate summit to make progress on existing commitments will increase carbon transition risk for certain highly exposed sectors. Mobilizing climate finance for emerging markets, such as through loss and damage financing and ramping up investment in adaptation and resilience measures, also took center stage. Without significant and effective adaptation, emerging market sovereigns will face significant economic and fiscal losses stemming from climate change. The ultimate credit impact of the announcements made at the summit will be determined by how and when policymakers and market participants translate them into action. Although participating countries had committed to revisiting their emissions reduction pledges after last year's UN climate summit (COP26), only five countries - Australia, Norway, Singapore, United Arab Emirates and Thailand - strengthened their targets in advance of this year's conference. The summit's final cover text also excluded a commitment to phasing out all fossil fuels. "As a result, global commitments remain well short of what will be needed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Given the large gap between existing commitments and stated policies, any meaningful progress on pledges will increase credit pressures on sectors and entities with high inherent exposure to carbon transition risk," Moody's said. For example, implementation of the Global Methane Pledge to reduce methane missions by 30% by 2030, is likely to raise compliance and operating costs for oil and gas companies. Similarly, the US and Norway's launch during COP27 of a Green Shipping Challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the shipping industry could increase policy and market risks for companies in the sector. "At the same time, a number of new initiatives could help accelerate technological innovation and reduce decarbonization costs for companies in high-emitting sectors. For example, the First Movers coalition announced $12 billion in purchase commitments by 2030 to help create early markets for low-carbon technologies across eight hard-to-abate sectors, such as cement and steel," the report said. "These efforts complement public sector initiatives under the so-called Breakthrough Agenda, through which governments representing more than 70% of global GDP have agreed to make low-carbon technologies, such as hydrogen, more affordable," it added. Meanwhile, 86 asset managers announced new initial targets under the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, increasing the total number of asset managers with net zero targets to 291, representing more than $66 trillion in assets under management. As more financial institutions and nonfinancial companies start to implement net zero targets, companies with high exposure to transition risks that do not lay out credible targets and transition plans will risk seeing their cost of capital rise and demand for goods and services fall. This trend could accelerate as disclosure requirements take effect in major jurisdictions and data availability improves, Moody's said. Coalitions focusing on data availability, transparency and accessibility continued to drive efforts at COP27 to improve and standardize disclosures. For example, the UN-backed service provider body Future of Sustainable Data Alliance released a report identifying data points most critical to corporate and sovereign sustainability disclosure and analysis, it said.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Through the partnership, the two parties agreed to exchange knowledge and collaborate on initiatives to accelerate widespread renewable energy adoption to mitigate climate change. Mr. Francesco La Camera, Director-General of IRENA, and Mr. Abdalah Mokssit, IPCC Secretary, met at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh to sign the MoU. We have all the tools we need to address the growing climate challenge, said IRENA Director-General Francesco La Camera. The reliability and resilience of renewables in the face of mounting global crises should serve as clear motivating factors for governments to double down on the energy transition and accelerate renewable energy deployment. Clean energy is abundant, but time is not. IRENAs knowledge strongly builds on the valuable scientific work of the IPCC. I look forward to our continued close cooperation. With current commitments, we are not on track to limit warming to 1.5C. But, with rapid and deeper emissions cuts through 2030, we can keep this goal within reach, said Abdallah Mokssit, the Secretary of IPCC. Costs for some forms of renewable energy have fallen, use of renewables continues to rise and, in some countries and regions, electricity systems are already predominantly powered by renewables. Were confident this partnership will strategically contribute to the much-needed transformational change and to a faster and sweeping transition to renewables. According to IRENAs World Energy Transitions Outlook, avoiding the catastrophic consequences of 1.5C global warmings requires a fundamental change in how energy is generated and consumed. Renewables are the most readily-available and cost-effective way to provide 90 per cent of all decarbonization by 2050, but this requires tripling of currently installed renewable power capacity by 2030. Progress will depend on political will, well-targeted investments, and a mix of technologies, accompanied by policy packages to put them in place and optimize their economic and social impact. The signed MoU provides a framework for IRENA and IPCC to enhance understanding of the scientific basis of the risk of human-induced climate change, its potential impacts, and options for adaptation and mitigation. The two organizations will also work together to promote the widespread and increased adoption and sustainable use of all forms of renewable energy through dialogues, expert meetings, and workshops in coordination with the relevant IPCC Working Groups/Task Force Bureau. \</doc>

Former Irish president Mary Robinson headlined a panel discussion to mark Gender Day at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt. She called for a bespoke climate fund to support grassroots women to tackle climate change and build resilience. The African Development Bank organized the session held during COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh under the theme, Gender Sensitive and climate just finance mechanisms. The panelists said facilities tailored to supporting women, who are helping to build climate resilience, must be visible, simple, and easily accessible. There is a problem about the visibility, transparency and accountability, and although there is some money floating around, we dont have a properly dedicated climate fund or a permanent climate fund to support women entrepreneurs in combating climate change, Robinson said. Robinson gave the example of some women-led projects in Uganda which could do ten times more if they had access to targeted climate resources. They had no prospects of getting the money that could be available for their sector they didnt even know who was getting the money or where it was going. Opening the session, African Development Bank Group Vice President Vice for Power, Energy, Climate and Green Growth, Kevin Kariuki, said the Bank had earmarked funding for ten capacity-building projects, focusing on gender and climate through the Africa Climate Change Fund. Moreover, we are committing $100 million in loans to public and private sector projects to address gender and climate issues, Kariuki said. The Bank is also developing an adaptation mechanism to enable individuals and groups, including women and youth, to borrow money for climate adaptation projects, he added. The African Development Bank hosted other side events to mark Gender Day at the COP27 to highlight the successes, challenges and issues surrounding gender equality and climate change. They included the launch of the Gender in Climate Action Accelerator, a tool to support private sector companies improve the gender responsiveness of their corporate climate governance. The Accelerator will support governments in promoting gender-sensitive climate sector policies, accelerating their green transition to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. It is a joint initiative by the Egyptian government, the African Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the French Development Agency, AFD. At a session opened by Kenyas First Lady Rachel Ruto, experts agreed that as the efforts for greener economies grow, the focus should be on upskilling and reskilling to help women and girls to access green jobs. The panel, titled Enabling and Tracking Gender-responsive Green Jobs Recovery, also highlighted access to information for women and strengthening gender-responsive capacity building. The Bank also held a session on Accelerating gender-responsive climate investment for a resilient Sahel, which discussed good practices to ramp up gender-responsive climate finance in the Sahel. In his remarks, Al Hamndou Dorsouma, Acting Director of Climate Change and Green Growth at the African Development Bank called for a more equitable distribution of climate resources in the Sahel. Sidi Mohamed EL Wavi, Director of Climate and Green Economy at the Ministry of Environment in Mauritania, underscored the importance of eliminating barriers to quality education for women to enhance their representation at all levels. \</doc>

CHIMEI Corporation joined Singapore's global carbon exchange Climate Impact X (CIX) in April this year, becoming one of the few Taiwanese enterprises to join the international carbon trading market. Recently, CHIMEI was introduced by CIX to participate in a promotional activity of the Natural Climate Solutions Alliance (NCSA), which is convened by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). CHIMEI was the only Asian manufacturer to be invited to this promotional activity, which is promoted on the WBCSD's website and social media (LinkedIn and Twitter) and will also be promoted at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in November. Original Press Release: Nov. 18 -- CHIMEI Corporationissued the following news release: CHIMEI Corporation joined Singapore's global carbon exchange Climate Impact X (CIX) in April this year, becoming one of the few Taiwanese enterprises to join the international carbon trading market. In June, CHIMEI became the first Taiwanese enterprise to complete carbon credits transaction and offsetting on the CIX. Recently, CHIMEI was introduced by CIX to participate in a promotional activity of the Natural Climate Solutions Alliance (NCSA), which is convened by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). Bayer, SAP, Unilever, as well as CHIMEI, were among the nine "NCS Leaders" recruited from around the world by the NCSA to produce a series of 2-3 minutes videos in which the company CEO or Chief Sustainability Officer promotes the principles of NCS and outlines the benefits of supporting NCS projects: produce carbon reduction, facilitate the protection of biodiversity, and create opportunities for local communities. CHIMEI was the only Asian manufacturer to be invited to this promotional activity, which is promoted on the WBCSD's website and social media (LinkedIn and Twitter) and will also be promoted at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in November. The hope is to take this opportunity to further raise global NCS awareness, thereby jointly achieving carbon reductions and the green vision at the social level. CHIMEI is expected to propose short-term (2030) and long-term (2050) carbon reduction roadmaps for the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) by the end of 2022. The SBTi also encourages corporations to invest in carbon reduction solutions outside their value chains, including high-quality carbon credits, to contribute to societal net-zero.

For agrifood systems to adapt to climate change and become more sustainable, improving the quality and quantity of climate finance contributions to the sector is critical that was the main message at the launch of the Food and Agriculture for Sustainable Transformation Initiative (FAST) held at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm-El Sheikh, Egypt. The United Nations Climate talks are being hosted by Egypt this year and FAST was developed and initiated by the Egyptian Presidency in close collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and other stakeholders. FAST comes at a time when the risk of hunger and malnutrition among the most vulnerable groups is getting worse and the worlds agrifood systems are increasingly impacted by climate variability and extreme weather events. Agrifood systems also contribute to the climate crisis, ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss. But the funding to transform agrifood systems to make them more sustainable, resilient and productive is grossly inadequate, and that is what this initiative hopes to address. Access to climate finance at both farm and country levels remains insufficient and FAST aims to implement concrete actions to correct this to transform agriculture and food systems by 2030 while supporting food and economic security and the environment. Speaking at the event, FAO Deputy Director-General Maria Helena Semedo, pointed out that while overall climate finance flows have been increasing over the past decade, the share allocated to agriculture has been steadily decreasing. The agriculture and land use sector received $122 billion in financing between 2000 and 2018, representing 26 percent of the global climate finance flows to all sectors. That is why bold transformative actions are now needed to boost investment in agrifood transformation, support countries in accessing climate finance, and ensure that appropriate financial resources reach small and medium-scale food producers, Semedo said. FAST aims to make this possible by enhancing country capacities to identify and access climate finance and investment, giving stakeholders greater access to knowledge and developing guidelines and providing support in crafting appropriate climate action policies. Promoting food security and diversity, empowering and engaging women, youth, Indigenous Peoples and people in vulnerable situations, using science and innovation to improve agricultural practices across the value chains - these are some of the principles that will guide FASTs work. This partnership will rely on and harness the efforts started by previous initiatives such as the Glasgow breakthrough and will be nurtured by future (COP) Presidencies. Agriculture is higher than ever on the COP agenda, and FAO is committed to support all actors in their efforts to transform our agrifood systems to become more efficient, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable, Semedo said. The summit is being held at a time when estimates show that the world is falling behind on the goal of reducing emissions by 45 percent by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. FAST is one of the key initiatives that FAO is a part of at COP27 . The organization will use its expertise and experience to lead several discussions on how agrifood systems can be part of the solution to the climate crisis and how food security can be achieved. \</doc>

As the United Nations climate change conference - COP27 - winds down, countries, industries, multilateral organisations and non-profits will all analyse whether it delivered on their hopes. Disappointment and frustration are likely to dominate the headlines. Yet, while those are justifiable sentiments, the conclave in Egypt also offered a glimpse of what is possible if countries do come together to address shared concerns. The short answer: it can help defend the planet against climate change while also providing a platform to minimise other tensions between nations. Two examples stand out from the climate conference. After the United States of America made clear it would not back the Global South's demand for a mechanism to cover costs of loss and damage because of climate change, African nations took matters into their own hands. They announced a $14 billion African Climate Risk Facility, recognising that despite the myriad regional and pan-African differences that divide them - and have, far too often, led to conflict - they are bound by common challenges that, ultimately, no one else will fix. Separately, Brazil, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo - home to the planet's most vital lungs - came together to ink a pact to protect rainforests. These efforts hold valuable lessons for the Indian subcontinent and its neighbourhood as well as for the world's biggest powers. A poor monsoon, in any year, is almost certain to ravage the agricultural sectors of both India and Pakistan. Droughts and floods know no national boundaries or gun-mounted border checkposts. As the frequency of extreme weather events increases in South Asia, it is vital for New Delhi and Islamabad to work together - closely - in trying to mitigate the worst effects of global warming on their shared landscape. National security concerns are the prime reason why theneighbours are barely talking to each other - at least formally. But increasingly, countries around the world are recognising that there is no bigger national security threat than climate change, which is devastating nations and economies. India and Pakistan must shed their traditionally limited threat perceptions and urgently acknowledge that the survival of both will need them to work together. And, indeed, that could open up pathways to broader political dialogue on other differences. After all, even the US and China, sworn rivals for global supremacy, have now agreed to relaunch climate talks. Unless the world's two biggest polluters work together, the planet has no chance of containing emissions. If their conversation on climate change also helps Washington and Beijing manage their other differences and prevent their competition from exploding into a conflict, it can only be good for the world. And if the gains from their talks remain limited to the climate, it is still a positive. That mindset is one that South Asia desperately needs as well. Any chance to pull humankind back from the brink must be explored. There is no time to waste. \</doc>

Ahead of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , commonly referred to as COP27 , the Centre is reaching out to states to encourage them to devise stronger climate action plans. This comes with India aiming to become a net-zero economy by 2070. COP27 will be held in Egypt from November 6 to 18. As the government prepares for it, the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) is hosting a two-day conference of state environment ministers in Ekta Nagar, Gujarat, starting September 23. This would include eliminating plastic pollution through a multi-pronged approach and 'State Action Plans' to effectively combat climate change with a focus on LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment), which is part of India's nationally determined commitments (NDC) submitted to the UN. Emphasis on expanding the forest cover while protecting species and restoring degraded land is also on the agenda. During HYPERLINK COP26 in Glasgow last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 2070 deadline to achieve HYPERLINK https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/cop26-india-will-reach-net-zero-emissions-by-2070-says-pm-modi-121110101628_1.html net-zero carbon emissions India has committed to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 45 per cent by 2030 - up from the 2005 level of 30 per cent. State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCC) are already in place in 33 states and Union Territories, according to a Lok Sabha reply in 2022. But only a few states have started implementing them. In March 2022, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation announced the Mumbai Climate Action Plan (MCAP), which aims to make Mumbai a net-zero city by 2050. However, the corporation has not yet constituted a climate cell, as mandated by the MCAP. To achieve the ambitious target, the central government is reaching out to states to motivate them to adopt: efficient and cleaner technologies; renewable energy; e-mobility; better waste management methods; climate-resilient infrastructure; sustainable urbanisation, and so on. According to environment officials in the ministry, the last such conference was held in 2015. MoEFCC also hopes to bring states on board on environment matters through policies and programmes clearance, coordination and by way of overseeing implementation through its single-window PARIVESH portal. Among other things, the Centre intends to push for tree promotion on a mission mode outside of forests. The national goal is to bring one-third of the area under forest and tree cover. In its NDC, India has put forth a target of creating an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent by increasing forest and tree cover by 2030. \</doc>

November 14 -- Technology cannot remain confined to big players and MSMEs and start-ups need to be enabled to access finance for using it optimally, Environment Secretary Leena Nandan said today. She was speaking at a panel discussion on "Technology Needs Assessment for Sustainable Life" at the India Pavilion at COP 27 to identify technology needs and their assessment for adoption for sustainable wellbeing of global citizens in future. Nandan said what India and the world need today is technology. "Climate change is not an issue confined to those who are seen as emitters. There is now a realisation and larger and uniform understanding that climate change cannot be wished away. It is knocking at our door," she said. Powered By \~ Nandan added that discussions need to now focus on bridging the gaps between what we want to achieve and how to achieve it. "Technology cannot remain confined to big players due to their access to finance. MSMEs and start-ups need to be enabled to access finance to use technology optimally," she said. India will release its Long-term Low Emissions and Development Strategies (LTLEDS) at COP27 on Monday. Environment Minister Bhupendra Yadav, who is due to return for the second week of negotiations at COP27 by Monday, will release the document, according to officials.\~\~ \~ \</doc>

The European Investment Bank (EIB) Group will convey the urgency of mobilising massive resources for global warming mitigation and adaptation at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, from 6 to 18 November 2022. The EU bank will affirm its unwavering commitment to deploying its full range of financial tools in support of the swift decarbonisation of our economies. The EIB Group (European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund) will launch new initiatives under its Climate Bank Roadmap, supporting a just transition to climate neutrality globally, and a framework to promote environmental sustainability. In addition, the EIB will team up with partners to announce new green financing projects and initiatives. EIB President Werner Hoyer commented: Russias war against Ukraine is a catastrophic human tragedy. It has also exposed the worlds vulnerability and dependence on fossil fuels. Decarbonisation has now become a prerequisite not just for saving the planet from climate disaster, but also for energy security and safeguarding cohesion at a global level. This is why our response to the crisis must focus on renewables, energy efficiency, and innovative technologies that will power sectors such as heavy industry, shipping and aviation. I therefore call on the COP27 conference to put partnerships to support new technologies at the centre of its discussions. The EIB stands ready to work with all our partners to finance the green solutions of the future. EIB Vice-President Ambroise Fayolle added: To meet the Paris goals we must halve global emissions by 2030. To do so, we must get climate finance right and make sure we support those countries and communities that find it hardest to make the green transition a success. At COP27 , the EIB will report progress on the implementation of its Climate Bank Roadmap and launch new initiatives to support environmental sustainability. Through our dedicated arm for operations outside the European Union, EIB Global, we are stepping up our efforts to support green energy projects globally, with a special focus on Africa. EIB Vice-President Gelsomina Vigliotti said: We have worked closely with Egypt as the incoming COP27 Presidency to deliver a successful outcome of the United Nations climate conference in Sharm El Sheikh. The EIB has worked with Egypt since 1979. We will continue our partnership to support the countrys ambitious National Climate Change Strategy 2050, including investments in energy, transportation, agriculture and water resources. The EIB boosts clean energy financing in support of REPowerEU Plan The EIB Group will support the European Commission REPowerEU Plan with an additional 30 billion in loans and equity financing over the next five years. The additional funds from the EIB Group will be directed to renewables, energy efficiency, grids and storage, electric-vehicle charging infrastructure, and breakthrough technologies, such as low-carbon hydrogen. The package of new, targeted financing approved by the EIBs Board of Directors on 26 October is expected to mobilise up to 115 billion of new investment by 2027, thus making a substantial contribution to the REPowerEU objective of ending dependency on Russian fossil fuels. It is a supplementary envelope, on top of the EIB Groups already robust support for the energy sector in the European Union, averaging around 10 billion of financing per year over the past decade. Just transition everywhere The EIB pledges to expand its range of financing tools for projects aimed at supporting a just transition to a climate-neutral economy across the world. At COP27 , the EIB will release a statement to offer financing and advisory services in regions that combine carbon-intensive production with socioeconomic fragility. Moreover, in the context of a just resilience strategy, the EIB will pledge to support adaptation actions explicitly addressing the needs of population groups most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Environment framework At COP27 , the EIB will launch its environment framework to support environmental sustainability projects globally, thereby pursuing a green, resilient, equitable and inclusive development approach. The EIB will support operations helping to reduce pollution and protecting health and human well-being, the sustainable use and protection of water resources, and the development of a sustainable blue economy protecting marine and coastal resources. The EIB will also help speed up the shift towards a more circular world and increase its contribution to supporting the reversal of the global trend of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. Accelerating gender-smart climate finance The full participation of women as leaders, employees, entrepreneurs and consumers is essential for climate finance to be effective and tackle the climate crisis at the speed and scale necessary. The EIB, together with its partners, will at COP27 call for urgent action to improve gender equality in climate finance. On gender day, 14 November, the EIB will co-host a high-level event with the Council of Europe Development Bank and Hivos to discuss avenues for accelerating gender-smart climate investments, from enhancing access to quality green jobs and leadership opportunities for women to developing inclusive low-carbon infrastructure. \</doc>

December 12 -- The 2022 African Economic Conference (AEC) opened today in the island nation of Mauritius with a strong call for Africa to adopt smart technologies to tackle what speakers described as 'the looming climate change threat' to the continent. "Supporting climate-smart development in Africa is extremely pertinent. Climate change is a looming threat to Africa. The continent is the most vulnerable region to climate disasters," Pravind Kumar Jugnauth, Prime Minister of Mauritius said at the conference opening. Prime Minister Jugnauth stressed how the rise in petroleum prices caused by Russia's war in Ukraine war should quicken Africa's motivation to shift away from fossil fuels and become self-sufficient in electricity production. "In order to face the challenges of climate change more effectively Africa needs the support and assistance of development partners," he added. The largest pan-African economic meeting is being held under the theme "supporting climate-smart development in Africa." It is bringing together various stakeholders- policymakers, climate experts, the private sector, researchers, and youth-to discuss and draft an action plan to support the low-carbon and climate-resilient development of Africa.\~ In a speech read by Acting Chief Economist and Vice-President, Prof. Kevin Urama, the African Development Bank President Dr. Akinwumi Adesina underscored the urgency of Africa adapting to climate change. "Africa is suffering from the devastating effects of climate change, from droughts, floods, irregular rainfall, locusts, and armyworms, he said. "Supporting climate-smart, environmentally friendly development is one step in the right direction," he said. Estimates show that Africa suffers $7-15 billion per year in GDP losses to climate change, which are projected to rise to $45-50 billion per year by 2040. During COP27 , the African Development Bank and its partners launched the Alliance for Green Infrastructure in Africa to speed up the development of green infrastructure in Africa. In her remarks, Assistant Administrator and Director of the Regional Bureau for Africa at the United Nations Development Program, Ahunna Eziakonwa, emphasized that Africa's path to attaining Sustainable Development Goals must be\~climate smart. "In 2022, we have seen a climate emergency hitting with increasing intensity. At the same time, climate-change-induced drought is precipitating hunger and even famine in regions such as the Horn of Africa," she added. "Protecting the planet cannot be an option, it is an urgent priority." Speaking on the recently concluded United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP 27 COP27 Ahunna told participants about a new partnership between the Global Environment Facility, the United Nations Development Programme, the African Development Bank, and the Rocky Mountain Institute. Together they will support new solar battery mini-grid markets in 21 countries in Africa. Deputy Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, Dr. Hanan Morsy observed that the theme of this year's conference provides the opportunities to digest and synthesize the discussions at COP 27 and propose recommendations for supporting climate-smart development in Africa. \~"Africa needs to close huge development gaps by investing substantially in key sectors such as energy, agriculture, transport, water, and cities, among others. These sectors are all very vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change," Morsy said. ECA is working with partners to support the development of just energy transition plans in many African countries, tapping the continent's abundant clean energy resources. It is also working with African Export-Import Bank, the Africa Finance Cooperation, the African Development Bank, and other partners to leverage the African Continental Free Trade Area to use Africa's abundant clean energy resources to transform the continent's minerals. \~ The idea is to "support regional and global value chains related to the global drive for net zero emissions," Morsy said. The African Economic Conference is jointly hosted by the African Development Bank, the Economic Commission for Africa, and the United Nations Development Program. \</doc>

The Council approved conclusions that will serve as the EUs general negotiating position for the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to be held from 6 to 18 November 2022. In its conclusions, the Council underlines the opportunities that ambitious climate action brings for the planet, the global economy and the people, and the importance of ensuring a just transition towards sustainable climate resilient economies and societies, that leaves no one behind. All eyes will be on us in Sharm El-Sheikh. The EU has always been at the forefront of climate action and we will continue to lead by example. Protecting our planet for future generations requires a strong common global action. I am glad the EU has proved today that it is serious in its ambitions. Anna Hub?kov, Czech minister of the environment Member states highlight that global ambition must increase substantially to keep the 1.5C objective within reach, in line with the Paris Agreement. They underline that collectively, Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and their updates are currently insufficient. Therefore, all countries should come forward with ambitious targets and policies and major economies in particular should revisit and strengthen their NDCs in time for COP 27 . The Council recalls that in June 2022 the Council agreed its position on the essential elements of the Fit for 55 package that will enable the EU to implement its NDC and reduce its net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, and to achieve climate neutrality at the latest by 2050 and aim to achieve negative emissions thereafter. It notes the advancement of the legislative process for the adoption of the climate package thus far and the aim to conclude negotiations of these essential elements by the end of 2022, in a balanced manner. It stands ready as soon as possible after the conclusions of these negotiations to update, as appropriate, the NDC of the EU and its Member States, in line with 29 of the Glasgow Climate Pact to reflect how the final outcome of the essential elements of Fit for 55 package implements on EU headline target as agreed by the European Council in December 2020. The Council recalls the EU member states continued commitments as agreed with social partners, and also calls on all Parties, to close the book on unabated coal through a phasedown and ending inefficient fossil fuel subsidies to accelerate their energy transition, and to deliver on the Glasgow Climate Pact in a way that benefits workers and communities. The Council acknowledges that all countries must enhance adaptation efforts while urgently reducing emissions. They underline that a clear progress towards the Global Goal on Adaptation is key and thus the EU will continue to support and constructively engage in the two-year Glasgow-Sharm-el-Sheikh work programme on the Global Goal on Adaptation. The Goals purpose is to achieve a better understanding of how to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to protect people, livelihoods and ecosystems. The Council calls on all countries to scale up their efforts to mobilise finance from all sources to support climate action and to mainstream climate in all financial flows. It recalls that the EU and its Member States are the largest contributor to international public climate finance. It renews the strong commitment made by the EU and its member states to continue scaling up their international climate finance towards the developed countries goal of mobilising at least USD 100 billion per year as soon as possible and through to 2025 from a wide variety of sources. The Council expects the goal will be met in 2023. The Council looks forward to the continuation of the Glasgow Dialogue to discuss arrangements for funding of activities for averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change. It reiterates its readiness to engage constructively with partner countries, including through a new agenda item that would make full use of the Glasgow Dialogue to promptly strengthen the existing institutions providing support towards averting, minimising and addressing the risk of loss and damage, and to deliver concrete solutions to the challenges faced by most vulnerable countries. In this context, the Council welcomes the Early Warnings for All initiative launched by the UN Secretary General with the objective to cover everyone on Earth with early warning systems within 5 years. It welcomes the G7 Leaders commitment to work towards a Global Shield against Climate Risks for poor and vulnerable countries and people and commits to support these efforts including through the Climate and Disaster Risk Finance and Insurance (CDRFI). In addition, the EU is determined to work with all Parties to: - Foster the discussion on the future of UNFCCC - Discuss ways forward to implement climate action in the agricultural sector sustainably, - Enable the ambitious implementation of the Glasgow Work Programme on Action for Climate Empowerment - Address the gender dimension. \</doc>

Between 2016 and 2021, renewable energy installed capacity in India increased at a 19 per cent annual rate, whereas, this year, China is expected to install a record 156 GW of wind and solar energy and sales of electric vehicles (EVs) in China are expected to double With the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 Between 2016 and 2021, renewable energy installed capacity in India increased at a 19 per cent annual rate. Its draught national electricity plan calls for an 18 GW reduction in installed coal capacity by 2030. This year, China is expected to install a record 156 GW of wind and solar energy and sales of electric vehicles (EVs) in China are expected to double, with the possibility of reaching six million. According to Energy Tracker Asia's (ETA) analysis, ' COP27 Analysis: Assessing India & China's Climate Targets,' China and India are critical players in the global fight against climate change. They account for 2.7 billion people, nearly 20 per cent of global GDP and nearly one-third of global emissions (China 24.23 per cent and India 6.76 per cent). What Beijing and Delhi say at the UN climate talks in Sharm El-Sheikh, matters. Major decisions at the COP27 will not be made without Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi's tacit approval. According to the report, both countries are extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change. According to AON, 2022 will be one of the most damaging years on record. China has suffered extreme weather losses totalling more than USD 20 billion, while flooding has cost India more than USD 2 billion and killed nearly 2,000 people. Both countries' workers suffer. Due to extreme heat, India's earnings fell by 5.4 per cent in 2021, while China's fell by one per cent. According to Hozefa Merchant and Yao Zhe's analysis, both countries committed to long-term net-zero climate targets in 2021, China before 2060 and India before 2070. However, assessing interim progress in Delhi and Beijing has been difficult. Politicians in both capitals previously followed a policy of under-commitment on international targets, owing to concerns about energy security. However, according to the report, a growing body of evidence suggests that their investments in clean energy and green technology are gaining traction. "Coal demand rebounded strongly in 2021 to over 5,600 million tonnes of coal equivalent as economies recovered from the pandemic and some countries, notably India and China, turned to domestically produced fuel sources in the interests of affordability and energy security," according to the International Energy Agency's 2022 World Energy Outlook 5. The analysis of the electricity sectors in India and China shows how renewable energy is gradually replacing fossil fuels. Renewable energy supplied 82 per cent of the increase in China's electricity demand. At the current rate of installation, China will have met its 2030 renewables target of 1,200GW five years sooner. It is also on track to reach a plateau in emissions this decade, well ahead of the official peaking target of 2030. At the end of FY2022, India's total installed renewable capacity was 157GW, accounting for 39 per cent of the country's total capacity of 400GW and 22 per cent of the total generation of 1,492TWh. According to the analysis titled 'India-China Investment Analysis in Electricity as COP27 Progresses,' India is likely to reach a peak and then plateau in thermal power generation at some point this decade, despite strong sustained economic growth of 5-7 per cent per year. The UN climate talks have not specifically addressed fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are the primary cause of loss and damage, accounting for 86 per cent of CO2 emissions over the last decade. However, the world is on track to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels required to meet a 1.5-degree Celsius target. The fossil fuel industry profits handsomely from this addiction, while households struggle to meet basic needs and over one billion people live with little or no modern energy. Africa alone has 600 million people who do not have access to electricity. Civil society is urging governments to collaborate in addressing fossil fuel production because a COP that fails to address fossil fuel production is a COP that fails to address the root cause of the climate crisis. "Our host government has said that this is a COP of implementation," said Alex Rafalowicz, Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, assessing the initial announcements made by governments in their high-level statements in the opening days of COP27 . \</doc>

New Delhi, Nov 29 (IANS) The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties ( COP ) 27 being held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt provides an opportunity for the world to bring about much-needed steps to curb the climate change disaster that is facing us all today. With its theme of "Loss and Damage", COP27 will put special emphasis on addressing the damage that has already been caused and recompensing the affected countries for the same. COP27 brought together more than 45,000 participants to share their thoughts and ideas, solutions, build partnerships and coalitions. Indigenous peoples, local communities, cities and civil society, including youth and children, showcased how they are addressing climate change and shared how it impacts their lives. The decisions taken reemphasized the critical importance of empowering all stakeholders to engage in climate action; in particular through the five-year action plan on Action for Climate Empowerment and the intermediate review of the Gender Action Plan also. These outcomes will allow all Parties to work together with concerted efforts to address disparities in participation and provide stakeholders with the tools required to drive larger and more inclusive climate action at all levels. The response thus far has not been in accordance with the gravity of the situation. While the effects of climate change and global warming have been unravelling at a great pace, the measures needed to control these have been rather slow and incremental. The annual global emissions have risen up to 50 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. The Emissions Gap Report note that to achieve the target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial level, annual emissions must drop to 33 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030 and 8 billion tonnes by 2050. It is important to note that developed countries which have been historically responsible for global warming amounting to 77 per cent of the total share since 1850 have not been undertaking significant measures to check global warming either in terms of drastically reducing their own emissions or by way of climate finance and technology transfer to developing countries. At such a juncture, India seems ready to lead by example and not only become the voice of the Global South but also an inspiration for the developed world. Take, for instance, India's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution premised on 'Panchamrit' aims to achieve the target of net zero carbon emissions by 2070 and increase non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030. It also sets a target of 50 per cent electricity requirements to be sourced from renewable energy sources by 2030 and reduce the emission intensity of GDP by less than 45 per cent by 2030 from 2005 levels. Additionally, it aims at reducing carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent till 2030. India submitted its Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy to the UNFCCC. The strategy was launched by the Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Bhupender Yadav, who is leading the Indian delegation to COP 27 . Notably, India achieved a 24 per cent emission intensity reduction in 2016 itself and is estimated to have reached 30 per cent by now. By June 2022, India had already achieved 41.5 per cent share of non-fossil fuels in installed electricity capacity. All this shows that India has displayed immense credentials and commitment in taking mitigation and adaptation measures for climate change. In fact, India is the only G20 country which is on track to achieve its NDCs and climate targets. COP 27 India shall push for the effective enforcement of the principle of Common-but-Differentiated-Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR RC). This shall be achieved by emphasising fair negotiations regarding climate actions. CBDR RC is necessary to ensure equity and justice between Global North and Global South. For instance, one cannot expect parity in actions between developing countries such as India which emits less than 1.9 Mt of carbon dioxide equivalent per capita, and developed countries such as the US emitting over 15.5 Mt of carbon dioxide equivalent per capita. Moreover, India must also push for climate finance and technology transfer that developed countries promised to developing countries in their efforts towards climate change mitigation and adaptation. The UNEP report suggests that developing countries are in need of $70 billion in adaptation costs alone. In such a scenario, merely $100 billion committed by developed countries for both mitigation as well as adaptation targets won't suffice. Additionally, India should strongly push for negotiations and discussions leading to constructive steps for "Loss and Damage" which is also the main agenda of COP 27 . The much-awaited Global Shield Against Climate Risks initiative was formally launched at the Vulnerable 20 (V20) pavilion at COP27 . The initiative is envisioned as a social protection and insurance-based finance mechanism for loss and damage outside the UNFCCC process. The initiative will provide pre-arranged financial support designed to be quickly deployed in times of climate disasters. Although the rate of global warming in the past decade was 33 per cent higher than in the 1990s, there is some improvement. Before the COP 21 Paris Agreement, the planet was estimated to heat up by over 4.5 degrees Celsius over the pre-industrial levels, the recent estimates peg it at 2.6 degrees Celsius, which is a stark progress. Here again, India with its clarion call of LiFE -- Lifestyle for Environment, emphasising a healthy and sustainable way of living by following ways of moderation and involving mass participation, shows the way. India is giving a message to the world, especially the industrialised world, that the mindset of "use and throw" must be replaced by the notion of a circular economy involving the 3Rs -- reduce, reuse and recycle. scor/ \</doc>

As the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) draws to a close, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority underlines its commitment to supporting the insurance and pensions sectors in tackling climate change. Greening the economy will not happen overnight, but every step makes a difference. Sustainability has long been a key pillar of our work, with the overall objective to strengthen the sustainability of the insurance and pensions sectors. Original Press Release: Nov. 18 -- EIOPA issued the following news release: As the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) draws to a close, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority underlines its commitment to supporting the insurance and pensions sectors in tackling climate change. Greening the economy will not happen overnight, but every step makes a difference. Sustainability has long been a key pillar of our work, with the overall objective to strengthen the sustainability of the insurance and pensions sectors. We are now moving from considering what we should do to defining how we should do things. Over the past year, we have provided guidance on the own risk and solvency assessment (ORSA), so that insurers adopt a forward-looking approach to the management of sustainability risk. We are also providing guidance on the application of the Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation. This year, our stress test will assess the resilience of Europe's occupational pensions sector against a climate change scenario. We are also making step-by-step progress in our work on assessing the extent to which a dedicated prudential treatment of environmental or social objectives under Solvency II might be warranted, and expect to launch a consultation before the end of this year. Finally, in the area of protection gaps, EIOPA will publish in December the first European-wide dashboard on the natural catastrophe insurance protection gap, in line with our commitment made in the confines of COP26 in Glasgow. As part of our contribution to this year's conference, EIOPA has participated in European Union side events highlighting our supervisory initiatives in the area of climate risk and treatment of green investments; as well as the role of insurance and adaptation, focusing on the role of insurers as risk managers and investors. We strongly support the theme of this year's COP27 conference: 'Together for Implementation.' Climate change is an enormous global challenge and meeting the challenge requires a joint effort by many parties. The insurance and occupational pensions sectors play a vital role addressing climate-related challenges, as both risk managers for society and major long-term investors. EIOPA therefore values its consultative dialogue with the insurance and pensions sectors as part of its work to support both sectors in their efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change and other sustainability risks. Furthermore, EIOPA continues to actively contribute to a range of bodies at national, European and international level, to foster a common approach to supervisory practices related to sustainability. We are seeing at close hand the impact that climate change has on human, social and economic life. At EIOPA, we will continue to integrate sustainable finance across all areas of our work and to ensure that insurers and occupational pension funds incorporate sustainability risks in their risk management frameworks in a forward-looking and transparent way. EIOPA will present a full overview of the latest developments in its work on sustainable finance at its Sustainable Finance Conference on 7 December.

In November 2022, representatives from several countries will gather in Sharm-El-Sheikh, Egypt, for the 27th UNFCCC Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) In the videoconference, the minister defended that the countries of the region reach a common position to be presented at the 27th United Nations Conference of the Parties on Climate Change ( COP 27 ). The construction of a common message from our region for COP 27 reflects our desire for greater international cooperation to accelerate the achievement of our national and collective climate goals. It is a collaborative vision, which contrasts diametrically with unilateral and restrictive approaches to trade, which have been favored by some countries and which do not seem to generate positive climate effects, he said at the meeting, which is part of a series of preparatory meetings to the COP 27 . In November 2022, representatives from several countries will meet in Sharm-El-Sheikh, Egypt, for the 27th UNFCCC Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ), with the aim of debating goals and actions to tackle climate change. \</doc>

BBVA Chair Carlos Torres Vila, alongside other leaders of major global companies, has signed a statement calling on world leaders and participants at the Sharm El Sheikh United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ) to commit convincingly to a just transition. "This transition needs a radical rethinking of how we do business," explains the statement from the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders promoted by the World Economic Forum (WEF). The Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders is the largest global community of businesspeople in the world. Key Highlights:  The statement urges governments to "ensure that developed countries meet and exceed their $100 billion commitment and that these funds go directly to supporting developing countries' efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change," because the Alliance believes "this is fundamental to establishing and maintaining confidence between countries to tackle the climate crisis together."  The members of the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders have committed to "reducing emissions by more than 1 gigatons annually by 2030 and have, on average, reduced scope 1 and 2 emissions by 22% from 2019-2020 levels." Nov. 4 -- Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. issued the following news release: BBVA Chair Carlos Torres Vila, alongside other leaders of major global companies, has signed a statement calling on world leaders and participants at the Sharm El Sheikh United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ) to commit convincingly to a just transition. "This transition needs a radical rethinking of how we do business," explains the statement from the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders promoted by the World Economic Forum (WEF). The Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders is the largest global community of businesspeople in the world. Its goal is to gradually reinforce climate action in all sectors. In addition, the Alliance seeks to involve policymakers in aiding the transition to a zero-emission economy, with the aim of cutting emissions by half by 2030 and achieving net zero by 2050. The statement encourages leaders to set science-based goals to speed up the transition, and calls on peers to join forces to cooperate across industries and value chains. The objective is to promote transparency, advocacy and action through partnerships and initiatives, and align their collective efforts to arrive at globally-aligned standards to accurately measure and compare progress against ambitious targets. COP 27 as an opportunity for change In its statement, the Alliance emphasizes that "the crisis is a stark reminder of the fragile nature of the current energy and food systems, which are still dominated by fossil fuels." The CEOs call on leaders at COP 27 to grasp the opportunity "to make this a historic turning point towards cleaner, more affordable and secure energy and food systems." In addition, the Alliance calls on governments to establish plans and policies to comply with the Paris Agreement and reach zero net emissions by 2050, to accelerate the transition with initiatives that facilitate green finance, and to invest in climate change mitigation by adapting infrastructure and using more sustainable materials. The statement urges governments to "ensure that developed countries meet and exceed their $100 billion commitment and that these funds go directly to supporting developing countries' efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change," because the Alliance believes "this is fundamental to establishing and maintaining confidence between countries to tackle the climate crisis together." To achieve this, the business leaders propose to streamline regulations so as to speed up solutions, provide incentives for sectors to undertake the transition and phase out subsidies for fossil fuels, while investing in conversion and improvement of jobs affected by the transition. The members of the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders have committed to "reducing emissions by more than 1 gigatons annually by 2030 and have, on average, reduced scope 1 and 2 emissions by 22% from 2019-2020 levels." The World Economic Forum (WEF) Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, formed by 124 CEOs and other business figures, meets twice a year to exchange ideas and best practices and reach consensus. Open to companies from any country and sector of activity, this community aims to drive change in all supply chains. The companies in the Alliance employ 8.9 million people across 26 countries, and account for more than $6 trillion in market capitalization.

Funding to help poorer countries curb their emissions and strengthen their resilience will be a key issue as countries gather in November for the United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as COP27 . With COP27 just two months away, there is pressure on Botswana to find ways to close the funding gap and also balance mitigation and adaptation actions. Botswana continues to feel the brunt of negative global warming impacts in terms of harsh weather conditions, despite being among countries in the world which account for the smallest share of global greenhouse gas emissions. Droughts are becoming longer and hotter and flooding more widespread and intense, shifting some fragile environments from being barely habitable to being uninhabitable. Additionally, the country has one of the least resources to adapt. While some African countries rely to a large extent on funding from rich nations to finance the measures needed to reverse climate change effects, Botswana finds herself in an unenviable position as she has no money to finance climate mitigation, adaptation and resilience. Early in September, African environment ministers convened in Cairo and advocated for a dramatic increase in the continent's climate financing. Despite having a low carbon footprint and suffering disproportionately from climate change, Africa received less than 5.5% of global climate investment, according to a communiqu\'e9 issued in the wake of the finance meeting. 'There is injustice because the most climate vulnerable countries are asked to pay for a crisis that they did not contribute to it, and they get the little share of the finance to achieve their climate goals,' said Mahmoud Mohieldin, the climate champion for the Egyptian presidency of the COP27 . A report titled: 'The State of Climate Finance in Africa: Climate Finance Needs of African Countries' also shows that unlike other countries, Botswana does not have a specific and comprehensive assessment of adaptation financing needs. 'Majority of African countries (42 countries) provide estimates for the 2020-2030 time period, while the remaining nine for 2020-2050. Four countries (Mozambique, Togo, Tanzania and Seychelles) calculate some needs per annum, three (Ghana, Burundi and Mozambique) use a five year range, while 10 (Ghana, Botswana, Guinea, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Tanzania, Zambia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya) do not clearly specify the time range for all the presented needs,' states the report. According to experts who commented on the report, Botswana will struggle to guide stakeholders in mobilizing climate finance because it lacks a comprehensive assessment of adaptation financing needs. South Africa will receive a large sum of money to assist it in meeting the ambitious goals outlined in its updated Nationally Determined Contribution emissions goals. 'This will be an expensive and slow process for Botswana, unlike nations like South Africa that will phase out coal in an accord dubbed the Just Transition, which will see $18 billion donated to the country to aid with the transition,' says Ronald Dintle, who is a political commentator. Botswana did not receive any adaptation funding, according to the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), who also note that South Africa received the most multilateral climate financing on the continent. 'South Africa received the most multilateral climate financing on the continent and is placed sixth highest internationally. But only 2% is directed to adaptation, with the rest going to mitigation. Zambia, Tanzania and Comoros received relatively high amounts of adaptation financing relative to their climate vulnerabilities, yet the sums are still inadequate to meet their needs. Botswana received no adaptation financing,' says ISS. Climate change adaptation is the process of adjusting to current or expected effects of climate change. Climate change mitigation refers to efforts to reduce or prevent emission of greenhouse gases. Both are ways to respond to climate change. ISS also note that without adaptation financing, the costs of adaptation measures in Botswana will keep rising. Adaptation measures include resilient water sources; early warning systems; dry land farming which encompass specific agricultural techniques for the non-irrigated cultivation of crops; and climate-resilient infrastructure which are smart practices and technologies for climate resilient agriculture such as fodder cultivars to tackle fodder scarcity, integrated farming system modules, recharge of wells to improve shallow aquifers. While experts have urged Africa to speak with a single voice and make a case for just transition at COP27 \</doc>

"The children and young people of Aotearoa are the least responsible for climate change, but they, and their children, are the ones who will live with its consequences," says Save the Children's Advocacy Director Jacqui Southey. "Already, at home and around the world, we're beginning to see the result of climate change with floods, droughts, heatwaves and more extreme weather events. This is an important opportunity to ensure the ideas and insights of Aotearoa's youth are heard ahead of this global event. "In Aotearoa and around the world youth are leading conversations around climate change and taking action on climate change mitigation and adaptation. Youth participation is crucial as world leaders negotiate and review policies around climate change at COP 27 ." COP 27 (the UN Conference on Climate Change ) will be held in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt from 6 - 18 November, with Climate Change Minister James Shaw and a New Zealand delegation in attendance. Save the Children works in 120 countries across the world. The organisation responds to emergencies and works with children and their communities to ensure they survive, learn and are protected.

Reducing emissions from road transport, mobilising funds towards sustainable investments and increasing energy efficiency in buildings emerged as the three main priorities to speed up Maltas transition towards a green economy that combats climate change. In its second year running, the five-month #ClimateOn campaign came to an end on Friday, bringing together government, agencies, and private stakeholders on activating real change to address climate change. The conference was also held on the eve of the COP27 , in preparation for Maltas participation to the United Nations Climate Change Conference taking place in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Malta is implementing the Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS) a plan that puts into action the islands commitments in line with the European Unions Fit for 55 package. The Ministry for the Environment, Energy and Enterprise together with Prof Simone Borg, Maltas Ambassador for Climate Action, organised a series of stakeholder dialogue meetings on Sustainable Mobility in Road Transport, Sustainable Finance and Energy Efficiency in Buildings. Minister for the Environment, Climate Change and Enterprise Miriam Dalli reiterated governments commitment to achieve climate targets and move towards climate neutrality. This has been manifested once again in the governments budget plan as investment in our families and businesses will continue to support them towards the green and just transition, Miriam Dalli said. Taking part in the discussion were also Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Capital Projects Aaron Farrugia and Minister for Public Works and Planning Stefan Zrinzo Azzopardi. Minister Farrugia highlighted governments commitment to continue investing in an improved transport infrastructure. We are also developing projects to promote increased active mobility across our road network and looking at a mass transit system, said the minister. Minister Zrinzo Azzopardi explained that that awareness raising on means to improve energy efficiency in homes and offices was crucial. Knowledge and capacity building are two challenges that we are striving to address in order to support this economic pillar to decarbonize and transform into a more sustainable construction industry, he continued. Margaret Cassar, Director General at the Environment Ministry, explained that: In order to mainstream climate policy across all sectors, the public and private sector need to work in hand in the implementation of LCDS. The #ClimateOn platform allows for open continuous communication between all stakeholders in order to enhance capacity for a greener and climate resilient economy. During the seminars, participants discussed the major challenges and how these could be addressed. A corporate EV training course was also launched, targeting the shift towards cleaner vehicles. The short course, provided free of charge by EIT Urban Mobility and MCAST, offers businesses and professionals with knowledge on electric vehicles, their impact on the environment and how to phase out conventional vehicles. During the sustainable mobility seminar, stakeholders highlighted the increased need for more awareness to enable better commuting choices, the enabling of infrastructure that favours a modal shift, and the need for efficient mass public transport. During the sustainable finance seminar, stakeholders explained that Malta has the firepower of private capital that can enable the country to achieve its green ambition. On energy efficiency, stakeholders referred to Maltas energy vision, direct electrification, and the governments plan to increase cleaner sources of energy. To support this transition, the introduction of standards and codes, policy and regulations is crucial. \</doc>

November 15 -- Schneider Electric, a leader in the digital transformation of energy management and automation, called for accelerated action for an equitable transition to net zero, driven by collaborative action across the private and public sectors. The company's call to action comes in the run-up to the COP27 United Nations Climate Change Conference During COP27 , Schneider Electric executives will participate in a series of panels and meet decision-makers across the business, government and civil society to help advise on the sometimes still-underappreciated solutions and approaches that can help deliver urgently needed carbon-reduction action. In-depth analysis from the Schneider Electric Sustainability Research Institute, for example, is helping to underline the big role that the demand side of the energy equation and the combination of electrification and digitization can play in accelerating the energy transition. Also, at COP27 \~ A widely-recognised champion of decarbonization and sustainability, Schneider Electric is a big believer in the need for companies to go beyond just "doing business" and to work with multiple stakeholders and partners to generate a positive long-term impact on the planet and society. \</doc>

New Delhi, Nov 9 (IANS) With the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) underway in the backdrop of a year when extreme climate events demonstrated again the urgency to curb greenhouse gas emissions, leading economies of India and China are on track to overachieve their UN climate targets. Renewable energy installed capacity in India has expanded at a rate of 19 per cent annually between 2016 and 2021. Its draft national electricity plan sees an 18 GW downward revision of installed coal capacity in 2030. China is set to install a record 156 GW of wind and solar energy this year, and China's electrical vehicle (EV) sales are forecasted to double with the possibility of reaching six million. An analysis, ' COP27 Analysis: Assessing India &amp; China's Climate Targets' by Energy Tracker Asia (ETA) says China and India are critical players in the global fight against climate change. Together they account for 2.7 billion people, nearly 20 per cent of global GDP and nearly a third of global emissions (China 24.23 per cent and India 6.76 per cent). At UN climate talks in Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt, what Beijing and Delhi say matters. Major decisions at the COP27 will not pass without the tacit approval of Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi. It says both countries are also deeply vulnerable to climate impacts. Leading insurer AON rates 2022 as one of the most damaging on record. China has incurred extreme weather losses of plus $20 billion, while flooding left India with a plus $2 billion bill and nearly 2,000 dead. Workers in both countries suffer. In 2021, India witnessed a 5.4 per cent drop in earnings due to extreme heat, while in China, that figure was one per cent. The analysis by Hozefa Merchant and Yao Zhe says in 2021 both countries committed to long-term net-zero climate targets, China before 2060 and India in 2070. But assessing interim progress in Delhi and Beijing has been hard. Politicians in both capitals previously followed the policy of under-committing on targets internationally, in part due to energy security concerns. But a growing amount of evidence is suggesting that their investments in clean power and green technology are fast gathering momentum, they say. The International Energy Agency's 2022 World Energy Outlook 5 says, "Coal demand rebounded strongly in 2021 to over 5,600 million tonnes of coal equivalent (Mtce) as economies recovered from the pandemic and some countries -- notably India and China -- turned to domestically produced fuel sources in the interests of affordability and energy security." Tim Buckley, Director, Climate Energy Finance, tells a similar story. The analysis on India and China's electricity sector highlights how renewable energy is slowly replacing fossils. Eighty-two per cent of the increase in electricity demand in China was supplied by renewable energy. At the current rate of installs, China is on track to reach its 2030 renewables target of 1,200GW five years earlier. Also it is on track for a possible plateauing of emissions this decade, well ahead of the 2030 official peaking target. India's total installed renewables capacity at the end of FY2022 was 157GW or 39 per cent of India's 400GW capacity total, and 22 per cent of total generation of 1,492TWh. India is likely to reach peak and then plateau in thermal power generation at some stage this decade, even with strong sustained economic growth of 5-7 per cent annually, says the analysis titled 'India-China Investment Analysis in Electricity as COP27 Progresses'. However, the world is on track to produce more than double the fossil fuels than is compatible with a 1.5 degrees Celsius target. The fossil fuel industry is also earning 11-figure profits from this addiction while households struggle to afford basic needs and over one billion people live with almost no modern energy. Africa alone is home to 600 million people without access to electricity. Civil society is calling on governments to work together to address fossil fuel production because a COP that does not address fossil fuels is a COP that doesn't address the root cause of the climate crisis. Evaluating the initial announcements made by governments in their high-level statements in the opening days of COP27 , Alex Rafalowicz, Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, said: "Our host government has said that this is a COP of implementation so it has to be about listening clearly to the words of the UN Secretary General, the world's scientists and those around the world that the fossil fuel era needs to come to an end so that everyone has energy access."

The Global Climate Budget 2022, released at The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference or COP27 , indicates that India will record a higher rise in carbon emissions this year than other major countries. As per the report, India's carbon dioxide emissions are expected to rise 6 per cent in 2022 compared to last year, while the US is expected to witness a 1.5 per cent increase. The European Union and China, on the other hand, would witness a decline (chart 1). While the short-term outlook may seem gloomy, India is expected to perform better in the medium term. The Emissions Gap Report 2022 released by the United Nations Environment Programme at COP 27 showed India's per capita carbon dioxide emissions in 2030 will be nearly the same as its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target. All other major G20 economies, barring Indonesia, are expected to breach their NDC target if the current policies are pursued. For the G20 countries, the carbon dioxide emission is expected to be 7.3 tonnes per person, against the NDC target of 6.9 tonnes per person (chart 2). Analysis by Business Standard shows that India has added more forest cover compared to most other countries in the G20. While India's forest cover increased by 3.8 per cent between 2010 and 2020, only China and the United Kingdom could add more (chart 3). However, despite these achievements, India has set one of the farthest goals for net-zero emissions. India plans to reach the net-zero goal by 2070, whereas neighbouring China has set a deadline of 2060. The European Union, the US and the UK have set a 2050 deadline for net zero (chart 4). A significant step towards achieving this goal is a transition towards clean energy. The government, earlier this year, had set a target of having 50 per cent installed capacity from renewable sources by 2030. It seems to have done well in this regard. The installed capacity for renewables was 29 per cent as of September 30 (chart 5). Five years ago, India's installed capacity in renewables was half of what it is today. However, despite an increasing share in installed capacity, India's power generation remains largely coal-dependent. Renewable sources contributed only 11.9 per cent to the total generation, whereas coal's share was 68.5 per cent (Chart 6). \</doc>

The United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), on Wednesday, November 9, 2022, opened with a key theme dedicated to climate finance to improve the financial commitments in alignment with the Paris Agreement goals. While India is ranked high on the list of most vulnerable countries to climate impact, it is also increasingly prioritizing addressing the challenges. In this context, CDP India and TERI jointly organized a panel discussion where Financial Institutions (FI's), the investor and capital markets community and the industry players came together to look at how to scale up the flow of climate finance by leveraging corporate sustainability disclosures. Key Highlights:  JSW Group raised 2 billion dollars from sustainability-linked finances.  There was a 40% increase in the disclosures by corporates in the Indian context.  Scope 3 emissions were 11 times higher in comparison to scope 1 and 2 for India. Original Press Release: New Delhi,Nov. 11 -- The Energy and Resources Institute issued the following news release: - India is one of the most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change, ranking 7th out of 181 according to the Global Climate Risk Index 2021. - According to CDP India data, the financial impact of climate-related risks to Indian companies was estimated at Rs.2843 billion whereas climate-related opportunities were cited at Rs.31281 billion in 2022. The numbers have drastically changed in 2 years. The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 ), on Wednesday, November 9, 2022, opened with a key theme dedicated to climate finance to improve the financial commitments in alignment with the Paris Agreement goals. Public funds alone will not suffice to curb the challenges of climate change. While India is ranked high on the list of most vulnerable countries to climate impact, it is also increasingly prioritizing addressing the challenges. In this context, CDP India and TERI jointly organized a panel discussion where Financial Institutions (FI's), the investor and capital markets community and the industry players came together to look at how to scale up the flow of climate finance by leveraging corporate sustainability disclosures. Amongst many things, the need for an enabling policy environment as well as accelerating corporate sustainability disclosures was highlighted. The latter would not only improve transparency but specifically lead to 'smart' capitalism. In a major strategic move, the Security and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has mandated Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) for the top 1000 listed companies based on market capitalization from the year 2023. In the same light, the Reserve Bank of India has recently released a Discussion Paper on Climate Risk and Sustainable Finance which recognizes that climate change is increasingly becoming a source of financial risk for banks globally. Ahead of the annual climate summit, India said that "what gets measured gets done". More clarity, however, is needed on the definition of climate finance for developing countries to accurately assess the extent of finance flows for climate action. The increased alignment of global and national frameworks is seen as an important step to support the evolving dynamics of capital markets thereby mobilizing private sector investments to help reduce carbon emissions and impacts thereof. Delivering the keynote at the panel 'Building Investor confidence for enhancing climate finance by leveraging global and national frameworks on corporate sustainability disclosures', Dr Vibha Dhawan, Director General, TERI highlighted the nascent stage of ESG which corporates are still trying to unravel. "I am glad to share that Indian corporates are increasingly understanding and showing interest in the framework, and in how it will be helpful to build their business. There is an interest in having an ESG academy to train people on reporting. Therefore, corporates can play an important role by disclosing and measuring how far they have achieved in the next cop summit." Commenting on the alignment of disclosure frameworks, Ms Mardi Mc Brien, Director of Strategic Alliances, ISSB emphasized the importance of CDP's announcement at COP27 to incorporate ISSB climate-related disclosure standards into the framework for the 2024 cycle. "The decision will improve the consistency of climate-related information for investors and reduce the disclosure burden on entities through an alignment of requirements. This announcement sends a clear signal to the global market ahead of finance day at COP27 that CDP and ISSB are responding to market demand for effective, consistent climate disclosure." Giving an on-the-ground perspective, Mr David Wong, APAC Deputy Director GFANZ gave insights on how to move forward after disclosing. "Initially we focused on disclosures but now we are looking into transition planning and attaining net zero, creating transparency, and setting GHG reduction targets." While there is a lot of momentum, challenges, according to him, are that no large FI in Asia pacific has committed to net zero. "In the transition planning, the role of FIs getting involved is much more important. We need to focus on the implementation strategy and how to engage your stakeholders. We need to work on how to monitor our progress." Looking at the hard-to-abate sectors like steel and cement, Mr Prabodha Acharya, Chief Sustainability Officer, JSW Group emphasized: "It's very important to disclose the right information so that the investor has confidence, targets should be interim and practical and not selling dream targets of Net Zero. JSW Group raised 2 billion dollars from sustainability-linked finances. Transparency is very important in reporting which organizations should focus on to gain investor confidence." Connecting the threads, Prarthana Borah, Director CDP India, emphasized: "Disclosure is the first step to environmental action". "There was a 40% increase in the disclosures by corporates in the Indian context. The private sector has begun to respond, now it's time for the FIs and think about mobilizing it. We should be working on analysing data to bring more corporates towards disclosure in driving climate action. Scope 3 emissions were 11 times higher in comparison to scope 1 and 2 for India. To meet these commitments, investors and financial institutions require environmental disclosure from the companies in their portfolios so that they can understand and manage their financed environmental impact." The session successfully addressed the need for mobilizing capital for dealing with climate urgency, whilst highlighting the criticality of the sustainability disclosures in raising climate finance. Efforts, however, need to gather greater momentum. Although in the past few years, an increase in awareness and policies has helped navigate the transition towards a greener tomorrow, there is no denying that Indian FIs need to catch up to enable banks to operate and develop a sustainable finance ecosystem. The policy framework developed in the country is of equal importance. In addition to this, a collective urge to make a sustainable change will make a real difference. Greater public awareness, information sharing, and constant research and development would help to boost the confidence of investors to be at the precipice of creating a real shift.

AHEAD OF COP27 New Delhi: Ahead of the crucial United Nations climate change conference COP27 next month, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has warned of a decline in cross-border investments in climate change mitigation and adaptation in 2022 amid a global investment downturn. Citing a bleak outlook for global foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2022, UNCTAD in a report said the number of new investment projects across most industries have declined, notably those tackling cli- mate change.  Between January and September 2022, climate mitigation and adaptation sectors had, respectively, 7% and 12% fewer new projects announced, in stark contrast to the previous year's strong acceleration, it said. Among mitigation measures, low carbon transport witnessed the steepest decline of 25%, while in adaptation actions, water management contracted 19%.  The shift from fossil fuel to green investments to support the energy transition risks a setback, due to the loss of momentum in renewables and high oil and gas prices, UNCTAD said. For now, the downward trend in investment is also affecting extractive industries and fossil fuel-based energy generation where project numbers dipped by about 16% in first three quarters of 2022, it said.

November 22 -- One can only hope that the big news out of COP-27 in Sharm el-Sheikh is yet another cop-out on "climate change." The big news seems to rank up there with news of Trump's return to Twitter. Is it equally vacuous? Politico boils the news down to three paragraphs: Governments from around the world agreed to have wealthy countries help pay vulnerable nations for the damage they're suffering from climate change, a deal that overcomes decades of U.S. and European resistance. Those include the exact mix of government and private financing that would go into the climate-damage fund, as well as U.S. and European demands that China and other middle-income countries contribute as well. Among the accessible news stories, CNN's gives a hint of the farcical madness that Jonathan Swift mocks in Book III of Gulliver's Travels: "The complete COP27 agreement, of which the fund is a part, also reaffirmed the goal of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels - a key demand from a number of countries." As many have observed, the "climate change" orthodoxy has the earmarks of a religion. The mad scientists of Laputa have nothing on the men of COP27 . The UN has posted the so-called Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan along with many other documents related to the conference. It is one of the documents accessible via the UN press release posted here or via this page. I trust that Steve Hayward will tell us what it all means when he returns to duty this week. \</doc>

Kolkata-based firms, Vikram Solar and SnapE Cabs, have entered into a UK-supported Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV) Declaration. Through this agreement, the two firms are now a part of Accelerating to Zero Coalition platform. The Accelerating to Zero (A2Z) Coalition is an an initiative launched at COP27 and looks at securing commitments to zero-emission vehicles transition in alignment with the Paris Agreement. The ceremony of the signing of the agreement happened on November 17, 2022 at the British Deputy High Commission office and marked the presence of the British High Commissioner to India, Alex Ellis. The day was dubbed as COP27 Solutions Day in Kolkata by the High Commissioner. "I am delighted to be in Kolkata, one of the world's most innovative cities in the fight against climate change. Be it on electrification of the public transport system or the new electric vehicle policy, the UK is a partner of Kolkata and India on this journey. Congratulations to the two companies for joining the Accelerating to Zero Coalition platform, which will provide greater access to finance, technology and innovations," said the British High Commissioner to India. The Zero Emissions Vehicles Declaration currently has more than 200 signatories. It was UK that set the ball rolling on this front at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference . This initiative envisions commitment for all new cars sales to be zero emission around the world by years 2040 and by 2035 in leading markets. \</doc>

One year on from hosting COP26 in Glasgow, the UK has handed over the Presidency of the United Nations Climate Change Conference to Egypt as world leaders, including the UKs PM, Rishi Sunak, meet at Sharm el Sheikh for COP27 .The UKs Presidency of COP26 made progress on each of its four goals of: mitigation (reducing emissions), adaptation (helping those already impacted by climate change), finance (enabling countries to deliver on their climate goals) and collaboration (working together to deliver even greater action). Most importantly, if countries which agreed the Glasgow Climate Pact deliver on their commitments to phase down coal power, halt or reverse deforestation and speed up the switch to electric vehicles, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees is still possible. This will be critical for preventing devastating climate impacts and protecting vulnerable countries like Pakistan. At COP26 the UK pledged 55m in financial support to Pakistan to assist with building climate resilience and tackling climate change. This support is in addition to 26.5m provided by the UK Government and 30m donated by UK citizens to provide relief following this years devastating floods. Having handed over the Presidency, the UK is maintaining its ambitious goals on climate change. This year the UK is launching the Accelerating to Zero Coalition which will promote the use of more electric cars worldwide. The UK is also initiating the Forest and Climate Leaders Partnership to halt and reverse forest loss and will be working with developed countries to increase the availability of climate finance to countries such as Pakistan. Development Director at the British High Commission, Islamabad Jo Moir, said the following: Important achievements of COP26 include: International partners mobilising over $20 billion for a just and inclusive transition from coal to clean energy. 137 countries committed to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030 in the Glasgow Leaders Declaration on Forests and Land Use. The COP26 Declaration on Accelerating the Transition to 100% Zero Emission Cars and Vans brought together over 35 countries, 6 major carmakers, 43 cities, states and regions, 28 fleet owners and 15 financial institutions and investors, all committing to work together to achieve this goal. It currently has over 180 signatories. Building on the ZEV declaration, the UK will formally launch the Acceleration to Zero (A2Z) Coalition this will comprise of a group of governments, manufacturers and businesses that will take the lead in ensuring that all new vehicles are zero emission by 2035 in leading markets and globally by 2040. On 2 November, as part of its Climate Finance Accelerator programme the UK announced that seven low-carbon projects from across Pakistan would receive technical support to improve their ability to attract long-term investment from financers, worth up to 148m. These projects have the potential to benefit communities across Pakistan, through clean energy access, green transportation and pollution reduction while creating jobs. The ultimate objective however is to improve the flow of much needed climate finance which will allow Pakistan to build back smarter. At COP27 \</doc>

Source: The Conversation (Au and NZ) - By Wesley Morgan, Research Fellow, Griffith Asia Institute, Griffith University Officials from nearly 200 nations are gathering in Sharm-El-Sheikh, Egypt, for the 27th United Nations climate change conference known as COP27 COP27 over the next two weeks is more urgent than ever. A report released today by the Climate Council shows the world is in the grip of a deepening climate crisis. Without more ambitious emission cuts this decade, we are headed for a full-blown catastrophe. In this time of global volatility, Australia can play a key role. At COP27 , Australian officials will be lobbying to co-host the UN climate talks with Pacific island countries. But, to succeed in its bid, Australia will need to walk the talk. That means moving rapidly away from coal and gas, and helping developing nations to manage climate impacts. Read more: 3 things a climate scientist wants world leaders to know ahead of COP27 After a decade of denial and delay, Australia has rejoined the global shift toward a clean energy economy. However, Australia's new 2030 target - to cut emissions by 43% from 2005 levels - is still one of the weakest in the developed world. And dozens of major fossil fuel projects remain in the pipeline. Source: Climate Council of Australia, Author provided More ambition is needed. At COP27 , Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen has a chance to signal that Australia intends to become a renewables superpower, exporting the clean energy commodities and critical minerals other nations need to decarbonise their economies. Australian diplomacy matters too. Australia is formally bidding to host a future round of UN climate talks, for the first time, in partnership with Pacific island nations. But a bigger role will come with bigger expectations. To demonstrate Australia's climate credentials, Bowen will need to explain that our 2030 target is just a starting point. Pacific island nations will want to see Australia end public finance for fossil fuels and join the growing list of countries that have set a clear deadline for exiting coal. Australia will also be expected to commit more climate finance for developing countries and support a new global fund to address permanent loss and damage from climate change.

Wealthy countries, pay your dues With a responsible international climate agenda, Australia could play a crucial role reinforcing global co-operation and brokering the next phase of climate action. We need delegates and world leaders to stay focused at COP27 . Distraction will be deadly. A world of climate suffering Extreme weather records were broken on every continent this year. From Lismore to Lahore, records tumbled so fast it was hard to keep up. Australia recorded its equal-hottest day on record and its costliest flood disaster. Read more: Some councils still rely on outdated paper maps as supercharged storms make a mockery of flood planning China endured its most intense heatwave. In Pakistan, extreme floods affected more than 30 million people and killed thousands. Europe's hottest summer on record smashed the record from just last year. The continent also suffered one of its worst ever droughts. UK temperatures topped 40 for the first time. The western United States also recorded its worst heatwave. In South Africa, record rainfall led to hundreds of deaths. Drought in East Africa has left millions at risk of starvation. These climate impacts, sadly, are just the beginning. They are occurring in a world that has warmed 1.2 since the Industrial Revolution, but it's going to get worse. Even if all countries meet their targets for emission reductions by 2030, the world is headed for 2.4-2.6 of warming this century. Deeper cuts to emissions this decade can avoid worst-case scenarios. But we must act now. Global emissions must fall by 45% by 2030 to have any chance of achieving the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5. Even while climate records tumble, world leaders are focused on strategic rivalry between nations. It's not all bad news, however. While competition may undermine joint action, it is also speeding up the shift to clean energy. The United States and China are competing to lead this transition. China is the world's largest emitter and relies heavily on coal-fired power, but it's also the global leader in clean energy production and deployment. Last year China built nearly half the world's new renewable energy infrastructure. China also dominates global production of solar photovoltaics, batteries, wind turbines and electric vehicles. In September, the US Congress passed legislation authorising the largest climate spend in US history. The intention is to establish a clean energy manufacturing base in the US, and to displace China as a key supplier of components for solar, wind, batteries and electric vehicles. Read more: Heat pumps can cut your energy costs by up to 90%. It's not magic, just a smart use of the laws of physics In Europe, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sped up the move away from fossil fuels, as it's now also an issue of security. In May, the European Union set out a plan to cut Russian gas imports by two-thirds this year and end them altogether before the decade is out. The strategy will cut Europe's overall gas use - not just Russian gas - by a third by 2030. It also sets more ambitious 2030 targets for renewable energy and energy savings, and requires rooftop solar installations on new buildings. As a result, the EU is expected to exceed its 2030 emissions target. European policymakers have agreed to formally strengthen the target next year. Competition among major powers is clearly accelerating, not slowing, the shift to clean energy. A majority of countries - representing more than 90% of the world economy - have committed to achieving net-zero emissions. Most of the developed world has pledged to at least halve emissions this decade. Australia is well placed to benefit from the global clean energy transition. At COP27 we must signal our shift from fossil fuel heavyweight to renewables superpower. Wesley Morgan is a Senior Researcher with the Climate Council - ref.

The Union Minister of Environment Forest and Climate Change Shri Bhupender Yadav addressed the special United Nations Country Team (UNCT) on the key themes and takeaways from CoP 27 at UN House, today. The meeting was followed by the inauguration of the Climate Change Photo Exhibition with the Swiss Embassy at the UN House in New Delhi. Mr Shombi Sharp, United Nations Resident Coordinator in India, congratulated the Government of India on its vitally important contributions made at the recently concluded CoP 27 at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. He remarked that Indias bold leadership on the climate agenda, and the innovative solutions increasingly emerging from government and private sector partners in India, are a beacon to the world for a more sustainable, just and equitable global future. In his address to the special UNCT meeting, Shri Bhupender Yadav said: Ladies and Gentlemen, I am happy to be amongst you all in this special meeting with UN Country team which focuses on key takeaways and outcomes from recently concluded COP 27 . I have just returned from COP27 and I am sure you would have followed its proceedings and read its outcomes. It was an implementation COP with a headline outcome on funding arrangements including a dedicated loss and damage fund. Today, I would like to hear your views on your approach to operationalize the COP27 outcomes in India, in keeping with our National Development Priorities. At COP26 in Glasgow, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi shared his vision of LiFE Lifestyles for Environment as a key approach to promoting sustainability and combating climate change. Since then, much work has been done to translate this vision into a plan of action. Mission LiFE was conceptualized to take forward this message to the global community. The UNSG has reinforced the importance of Mission LiFE, by participating in its launch event on 20th October at Kevadia, with PM Shri Narendra Modi. I am glad to share that the cover decision of COP-27 , called Sharm el-Sheikh implementation plan, notes the importance of transition to sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of consumption and production for efforts to combat climate change. India seeks to involve a billion people in this global mass movement of Mission LiFE. We made a start, with several LiFE related events at the India Pavilion during COP27 . I appreciate the involvement of UNEP and UNDP in these events. One immediate task ahead is to create a LiFE compendium of global best practices on sustainable lifestyles. This will be a comprehensive repository containing best practices from around the world. I understand that UN INDIA is already working with NITI Aayog and MoEFCC in this regard. There could be many other ways to roll out the COP27 decision on transition to sustainable lifestyles. For example, UN India could consider organising a global conference on Mission LiFE during Indias G20 Presidency. Many UN agencies are implementing agencies under GEF and some are also accredited entities under GCF. We are now preparing a shelf of projects for the GEF 8 cycle. I expect that outcomes of COP27 on sustainable lifestyles, climate action in agriculture, mitigation work program and just transition would be factored in appropriately, in the upcoming projects. COP27 has established a 4-year work program on climate action in agriculture and food security. Agriculture, the mainstay of livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers, will be hard hit from climate change. We look at the agriculture sector primarily as a sector for adaptation and building climate resilience. We should not burden our smallholder farmers and pastoralists with mitigation responsibilities. FAO, in particular, may note that India has kept mitigation in agriculture out of its NDCs. COP27 has also established a work program on just transition. For most developing countries, just transition cannot be equated with decarbonisation, but with low-carbon development. Developing countries retain the right to choose their energy mix and in achieving the SDGs. Just transition is not just an issue for individual countries, it is also about a global just transition. Developed countries taking the lead in climate action is therefore a very important aspect of the global just transition. At COP27 , there was an agreement to set up a loss and damage fund as part of wider funding arrangements for addressing, averting and minimizing loss and damage. The contours of this fund, including its contributors and beneficiaries, would be worked out later in the course of the coming year. India is voluntarily providing support as part of wider south-south cooperation. India bears no responsibility for the climate crisis, but stands in solidarity with the global south on loss and damage issues. UN agencies anchor many environment conventions and treaties. I would insist that the UN system remains steadfast in the protection of foundational principles of each of these conventions and treaties in its work in different countries. For India, the principles of equity and CBDR-RC in the light of national circumstances remains, paramount. I urge you to ensure that these foundational principles are respected when you prepare projects for implementation in India. Red-tapism is the bane of all bureaucracies and I am afraid it does not spare the UN system either. Many reporting requirements under the multilateral environment conventions and treaties are funded through GEF projects. I am given to understand that three critical projects on fulfilling reporting requirements under the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement have not yet taken off, even one year after its approval by GEF. Such delays are strictly avoidable. The concerned UN agency may kindly take note, and I request that these projects may definitely be launched in the coming month. With these thoughts, I thank you for organising this interaction and I look forward to hearing your views. \</doc>

India, Sept. 6 -- Summit discussed Africa's COP 27 agenda; Calls for flowing funds to continent's Adaptation Acceleration Program Richer, more polluting nations need to increase funding for projects to help African countries adapt to climate change, the continent's leaders said. African heads of state and top figures from global organisations met in Rotterdam September 5, 2022 to address climate change financing in Africa. Developed nations need to at least collectively double the climate adaptation finance to Africa by 2025, the leaders said at the African Adaptation Summit, Global Center on Adaptation. An agenda for adaptation was also set for Africa ahead of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , more commonly referred to as COP27 . The agenda has been included in the 5-point "adaptation delivery breakthrough" adopted for COP27 , scheduled in Egypt November 2022 . Two of the five points in the breakthrough statement underscore how Africa is least responsible but most vulnerable to climate impacts. Africa was at a tipping point due to being most exposed to the food crisis triggered by the Ukraine conflict and the frontline of the global climate breakdown, it said. Other three points focused on adaptation - doubling international finance for adaptation by 2025, capitalising Africa's Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP) and making available the AAAP Upstream Financing Facility's full resourcing needs by COP-27 . African Development Bank has already committed $12.5 billion . "We now need full financing of the $12.5 billion for the AAAP," said Akinwumi A Adesina, president African Development Bank Group, at the summit. The most vulnerable continent to consequences of the climate crisis does not have the resources to tackle climate change, he said. A standalone and transparent implementation plan showing progress towards the 2025 doubling target and flowing funds to country-led programmes like Africa's AAAP, would provide a powerful outcome to COP27 , the agenda statement said. Developed nations committed to providing $100 billion per year to support developing countries in mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Of this, adaptation finance accounted for just one-fourth of total climate finance. Developed countries at COP26 had agreed to double the funding for adaptation by 2025. Africa is at the frontline of the global climate emergency and adaptation presents an unprecedented opportunity for COP27 to secure unstoppable progress. It is also the most effective pathway to minimise climate-related loss and damage, the communication said. Success at COP27 African Union President Macky Sall of Senegal called upon Africa's development partners to fully fund the AAAP and make it an exemplary model of what is possible when we collaborate. "COP26 marked a breakthrough thanks to your determination to put adaptation on the global agenda by doubling adaptation finance. Now, with your help, we must keep that promise. With your support, the AAAP can make this vision a reality," concluded Sall. It's time to turn words into deeds and ambition into action, said Ghana President Nana Afuko-Addo, calling for standalone implementation plan of the promise made at COP26 to double adaptation funding by 2025. Afuko-Addo is also climate vulnerable forum chair president. "Crucially, we expect progress and we expect to see how funds will flow into country-led programs like the AAAP," Afuko-Addo said at the summit. Africa generates less than 3 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions, is least responsible for the causes of climate change, but suffers the most. For instance, by 2030, up to 118 million extremely poor people or those living on less than $1.90/day will be exposed to drought, floods and extreme heat in Africa, according to State of the Climate in Africa 2020 report . GDP losses per capita could be as high as 16-64 per cent under high warming scenario, as per estimates by the African Development Bank. With an African COP this year, the continent cannot miss out on a win for the region on climate, said leaders representing Africa at the adaptation summit.

November 21 -- The first two weeks of November 2022 were a fascinating time in the oil and gas and energy geopolitical ecosphere. There was a confluence of several international gatherings addressing global collaborations across economic, environmental, trade and energy topics. The first week of November saw the start of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference on Sunday, Nov. 6 which ran until Nov .18. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations- the ASEAN Summit ran from Nov. 10 to Nov. 13. The 2022 G20 Bali summit began on Tuesday, Nov. 15, and ended on Wednesday, Nov. 16. It was a fertile time for energy expert and best-selling author Alex Epstein to address an audience in Calgary on the future of fossil fuels and why humankind needs more hydrocarbons not less. Alex Epstein got started investigating and developing pro-hydrocarbon arguments in 2011 when he founded the Center for Industrial Progress. He began a journey to promote human development and progress which Alex refers to as "human flourishing"- improving lives by using technology to improve the planet. His prescription for human flourishing is for every individual to have the potential for a longer, happier, healthier, safer, more comfortable, more meaningful, and more opportunity-filled life. In Calgary on Nov. 16, Epstein delivered an expansive analysis of the energy industry's historical and current challenges, wins and draws in the geopolitical arena. Ultimately, he is optimistic that there is progress in the areas of information and education. "I think we're really at an exciting moment right now, in terms of education-for two reasons. One is what I and some others have done in the last 10 years. We developed arguments that are really easy to make and that are powerful. They didn't exist when I got started (championing fossil fuels). \~So you have much better arguments at your disposal than what you used to have, which are much easier to use and share," Epstein said. "What we have is a global energy crisis, which is tragic. But what crisis brings is an awareness that the establishment has failed. For years, the establishment was doing all of these destructive things, but they were kind of bailed out by the industry. Particularly the shale revolution in the U.S. bailed out a lot of these bad policies by creating a lot of new, unexpected oil and gas. But now, what's happened is that anti-fossil fuel policies have really suppressed supply. We're seeing rising prices. People are struggling. We're seeing the consequences- all of the things that many of us have talked about for years. So people are more open than ever to the idea that we should have a fossil future. So you have this combination of more open minds and really powerful arguments." Part of the presentation included an engaging discussion of the ideas coming out of the last two weeks of international conferences and meetings. The discussion began with COP 27 and the news that although organizers of COP 27 were still catastrophizing about climate change saying "We're in the fight of our lives and we're losing" many of the country leaders were saying the war in Ukraine and staggering inflation has reduced the urgency of climate change. Epstein pointed out that the messaging is following what he calls "the same fossil fuel benefit denial playbook of just acting like climate change is "the Apocalypse", and cost-effective energy doesn't matter." Ultimately, he said climate change catastrophists find it difficult to admit their policies are ruining lives and they want to continue on their path. Epstein asserts that eliminating fossil fuels and impacting climate should not be a goal in and of itself. There should be a larger goal to advance human flourishing and global human empowerment. The idea of climate-related loss and damage payments, which surfaced ten years ago was again floated at COP 27 . This is the view that the richer, more developed Western countries that have spent years profiting off fossil fuels should give money to the countries that are poor and may be suffering from climate change. These payments will amount to trillions of dollars. The U.S. has long resisted these requests for loss and damage agreements. Countries like Bangladesh or Pakistan are used as examples - quoting the extreme flooding losses they experienced in 2022. The private sector is reported to be working on developing an insurance scheme, which Germany favours. However, opponents are saying that the richer countries will still just be profiting from the folks at the bottom of the economic pyramid. No demands are being made of top emitters like China, Russia and India who are the first, third and fourth highest emitters according to 2019 measurements reported by climatetrade.com. In response to the concept of loss and damage payments, Epstein referred to research on income, population and life expectancy development statistics, charting the rapid rise from the 1700s until present day which he calls "human flourishing hockey sticks." The global dramatic rise in income and population is attributed largely to fossil fuels which allowed humans to use machines to be productive and prosperous. It's also freed up the time to develop sanitation, science and tech innovation, medical care, etc. Epstein points out that our use of fossil fuels has been incredibly beneficial to everyone in the world- "an incredible net benefit to the rest of the world leading to radical experiences, and extension of life expectancy." "What we owe the rest of the world is not to impose any of these anti-fossil fuel policies on them. But what they owe themselves is to adopt more pro-freedom policies. The poor parts of the world have a very predictable way to become prosperous, and it is to become freer places and we've seen this throughout Asia. Many countries have risen dramatically out of poverty since I was born in 1980." This message is echoed by N.J. Ayuk, Executive Chairman of the African Energy Chamber who stated in mainstream and on social media, "I'm going to COP27 because I believe if Africa is not at the table, it will be on the menu. Let me be clear, those of us who are advocating for African countries to continue using their oil and gas resources are not "ignoring" the world's green agenda - we're simply not willing to embrace the world's timetable for transitioning to renewable fuels at the expense of our own energy security and economic well-being." Strong words from a representative of countries that UN delegates might just as easily designate as "heavily impacted by climate change" and owed loss and damage payments. Instead, there is a choice to exercise the freedom to develop their own prosperity and rise out of poverty. Epstein referred to statistics on poverty from his research explaining how extreme poverty- which is defined as living on less than $2 a day- has gone from impacting over 40% of the world to just 10% of the world today. He suggests the focus should be improving areas like Pakistan that need radical economic reform. He thinks the idea that we keep indulging extreme poverty and feeling guilty about improvements made in the developed world is the wrong way to think about the problem. COP 27 discussions included the proposed imposition of windfall taxes on Oil and Gas profits. It is reported that one Canadian producer, Vermillion Energy could face an estimated $250 million to $350 million for 2022 in windfall tax being imposed by European Union countries on profits by oil and gas producers. In a news release, Vermilion Energy president Dion Hatcher said "We do not believe a windfall tax is an appropriate solution as it will not incentivize new domestic supply, nor reduce consumption, and it may ultimately result in higher natural gas prices in Europe." It is unclear whether the tax will apply retroactively to 2022, prospectively to 2023, or for both years. Epstein responded to the suggestions of windfall taxes saying that the current energy crisis is entirely caused by the anti-fossil fuel movement which is artificially suppressing the supply of fossil fuels, fossil fuel investment, fossil fuel production, fossil fuel transportation, and fossil fuel refining - all aspects of the industry and that is a huge problem. "How could it possibly be a solution to punish them even more? This is more punishing of an industry that we want to make more profitable. We want this to be as appealing an industry as possible to go into so we can get a rapid increase in supply. Instead, they're giving more and more punishments to discourage people from being in the industry." Epstein referenced chapter 11 - "Reframing the conversation - Arguing to 100" from his book "Fossil Future." He explained the importance of the energy industry's actions to develop positive, confident messaging rather than the current practice of reacting to bad policies. He advocates for a focus on the message that the fossil fuel industry is making the world a better place for billions of people with confidence. He observed that what often happens in the fossil fuel industry is inaction and a loss of that focus. Epstein says the industry lets "the other side" define the issue in terms of negative side effects. "The key thing to do is NOT concede this idea of climate catastrophe or apocalypse. If people are afraid of "the Apocalypse", they are not going to think rationally. They are going to do everything they can to shut down the problem. So this idea of \~climate change, and climate catastrophe is very damaging and it's been very destructive for the industry to concede it."29dk2902l \</doc>

President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to address the Presidential Climate Commission on governments priority investment and financing interventions under the Just Energy Transition Investment Plan, this afternoon. According to the Presidency, the engagement of the commission will serve as preparation for the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference known as COP27 which is expected to be held in Egypt next week. The Presidential Climate Commission is focused on creating a social partnership around a just transition defining a vision for a just transition, and means of achieving that vision, covering the necessary sectoral shifts, technological innovation, employment opportunities, and climate finance, as well as conducting independent analysis into climate change impacts on jobs, the economy, and policy. The President will update the Commission in his capacity as Chair of this independent, statutory and multi-stakeholder body established to oversee and facilitate a just and equitable transition towards a low-emissions and climate-resilient economy, the Presidency said. South Africa has entered into a partnership with Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union. Under the Just Energy Transition Partnership, South Africa, ahead of COP27 , requires a financing package that is aligned to the countrys fiscal realities and demands, upholds the development and climate finance principles and obligations that are due to developing countries, and is inclusive and just, said the high office. At a media briefing on Friday morning, Presidential spokesperson, Vincent Magwenya, said the President will be accompanied to COP27 by Minister in the Presidency, Mondli Gungubele Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Dr Naledi Pandor and Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and Environment, Barbara Creecy. The Presidents focus will be on securing maximum ambition in terms of climate action, the honouring of previous commitments and the provision of enabling means of implementation support for developing countries, including South Africa. With COP27 taking place in Africa, it presents an opportunity to advance African priority issues, namely: raising the ambitions on mitigation, adaptation and support to developing countries advancing financing arrangements for loss and damage building on progress made in Glasgow on the importance of Just Transitions and advancing discussions on the special needs and circumstance of Africa, Magwenya said. \</doc>

Florestas de Valor operates in the regions of Amazonas and Par for the autonomy and sustainable development of communities. An example of bioeconomy for the conservation of the Amazon, the socio-environmental project Florestas de Valor will be presented, this Tuesday, 11/15, at the UN Conference on Climate Change - COP-27 , by the executive manager of Social Responsibility at Petrobras, Rafaela Guedes. Original Press Release: Nov. 14 -- Petrobras issued the following news release: Florestas de Valor operates in the regions of Amazonas and Par for the autonomy and sustainable development of communities An example of bioeconomy for the conservation of the Amazon, the socio-environmental project Florestas de Valor will be presented, this Tuesday, 11/15, at the UN Conference on Climate Change - COP-27 , by the executive manager of Social Responsibility at Petrobras, Rafaela Guedes. Developed in the municipalities of So Flix do Xingu, Oriximin and Alenquer, in the state of Par, and in the interior of Amazonas, in Nhamund, the basis of the project is the conservation of the forest through the sustainable management of non-wood products, such as chestnuts. -do-Brasil, aa, cocoa, cupuau, and copaba and andiroba oil. The project also works with training and awareness actions for local communities for the possibility of selling and expanding the markets for these products. Petrobras supports Florestas de Valor through the Petrobras Socio-environmental Program. During this period, more than seven thousand people were trained. The communities are part of a teaching-learning process and land use and management practices, which combine the conservation of natural resources, income generation and guarantee of the rights of traditional populations and workers. "Our objective in this project is to value the standing forest and empower local communities by promoting activities that generate income for them and at the same time conserve the forest. We work with the concept of socio-bioeconomy, agroecology and low-carbon agriculture, contributing to the increase of carbon stocks and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions at the same time that we encourage the growing autonomy of communities " highlights Rafaela Guedes, manager Social Responsibility Executive at Petrobras. In the community of Jarauac, for example, it was common to extract native trees such as Jata and Mari-Mari as a means of sustenance. Each tree was sold, on average, for R$ 300. With the work of Florestas de Valor in the region, the community understood a new form of livelihood: keeping the tree standing and extracting the copaiba oil, which today is sold for approximately R$ 30 a litre. One tree can produce up to 18 liters per harvest. In addition to raising awareness, residents become knowledge multipliers, many of whom carry out training in other communities to share the best sustainable oil extraction techniques. Gains of scale with the guarantee of origin system The first contract with the project contributed to the development and pilot implementation of an origin guarantee system for products from Protected Areas in the Xingu corridor, an initiative called Origins Brasil. This system guarantees the socio-environmental certification of the origin of the products, the traceability of the production chain and the possibility of increasing the scale of production in a sustainable way. "With the Floresta de Valor project, we are developing more consumer markets that value the guarantee of origin and traceability of products. Based on this, our expectation is that the income generated for the communities involved will reach R$ 4 million by 2025", comments Rafaela Guedes. Petrobras Socio-environmental The company's participation in COP-27 demonstrates Petrobras' commitment to being part of the global dialogue on climate change and the challenges of decarbonization. Through the Petrobras Socio-environmental Program, Petrobras seeks to strengthen and empower local communities, promoting sustainable economic and social development. So far, more than R$1 billion has been voluntarily invested in socio-environmental projects. Initiatives aimed at sustainable economic development are supported; education; conservation of coastal and marine biodiversity; and conservation of forests and natural areas. Petrobras currently supports projects developed in the Atlantic Forest, Amazon, Caatinga and Cerrado biomes. In 2021, these projects worked on the recovery or conservation of about 3% of the domestic territory (more than 175 thousand hectares of forests and natural areas, in addition to the strengthening of more than 25 million hectares of protected areas).

November 25 -- The Union Minister of Environment Forest and Climate Change Shri Bhupender Yadav addressed the special United Nations Country Team (UNCT) on the key themes and takeaways from CoP 27 at UN House, today. The meeting was followed by the inauguration of the Climate Change Photo Exhibition with the Swiss Embassy at the UN House in New Delhi. Shri Bhupender Yadav at the Special meeting of UNTC \~ \~ Mr Shombi Sharp, United Nations Resident Coordinator in India, congratulated the Government of India on its vitally important contributions made at the recently concluded CoP 27 at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. He remarked that India's bold leadership on the climate agenda, and the innovative solutions increasingly emerging from government and private sector partners in India, are a beacon to the world for a more sustainable, just and equitable global future. In his address to the special UNCT meeting, Shri Bhupender Yadav said: "Ladies and Gentlemen, I am happy to be amongst you all in this special meeting with UN Country team which focuses on key takeaways and outcomes from recently concluded COP 27 . I have just returned from COP27 and I am sure you would have followed its proceedings and read its outcomes. It was an implementation COP with a headline outcome on funding arrangements including a dedicated loss and damage fund. Today, I would like to hear your views on your approach to operationalize the COP27 outcomes in India, in keeping with our National Development Priorities. At COP26 in Glasgow, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi shared his vision of LiFE - Lifestyles for Environment as a key approach to promoting sustainability and combating climate change. Since then, much work has been done to translate this vision into a plan of action. Mission LiFE was conceptualized to take forward this message to the global community. The UNSG has reinforced the importance of Mission LiFE, by participating in its launch event on 20th October at Kevadia, with PM Shri Narendra Modi. I am glad to share that the cover decision of COP-27 , called Sharm el-Sheikh implementation plan, notes the importance of transition to sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of consumption and production for efforts to combat climate change. India seeks to involve a billion people in this global mass movement of Mission LiFE. We made a start, with several LiFE related events at the India Pavilion during COP27 . I appreciate the involvement of UNEP and UNDP in these events. One immediate task ahead is to create a LiFE compendium of global best practices on sustainable lifestyles. This will be a comprehensive repository containing best practices from around the world. I understand that UN INDIA is already working with NITI Aayog and MoEFCC in this regard. There could be many other ways to roll out the COP27 decision on transition to sustainable lifestyles. For example, UN India could consider organising a global conference on Mission LiFE during India's G20 Presidency. Many UN agencies are implementing agencies under GEF and some are also accredited entities under GCF. We are now preparing a shelf of projects for the GEF 8 cycle. I expect that outcomes of COP27 on sustainable lifestyles, climate action in agriculture, mitigation work program and just transition would be factored in appropriately, in the upcoming projects. COP27 has established a 4-year work program on climate action in agriculture and food security. Agriculture, the mainstay of livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers, will be hard hit from climate change. We look at the agriculture sector primarily as a sector for adaptation and building climate resilience. We should not burden our smallholder farmers and pastoralists with mitigation responsibilities. FAO, in particular, may note that India has kept mitigation in agriculture out of its NDCs. COP27 has also established a work program on just transition. For most developing countries, just transition cannot be equated with decarbonisation, but with low-carbon development. Developing countries retain the right to choose their energy mix and in achieving the SDGs. Just transition is not just an issue for individual countries, it is also about a global just transition. Developed countries taking the lead in climate action is therefore a very important aspect of the global just transition. At COP27 UN agencies anchor many environment conventions and treaties. I would insist that the UN system remains steadfast in the protection of foundational principles of each of these conventions and treaties in its work in different countries. For India, the principles of equity and CBDR-RC in the light of national circumstances remains, paramount. I urge you to ensure that these foundational principles are respected when you prepare projects for implementation in India. Red-tapism is the bane of all bureaucracies and I am afraid it does not spare the UN system either. Many reporting requirements under the multilateral environment conventions and treaties are funded through GEF projects. With these thoughts, I thank you for organising this interaction and I look forward to hearing your views." \</doc>

H.E. Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Chairman of the World Green Economy Organization (WGEO), highlighted how the organization is promoting effective discussions on nature-based solutions and its impact on climate action during an engagement with stakeholders, at the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ), held from November 6 to 18, 2022, at Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Co-hosted by UNFCCC - WGEO and HSBC Middle East, the session titled The Role of Green Economy in Nature-based Solutions, featured a series of multistakeholder dialogues exploring the role biodiversity plays in the protection of humankind and the financing required to protect both the preservation of Nature and people. HE Al Tayer emphasized how nature-based solutions or processes could significantly minimise climate change and its effects while also addressing the regional challenges, such as air, water, and soil pollution, as well as stressed on the value of social inclusion, the role of international collaboration, social innovation, and the private sector in advancing the development of nature-based solutions. HE Al Tayer delivered the opening remarks for the session. The session was moderated by David Ramos Senior Sustainability Manager, HSBC Bank Middle East; along with other prominent members including HE Hussein Makhlouf, local Administration and Environment Minister of the Syrian Arab Republic, HE Ahmed Buti Al Muhairbi, Secretary-General of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, Dr. Mostafa Foda National Focal Point for Convention of Biodiversity in Egypt, Waleed Salman, Vice Chairman of WGEO and Abdulrahim Sultan, Director-General of WGEO. HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Chairman, WGEO, in his speech said: The world is witnessing major crises across all sectors due to climate change, which has caused natural disasters in various regions worldwide. Europe experienced its worst drought in at least 500 years, shrinking water levels in key rivers. One third of Pakistan was completely and deeply flooded with rainwater bringing widespread destruction and misery. The Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicates that climate change will impact water quality and availability. Globally, 800 million to 3 billion people are projected to experience chronic water scarcity due to droughts at 2C warming. This calls for climate action at all levels, to protect economies, livelihoods, and ecosystems. HE Al Tayer further stated, What is needed today is solutions that address several challenges at once. Transitioning to a green economy as well as resorting to nature-based solutions will contribute to enhancing food and water security, address climate change and biodiversity loss, and strengthen the response to disasters. Climate-smart agriculture, forestation, and natural ecosystems restoration are multi-faceted, serving the economy, people and the climate response. Platforms like COP 27 not only allow global stakeholders to have their voices heard, but also provide a forum to address climate change, share best practices and build commitments. Most significantly, such platforms make sure that all stakeholders are fully committed to and involved in all measures intended to curtail climate change. This will help the society and wildlife in successfully adapting and ensure preservation of the ecosystem on planet Earth. The UAE attaches great importance to adopting the principles and practices of green economy to achieve sustainable development and combat the repercussions of climate change. The UAE is leading this effort by setting a framework for achieving net-zero emissions, launching green initiatives, and ambitious national strategies and policies that will help reduce carbon emissions and adapt to climate change, as well as find a smooth path towards achieving economic prosperity that goes in parallel with environmental sustainability. To support the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 and the Dubai Net Zero Carbon Emissions Strategy 2050 to provide 100% of the total power production capacity from clean energy sources by 2050, Dubai launched major strategic initiatives and development projects. These projects, built through Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), include the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, the worlds largest single-site solar park using the Independent Power Producer (IPP) model with a production capacity of 5,000 megawatts by 2030; the pumped-storage hydroelectric power plant in Hatta using clean energy, which is the first of its kind in the GCC region; and the Green Hydrogen project that DEWA implemented at the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai. It is the first pilot project of its kind in the Middle East and North Africa for green hydrogen production, Al Tayer said. H.E. Saeed Al Tayer also emphasised the importance of nature-based solutions to enhance food and water security, address climate change and biodiversity loss, and strengthen the response to disasters, as well as how the UAE places strong focus on transitioning to a green economy. Bridging these elements is also a priority, to make the implementation process as efficient, and effective as possible. Advancing the green economy requires international cooperation, guaranteeing a new approach and a stable partnership among all stakeholders globally. In this respect, the UAE government, along with WGEO, have launched the Global Alliance on Green Economy in September 2022, aiming to advance policymaking and implementation towards a green economy, at the global, regional, and national levels. Solutions under the Alliance will address the transition, climate change and sustainable development. \</doc>

As the United Nations (UN) Climate Conference ( COP 27 ) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, progresses into its final week, Fiji is at the forefront of the negotiations to mobilise support for local communities and families who are affected by the adverse impacts of the climate crisis in Fiji. The head of the Fijian delegation at COP27 , Fijis Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Satyendra Prasad, today spoke at the Blue Economy Financing Models for the Pacific Island Countries at the COP27 side event collaboratively organised by the Fijian Government and Monash University. In his remarks, Ambassador Prasad said as a large ocean state, blue finance is not only central to Fiji, but a key player in economic recovery and the pandemic recovery. He said Fiji has partnered with the Monash University recently to establish a Monash- FNU Pacific Island Countries Climate Change Research Centre, known as PACT (Pacific Actions for Climate Transition) A Monash FNU Climate Change Centre- which will be launched next year, will assist the policymakers and development partners in Fiji, to device solutions for climate change from the business and economic perspectives. Ambassador Prasad said the initiative affirms the government-academia partnership to advance result-oriented solutions that have solidarity at the heart of it. He highlighted that Fijis Sustainable Bond Framework launched last week at COP27 , will clearly articulate the blue economy projects and criteria with potential investors while ensuring consistency and transparency of projects, be it in the blue, green or even social space. One such initiative includes the Pacific Blue Shipping Partnership, which aims to reduce shipping emissions in line with International Maritime Organization's (IMO) targets and enhance shipping safety in the region. Initiatives outlined included Fijis NDC (Nationally Determined Contributions) investment plans, sector-based climate proposals, Fijis E-Bus initiative, nature-based solutions, adaptation-mitigation and marine proposals that have secured funding opportunities and are ready to be further scaled up. Ambassador Prasad spoke on Fiji's national climate finance strategy and the Green Climate Fund (GCF) proposals- which require easier and faster access to climate finance and preparatory support to bring these initiatives to fruition. He called for long-term visions, protection and conservation to be at the core of financing investments to deliver a sustainable future and that the Pacifics Blue economy ambitions require capital investors who are focused more on the impact rather than returns. Fijis initiatives such as upcoming blue bonds, and regional partnerships for smart investments with the support of the development partners, were also discussed at the event. In conclusion, Ambassador Prasad reminded the delegates at COP 27 that a Blue Economy is a global economy- all our seas connect to one ocean, and the motto is clear -- we are one and our fight is one- to maintain the health of our oceans and to invest in us in order to maintain the lifeblood and the blue lungs of our planet. \</doc>

November 09 -- The Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI), led by a 13-member steering committee of African leaders, CEOs, and carbon credit experts, was launched at COP27 to support the growth of carbon credits production and create jobs in Africa. ACMI announced a bold ambition for the continent to reach 300 million credits offered annually by 2030. This level of supplies would unlock US$6 billion in income and support 30 million jobs. By 2050, ACMI is targeting over 1.5 billion credits annually in Africa, leveraging over $120 billion and supporting over 110 million jobs. \~ ACMI's ambition is for the growth of African voluntary carbon markets to: Produce 300 million carbon credits annually by 2030, and 1.5 billion credits annually by 2050. Unlock 6 billion in revenue by 2030 and over 120 billion by 2050. Support 30 million jobs by 2030 and over 110 million jobs by 2050. Distribute revenue equitably and transparently with local communities. African nations including Kenya, Malawi, Gabon, Nigeria and Togo shared their commitments to collaborating with ACMI to scale up carbon credit production via voluntary carbon market activation plans. The initiative was inaugurated at COP 27 in collaboration with The Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP), Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), and the UN Economic Commission for Africa, with the support of the UN Climate Change High Level Champions - Mahmoud Mohieldin and Nigel Topping. ACMI released Africa Carbon Markets Initiative, Roadmap report: Harnessing carbon markets for Africa at the initiative's COP 27 launch event. The report identifies 13 action programs to support the growth of voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) on the continent. Though voluntary carbon markets are already growing quickly, retirements of African credits have grown by an average of 36 per cent annually over the past five years, aggressive action will be required to maintain this level of growth over the coming decades. ACMI is working with major carbon credit buyers and financiers, such as Exchange Trading Group,\~Nando's, and\~Standard Chartered, to set up an advance market commitment for hundreds of millions of dollars for high-integrity African carbon credits. For example, mobilizing $500 million, at an average price of $10 per carbon credit, could support the development and delivery of at least 50 MtCO2e, which is equivalent to the total credits retired from Africa from 2010 through 2020. \</doc>

At the Annual Climate Change Summit ( COP27 ), today was a day dedicated to science. In this framework, Peru held the event From the Andes to the Alps: monitoring of mountain ecosystems as a contribution to the Nationally Determined Contributions, together with the Italian Ministry of Ecological Transition. In this regard, the head of the Peruvian delegation at COP27 and general director of Climate Change and Desertification of the Ministry of the Environment (Minam), Milagros Sandoval, highlighted the collaborative work between both nations, which is long-standing, in order to promote joint actions that contribute to adopting urgent measures to combat climate change. One of these initiatives is the IMELS project for the adaptation and mitigation of climate change, which has contributed to the generation of studies linked to the monitoring of mountain ecosystems to adopt adaptation actions in the face of the climate crisis in the vulnerable population and in the productive systems that depend on water from glaciers, he said, during the meeting that takes place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. The deputy director of Knowledge Management and Capacity Building of the National Institute for Research on Glaciers and Mountain Ecosystems (Inaigem), Daniel Martnez, presented evidence of the impact of climate change on mountains, snow-capped mountains and lakes of glacial origin, which represents a potential danger to the population. Likewise, he presented the work carried out by said entity attached to the Minam in the monitoring of the Huascarn (Ancash) and Huaytapallana (Junn) glaciers, at altitudes close to 5000 meters above sea level. He then highlighted the importance of the bofedales or wetlands of the highlands in Peru, which represent an important reserve of carbon and water. Science for action - During todays session at COP 27 , its president, Sameh Shoukry, highlighted the role of science in providing critical evidence to drive the sense of urgency in climate action. While we cant turn back the clock on melting glaciers and reverse global emissions, we can stop some of the impact of climate change by turning to science to find solutions, he remarked. - In that context, Egypt released its first Vulnerability Assessment Map, which was based on data from the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts on Climate Change. \</doc>

Vice President Faisal Naseem stressed on Tuesday the importance of asserting the urgency and seriousness that climate change deserves to protect the planets most vulnerable places and communities. He made the statement while speaking at the high-level roundtable on Climate Change and Sustainability of Vulnerable Communities, held as part of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Addressing the debate, the Vice President stressed that the worlds most vulnerable countries are at the frontlines of the climate crisis and at the greatest risk of losing lives and livelihoods. We need to change the narrative. We cannot be going about business as usual, he added. Shedding light on the recent flooding in Pakistan that affected 33 million people and destroyed 1.7 million homes, the Vice President warned that similar events would likely become more frequent as global temperatures continue to rise. Noting that food and water security, human health, and biodiversity will be drastically affected even in a 1.5-degree world, he underscored the need to address such transboundary issues with a global response and drastically scale up finance and action. For many countries, loss and damage is already a reality and will become more so the slower we act on mitigation and adaptation, he warned. One very troubling example for Maldives concerns coral reefs, the source of so much of our culture and livelihood. Citing predictions by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that global warming of 1.5C will result in the disappearance of between 70 and 90 per cent of coral reefs, the Vice President stressed that it would have detrimental effects on the Maldives in terms of jobs, tourism, fisheries, and the loss of entire ecosystems. Before the debate, the Vice President visited the pavilions at the Sharm El-Sheikh International Convention Center and met with a Maldivian student from Hira School who was attending COP27 . \</doc>

Opening remarks by the Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, Ms Barbara Creecy, at the PRE- COP27 negotiations in the Democratic Republic of Congo Ms Eve Bazaiba Minister for the Environment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Mr Sameh Shoukry COP 27 President Designate Ms Amina Mohammed United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Excellencies Climate change remains the greatest challenge of our generation and Africa is one of the most impacted regions due to multiple factors, including heavy dependence on climate sensitive sectors, low adaptive capacity, underdevelopment, and limited access to finance and technology. Despite having contributed insignificantly to climate change, Africa has continued to make substantial investments towards climate change adaptation, using mostly its own domestic resources. This has been necessitated by the failure of developed countries that bear the historical responsibility to fully honour their obligation to provide means of implementation support to developing countries and inadequate or inappropriate multilateral and private sector financing. COP 27 is thus a critical moment for all of us in Africa. This COP, which is taking place on African soil, must deliver meaningful and substantive progress on adaptation, Loss and Damage and means of implementation support for African and other developing countries. COP27 further needs to focus on supporting a people-centred, just and equitable transition in the developing world. The urgent need is to adapt now, while we build resilience for the future. We can only avoid loss and minimize damage with the appropriate scale of public finance that does not exacerbate the indebtedness of Africa. For too long these issues of critical importance to Africa have seen only process-related outcomes in the UNFCCC negotiations, due to the mitigation-centric approach of developed countries. COP 27 must ensure that the outcome on Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) increases the actual resilience of our population to the adverse impacts of climate change by at least 50% by 2030 and by at least 90% by 2050. Focus must be placed on the most vulnerable people and communities; in order to support health and well-being; food and water security; infrastructure and the built environment; as well as ecosystems and ecosystem services. We also need an outcome on a key set of adaptation finance goals as part of the GGA, focusing on core adaptation support in a range of sectors, and also as part of the deliberations on a new collective quantified goal on finance; and present a clear roadmap to deliver on the Glasgow decision to double adaptation finance by 2025. This roadmap, as stated in the AMCEN Dakar decisions, should include projected annual contributions, the timing of such contributions, and the multilateral institutions that will channel these resources to developing countries. \</doc>

"Supporting climate-smart development in Africa is extremely pertinent. Climate change is a looming threat to Africa. The continent is the most vulnerable region to climate disasters," Pravind Kumar Jugnauth, Prime Minister of Mauritius said at the conference opening. ECA is working with partners to support the development of just energy transition plans in many African countries, tapping the continent's abundant clean energy resources. It is also working with African Export-Import Bank, the Africa Finance Cooperation, the African Development Bank, and other partners to leverage the African Continental Free Trade Area to use Africa's abundant clean energy resources to transform the continent's minerals. Key Highlight:  Estimates show that Africa suffers $7-15 billion per year in GDP losses to climate change, which are projected to rise to $45-50 billion per year by 2040. Original Press Release: "Supporting climate-smart development in Africa is extremely pertinent. Climate change is a looming threat to Africa. The continent is the most vulnerable region to climate disasters," Pravind Kumar Jugnauth, Prime Minister of Mauritius said at the conference opening. Prime Minister Jugnauth stressed how the rise in petroleum prices caused by Russia's war in Ukraine war should quicken Africa's motivation to shift away from fossil fuels and become self-sufficient in electricity production. "In order to face the challenges of climate change more effectively Africa needs the support and assistance of development partners," he added. The largest pan-African economic meeting is being held under the theme "supporting climate-smart development in Africa." It is bringing together various stakeholders- policymakers, climate experts, the private sector, researchers, and youth-to discuss and draft an action plan to support the low-carbon and climate-resilient development of Africa. In a speech read by Acting Chief Economist and Vice-President, Prof. Kevin Urama, the African Development Bank President Dr. Akinwumi Adesina underscored the urgency of Africa adapting to climate change. "Africa is suffering from the devastating effects of climate change, from droughts, floods, irregular rainfall, locusts, and armyworms, he said. "Supporting climate-smart, environmentally friendly development is one step in the right direction," he said. Estimates show that Africa suffers $7-15 billion per year in GDP losses to climate change, which are projected to rise to $45-50 billion per year by 2040. During COP27 , the African Development Bank and its partners launched the Alliance for Green Infrastructure in Africa to speed up the development of green infrastructure in Africa. In her remarks, Assistant Administrator and Director of the Regional Bureau for Africa at the United Nations Development Program, Ahunna Eziakonwa, emphasized that Africa's path to attaining Sustainable Development Goals must be climate smart. "In 2022, we have seen a climate emergency hitting with increasing intensity. At the same time, climate-change-induced drought is precipitating hunger and even famine in regions such as the Horn of Africa," she added. "Protecting the planet cannot be an option, it is an urgent priority." Speaking on the recently concluded United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP 27 , she said: "While COP27 in Egypt did not achieve the drastic reduction in emissions that the world needs, it did see the establishment of funding arrangements for loss and damage." Ahunna told participants about a new partnership between the Global Environment Facility, the United Nations Development Programme, the African Development Bank, and the Rocky Mountain Institute. Together they will support new solar battery mini-grid markets in 21 countries in Africa. Deputy Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, Dr. Hanan Morsy observed that the theme of this year's conference provides the opportunities to digest and synthesize the discussions at COP 27 and propose recommendations for supporting climate-smart development in Africa. "Africa needs to close huge development gaps by investing substantially in key sectors such as energy, agriculture, transport, water, and cities, among others. These sectors are all very vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change," Morsy said. ECA is working with partners to support the development of just energy transition plans in many African countries, tapping the continent's abundant clean energy resources. It is also working with African Export-Import Bank, the Africa Finance Cooperation, the African Development Bank, and other partners to leverage the African Continental Free Trade Area to use Africa's abundant clean energy resources to transform the continent's minerals. The idea is to "support regional and global value chains related to the global drive for net zero emissions," Morsy said. The African Economic Conference is jointly hosted by the African Development Bank, the Economic Commission for Africa, and the United Nations Development Program.

According to a fact sheet on the specific impacts on India - which uses data from the report but is not itself a part of the report - climate change is affecting almost every pillar of food security. Ahead of this year's United Nations climate change conference ( COP27 "Our report this year reveals we are at a critical juncture. We see how climate change is driving severe health impacts all around the world, while the persistent global fossil fuel dependence compounds these health harms amidst multiple global crises, keeping households vulnerable to volatile fossil fuel markets, exposed to energy poverty, and dangerous levels of air pollution," Dr Marina Romanello, Executive Director of the Lancet Countdown at the University College London said. Dr Romanello is co-author of The 2022 report of the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: health at the mercy of fossil fuels. "New findings presented in the seventh annual global report of the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change reveal that governments and companies continue to follow strategies that increasingly threaten the health and survival of all people alive today, and of future generations," an official release on the report said. The report represents the work of 99 experts from 51 institutions, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), the release said. According to a fact sheet on the specific impacts on India - which uses data from the report but is not itself a part of the report - climate change is affecting almost every pillar of food security:  The duration of the growth season for maize has decreased by 2%, compared to a 1981-2010 baseline, while rice and winter wheat have each decreased by 1%.  From 2012-2021, infants under one year old experienced an average of 72 million more person-days of heatwaves per year, compared to 1985-2005. For the same period, adults over 65 experienced 301 million more person-days. This means that, on average, from 2012-2021, each infant experienced an additional 0.9 heatwave days per year while adults over 65 experienced an additional 3.7 per person, compared to 1986-2021.  From 2000-2004 to 2017-2021, heat-related deaths increased by 55% in India.  In 2021, Indians lost 167.2 billion potential labour hours due to heat exposure with income losses equivalent to about 5.4% of national GDP.  From 1951-1960 to 2012-2021, the number of months suitable for dengue transmission by Aedes aegypti rose by 1.69%, reaching 5.6 months each year. "These are early warnings and we need to take mitigation measures like adapting heat action plans in each city. For instance, the Ahmedabad heat action plan that has shown mortality can be reduced, should be adapted everywhere," Ahmedabad-based public health expert and Director, Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar, Dr Dilip Mavalankar, told The Indian Express. Dr Sundeep Salvi, Chairperson, Global Burden of Diseases-India for respiratory diseases, said the burning of dirty fuels needs to be minimised as soon as possible to reduce the accompanying health impacts. "Global warming and climate change is intricately related to human health and India needs to do something seriously in this space," Dr Salvi said. Neither Dr Mavalankar nor Dr Salvi were involved in the preparation of the report. \</doc>

The 56th session of the two permanent working bodies of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body on Science and Technology - is taking place in Bonn, Germany, from 6 to 16 June. Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice-SBSTA. The purpose of the session is to continue and upgrade the work that began at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) and preparations for COP27 to be held in November 2022 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The EU and its Member States, including Slovenia, will strive to make the greatest possible and steady progress in the areas of climate change mitigation and adaptation, and in terms of climate finance. The meeting is the basis for negotiations and decisions on COP27 , in particular on mitigation, adaptation to climate change, losses and damage, and climate finance. One of the central themes is also the in-depth implementation of the commitments made at COP26. The meeting is attended by representatives of the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning. On the first day of the meeting, the participants were addressed for the last time by Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, who emphasized the importance of political guidelines for the successful continuation of international climate negotiations. Achieving the 1.5-degree goal of limiting global warming, to which we committed ourselves at the last COP26 meeting, will require strengthening our climate ambition, taking into account the latest scientific knowledge. The EU and its Member States, including Slovenia, will strive to make the greatest possible and steady progress in the areas of climate change mitigation and adaptation, and in terms of climate finance. In doing so, the EU will encourage all follow-up to be based on science, in particular the reports of the International Climate Change Forum (IPCC), such as the last issue of the Climate Change Mitigation Report of the 3rd IPCC Working Group in April this year. In international climate negotiations, the EU will emphasize the importance of implementing commitments in the critical period up to 2030, for which the EU has set an ambitious target of reducing emissions by at least 55% and is currently in the process of reviewing climate and energy legislation to achieve this goal. \</doc>

Sharm El-Sheikh (Egypt), Nov 9 (IANS) In response to the devastating impacts of climate change affecting vulnerable people all over the world, the COP27 Presidency launched the Sharm-El-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda in partnership with the High-Level Champions and the Marrakech Partnership. The Agenda outlines 30 Adaptation Outcomes to enhance resilience for 4 billion people living in the most climate vulnerable communities by 2030. Each outcome presents global solutions that can be adopted at a local level to respond to local climate contexts, needs and risks and deliver the systems transformation required to protect vulnerable communities to the rising climate hazards, such as extreme heat, drought, flooding, or extreme weather. It comes as research warns that nearly half the world's population will be at severe risk of climate change impacts by 2030, even in a 1.5-degree world, according to analysis published by IPCC AR6 WG II Report and the UN Climate Change High-Level Climate Champions. Collectively, these outcomes represent the first comprehensive global plan to rally both state and non-state actors behind a shared set of adaptation actions that are required by the end of this decade across five impact systems: food and agriculture, water and nature, coastal and oceans, human settlements, and infrastructure, and including enabling solutions for planning and finance. The 30 Adaptation Outcomes include urgent global 2030 targets related to: Transitioning to climate resilient, sustainable agriculture that can increase yields by 17 per cent and reduce farm level greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 21 per cent, without expanding agricultural frontiers, and whileA improving livelihoods including of smallholder farmers. Protecting and restoring an estimated 400 million hectares in critical areas (land and freshwater ecosystems) supporting indigenous and local communities with use of nature-based solutions to improve water security and livelihoods and to transform 2 billion hectares of land into sustainable management. Protecting 3 billion people by installing smart and early warning systems and investing $4 billion to secure the future of 15 million hectares of mangroves through collective action to halt loss, restore, double protection and ensure sustainable finance for all existing mangroves. In a sign of recognition of this major milestone for the global adaptation process, the Adaptation Agenda is being driven by the COP27 Presidency, the High-Level Champions and Marrakech Partnership and underpinned by the 2,000 plus organisations spanning 131 countries in the Race to Resilience campaign. At the launch on Tuesday, COP27 President and Egypt's Minister of Foreign Affairs Sameh Shoukry and High-Level Champions Mahmoud Mohieldin and Nigel Topping, called on all state and non-state actors to get behind this critical agenda. Shoukry said: "It is our aspiration that the Sharm-El-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda represents a significant contribution to enhancing global action on adaptation and resilience as an utmost priority. "The COP 27 COP27 Presidency at COP27 that shall accelerate action across system interventions and b) the adaptation and resilience outcome targets identified by the High-Level Champions. "The Marrakech Partnership, the High-Level Champions and a number of specialised UN agencies will work together, as partners, to accelerate an agenda of global adaptation action through following up on the implementation of Sharm-El-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda. "The COP 27 The agenda emphasises the urgency for counting with evidence-based, actionable adaptation plans for all actors, making climate risks visible and accessible, and to deploy the locally-led adaptation principles. vg/ksk/ \</doc>

ATT, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Department of Energys Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne) today announced the launch of the Climate Risk and Resilience Portal (ClimRR), which advances access to cutting-edge science for climate projections to help improve Americas preparedness for future climate extremes.This announcement comes as world leaders gather for the United Nations climate change conference COP27 . Using climate science modeling that is among the most sophisticated methodologies worldwide, ClimRR gives state, local, tribal and territorial emergency managers and community leaders free access to localized data about future climate risks that can be used to explore strategies for resilience. Initial hazards included in ClimRR are temperature, precipitation, wind and drought conditions. Additional risks, such as wildfire and flooding, will be added in the coming months. FEMAs collaboration on ClimRR and the Biden-Harris Administrations recently released Climate Mapping for Resilience and Adaptation (CMRA) assessment tool represent the federal commitment to making climate science data available so communities across America can make risk-informed investments to become more resilient. ATT originally commissioned Argonnes Center for Climate Resilience and Decision Science to produce the climate projections in ClimRR for the companys own adaptation efforts. Through this collaboration, ATT has made the data used in ClimRR publicly available. \</doc>

NEW DELHI, NOV 04, 2022: UNION Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Bhupender Yadav, will be leading Indian delegation to attend the 27th Session of Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC ( COP 27 ) scheduled to be held at Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt from 6-18 November, 2022. India is fully engaged with the process and is supportive of the efforts by Government of Egypt for substantive outcomes at COP 27 . In the 56 th Session of the Subsidiary Bodies held in June 2022 in Bonn, developing countries made it clear that UNFCCC is the centre of the collective and multilateral response to the issue of climate change. There must be a faithful, balanced and comprehensive implementation of the Convention and the Paris Agreement, in accordance with its goals and principles. India looks forward to substantial progress on the discussions related to climate finance and clarity on its definition. As it is a saying that "what gets measured gets done", more clarity is needed on the definition of climate finance for the developing countries to be able to accurately assess the extent of finance flows for climate action. While the Standing Committee on finance will submit a report on the various definitions, we hope to have good deliberations on this to arrive at a common understanding. The interpretation of the term must be in line with the commitments made by the countries on climate finance in the Convention and its Paris Agreement. The goal of USD100 billion per year of climate finance by 2020 and every year thereafter through till 2025 is yet to be achieved. Due to lack of common understanding, several estimates of what has flown as climate finance are available. While the promised amount must be reached as quickly as possible, there is a need now to substantially enhance the ambition to ensure adequate resource flow under the new quantified goal post-2024. The discussion on the new collective quantified goal in the ad-hoc working group must focus on the quantity of the resource flow and also on the quality and scope. Issues relating to access to and suggestions for improvement in the function of the financial mechanisms are also important. Besides this, improvement in transparency to ensure appropriate oversight of the quantum and direction of flows is imperative. The Ad hoc working group must provide advice/ suggestions covering all the above aspects. Strengthening of the financial mechanisms of UNFCCC and its operating entities is imperative to meet the climate finance delivery goals. There needs to be a greater discussion on this as resources available to them should be utilized well. The SCF could also play an important role in assessing the shortcomings and may suggest appropriate measures to address them. The Egyptian Presidency of COP27 , which is also a member of the Like Minded Developing Countries, has rightfully named COP 27 as the COP of "Implementation". India welcomes this step as over the last twelve months the world has seen the widening gap between the statements by developed countries at COP 26 in Glasgow and the reality of their actions. India will support the Egyptian Presidency, for a plan of action that answers the needs of developing countries. Adaptation and loss and damage are two issues at the centre of attention, and a progress on these two issues will complement each other. Loss and damage must also be on the agenda of COP27 and there must be specific progress on the issue of loss and damage finance. The existing financial mechanisms, like GEF, GCF and Adaptation Fund, under the Convention have not been able to mobilise or deliver funds for loss and damage due to climate change. These mechanisms are under-funded; accessing funding is cumbersome and time-consuming; and most of the funding is for mitigation. Adaptation funding is highly inadequate and loss and damage funding is perhaps none at all. These are the circumstances based on which G77 and China has proposed adoption of an agenda item on loss and damage finance. It is the time that this issue is accorded prominence on the climate agenda that it rightfully deserves. On the Global Goal on Adaptation, there needs to be significant progress on actions, indicators and metrics. There must not be any hidden agenda of mitigation, especially in the form of nature-based solutions, in the name of co-benefits. The Work Programme on Enhanced Ambition in Mitigation and Implementation cannot be allowed to change the goal posts set by the Paris Agreement. The GST process and the other mechanisms of the Paris Agreement, including enhanced NDCs and submission of the long-term low emissions development strategies, are sufficient. In the Mitigation Work Programme best practices, new technologies and new modes of collaboration for technology transfer and capacity building may be discussed fruitfully. On the issue of finance, a discussion on Article 2.1 (c), a sub-clause of article 2, cannot be opened as a standalone COP27 agenda item at this stage. Article 2(1) (c) has to be read in conjunction with entire article 2 as well as article 9 on climate finance. Reaching the USD 100 billion per year goal must come first, and the developed countries must be asked to show the roadmap for the same. India will emphasize again on its invitation to all countries to join the LiFE movement - Lifestyle for Environment, a pro-people and pro-planet effort that seeks to shift the world from mindless and wasteful consumption to mindful and deliberate utilization of natural resources. India is committed to both domestic action and multilateral cooperation on climate change, and will continue to fight all global environmental concerns in the call to protect humanity's planetary home. But global warming also warns that equity and international cooperation, leaving no one behind, hold the key to success, where the most fortunate must lead the way. \</doc>

A traditional welcome ceremony was accorded to Pacific Island member countries attending the 6th Pacific Water and Wastewater Ministers Forum and the 13th Pacific Water and Wastewater Conference and Expo in Nadi this morning (14/11/22). Several Pacific Island Ministers, Heads of Delegation and Chief Executive Officers are attending the meeting to discuss the challenges faced by Pacific Islanders while accessing clean drinking water and proper sanitation. Speaking at the opening ceremony, Minister for Infrastructure and Meteorological Services, Jone Usamate highlighted that a collaborative approach towards ensuring access to clean water and treatment of wastewater is the way forward. The challenges faced by us in the Pacific revolves around the effects of climate change on resources, lack of climate-resilient infrastructure, ensuring availability of water for the coming generation and mitigating environment risks when it comes to human activities. It is very timely for all of us to converge and collaborate as many of our Pacific Island countries and territories leaders are in Egypt for the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), sharing experiences about the crucial role of water in climate action. As Pacific Island countries, we have an opportunity-seeking greater global attention at the UN 2023 Water Conference that would further strengthen our role in the Pacific for increasing accessibility of water and sanitation services. It is the second time Fiji is hosting this event under the theme Resilience and Water Security. \</doc>

The members of the Peruvian delegation that participates in the XXVII Conference of the Parties on Climate Change ( COP27 ), which takes place in the city of Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, today held a meeting to evaluate the progress in climate negotiations and issues that are of priority interest to our country. According to the head of said delegation and general director of Climate Change and Desertification of the Ministry of the Environment (Minam), Milagros Sandoval, the meeting addressed the inclusion of the issue of loss and damage due to climate change, an important milestone especially in countries developing and small island states. He argued that this issue is of special interest to Peru because the effects of climate change are evident in the glacial retreat of our mountain ranges. As is known, in 2018 there was a loss of around 1,200 km2 of glaciers (53.56%, according to the National Glacier Inventory). In her turn, the director of Adaptation to Climate Change and Desertification of Minam, Cristina Rodrguez, pointed out that at COP 27 efforts are being made to reach agreements on the financing required in the face of the existing gaps due to losses and damages caused by the dangers associated with the climate crisis. She added that developing countries have reiterated the urgent need for more support to implement their national adaptation plans. Negotiations have focused on how to move forward to make the Santiago Network operational, which will contribute to providing technical assistance to countries in terms of loss and damage, he said. This first meeting was headed by the Peruvian ambassador to the United Nations, Manuel Rodrguez Cuadros, with the presence of representatives from Minam, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, indigenous or native peoples, the private sector, and society. civil, among others. \</doc>

By Rachael Nath, RNZ Pacific journalist After two weeks of negotiations at the United Nations ' Climate Change Conference ( COP27 Diplomats have created proposals on the controversial loss and damage agenda that will be decided upon by politicians. Robust discussions at the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh have seen many collaborations and discord resulting in negotiators not reaching agreement on funding that would see vulnerable countries compensated for climate change-fuelled disasters caused by developed nations. A key milestone was reached on Friday morning (New Zealand time), when the European Union shifted its position to support the G7 and China which includes Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and the Pacific. However, developing nations and their allies have been able to stir up support, with major voting in favour for the set up of a loss and damage facility. Australia has chosen to keep the discussion open while the US maintained an isolated position, showing no flexibility. Now, there are three options on the table for politicians to agree upon and they were due to be debated over the next few hours. [embedded content] Climate change with Al Jazeera. The Pacific's call The Pacific through the G7 and China has stressed the urgency of establishing a loss and damage framework at this COP. Fiame said more action was needed on upscaling ambition on funding for loss and damage and must remain firmly on the table as nations continued to witness increasing occurrences and severity of climate change impacts everywhere. Samoa Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata£fa . . . the climate needs the same urgent response that was applied to the covid-19 pandemic. Image: Tipi Autagavaia/RNZ Pacific Option one also entails need for loss and damage to be a separate funding from adaptation and mitigation. Fiji's Permanent Representative to the UN, Satyendra Prasad, explained there were gaps in trying to conflate the funding intended for other purposes with compensation as they were not the same thing. Prasad said vulnerable people in the Pacific "are facing the loss of livelihoods, of land and of fundamental cultural and traditional assets". These were non-economic losses that could not be compensated through adaptation and mitigation funds. Financial support for loss and damage must be additional to adaptation funding but also differently structured. Option one calls for existing funding pledges to be made operational in the interim for vulnerable nations. Pacific's Adviser for Loss and Damage Daniel Lund said when responding to damage caused by extreme weather events, finance needed to be available at short notice. Lund added that current funding available was for project-based support under the Green Climate Fund which took around one year from proposal submission to receiving the first disbursement of funds, "Something like that doesn't work when the loss and damage are immediate." Republic of Palau's Minister of State, Gustav Aitaro, in his address to world leaders, said, "every time we have a typhoon, we have to shift funds and budgets allocated for breakfast for students to address the damage. We have to shift funds from our hospital to address the damage, and it becomes such a big burden for us to look for funds to replace that." He pleaded with parties to understand the Pacific's situation as it was a matter of life and death and their very existence depended on it. "How do I explain to young kids in Palau, the children who live on that atoll, that their homes have been damaged by typhoons and we have to rebuild them over again and again? If they ask me why is it a recurring situation, what do I tell them? Who do we blame? "Our islands, our oceans are our culture, it's our identity in this world. I'm sure our developing countries share the same concerns and this is why we are asking them to help." Pacific Islands activists protest in a demand for climate action and loss and damage reparations at COP27 in Egypt. Image: Dominika Zarzycka/AFP/RNZ Pacific Kicking the can down the road Australia and the US have put forward options two and three for consideration. They propose a soft power influence. They are proposing more time be given to iron out the finer details to establish a loss and damage finance in COP28 and operationalise the funding by COP29 in 2024. The Sydney Morning Herald reported Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen as saying: "The world is unlikely to come to an agreement at COP27 over contentious calls for wealthy nations to pay loss and damage compensation to developing countries." He said: "Let's just see how the internal discussions go. But I mean, I doubt very much it'll be a full agreement on that at this COP." The two countries who have spent time in the wilderness of climate diplomacy, have also proposed developed nations continue to tap into climate funding made available through bilateral and multilateral arrangements. This proposal also suggests that any funding made available for vulnerable states can be channelled through developed nation governments, proposing it does not need to be faciliated by a governing body like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Pacific feels this is problematic. Pacific negotiator Sivendra Michael explained: "This is volatile as it depends on the government of the day." Finding a way for more capital Time reports US climate envoy John Kerry as saying: "We have to find a way for more capital to flow into developing countries." Kerry added: "I think it's important that the developed world recognises that a lot of countries are now being very negatively impacted as a consequence of the continued practice of how the developed world chooses to propel its vehicles, heat its homes, light its businesses, produce food. "Much of the world is obviously frustrated." While the US allowed loss and damage finance to be added to the meeting's formal agenda for the first time, it took the unusual step of demanding that a footnote be included to exclude the ideas of liability for historic emitters or compensation for countries affected by that pollution. World leaders will now spend the next few hours deciding on which option to take on loss and damage finance. This article is republished under a community partnership agreement with RNZ. \</doc>

Anti-Coca-Cola protestors on Sunday staged a protest in front of the company's defunct plant at Plachimada on Sunday, condemning the involvement of Coca-Cola in hosting the 27 th Conference of Parties ( COP 27 ) of the United Nations Climate Change Conference being held in Egypt from Sunday. Burning effigies of Coca-Cola, the protestors demanded that the multinational beverage company be removed from the sponsorship of the COP-27 . A bicycle rally was taken out from Palakkad town to Plachimada in the morning. Although Coca-Cola stopped its operations at Plachimada following a series of agitations, the company refused to pay any compensation as recommended by a high-level committee headed by former Chief Secretary K. Jayakumar. During investigation, the panel had found that the company caused extensive damage to people and their land at Plachimada. It also recommended a compensation of Rs. 216.26 crore. Inaugurating the protest, environmentalist C.R. Neelakandan demanded that the United Nations should intervene to seek damages from Coca-Cola for the victims of Plachimada. He said that allowing the firm, which dumps crores of plastic bottle as waste every day, to sponsor the climate change conference was unfair. Presiding over the function, Plachimada Anti-Coca-Cola Struggle Committee chairman Vilayodi Venugopal said that they would expose the true nature of Coca-Cola by joining hands with other environmental groups from different parts of the world. "Coca- Cola has cheated the people of Plachimada by denying compensation to them," he said. \</doc>

November 16 -- Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi said on Tuesday at the G20 meeting in Indonesia that India is on pace to meet its goal of producing 50% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 while ruling out "any limits" on the supply and stability of energy. Two days of talks between the heads of the 20 major economies are taking place in Bali in what has been called one of the most contentious and difficult G20 summits ever. Mr. Modi stated that while India has contributed food grain to other countries, the most recent global scarcity should be addressed with a G20 agreement on secure supply chains. He was addressing the summit's opening session on food and energy security. The declaration strengthens India's standing at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 He emphasised the necessity for poor countries to get time-bound, inexpensive financing as well as a sustained supply of technologies to support an inclusive energy transition. He also emphasised that because multilateral institutions have failed to address these issues, there are higher expectations for the G20. \</doc>

India, Nov. 11 -- Fans of the American sitcom - 'The Office' - would agree that the show's star character - Dwight Schrute's love for all that is organic and his family's 60-acre beet farm remains unmatched. Taking that love for nature forward, the actor - Rainn Wilson - has pulled off what he calls a "cheap little stunt" amid the UN climate conference COP 27 taking place in Egypt. The actor took to Twitter on Thursday to announce that he has changed his name on social media to 'Rainnfall Heat Wave Extreme Winter Wilson' in a bid to raise awareness about the risks of melting glaciers. Wilson, in a video, started in a condescending Dwight Schrute tone saying, "Hi there, I am Rainn Wilson or should I say Rainnfall, heatwaves, rising sea levels and we have to do something about it now Wilson." In the rest of the video, he explains his "stunt" done to draw the attention of world leaders. "We need world leaders at COP27 to take notice and take action. The Arctic is melting at millions of litres per second, yet this problem can't seem to make a name for itself, so it's up to us to make a name for it," Wilson said. He explained he changed his name using a website called 'Arctic risk name generator' in partnership with an organisation - 'Arctic Humanity at Risk Basecamp' - which apparently works to raise awareness about changes happening in the Arctic. He also urged the viewers to get their "ArcticRisk name" too and said, "if enough of us do this, then maybe @ cop27 _egypt will be where our world leaders sit up and notice Arctic risks and introduce a solution." Wilson further affirmed "the name changer will be a game changer," as he tagged celebrities including Leonardo DiCaprio, and Cardi B among others on a similar Facebook post, likely nominating them for the same. Although his social media profiles do not reflect the name change as of now, Wilson on Twitter said he is apparently unable to do so because of the new Twitter verification rules. "P.S. THEY WON'T LET ME CHANGE MY NAME BECAUSE ELON!" the actor's tweet read. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) announced a new initiative at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ) the Nature for Cool Cities Challenge, which incentivizes cities to use the cooling power of nature. See also: What is COP and what to expect from the forthcoming COP27 By 2100, cities around the world could warm by 4C on average, exposing the growing urban population to conditions that will damage human health, productivity, and quality of life. Cities are on the frontlines, dealing daily with the impacts of climate change. Solutions exist to cool our cities sustainably: cities can turn to nature to reduce local temperatures and increase the resilience of their citizens. Nature-based solutions such as forests, green belts, and parks in and around cities can deliver cooling services, without damaging emissions. The cooling benefits of such solutions are well-documented, but they need to be better understood and leveraged to increase implementation and bring about change at a global level. We have come to COP27 at a time of global crisis, but these crises are a reason to increase our climate ambition, not reduce it. The Challenges goal scaling up nature-based solutions to tackle climate change impacts in cities is an important one said WWF Global Lead for Climate and Energy, Manuel Pulgar-Vidal. Cities play a key role in avoiding the most severe impacts of global warming and it is important that we champion ambitious and sustainable efforts to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change. Municipalities, groups of municipalities, or regional governments will pledge to increase the number of high-quality nature-based cooling solutions by 2030, with demonstrable progress by 2025. They will have to agree on a quantitative and funding target for local spending, and at least three implementation actions to back their pledges. In a warming world, cities have a critical role to play in achieving SDG 7, delivering sustainable cooling, and meeting the climate crisis. We urge them to embrace nature as a tool to cool their cities and pledge to scale up nature-based solutions by joining this challenge, said Sherry Kennedy, Director of Communications at SEforALL. The Nature for Cool Cities Challenge will help us demonstrate the power of urban nature to adapt to the effects of extreme heat, avoid emissions, and reduce energy demand. In an effort to harness the power of nature for cooling in the Global South, the Cool Coalition partners convening the challenge will provide incubation support for a cohort of cities in low and lower-middle-income countries that require assistance in defining their ambition. For the award winners, matching finance for the implementation of their pledges will be provided, based on the value of investment committed, tiered by the income level of the country, alongside technical assistance, support for the development of partnerships, and matchmaking. To make peace with nature, we need to rebuild our cities with nature in mind, said Sheila Aggarwal-Khan, Director of UNEPs Economy Division. But truly replicable nature-based solutions require a partnership between local governments, the private sector, experts, and practitioners. It is decisive that financial institutions, investors, and businesses step up and help make this vision a reality. The Nature for Cool Cities Challenge will demonstrate urban nature-based solutions ability to reduce the urban heat island effect, avoid emissions, and lower energy demand. One year from now, at COP 28, the Cool Coalition will showcase challenge participants, their pledges, and donor contributions that are helping cities deliver on their pledges. UNEP stands ready to work with Cool Coalition members to collect pledges, donor contributions, and catalyze action towards COP28 said Sheila Aggarwal-Khan, Director of, the Economy Division. \</doc>

Activists have slammed the beverage maker for greenwashing. Coca-Cola has defended its sponsorship of the upcoming 27th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ). The beverage maker, as per the BBC, said it "shares the goal of eliminating waste and appreciates efforts to raise awareness". Green activists have slammed Coca-Cola for greenwashing because they say the company is one of the biggest polluters on the planet and its sponsoring of the global event on climate change is baffling. "It is baffling that Coca-Cola - the world's biggest plastic polluter in all global Break Free From Plastic brand audits, including Kenya and Uganda - will sponsor this year's UNFCCC Conference of Parties in Egypt," said John Hocevar, Greenpeace USA Oceans Campaign Director on the group's website. He further said, "Coca-Cola produces 120 billion throwaway plastic bottles a year - and 99% of plastics are made from fossil fuels, worsening both the plastic and climate crisis. They have yet to even acknowledge that this is a problem or explain how they will meet their climate goals without ending their plastic addiction. This partnership undermines the very objective of the event it seeks to sponsor." \</doc>

Nearly 100 heads of state and government are meeting in Sharm el-Sheikh, facing calls to deepen emissions cuts and financially back developing countries already devastated by the effects of rising temperatures. A multitude of other crises, from Russias war in Ukraine to soaring inflation and the lingering effects of the Covid pandemic, has raised concerns that climate change will drop on the priority list of governments. Time is running out and the end of the decisive decade is a few years away, and we must make use of it to resolve this battle in the way we want. It is time for action and implementation. There is no way to retreat or place for excuses, as missing the opportunity will waste the legacy for future generations of our children and grandchildren, stated Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Egyptian President Nations worldwide are coping with increasingly intense natural disasters that have taken thousands of lives this year alone and cost billions of dollars -- from devastating floods in Nigeria and Pakistan to droughts in the United States and Africa and unprecedented heatwaves across three continents. I dont believe it is justice to the young generation when our rivers and lakes are polluted. I do not see justice when big politicians are untouchable. Is it justice for the world leaders to choose profits over lives prompted Leah Namugerwa, Ugandan youth climate activist. Let the African Cop be a different cop. Let the African Cop listen to the biggest stakeholders. Let the African Cop be an action cop. On Sunday, the heads of developing nations won a small victory when delegates agreed to put the controversial issue of compensation for loss and damage on the summit agenda. Pakistan, which chairs the powerful G77+China negotiating bloc of more than 130 developing nations, has made the issue a priority. The United States and the European Union have dragged their feet for years on the proposal, fearing it would create an open-ended reparations framework. Guterres said COP27 must agree on a clear, time-bound roadmap for loss and damage that delivers effective institutional arrangements for financing. Getting concrete results on loss and damage is a litmus test of the commitment of governments to the success of COP27 , express UN Secretary, Antonio Guterres. Rich nations will also be expected to set a timetable for the delivery of $100 billion per year to help developing countries green their economies and build resilience against future climate change. The promise is already two years past due and remains $17 billion short, according to the OECD. COP27 is scheduled to continue until November 18 with ministerial joining the fray during Week Two. Security is tight at the meeting, with Human Rights Watch saying authorities have arrested dozens of people and restricted the right to demonstrate in the days leading up to COP27 . The COP27 is scheduled to continue until November 18. \</doc>

Vice President Faisal Naseem on Monday called for global solidarity in the face of climate change, stating that despite Maldives negligible contributions to the causes of climate change, it would be impossible for us to respond effectively to them without global support. The Vice President made this statement delivering Maldives national statement at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ). Addressing world leaders at the Sharm El-Sheikh International Convention Center, the Vice President recalled the harsh realities of the world over the past few months, including floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Europe, and food shortages across Africa caused by climate change. Citing that the lives of Maldivians are also affected daily due to the impact of climate change on our oceans, the Vice President stated that it was affecting our sources of nourishment and income. He added that Maldivian fishermen were forced to travel further every year in search of abundant fisheries. The Vice President went on to detail the severe repercussions of climate change in the Maldives, including the need to rely on modern technologies following the depletion of freshwater supplies, the unpredictability of monsoon shifts that are more frequent and intense, and flooding and storm surges that have irreparably damaged homes and livelihoods. He added that our coral reefs, which are at the core of our tourism product, are on life support. The Vice President also warned world leaders that we only had 86 months to cut emissions in half and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. The Vice President also expressed the Maldives expectations from COP27 , including ambitious commitments on adaptation and mitigation, a visionary outcome on loss and damage that offers a patchwork of solutions to a wide range of issues, and the hope of achieving the collective target of US$100 billion per year in climate finance, with more than half going toward adaptation. The Vice President concluded by stating that because of climate change, the world is changing, and we must make sure the new world is equitable and just and allows every person to live well. \</doc>

New Delhi, Oct. 20 -- Having updated its nationally determined contribution (NDC) in August, India is likely to raise the issue of climate finance at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in November to support deployment of renewable energy projects on a large scale. The focus for India at the conference at Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt between November 6 and 18 will be: a multilaterally agreed definition of finance; a decision on the new collective goal on finance beyond 2025; an assessment of commitment made by the developed countries to provide $100bn/year of climate finance by 2020; and matters related to article 2.1(c) of Paris Agreement. This article covers the goal of making "finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development." It encompasses private as well as public financial flows to support low emission technologies. On Wednesday, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, currently visiting the country, urged India to take a leadership role at COP27 for a balanced outcome on finance, adaptation and loss and damage. India is also developing a long-term strategy (LTS) to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. Officials said it has not been decided when LTS will be ready for submission to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Glasgow Climate Pact which was adopted by 196 parties at the Glasgow climate change conference states that countries should submit their "low greenhouse gas emission development strategies referred to in Article 4, paragraph 19, of the Paris Agreement towards just transitions to net zero emissions by or around mid-century, taking into account different national circumstances" at COP 27 .

UN secretary general Antonio Guterres's deep disappointment with the outcome of the 27th Conference of Parties ( COP 27 ) is sure to be echoed across the world. Guterres said on Sunday that the planet continues to be in the "emergency room" and the COP "did not address" the need to drastically reduce emissions urgently. To be sure, the agreement on establishing a "loss and damage" fund through which rich nations-accounting for a disproportionate share of the historical post-industrial emissions-can help vulnerable nations cope with disaster wrought by climate change can be considered a win. More so, as it was the result of the G-77, a group of 134 developing nations, staying united on this. But the decision took decades after the concept was first mooted; this is testimony that developed nations continue to remain reluctant on assuming meaningful climate responsibility. Instead, they urge the developing world to take on the mantle of "climate leadership". This is further evidenced by the fact that details on how the fund is to be operationalised remain hazy. The COP27 text doesn't indicate when it is to be finalised, and how exactly it is to be funded-rich nations have agreed to it on the proviso that the donor base is to be a "broad" one. Though there is mention of a transitional committee that will work on those details, there are no deadlines set for the committee. Also, the language on the loss and damage fund carefully avoids allowing any interpretation that could facilitate climate "reparations" or "compensations". This shows the developed world is unwilling to shoulder responsibility for historical emissions and will continue to focus on current emissions, to the detriment of developing nations pursuing growth. Also Read: Still a net negative for people's privacy Worse, even as COP27 reaffirmed the goal of limiting warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, once again, there could be no agreement reached on phasedown of all fossil fuels. COP26 at Glasgow had agreed on a phasedown of unabated coal power and "phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies". India, which has made substantial commitments on adoption of renewables, had insisted fossil fuels meant oil and natural gas were included and the focus can't be just on coal. Even as the EU agreed-though it said this shouldn't mean a weakening of existing coal reduction agreements- bear in mind that European nations have been reverting to coal-based power following the energy crisis due to Russia's war against Ukraine. This points at the outsized and continuing influence of the fossil fuel lobby, significant as the UAE, a petro-state, assumes the presidency of the COP next year. The mitigation work programme to bring emissions down in line with the 1.5C goal was also washed out in the talks, with a focus on keeping it "non-prescriptive, non-punitive, facilitative, respectful of national sovereignty and national circumstances", though the blame for this is shared amongst emerging economies. Against this backdrop, India's Long Term Low Emissions and Development Strategy (LTLEDS), submitted to the UNFCCC on Monday can't be faulted too much. There are obvious misses-it doesn't mention any interim goal-post and could have included a plan for reducing emissions from agriculture. At the same time, it rightly focuses on the history of emissions, and the need for "climate justice" that balances developing countries' responsibilities with their development needs. The scepticism on carbon capture may not be entirely merited, but if it does indeed become a tool for the fossil fuel lobby to defer mitigation action, India may be on the right side of history. \</doc>

The Philippines called for the adoption of a transformational and operational definition of climate finance to include the principles or characteristics of the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) at the fifth High-Level Ministerial Dialogue on Climate Finance of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt on 14 November 2022. The NCQG is the new set of climate financial support that takes into account the needs and priorities of developing countries from a floor of USD$100 billion per year. The Philippines asked for a delivery plan for achieving the USD$100 billion that focuses on adaptation financing, scaling up climate finance grants, and streamlining access to financing. The country likewise stated that financial mechanisms should be based on the best available science and technologies. Philippine Ambassador to Egypt H.E. Ezzedin Tago relayed that the collective ambition of scaling up climate action should be anchored on a transparent, accessible, predictable, and efficient mobilization of climate finance. Ambassador Tago highlighted the need for swift and effective initiatives. Let us all work to break down the barriers to ambitious climate finance. Let us all endeavor for a climate finance that offers more sustainable results, he stated. The Dialogue was moderated by the Ministers of Maldives and Finland. States Parties shared the challenges and key areas of progress in climate finance, how the delivery and transparency of climate financing can be further enhanced, and lessons learned that can be applied to the deliberations on the new collective quantified goal. \</doc>

The work agenda of the Head of Government, Xavier Espot, in the Heads of State and Government segment of the 27th session of the Conference of States Parties ( COP 27 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, has started today in Egypt, with participation in the Opening Ceremony and attendance at the national declarations as well as at different parallel events. Xavier Espot, accompanied by the Secretary of State for Agriculture and Sustainability, Marc Rossell, will speak tomorrow in front of more than 200 high-ranking officials gathered at the Climate Conference. The 27th session of the Conference of States Parties ( COP 27 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change takes place until November 18 under the presidency of Egypt, in the city of Sharm El-Sheikh. This Conference must urge all Parties to demonstrate the necessary political will to move towards improved climate resilience including support for the most vulnerable communities. Thus, COP27 is held with the aim of promoting and agreeing on an improved global climate action agenda, following the commitment adopted in Paris in 2015, which was reaffirmed and strengthened at COP26 with the Glasgow Climate Pact, which placed the global goal of adaptation to the effects of climate change, the mitigation of gas emissions and climate finance at the forefront of global action. As a high mountain territory, Andorra is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. This is how the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change has defined it. It is for this reason that the Government has set Climate Action as one of its priorities, as reiterated by the Executive and as specified in the Horizon 23 roadmap. From this perspective, and with the purpose of aligning efforts around the challenge of sustainability, Andorra has become a particularly active State in the fight against climate change, playing an exemplary role with international commitments, in the time to present the Voluntary National Reports and to participate in the various international forums on the matter. In this way, the Principality is organizing on November 17, during COP27 , a ministerial meeting whose objective is to discuss and disseminate the impacts that climate change has on mountain regions. Andorra was elected representative of the European region in the Executive Committee of the FAO Mountain Partnership and is actively working during this year 2022, the International Year of Sustainable Mountain Development, to bring this theme of mountains and their vulnerability to the climate change on the agenda of the United Nations. \</doc>

Sharm El-Sheikh (Egypt): Commitments towards net-zero carbon emission cannot be a mere public relations exercise and if one wants to win the fight against climate change it is imperative to have zero tolerance for greenwashing, said United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at the ongoing COP27 summit. "We must have zero tolerance for net-zero greenwashing," said the Secretary-General. He made the remarks at the launch of a put out by Net-Zero Expert Group. Greenwashing is when a company misleads the public to believe it is doing more to protect the environment than it is actually doing. Calling the report a how-to guide to ensure credible, accountable net-zero pledges, he explained that it provides clarity in four key areas -- environmental integrity, credibility, accountability, and the role of governments. "Solving the climate crisis requires strong political leadership. I urge all government leaders to provide non-state entities with a level playing field to transition to a just, net-zero future," a United Nations statement quoted the Secretary-General as saying. Since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015, the world has seen an increasing number of net-zero commitments and pledges from the private and financial sectors and local governments. The 27th session of the Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC or COP 27 will be held at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt from November 6 to 18 in an effort to build on previous successes and pave the way for effectively tackling global climate change.

India, Nov. 6 -- The developing world's first COP since Marrakesh in 2016 must implement the 'Paris Rulebook' The presidency of the 27th Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reiterated November 6, 2022 that this year's meet must be remembered as the 'Implementation COP'. In other words, the developing world's first COP since Marrakesh in 2016 must implement the 'Paris Rulebook'. The Rulebook is the guidelines that countries will use to plan, implement and finance climate actions under the 2015 Paris Agreement. Read CoP27 CoP27 Presidency " COP27 COP27 on the first day of the event, said. COP27 is being held in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh from November 6-18. All countries under the UNFCCC gather once every year to deliberate and decide on the actions required to bring down greenhouse gas emissions known as 'mitigation', make adjustments to economic, social and ecological systems to weather the impacts of climate change known as £daptation' and reparations for impacts that are difficult to adapt to for vulnerable countries known as 'loss and damage'. Loss and damage , one of the most pressing issues of COP 27 , was officially accepted as an agenda item for the biggest annual climate change congregation. This is the first time that loss and damage is on the official agenda of a UNFCCC COP. "The outcomes of this agenda item are based on cooperation and facilitation and do not involve liability or compensation," the Loss and Damage Collaboration, a global group of activists wrote on microblogging site, Twitter. The loss and damage agenda item was being pushed by developing country negotiators, especially from small island states , for the past year since COP 26 in Glasgow. COP27 got underway in a year that has witnessed multiple climate-induced extreme weather events . These events, many of which have been partly attributed to global warming, affected both developing and developed countries. Developed countries are decently well-equipped to deal with the consequences. But developing countries need financing, technology and support from developed countries for mitigation , adaptation and addressing loss and damage. The required climate finance has been woefully inadequate until now, with a shortage of around $17 billion, according to an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD report released in July 2022. "With the Paris Rulebook essentially concluded thanks to COP26 in Glasgow last year, the litmus test of this and every future COP is how far deliberations are accompanied by action. Everybody, every single day, everywhere in the world, needs to do everything they possibly can to avert the climate crisis," Simon Stiell, UN Climate Change executive secretary, said. " COP27 COP27 . The first was pushing for the implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement and using negotiations to move towards climate actions. The second was moving forward on the agenda items on mitigation, adaptation, finance and loss and damage, including enhanced work on ensuring climate finance for developing countries. "The third was enhancing the delivery of the principles of transparency and accountability throughout the UN Climate Change process," the press release said. " COP27 creates a unique opportunity in 2022 for the world to unite, to make multilateralism work by restoring trust and coming together at the highest levels to increase our ambition and action in fighting climate change," Shoukry said.

The governments of Venezuela and Colombia highlighted the need to unify a policy in defense of the Amazon Rainforest, with the purpose of holding the United Nations Conference on Climate Change 2022, known as COP 27 , in Egypt. We have talked about the need to take a common position, like South America, like Latin America and the Caribbean, to COP 27 in Egypt and all issues of climate change as fundamental issues today for the survival of the human species, highlighted the President of the Republic, Nicols Maduro, during the signing of the joint declaration between both leaders. In context, his Colombian counterpart, Gustavo Petro, pointed out the importance of revitalizing, recovering and defending the fundamental climatic pillar of the planet for human existence, the Amazon Rainforest. It is a common effort of the countries that are responsible for the Amazon forest (...), we must help each other and hope that Brazil joins a fight that has to be of humanity, Petro said. In this regard, he confirmed that the capitalist system is responsible for the environmental imbalance that has caused the destruction of the planet. It is a process that we must stop and that has to do with an economic system that is used intensively in the world. COP 27 will take place from November 6 to 18 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, and brings together more than 90 countries in the region and high-level authorities involved in the discussion of climate action issues in Latin America and the Caribbean. . Strengthening of bilateral trade On the other hand, Petro reported that businessmen from both countries will meet in Cartagena, with the aim of promoting trade and production between the two countries, in order to strengthen the foundations of a powerful, plural trade, where the small farmer and the economies people have participation. Finally, he applauded the meeting on Venezuelan soil, which will allow the resumption of cooperation and integration relations. We are mixed by history, by a common root and by blood. Therefore, separating the Nations becomes a suicidal adventure () the friendship between the two peoples must be maintained, concluded Petro. \</doc>

Climate Change is expected to be the main issue of discussion at the first US-Pacific Islands summit in Washington D.C. this week. During the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Pacific leaders called on developed nations to urgently lower fossil fuel emissions and also to consider climate finance.More action is needed from developed nations," according to Tagaloa Cooper, Director of Climate Change Resilience at the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP). "The support of Pacific leaders financial climate finance so that they can adapt. We need support to implement our NDCs and our adaptation plans. There are things that have been requested to be done. It's just that we need accelerated support to meet the needs of the Pacific, and not meet the needs of partners." The Nationally determined contributions (NDCs) are at the heart of the Paris Agreement and the achievement of these long-term goals. NDCs embody efforts by each country to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. In November, the next United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP27 will take in the green city of Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. In his address to the UN General Assembly, Fiji's prime minister Frank Bainimarama urged developed nations to deliver on the US$100-billion climate finance commitment at COP27 in Egypt this year. "Only come if you plan to arrive true to your climate finance commitments. Only come to Sharm El-Sheikh if you are ready to agree to a loss and damage mechanism in addition to a post-2025 financing framework. This must be in the order of $750 billion, with at least 10 percent of climate finance destined for small island states," he said. Fiji's prime minister is one of 12 Pacific leaders attending the summit. \</doc>

India, Nov. 17 -- A round-up of what went on at the Sharm El-Sheikh summit The 27th Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, began November 7, 2022. Here's a look at what happened on day 10 of COP27 climate talks. The draft text for a cover decision is yet to be produced by the COP27 Presidency as of 7.30 am November 17, leading many to wonder how long discussions will continue to arrive at a consensus on the document once released. Just two days of the summit remain. ............................................................................................................................................................. Negotiations have concluded on the report of the Paris Agreement Implementation and Compliance Committee, Kyoto Protocol Compliance Committee, Santiago Network on loss and damage and Adaptation Fund, announced a letter from the COP27 President November 16. Read more: COP27 Negotiations on the mitigation work programme, Global Goal on Adaptation, loss and damage finance, climate finance, Article 6 and agriculture are now pending. ............................................................................................................................................................. The Group of 77 bloc produced a proposal on loss and damage, containing specific demands for the final text of the agenda item. A fund must be established "for assisting developing countries in meeting their costs of addressing non-economic and economic loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change," it stated. Options are also provided on the timeline, for the work programme to be 1-2 years long or to run until 2030. ............................................................................................................................................................. Brazilian President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva received a hero's welcome when he addressed crowds at a speech at COP 27 on Wednesday evening. Stating that 'Brazil is back' on climate action, he promised to do whatever it takes to bring deforestation in the Amazon down to zero. He also offered to host the 2025 COP summit in Brazil. ............................................................................................................................................................. COP27 President Sameh Shoukry conducted a stocktake of the situation and designated pairs of ministers to work on the each of the agenda items that required high-level political negotiations, special representative and Ambassador Wael Aboulmagd said at a press briefing. Inputs have been received from parties on the cover decision text on priorities and expectations along with red lines, which cannot be crossed, he said. The third part makes negotiations difficult. The pace of COP 27 has been typical, but some delegations are holding up work in several negotiation rooms, he highlighted. However, there is still hope for progress and last-minute decisions in line with people's expectations worldwide. Announcements made by countries at the G20 summit in Bali would have an impact on the negotiations at COP. The principles of equity are enshrined in Article 2 of the Paris Agreement and cannot be done away with, he said on some countries waning the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibility out of the cover decision text. Read more: COP27 "We are aware of the various positions on that and we are working now as the presidency team but moving forward with all parties to ensure that everyone finds the language that accommodates their perspective in an appropriate way but also one that is faithful to the legal agreement that we have all ratified in our internal processes", he said. On not meeting the goal of $100 billion in climate finance, he said that it is not the core of the process and that the figure was more of a gesture from the developed countries. The updating of NDCs from countries can also continue after COP27 . The transparency framework under the UNFCCC ensures accountability. Still, pledges outside the UNFCCC process being made by countries have to be made accountable by public pressure through media and other means, according to Aboulmagd. The Santiago Network will be operationalised soon, he said on loss and damage negotiations but did not divulge any information on the establishment of a finance facility. Meaningful progress was required on this, he added. ............................................................................................................................................................. Experts at a side event highlighted that the fossil fuel subsidies problem is huge and that government support for fossil fuel subsidies in 51 countries almost doubled. They called for the need to end fossil fuel subsidies. Canada is subsidising companies extracting and producing fossil fuel, said Julia Levine, energy programme manager, environmental defence, Canada. Between 2015-2019, the Canadian government provided $100 billion for fossil fuel production. "So far this year, the government has already committed 16 billion dollars," she stressed. The country could have instead directed this money to a globally just energy transition, delivered Canada's fair share of international climate finance or addressed loss and damage. In India, fossil fuel attracts nine times more subsidies than clean energy, said Shruti Sharma, senior policy advisor in the International Institute Of Sustainable Development's (IISD) energy programme. In Indonesia, 94 per cent of the support to the energy sector went to the production and consumption of fossil fuels and 1 per cent to renewables from financial years 2016-2020, she added. Social costs [mortality, diseases and climate change] of fossil fuel in South Africa far exceed subsidies and revenues generated from them, Chido Monzado from IISD pointed out. Read more: COP27 The level of fossil fuel subsidies generated from 2010-2020 in Argentina could help transition to a 100 per cent renewable electricity generation park by 2045, while Brazil's subsidies to fossil fuel totalled $21.9 billion in 2021. ............................................................................................................................................................. The fossil fuel lobby could threaten outcomes from COP27 , such as delivering strong language for a phase-out of all fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas, according to a press briefing from Climate Action Network. Further, Egypt's long list of elements likely to be considered for the cover decision did not mention fossil fuels. This is despite India calling for a phase down of all fossil fuel and the EU backing it. Follow COP27 with Down To Earth COP27 Loss and damage .

AHEAD OF COP27 NEXT MONTH... New Delhi: Ahead of the crucial United Nations climate change conference COP27 next month, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has warned of a decline in cross-border investments in climate change mitigation and adaptation in 2022 amid a global investment downturn. Citing a bleak outlook for global foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2022, UNCTAD in a report said the number of new investment projects across most industries have declined, notably those tackling climate change.  Between January and September 2022, climate mitigation and adaptation sectors had, respectively, 7% and 12% fewer new projects announced, in stark contrast to the previous year's strong acceleration, it said. Among mitigation measures, low carbon transport witnessed the steepest decline of 25%, while in adaptation actions, water management contracted 19%.  The shift from fossil fuel to green investments to support the energy transition risks a setback, due to the loss of momentum in renewables and high oil and gas prices, UNCTAD said. For now, the downward trend in investment is also affecting extractive industries and fossil fuel-based energy generation where project numbers dipped by about 16% in the first three quarters of 2022, it said. However, the report warned that high profits of multinationals in these sectors, combined with the current energy crisis, could lead to a renewed push for investments in fossil fuel-based energy whose production exacerbates climate change. An early indication of that is the value of cross-border mergers and acquisitions in the extractive industry, which rose sixfold between January and September 2022, it noted. Mitigation projects accounted for 94% of international climate investments. Most mitigation investments are in renewable energy and, to a lesser extent, in various energy efficiency projects. Europe alone accounted for more than half of renewables' projects, with more than 700 in the first three quarters of 2022. North America and developing Asia attracted about 200 projects each. \</doc>

October 07 -- The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of Parties 27's ( CoP 27 ) Egyptian presidency September 29, 2022 named\~Coca-Cola Company - one of the biggest plastic polluters in the world - as the official provider and supporter of the year's biggest climate change conference. CoP27 is to be held at Sharm El-Sheikh on Egypt's Red Sea coast from November 6-18. Countries under the UNFCCC will negotiate on mitigation, adaptation and financing aspects of action on climate change at the summit. Coca-Cola would be partnering with Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the event. While the financial aspect of the deal is not known as yet,\~CoP26 in Glasgow was sponsored by eight companies and the deal was worth $280 million. No other private company apart from Coca-Cola has been announced as sponsor, provider or supporter for CoP27 . There were some big polluters among the companies last year as well, like Unilever and Sainsbury. Coca-Cola, as part of the statement from the CoP27 presidency, claimed that climate was a key area of focus for the company as it "works towards its 2030 Science Based Target of an absolute 25 per cent emissions reduction and its ambition to be net zero carbon globally by 2050". \~ \~ \~ \~ Also, Coca-Cola in Europe and Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company, its bottling partner in Egypt, want to reach net zero\~greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040. "Through the CoP 27 partnership, the Coca-Cola system aims to continue exploring opportunities to build climate resilience across its business, supply chain and communities, while engaging with other private sector actors, NGOs, and governments to support collective action against climate change," the company said. Activists and commentators have called this a greenwashing exercise. "It is baffling that Coca-Cola - the world's biggest plastic polluter in all global\~Break Free From Plastic brand audits, including\~Kenya\~and\~Uganda\~- will sponsor this year's UNFCCC Conference of Parties in Egypt," John Hocevar, director of Greenpeace USA Oceans Campaign, said in a statement to the media. In Uganda, Coca-Cola is responsible for 20 per cent of all plastic pollution, according to a brand audit report by non-profits Break Free from Plastic and EndPlasticPollution. One of the major impacts of the plastic pollution is on the rivers of the country. The report found that the rivers Mpanga and Rwizi are the worst-affected and even Lake Victoria, one Africa's Great Lakes, is filling up with plastic. Coca-Cola has been polluting rivers, oceans and land globally with 120 billion single-use plastic\~bottles, thus risking the health of humans, animals and plants. The conglomerate is also significantly responsible for the climate crisis as 99 per cent of the plastic is produced from fossil fuels. In 2021, Coca-Cola's GHG emissions were 5.17 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents, according to non-profit Global Data. This was eight per cent higher than in 2020. Sixty per cent of the emissions came from onsite generation and purchase of electricity while 31 per cent came from fossil fuels and refrigerants. "They have yet to even acknowledge that this is a problem or explain how they will meet their climate goals without ending their plastic addiction," Hocevar said.\~ Such problematic private company sponsorship is not happening for the first time. \</doc>

India, Nov. 12 -- Along with several world leaders, President Vladimir Putin chose not to attend the United Nations Climate Change Conference , otherwise known as COP27 , currently underway in Egypt's luxurious resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. The Kremlin issued a statement last month that Putin would not attend because he believed "no breakthroughs were expected". While this may be true, all leaders of the 190 countries represented should nevertheless be grateful to the Russian President for helping their cause. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has meant that global demand for fossil fuels, the main drivers of climate change, has very likely peaked-for good. The world's policymakers have been working towards this tipping point for years. Now, the twin forces of national security and energy economics are driving a permanent system change away from fossil fuels quicker than ever, giving a glimmer of hope for the future of the planet. Analysts are concluding that the Russian fossil fuel industry is currently facing a real crisis-yet another of Putin's own goals resulting from his disastrous decision to invade Ukraine. Western sanctions and Russia's own embargo on exports to the West mean that the industry is now facing long-term decline. When Gazprom switched off the natural gas Nordstream 1, citing maintenance concerns, the real reason was political, with Russia seeking to cause maximum inconvenience to Europe in response to sanctions. When its submarines blew up sections of the pipe, the message was clear. But whilst these actions will hurt Europe in the short term, they will also hurt big-time an important part of Russia's economy. For example, in just a year, the flow of gas from Russia to Europe fell by more than 82%. In January 2021, supplies from Russia accounted for about 40% of the gas consumed in Europe, currently it is less than 10%. Oil can be carried by tankers to any part of the world, but gas needs to be liquefied for the same flexibility. Russia's problem is that it has very limited facilities for liquefying natural gas, and already there are reports of "capping" of natural gas facilities, which means that natural gas is burnt at source because the industry cannot sell or store the gas coming from wells. Russia's oil industry is likely to prove more durable, as sanctions have so far had only a limited effect on reducing demand. Russia is exporting large quantities of oil to China and India at considerable discounts, and for as long as there remains a strong global demand, it's likely that the Kremlin will find a way to continue exporting oil. The G7 countries have announced plans to cap the price of Russian oil by refusing to pay above a certain amount. The hope is that with the UK and EU also dominating the insurance of oil shipping, they are in a position to enforce this price cap, preventing rises for the West and limiting funds for Russia. The Kremlin has claimed that it won't take part and won't sell at a discount price, and if Russia can sell sufficient quantities to non-Western economies, such as India, the price cap may prove limited. However, the simple fact is that those producers hoping for continued high gas prices, because of scarcity of supply, and high oil prices, resulting from OPEC+ market manipulations, are failing to realise that the world has changed from earlier energy price shocks. Today, alternative green energy solutions are large enough to supply demand growth and will do so at a lower cost. Take a look at BP's "Statistical review of World Energy" and you'll find that in the decade to 2020, the global energy grew at 1% per year. In the same decade, solar and wind supply grew at an average rate of 20% per year, and made up about 4.4% of primary energy supply in 2021. A year of even 15% growth would see them make up 0.66 percentage points in total energy supply. In other words, under a steady-state environment, solar and wind are meeting about two-thirds of the growth in energy demand. Added output from hydro, nuclear and biomass supply is enough to make up the rest of demand growth. This leaves very little room for incremental demand for fossil fuels. According to BP's report, fossil fuel demand reached a peak in 2019 and will remain on a plateau for a few years before falling off a cliff in the second half of this decade. BP's report was signed off by its chief executive in July 2021, more than six months before Putin invaded Ukraine, a war which has hastened the cliff edge. Consider a few calculations. If we assume for the sake of argument that efficiency increases by 1 percentage point and solar and wind growth increases by 5 percentage points to 20%, then the decline in fossil fuel demand would turn into a rout. Fossil fuel demand would fall by 25% this decade and then collapse in the 2030s. It takes very few brain cells, a challenge for the Kremlin, to realise that Putin's war is galvanising the transition in energy supplies. The twin converging dynamics of a surge in energy prices and Russian troops in Ukraine are forcing politicians to make choices once deemed impossible. In May, the EU published plans for a massive increase in solar and wind power in order to end its reliance on Russian oil and gas as fast as possible. The Commission proposed that 45% of the EU's energy mix should come from renewables by 2030. "It's clear that we need to end this dependence and a lot faster than foreseen before this war", said Franz Zimmerman, the EU official in charge of the Green Deal. "Speeding up the transition means that money can stay in Europe, can help bring down the energy bills of European families, and will not be used to finance the barbaric war in Ukraine", he continued. To help speed up renewable energy, the EU wants to make it easier for companies to build wind and solar farms by reducing the time for planning permission, "time that we do not have", said Zimmerman. Before the war, solar and wind sources were already cheaper than fossil fuels in 85% of the world; now they are cheaper almost everywhere. Low prices unleash the giant potential of renewables. Solar and wind energy is local and cheap-it is also clean. Solar and wind solve the energy trilemma: the struggle to balance decarbonisation, energy security, and affordability. The solution also releases countries from energy dependency. Putin's war in Ukraine will create massive fiscal problems for Russia in the near future because of the world's accelerated move to green energy, resulting in less dependency on Russia's export of fossil fuels. At the same time, green energy is solving many problems in the vital move to counter climate change, the purpose of the gathering in Sharm el-Sheikh. COP27 should be hugely grateful to Vladimir Putin. John Dobson is a former British diplomat, who also worked in UK Prime Minister John Major's office between 1995 and 1998.

In an effort to build on prior accomplishments and prepare the way for effectively combating global climate change, the Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), also known as COP 27 , will hold its 27th session in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, from November 6 to 18. In the backdrop of multiple extreme weather disasters, including typhoons in Bangladesh, huge floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Europe, wildfires in North America, dry rivers in China, and droughts in Africa, this year's COP27 conference assumes even more importance. In the run up to the COP27 , the International Monetary Fund has highlighted three crucial areas where the world needs to work for tackling the rising greenhouse gas emissions. These three areas are: steadfast policies to reach net zero by 2050, strong measures to adapt to the global warming that's already locked in, and staunch climate finance to help vulnerable countries. According to IMF, the good news is that 140 countries, or 91 per cent of the world's emitters of greenhouse gases, have already proposed or established net-zero targets by the middle of the century. The bad news, however, is that reality and net-zero rhetoric do not align, said IMF. IMF stressed that doing more on climate financing is important. It said that advanced economies must meet or exceed the pledge of $100 billion in climate finance for developing countries. India is expected to raise matters such as climate finance for the developing world where per capita emissions are comparatively quite low against the developed world in order to address carbon mitigation. IMF said, "If we do not take action now, the damage and devastation brought on by climate change will only get worse. If we act now, not only can we avoid the worst, but we can also choose a better future. Done right, the green transformation will deliver a cleaner planet, with less pollution, more resilient economies, and healthier people." \</doc>

The High Commissioner of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka to the Republic of Maldives, H.E. Adam Maznavee Jaufer Sadiq, paid a courtesy call on Monday on H.E. Vice President Faisal Naseem. The meeting was held at the Presidents Office. Speaking at the meeting, the Vice President emphasised the strong relations between the two countries and thanked the Sri Lankan government for continuous support for the Maldives. He also emphasised the strong bonds between the people of the Maldives and Sri Lanka. The Vice President and the High Commissioner also spoke about ways to further expand relations between the two countries, especially in investment and trade. The Vice President also expressed hope that the Sri Lankan government would consider easing visa arrangements for Maldivian students, which he noted would provide significant relief for Maldivian families residing in Sri Lanka. Other topics discussed at the meeting included expanding the fisheries cooperation between the two countries and supporting Sri Lanka to alleviate its economic challenges. The Vice President and the High Commissioner also discussed the exchange of technical and professional expertise between the two countries. At the meeting, the Vice President also underlined that one of the most cherished goals achieved at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) was the commitment to establish a loss and damage fund to compensate vulnerable developing countries for the losses and damages they face as a result of climate impacts. He also shed light on the efforts by the Maldives on global forums to raise awareness about the financial strain and climate vulnerabilities faced by Small Island Developing States (SIDS). He added that the fund would benefit the Maldives, Sri Lanka, and other climate-vulnerable countries. The Maldives and Sri Lanka established diplomatic relations in 1965. \</doc>

mentarity.The Egyptian government plans to power the facilities that will host the COP27 talks with a 5 MWp solar photovoltaic plant. Egypt's plan is to demonstrate its commitment to the development of renewable energy. Egypt is going all out for the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 Under the auspices of Mohamed Shaker, the Minister of Electricity and Energy, and Khaled Fouda, the Governor of South Sinai, this project is in line with Egypts commitment to achieve 42% of its total electricity generation from renewable energy sources by 2030, says Gila. Through this project, Egypt wants above all to demonstrate its commitment to the ecological and above all energy transition to the world leaders who will be meeting in Sharm el-Sheikh from 7 to 18 November 2022. Ambitious, its policy is already bearing fruit. Egypt already has an installed renewable capacity of 6,226 MW in 2021. This represents an increase of about 4.4% compared to 2020. The development of the green hydrogen industry is expected to further boost this installed capacity. And this growth is expected to continue over the next few years as Egypt aims to become the regional hub for clean energy production with the development of the green hydrogen industry. Currently, the North African country is attracting large multinationals that plan to invest heavily in wind and solar power generation to power their electrolysis plants in the Suez Canal Economic Zone. \</doc>

Mali, Nov. 9 -- The World Bank has approved a $30 million credit from the International Development Association (IDA) to enable Mali to improve agricultural productivity and strengthen the resilience of rural households living in the targeted drylands. This additional financing is made available under the Mali Agricultural Productivity and Diversification Development Project in Semi-Arid Zones (PDAZAM).These additional funds will cover the costs of an emergency response to food insecurity as well as those generated by inflationary pressures, due in part to the Ukrainian crisis and insecurity. The project activities target the poor and vulnerable, including women, young people, and internally displaced persons. With these additional funds, PDAZAM will be able to assist a larger number of eligible recipients in the intervention area, i.e., the regions of Kayes, Koulikoro, Sa&#x00A9;gou, Mopti, and elsewhere in the event of a food crisis declaration. The rapid spread of food insecurity across the country has led to the emergence of affected areas needing support.These additional funds, provided a few days after the launch of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm-el-Sheik, Egypt, address the World Bank's objectives of strengthening the production and resilience of food systems, facilitating trade, developing inclusive value chains, and supporting vulnerable households and producers.

November 07 -- Never in the history of the UN Climate Change Conference the African continent was so well prepared on the eve of the global meet, COP 27 , that would be held at the Red Sea resort city of Sharm El Sheikh, in Egypt. \~The host country proudly calls itself an African Country, being in the northeast part of the continent termed in Arabic as the Mashriq region. 'Strategic' is the word that perfectly describes African preparation for the more than a weeklong meeting from 7-18 November. While COP27 Small island countries like Maldives are facing an existential threat. As a part of impactful theatrics, its former president Mohamed Nasheed held an underwater cabinet meeting. Nepal and Bhutan facing floods due to melting high-altitude lakes, and risking hydroelectricity. India is facing growing air and sea pollution and food crises due to extreme weather. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanded USD 1 trillion in COP26. Countries like Sri Lanka and Afghanistan are facing political and climatic challenges. However, South Asia did not strive for collective and consultative leadership the way Africa is engaged in now. A determined Africa COP is one of the myriads of complicated abbreviations used in the UN's climate taxonomy, meaning 'Conference of Parties' to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change -UNFCCC. The 'Parties' are all the 198 countries in the world that have ratified the UNFCCC. COP serves as the formal meeting of the UNFCCC Parties to assess the progress on agreed goals and targets. It also helps Parties to enhance their targets and provide to the Parties science, technology, and policy information. In face of growing criticism from the vested interests of the developed countries, mainly due to the host country's growing focus on increasing extraction of natural gas, particularly in Egypt and the Republic of Congo, the 53 African countries are determined to make COP 27 a significant success in forging partnerships to mitigate and adapt to climate change. They have reminded the developed countries of their past climate pledges and forgotten promises on funding even in the Pre- COP27 African Climate summit. Egypt, the host of the 27th COP, is also being cleverly criticized by the developed world for submitting its NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions) very late and not being proactive for 'net zero' pledge. Undeterred, it has very effectively proceeded with determination to unify African countries before COP27 to have common African agenda in wake of the life-threatening impacts of climate change. \~ Egypt has hit the nail on the head of the climate agenda. In African pre-summit consultations held at the beginning of October in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt took a stand that COP27 , which is the 5th COP taking place in the African continent, should be 'implementation-COP' and not 'Negotiation-COP'. It is a very powerful strategic approach the host country has ever taken recognizing that the era of discussion on agreed goals is long over and the window of opportunity for carbon neutral world is fast closing. Climate injustice The unifying force in the African countries to develop the COP27 strategy is the result of gross climate injustice facing the continent. The dire, distressing, and dreadful facts about Africa are laid out in the WMO report released in Sept 2022, 'The State of the Climate in Africa 2021'. It reveals that water stress and hazards of devastating droughts and floods are striking African communities, economies and ecosystems and demolishing hard almost to humiliate them. \~Rainfall patterns are disrupted, glaciers on Mount Kenya, Mount Kilimanjaro and Ruwenzori that straddle the border between Uganda and Zaire are disappearing, and key lakes are shrinking. Rising water demand across Africa combined with limited and uncertain supplies threatens to aggravate local and regional conflicts and displacements. Extreme weather and climate change are deteriorating human health and safety, food and water security and socio-economic development. It's not only the sub-Saharan region that is often quoted but even the richer southern tip of Africa, the Cape of Good Hope, which now appears to belie its optimistic name, with the nearby regions of southern Africa going deadly dry. Clearly, Africa only accounts for about 3 per centto 4 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions but suffers disproportionately from its impacts. This minimal share of emissions of Africa tells much of the colossal story of 75 per cent of population in sub-Saharan Africa that have no access to electricity. That also cripples the manufacturing and hence economic development of Africa. The story of climate injustice in Africa triggers the thought of whether such injustice in modern times could be an issue for the International Court of Justice in Dan Hague. The story of injustice gets further magnified if one considers high water stress is estimated to affect about 250 million people in Africa and is expected to displace up to 700 million people by 2030. Four out of five African countries are unlikely to have sustainably managed water resources by 2030. Adverse impacts of climate change would cost Africa USD 50 billion annually by 2050 as per World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). Climate justice "Water shocks are threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and destabilizing communities, countries and entire regions," says WMO Secretary-General Prof Petteri Taalas. African countries along with all developing countries have already realized that COPs, year after year, have proved to be nothing but talking shops, pledge factories, and promise machines. NDCs have been found to be miserably far from what is needed to achieve the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015 as per the UNEP annual reports called 'Emission Gap Reports' being published annually. \~The latest report released on 27th October 2022, is titled 'Closing Window'. It calls for the rapid transformation of societies globally, whatever it means. This is what was expected from the implementation of NDCs as per the Paris Climate Agreement. Sadly, NDCs are now called by some as 'Non-Deliverable Cuts' in emissions in the decorative corridors of climate conferences. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in his tweet on 29 October stated that the "Latest UNEP Emission Gap report makes it clear, we are headed for economy-destroying levels of global heating. We need Climate Action on all fronts and we need it now. We must close the emissions gap before catastrophe closes in on us all". Egypt, supported by all African countries in the Pre Cop27 summit, \~has called for, the need for more funds, specifically mentioning an agreement dating back to COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009. It was agreed then that developed countries would provide to developing countries new and additional' funding for climate change mitigation and adaptation starting from USD 10 billion in 2010 to reach USD 100 billion ((EURO)101.7 billion) in 2020 and then USD 100 Billion per year from the year 2020. Bizarrely, the Green Climate Fund has received from 32 developed countries only USD 10 billion as of August 2022, that too in confirmed pledges. It is not clear if those funds are actually paid in the Fund. Such pittance performance of developed countries professes nothing but gross failure principle of ' polluter to pay' and associated collective responsibility to save life on the Earth. Following the call by developing countries, the COP26 in the UK, Glasgow noted with regret that developed country parties have not met the $100 billion goal annually. The COP also agreed in Glasgow on a 'Climate Finance Delivery Plan: Meeting the US$100 Billion Goal' by 2025. African countries have a unified position that would like to drive a very clear distinction between Official Development Assistance (ODA) and climate finance. Congolese Environment Minister Eve Bazaiba, host of the pre- COP 27 summit, \~called on developed countries not only to respect past financial pledges but also to endorse proposals to compensate least developed economies for climate-inflicted damage, under the ' Loss and Damage' mechanism, which would be the yet another priority for African strategy. Article 8 of the Paris Agreement enshrines the importance of averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage and the role of sustainable development in reducing the risk of loss and damage. The cost of structural damage caused by natural disasters in Africa will increase to $415 billion a year by 2030. 'Loss and Damage' issue, propounded first by Small Island Countries ( SIDs) is still being deliberated if it is compensation for the damage caused in the developing countries or for the prevention of damage. \~ Africa looks at it as both as it feels that Loss and Damage are part of climate justice. It also shows that USD 100 Billion a year for developing countries is grossly inadequate considering the cost of loss and damage in poor countries. The current Chair of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN) on climate change, Ephraim Mwepya Shitima of Zambia, states that another strategy for Africa would be the need to enhance Adaptation Fund. Though it is agreed to be part of the USD 100 billion per year, The latest IPCC working group report on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, highlighted the annual cost of adaptation in developing countries from $140 billion to $300 billion by 2030. Africa wants to call for adaptation financing to match these figures. Adaptation Fund completes three dimensions of climate justice. Cue from Africa Africa, even though collectively well prepared for COP27 faces profound challenges when they arrive in Egypt. The world is reeling under recession in the post-COVID era and is torn due to conflicts and war between Russia and Ukraine. It is next to impossible to get all the funding expected by them from developed countries. Deputy UN Secretary-General Amina Mohammed of Kenyn, during the African summit, warned that "all indicators on climate are heading in the wrong direction." COP26 will be known for promises and pledges. Egypt and the rest of Africa want COP27 to be known as COP for implementing all these pledges. Africa wants to follow its well known proverb that 'A Chattering Bird Builds No Nest'. Taking a cue from Africa, can South Asian countries conduct strategic and collective consultations to build a nest? \~ \</doc>

LeadIT Summit 2022 was hosted by India and Sweden at COP27 , Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Highlights of the Summit are:  LeadIT Summit Statement 2022 launched.  LeadIT members re-emphasized the commitment to pursuing the low-carbon transition.  Co-development the only option for low carbon transition: Shri Bhupender Yadav India and Sweden hosted the LeadIT Summit, on the side-lines of COP27 . The LeadIT (Leadership for Industry Transition) initiative focuses on low carbon transition of the hard to abate industrial sector. Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, India, Shri Bhupender Yadav, Minister for Climate and the Environment, Sweden, Ms. Romina Pourmokhtari and the Minister for International Cooperation, Egypt, Ms. Raina Al-Mashat participated in the event. Union Minister Shri Bhupender Yadav at the LeadIT Summit 2022 at COP 27 During the opening address Minister, Shri. Bhupender Yadav talked about the activities of LeadIT with a special focus on the road mapping exercise that was undertaken for the cement and steel sector in India. He mentioned that going forward, similar exercises are expected to be taken up in other member countries of LeadIT. He also emphasised that co-development is the only option to meet the targets that the world has taken for itself and without it, low carbon transition could be delayed by decades. "The low carbon transition of the industrial sector will not only contribute towards the reduction in required greenhouse gas emissions. It has several co-benefits that include increasing resilience to changes in climate, enhanced energy security, innovation, socio-economic development and job creation", Shri Bhupender Yadav. He also highlighted that the current phase of LeadIT is set to conclude in 2023 and the next year is the time to reflect on the performance and achievements so far. Also, the post-2023 process needs to be deliberated on to identify the priorities in a consultative manner. The event included roundtable discussions that focussed on finance and other cross-sectoral issues. The LeadIT members that include countries and companies, shared their initiatives in the industry sector and views on the requirements for successful low-carbon transitions. The summit concluded with the adoption of the summit statement by the members of LeadIT which re-emphasized the commitment to continue pursuing the low-carbon transition of the industry. The members also committed to providing technical assistance to new members and emerging economies. The importance of de-risking investments in the transition of heavy industries in emerging and developing countries was also highlighted. The summit was followed by the public launch of the LeadIT Summit Statement 2022 in the India Pavilion at COP27 . The public launch witnessed a wide participation including from government representatives, industry, media and civil society. The Leadership Group for Industry Transition (LeadIT) gathers countries and companies that are committed to action to achieve the Paris Agreement. It was launched by the governments of Sweden and India at the UN Climate Action Summit in September 2019 and is supported by the World Economic Forum. LeadIT members subscribe to the notion that energy-intensive industry can and must progress on low-carbon pathways, aiming to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. \</doc>

November 18 -- Leading apparel brand H&M will financially support projects to reduce its emissions throughout the whole value chain as it has implemented an annual budget of around SEK 3 billion. The budget will be used for investments to phase out coal and increase the share of more sustainable materials, amongst others. The apparel brand has set the ambitious goal to reduce the group's absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions and its scope 3 emissions by 56 per cent respectively by 2030 (from a 2019 baseline). To work towards this goal, financial support will play a significant role. Working towards its ambition to achieve net-zero by 2040, H&M Group joined the 27th United Nations Climate Change conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt to build momentum for collaborative action and share about the company's progress and challenges. Instead of measuring the success of these initiatives by financial gain, the group measures effective emission reductions. "To turn our company growth, profit and greenhouse gas reduction into equal KPIs is a very ambitious decision that underlines the importance and value of our sustainability work for our business," said Leyla Ertur, Head of Sustainability H&M Group. Leyla further added, "We have been engaged in climate mitigation for years and continuously push ourselves to demonstrate climate leadership within our industry. Our recently strengthened climate goals are verified by the Science Based Targets initiative. We are dedicated to contributing to the limitation of the global temperature increase to 1.5 \'b0C and keeping our climate strategy aligned with the latest science-based target setting frameworks is crucial for us to create impact beyond our own organisation and value chain." \</doc>

The International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook (2022) shows the global energy crisis is a historic turning point. The findings only strengthen the case for a sustainable energy system ahead of COP27 at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 ), being held in the resort town of Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt is expected to be a significant step towards attaining the world's collective climate goals. COP27 will focus on accelerating efforts to achieve the 1.5-degree Celsius temperature target set under the Paris Agreement and reinforcing the Glasgow Pact aiming to turn the 2020s into a decade of climate action. The COP26 Glasgow conference resonated with the sentiment that "we must do more" to protect communities and habitats from climate change. However, one year after the Glasgow summit, the world remains murkier on several fronts. A recent report from UN Climate Change shows countries are making efforts to bend the curve of greenhouse gas emissions downwards but these remain insufficient to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C. Reducing global emissions to half by 2030 and securing net zero by 2050 still look like a distant reality. Despite efforts to shift to a green economy, steps taken to cut global emissions remain inadequate. Just as world leaders gear up for COP27 , the International Energy Agency's (IEA) flagship report, World Energy Outlook (WEO) 2022, reveals that the global energy crisis could prove to be a historic turning point towards a cleaner and safer future. The global energy crisis triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war is causing profound and long-lasting changes that have the potential to propel the transition to a more sustainable energy system, reveals the report. The tremors felt in the markets for natural gas, coal and oil have bared the vulnerability and fragility of the current global energy system and reiterate the urgency for energy security, the report warns. The report also highlights that the global demand for fossil fuel will exhibit a peak or plateau near the end of this decade before ebbing towards the mid-century. Fatih Birol, head of the IEA, said the world is fast approaching a "pivotal moment in energy history" as demand for fossil fuels, which have underpinned the modern industrial economy, nears an inflexion point. This is expected to boost large investments in renewable energy. This may be some good news ahead of COP27 . Global fossil fuel consumption has grown alongside GDP since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century. Reversing this trajectory will be a milestone in climate action. Significant developments have taken place in the renewable energy segment. According to IEA, renewable energy installations broke new records in 2021 and these are expected to rise by 8 per cent by the end of 2022, despite supply chain intricacies and the high initial infrastructure and installing costs. Renewable energy growth is accelerating faster than ever, supporting the rise of the green energy economy with solar energy accounting for 60 per cent of the increase this year. India is making the shift to cleaner energy, with a target to draw 40 per cent of its installed electric power from non-fossil fuels by 2030. In India, the rate of growth in renewable energy doubled in 2021. India is now in the 4th position globally in terms of overall installed renewable energy capacity. Being a tropical country, India experiences bright sunny weather for nearly 300 days a year. About 5,000 trillion kWh of energy per year is incident over India's land area. Solar power can be harnessed due to its huge potential for scalability permitting decentralised distribution of energy thereby, empowering people at the grassroots level through employment generation. Decentralised off-grid standalone solar electrification is seen as a solution for unelectrified households located in remote villages, where grid extension is not feasible or cost-effective. The environmental case for clean energy needs no reinforcement, but rising concerns over energy security are likely to galvanise even more support for renewables. The cost of renewable energy is falling and there are sound economic justifications in the long run for the transition. The price of solar technologies has plummeted in the last few years. Solar power is now the cheapest electricity. By 2026, global renewable electricity capacity is forecasted to rise more than 60 per cent from 2020 levels - equivalent to the current total global power capacity of fossil fuels. This looks promising, though experts warn that even this pace of deployment would fall short of the net zero emission goal set for 2050. At COP26, parties also committed to a 100 per cent zero-emission transport future, auguring well for electric vehicles. Transport accounts for one-fifth of global carbon dioxide emissions. Road travel accounts for three-quarters of transport emissions. The focus on electric vehicles has resulted in their sales doubling in key markets in 2021. The scope of the electric vehicle market is multidimensional and there are several beneficiaries in the EV ecosystem. The EV industry in India has the potential to create some 10 million direct jobs and 50 million indirect jobs by 2030, according to the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. Though many green campaigners believe that public transport and not electric cars is the real solution, the fact that countries are adding clean transport considerations into their nationally-determined contributions as part of mitigation and adaptation strategies is a good indicator nevertheless. The enormity of the climate emergency requires committed and sustained efforts. It mandates meaningful engagement of a wide range of stakeholders. Manufacturers and service providers need to be incentivised to invest in climate-friendly solutions. Consumers and end users too have a responsibility. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has issued startling assessments of how humans have pushed the climate into unprecedented territory, documenting the deteriorating climate scenario around the globe and underlining the "brief and rapidly closing" window humans have to avoid catastrophic consequences. The UN chief called the findings "a code red for humanity", with worse climate impacts to come unless greenhouse gas emissions fall dramatically. We cannot continue to live in denial. Global warming is causing extreme weather changes at an astonishing rate. People are losing lives and habitats due to deadly and frequent heatwaves, floods and droughts triggered by the climate crisis. No nation has disavowed any promises made at COP26 nor is there any backsliding. Countries have kept the 1.5-degree Celsius climate pledge alive. However, the pulse continues to remain weak. COP26 was about ambition. COP27 has to be about implementation and action. It should focus on strengthening the building blocks to set the world on a more sustainable, low-carbon pathway. The road from Glasgow to Sharm el-Sheikh has been long and winding and is bumpy even ahead, but we all have to embark on the journey together.

The objective of the Memorandum of Understanding is to explore cooperation and investment opportunities in support of the development of the first SMR project in Romania, which could have a great impact in the realization of green steel production in Romania. Original Press Release: Bucharest, Nov. 15 -- Nuclearelectricaissued the following news release: SN Nuclearelectrica SA, the only nuclear producer in Romania and a strategic contributor to Romania's energy security and decarbonisation, announces the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between RoPower Nuclear SA, the recently established project company for the implementation of small modular reactors (SMR), and Donalam SRL, part of AFV Beltrame Group, European leader in steel production, at the IAEA Atoms for Climate pavilion at COP 27 . By joining the UN 24/7 Carbon-free Energy Compact, Nuclearelectrica and AFV Beltrame become members of a global community of organizations collaborating to develop solutions that allow access to carbon-free energy 24/7. COP27 to discuss the urgency of accelerating the clean energy transition. The recently published United Nations Emissions Gap Report 2022 [1] shows that current policies are not enough to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. Nuclear power is necessary to ensure an effective and sustainable reduction in emissions. In this context, Romania's example regarding the plans to realize the first green steelmaking with the support of clean energy produced by SMR and photovoltaic panels can encourage even more similar steps and collaborations within the industry. "Nuclearelectrica is committed to implementing the first small-sized modular reactor project in Europe, together with the re-engineering project of Unit 1 and the project of Units 3&4 from Cernavoda, at the highest standards of nuclear safety and sustainability of the environment. The expansion of nuclear capacity aims to support the energy security of Romania and the region, energy independence and the achievement of decarbonisation objectives. In this context, we are happy to announce a new step in our approach, a potential new partner in RoPower, Donalam SRL, part of the AFV Beltrame group, one of the most important steel producers in Europe. AFV Beltrame Group shares the same commitment to sustainability as we do and understands the role of nuclear energy produced by SMR in achieving international climate change goals, while ensuring energy security with a clean, stable, affordable and resilient energy source. We are proud to make this announcement during the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 We are confident that our example shows ways to advance the goals of the Paris Agreement, inspire other industry actions, encourage global and European environmental policies and both governmental and private financial support in the industrial field for companies with economic strategies and environmentally sound, derived from a sustainable approach. Furthermore, as our vision to create a sustainable future for future generations is fully aligned with the principles of the United Nations 24/7 Carbon Free Energy Compact, we are proud to join the Coalition and further support the decarbonisation of Romania's electricity system through the implementation of nuclear energy technologies without carbon emissions, both on a small scale and on a large scale .", Cosmin Ghita, CEO of Nuclearelectrica SA and President of the Board of Directors of RoPower Nuclear SA. "We are fully committed to fulfilling our vision for a sustainable business and turning into reality our ambitious investment plans for our operations in Romania - the Calarasi and Trgoviste plants, sustainability being a Group-wide priority. Energy security has recently become a topic of great relevance. Our plan to build, in the near future, the photovoltaic park in Trgoviste, as well as the partnership with RoPower, are two of the solutions to ensure our access to sustainable energy at affordable prices in the long term .", Carlo Beltrame, CEO Romania&France and Business Development Manager, AFV Beltrame Group. In Romania, SMRs will be implemented in complementarity with both high-capacity reactors and renewable sources, with the Romanian SMR project also providing for the addition of a solar production capacity within the same energy complex. The joint nuclear and renewable solution would represent not only optimal generation capacity with the possibility to vary output, but also a vision of generation sources for the electricity grid of the future. RoPower is firmly committed to developing a state-of-the-art power plant with a strong commitment to nuclear safety and environmental sustainability, which will be achieved both by replacing a former coal-fired facility with clean energy production and through partnerships with companies that have switched or plan to switch to sustainable production to significantly reduce their carbon footprint. About Nuclearelectrica Compania Nationala "Nuclearelectrica" SA is the Romanian national company producing electricity, thermal energy and nuclear fuel, which operates under the authority of the Ministry of Energy, with the state owning 82.49% of the shares, and the other shareholders, 17.50%, after the company's listing on the Stock Exchange by Valori Bucharest in 2013. CNE Cernavoda branch operates two CANDU nuclear units, which are two of the most performing units out of more than 400 nuclear power plants in the world, a nuclear fuel plant and is in the process of realizing an integrated fuel cycle by purchasing a processing line of uranium concentrate to support the company's long-term investment projects. Nuclearelectrica has a major role at the national level, contributing over 18% of nuclear energy in total energy production and 33% in total CO2-free energy production in Romania. HYPERLINK http://www.nuclearelectrica.ro www.nuclearelectrica.ro Background information regarding the stages completed by Romania in the implementation of the SMRs  In March 2019, Nuclearelectrica and NuScale signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the evaluation, development, authorization and construction of a small modular reactor (SMR) in Romania.  On October 9, 2020, Romania signed an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) in the field of nuclear energy with the United States of America, which was also ratified by the Romanian Parliament, according to Law no. 199/2021, having wide support and being adopted with a majority of votes.  Furthermore, in October 2020, US Exim Bank expressed, through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Romanian Ministry of Energy, its interest in financing major energy investment projects in Romania, including in the nuclear field, totaling a total value of 7 billion dollars.  On November 4, 2021, at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), NuScale and Nuclearelectrica signed a Team Collaboration Agreement to advance the implementation of the first small modular reactor in Europe, in the presence of the Romanian Minister of Energy, Mr. Virgil Popescu. The importance of the strategic partnership between the US and Romania and the role of SMRs was highlighted in their speeches at COP26 by the US Secretary of Energy, Jennifer M. Granholm, by the US Secretary of the Department of Energy, the Presidential Special Envoy for Climate, John Kerry, and by Klaus Iohannis, the President of Romania, as well as by the President of the USA, Joe Biden.

The report from UN Climate Change underlines the limitations of a 'voluntary' goal based system, especially among the richer countries that have sought to hide behind legal loopholes. A new report from UN Climate Change shows countries are achieving serious reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions downward but underlines that these efforts remain insufficient to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. That places a huge challenge ahead of the next COP27 meet in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, from 6 to 18 November this year, in terms of achieving any significant breakrhrough. According to the report, the combined climate pledges of 193 Parties under the Paris Agreement could put the world on track for around 2.5 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century. That figure is completely inadequate, and indicates much more extreme events to follow climate wise in the coming future. The report also shows current commitments will increase emissions by 10.6% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels. This is an improvement over last year's assessment, which found countries were on a path to increase emissions by 13.7% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels. Last year's analysis showed projected emissions would continue to increase beyond 2030. However, this year's analysis shows that while emissions are no longer increasing after 2030, they are still not demonstrating the rapid downward trend science says is necessary this decade. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 2018 report indicated that CO2 emissions needed to be cut 45% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels. The latest science from the IPCC released earlier this year uses 2019 as a baseline, indicating that GHG emissions need to be cut 43% by 2030. This is critical to meeting the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of this century and avoiding the worst impacts of climate change, including more frequent and severe droughts, heatwaves and rainfall. "The downward trend in emissions expected by 2030 shows that nations have made some progress this year," said Simon Stiell, Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change. "But the science is clear and so are our climate goals under the Paris Agreement. We are still nowhere near the scale and pace of emission reductions required to put us on track toward a 1.5 degrees Celsius world. To keep this goal alive, national governments need to strengthen their climate action plans now and implement them in the next eight years." UN Climate Change analyzed the climate action plans - known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) - of 193 Parties to the Paris Agreement, including 24 updated or new NDCs submitted after the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP 26) up until 23 September 2022. Taken together, the plans cover 94.9% of total global greenhouse gas emissions in 2019. "At the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow last year, all countries agreed to revisit and strengthen their climate plans," said Stiell. "The fact that only 24 new or updated climate plans were submitted since COP 26 is disappointing. Government decisions and actions must reflect the level of urgency, the gravity of the threats we are facing, and the shortness of the time we have remaining to avoid the devastating consequences of runaway climate change." This is UN Climate Change's second such report, providing a critical update to last year's inaugural NDC synthesis report. While the overall findings of the report are stark, there are glimmers of hope. Most of the Parties that submitted new or updated NDCs have strengthened their commitment to reducing or limiting greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 and/or 2030, demonstrating increased ambition in addressing climate change. A second UN Climate Change report on long-term low-emission development strategies, also released today, looked at countries' plans to transition to net-zero emissions by or around mid-century. The report indicated that these countries' greenhouse gas emissions could be roughly 68% per cent lower in 2050 than in 2019, if all the long-term strategies are fully implemented on time. Current long-term strategies (representing 62 Parties to the Paris Agreement) account for 83% of the world's GDP, 47% of global population in 2019, and around 69% of total energy consumption in 2019. This is a strong signal that the world is starting to aim for net-zero emissions. The report notes, however, that many net-zero targets remain uncertain and postpone into the future critical action that needs to take place now. Ambitious climate action before 2030 is urgently needed to achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. With the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ) just around the corner, Stiell called on governments to revisit their climate plans and make them stronger in order to close the gap between where emissions are heading and where science indicates they should be this decade. " COP 27 Stiell is urging national governments to come to COP 27 to show how they will put the Paris Agreement to work in their home countries through legislation, policies and programs, as well as how they will cooperate and provide support for implementation. He is also calling for nations to make progress at COP 27 in four priority areas: mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, and finance. " COP27 COP27 President-Designate. "The report from UN Climate Change and before that from the IPCC are a timely reminder for all of us. Raising ambition and urgent implementation is indispensable for addressing the climate crisis. This includes cutting and removing emissions faster and at wider scope of economic sectors, to protect us from more severe adverse climate impacts and devastating loss and damage." "The synthesis report is a testimony to the fact that we are off-track on achieving the Paris Climate Goal and keeping the 1.5 degrees within reach," added Shoukry. "This is a sobering moment, and we are in a race against time. Several of those who are expected to do more, are far from doing enough, and the consequences of this is affecting lives and livelihoods across the globe. I am conscious that it is and should be a continuum of action until 2030 then 2050, however, these alarming findings merit a transformative response at COP27 ." COP27 ." \</doc>

India, Nov. 27 -- Considering the past actions on the commitments of the developed world, this so-called deal arrived at CoP 27 is at best a face-saver document, writes Dr. VK Bahuguna The Conference of Parties (CoP), better known as CoP27 , organized by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) secretariat at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt ended on November 20 with the adoption of a declaration for the creation of a fund for providing compensation to the poor nations facing the vagaries of climate change and extreme weather conditions due to the past emissions of the rich nations. The negotiating teams and others are touting it as a historical deal, but that is a far-fetched claim. This declaration at best is a face-saving deal for the consumption back home for people of these poor nations facing the wrath of climatic vagaries. The developed countries, however, have resisted these calls, fearing opening up a floodgate for compensation claims but ultimately agreed with no surety to adhere to their commitments. On average, $4000 was needed for one person for a week to attend the CoP. Understandably, many young activists could not attend the Conference due to a lack of funds, and few bothered to raise their voices. However, the CoP opened with most heads of state and leaders heading the country delegations speaking with strong feelings on taking action for the survival of the human race and pleading forcefully against complacency. The UN secretary general Antonio Guterres delivered one of his best speeches yet when he exhorted the world leaders that "We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator". He asked the countries to "cooperate or perish". The CoP 27 CoP 27 . The approach of the developed world all through in all CoPs is to blame India and China for being the biggest emitters conveniently forgetting the havoc they wrecked on nature during the past more than 150 years and more. In 2021, China accounted for the highest 25% (15 billion metric tonnes) of global CO2 emission followed by the USA accounting for 11% (5 billion Metric tonnes) of the global total. The European Union emits around 2.8 billion metric tonnes. India's emission in 2021 was 2.7 billion metric tonnes which is around 7.5 % of the global emissions. The per capita fossil CO2 emissions in 2021 were 1.3 tC per person per year for the globe and were 4.0 (USA), 2.2 (China), 1.7 (EU27), and 0.5 (India) tC per person per year for the four highest CO2 emitting countries. India will surpass China in population in 2023, but it cannot be equated with China in funding for climate change considering the country's relatively low emissions. India's contribution to historical cumulative CO2 emissions is 3%, whereas the US. On the other hand, the EU contributed 25% and 17% respectively to total fossil CO2 emissions from 1850 to 2019. China contributed 13%, the Russian Federation 7%, and Indonesia and Brazil 1%. Thus there is no equity, justice or fairness in global climate change talks. The climate change negotiations, therefore, for most developing countries like India are proving a wastage of money and efforts as nothing concrete except our statements before the world leaders on our achievements on the Nationally Determined Targets on Paris agreement of 2015 and how much clean energy we are generating and how much trees we are planting and what is our road map for achieving net-zero emission by the year 2070. The agreement on the creation of funds to support the poor nation is just recognition by the developed world after protracted negotiations of their responsible for past emissions. Now, therefore, the issue should be taken up vigorously by the developing countries in all forums and India should launch diplomatic networking to safeguard its interests and the interests of the developing world for climate justice. India and other developing countries in the CoP 27 meet had rightfully raised the issue of the gradual elimination of all kinds of fossil fuels. Thankfully, the developed world supported this, but the Russian and Saudi Arab vehement opposition blocked ti further progress. The Indian negotiators citing the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had told the Egyptian CoP27 presidency that meeting the long-term goal of the Paris Agreement "requires phase down of all fossil fuels". "Selective singling out of sources of emissions, for either labeling them more harmful or labeling them 'green and sustainable' even when they are sources of greenhouse gases has no basis in the best available science", they contended. The developed world has been demanding phasing out the use of coal in power generation which India and other countries cannot agree. The developed world's hypocrisy is quite apparent on this as they have developed better alternatives for coal but on the issue of transfer of technology, they always duck the question. So neither they want to part with the technology nor they are willing to be liberal on funding the poor nations, yet they want to assume the leadership role in climate change dialogue. In a nutshell, the climate change talks regarding human welfare are proving bogus and a bore if we assess the progress since Kyoto Protocol was signed except a few successes obtained through Paris deal in 2015. The global mean temperature will cross the 1.5 degreeC limits in the current decade or next, and the 2 degreeC mark during 2040-2060 as estimated by the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change in their sixth report. Lip service syndrome is best exemplified by the statement of Egypt's government and subsequent decisions taken in CoP 27 . The UN Secretary-General has commented that only the creation of a loss and damage fund is not a solution. The World Bank which is outside the purview of UNFCCD can pitch in effectively in tackling the fund position if the US and its European allies are genuinely committed to treating climate change as a top global priority and accepting their responsibility to do climate justice. This was also a reason why many countries were pitching for reforms in the World Bank, which is perceived as having failed to help with the climate crisis. What is the use of the World Bank funding poverty and water-related projects in poor countries when poor countries sink further into misery due to climate-related disasters? In several areas, the temperature in India is already on the rise from 0.8 to even 1 degree Celsius. We have less time for negotiation and should strive for more time on action. Many experts feel that India should hold parallel climate change negotiations and lead the world. The country should formulate some common action programme so that developing nations and China look inwards and help each other with technology and other resources. Efforts must be made to avoid disasters as the one Pakistan witnessed recently which wiped away 13 % of the GDP. Back home the dreadful memory of the Chennai flood will haunt for years. We need to declare climate emergencies in each country and support a programme to meet the emergency. In the Indian scenario, we need to declare water scarcity and its poor management, agricultural uncertainties, soil degradation, and natural forest and bio-diversity depletion as a climatic emergency and emphasize alternative fuels for our transport and energy sector. Unplanned waste disposal, poor investment in natural resources, and population control must be the focus area in the overall climate action plan. Already the success is excellent on solar power generation targets. However, on climate change, world leaders should remember one quote by Zimbabwean Philosopher Matshona Dhliwayo "Busy hands achieve more than idle tongues." Let us junk these half-baked dreams being sold in diffused glib negotiations and focus on concrete doable actions. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Pioneer.

NASA will participate in the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, which begins Sunday, Nov. 6, and runs through Friday, Nov. 18. The COP27 summit brings together countries from around the world to increase ambition by implementing existing goals and strengthening commitments to solutions that address climate change. The agencys vantage point from space provides critical information to advance understanding of our changing planet, including impacts from greenhouse gas emissions, the effects of warming including the decline of Arctic Sea ice, rising sea levels, more severe wildfires and shifting animal migration patterns. NASA has a unique role in the global effort to continue understanding impacts of climate change and in addressing and mitigating those impacts, said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. Beyond our Earth-observing satellites in space, instruments and research which provide an unparalleled understanding of our home planet, we are committed to working with our international partners to provide free and open data to the public. NASA is excited to be part of the discussions at COP27 to help answer the most pressing questions in addressing climate change. Throughout the conference, NASA staff and scientists will speak at several events and give presentations at the NASA Hyperwall, an interactive visual display of NASA imagery and data. Staff in attendance will include: Kate Calvin, NASAs chief scientist and senior climate advisor Susie Perez Quinn, NASAs chief of staff Tahani Amer, program executive, NASA Earth Science Division Mike Falkowski, program scientist, terrestrial ecology, NASA Earth Science Division To inquire about interview availability with one or more of these staff members, media should contact Tylar Greene at: HYPERLINK mailto:tylar.j.greene@nasa.gov tylar.j.greene@nasa.gov The NASA Hyperwall will be a main attraction at the U.S. Center. NASA scientists will provide two presentations per day, showing how NASAs global leadership in climate science and research helps model and predict ocean health, heat waves, wildfires, hurricanes, floods, and droughts. The full list of NASA presentations during the conference is available online. Climate adaptation and mitigation efforts cannot succeed without robust climate observations and research. NASAs fleet of satellites and instruments observe how the planet is changing and measure key climate indicators, such as rising sea level, intensity of precipitation, and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. NASA is currently working to launch the next generation of Earth observing satellites- the Earth System Observatory, which will provide a 3D, holistic view of Earth to help us better understand what our planets changes mean for humanity. NASA is also designing an Earth Information Center, which will allow people to see how our planet is changing and provide easy-to-use information and resources that support decision makers to mitigate, adapt and respond to climate change. \</doc>

Copenhagen, Nov 8 (IANS) Hans Kluge, regional director for Europe at the World Health Organization (WHO), called the current response to climate change "dangerously inconsistent and far too slow" in a statement. "Climate change and the crises it has triggered have long been clear health emergencies. WHO and (its) partners have long sounded the alarm," Kluge said, urging participants of the current United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt to act faster and more coherently. To avoid increasing exposure and vulnerability to heatwaves and other extreme weather events, Kluge called for drastic adaptation and mitigation measures that could tackle climate change and improve individual, societal and planetary health, Xinhua news agency reported. According to Kluge, the devastating wildfires that hit Europe last summer had caused the highest carbon emissions since 2007, "polluting our air, killing many people". He warned that extreme temperatures caused heat stress, which had become the leading weather-related cause of death in Europe. Based on country data, the WHO puts the number of heat-related deaths to 15,000 in 2022, Kluge said. Last year, high-impact weather and climate events like floods and storms directly affected over half a million people, he said. Kluge cited a report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), saying that Europe was the fastest-warming region in the world, where extreme temperatures had accounted for over 148,000 lives lost in the last 50 years. "We need to do it now if we are to prevent the climate crisis from turning into an irreversible climate disaster for our region and our entire planet," he said. --IANS int/sha \</doc>

The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and climate and impact fund manager Camco signed a Memorandum of Understanding today to ramp up investments in climate-resilient agriculture in Southern Africa. Rural populations across Southern Africa are heavily dependent on rain-fed agriculture for subsistence farming, which puts them at the frontline of worsening climate variability across the region. As has been emphasized at the ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), adaptation finance for agriculture in Southern Africa requires significant scaling up and incentivisation to build capacity and unlock private sector investment in climate-smart agriculture to promote adaptation and build climate resilience. Under the agreement, UNIDO and Camco will promote access to climate finance, which will support developing countries in meeting their climate commitments and in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through accelerating sustainable industrial and economic development. As COP27 is focused on implementation, the collaboration between UNIDO and Camco will aim at delivering tangible climate resilience via the Resilient Investment in Southern Africa (RISA) programme, which is currently being prepared for submission to the Green Climate Fund. RISA will enhance climate resilience of some of Africas most vulnerable groups by investing in small to medium-size enterprises (SMEs), since SMEs in the agricultural value chain are the best source of innovative adaptation solutions for the short to medium term. RISA will seek to address climate vulnerability and risk by building resilience through the cost-effective deployment of products and services via SMEs within the agricultural value chain. The programme will consist of two interlinked components: a technical assistance facility, managed by UNIDO, and an investment facility, managed by Camco. Gerd Mller, Director General of UNIDO, said: Climate change is the single greatest threat to a sustainable future. Addressing the climate challenge presents a golden opportunity to promote prosperity and a brighter future for all. Geoff Sinclair, Managing Director at Camco, said: Todays signing of the agreement with UNIDO represents a very exciting moment for Camco as we continue to pursue new opportunities to support sustainable development and climate adaptation. The partnership draws on UNIDOs extensive capacity and experience as the UNs specialized agency promoting industrial development and progress by innovation, and Camcos long track record of deploying sustainable finance in Africa and other developing markets around the world, making the partnership the ideal union for developing and implementing RISA. \</doc>

Phasing out coal: KfW provides a loan of EUR 300 million for a socially responsible and ecologically sustainable transformation of the energy sector in South Africa. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 in Egypt, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the President of the Republic of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, and French President Emmanuel Macron, together with other representatives of the G7 and the EU, pledged their support for the investment plan of the world's first Just Energy Transition Partnership (JET-P) on 7 November. Under the JET-P, South Africa has been pledged up to USD 8.5 billion over the next 3-5 years by partner countries to support the coal phase-out. Key Highlights:  KfW is supporting South Africa's energy transition on behalf of the German government with a promotional loan of up to EUR 300 million.  The French development bank Agence Franaise de Dveloppement (AFD) has also issued a loan of EUR 300 million.  80% of electricity is generated using coal.  The goal is to reduce the share of fossil fuels in the South African electricity mix to a maximum of 48% by 2030, while increasing the share of renewable energies to at least 38%. Original Press Release: Phasing out coal: KfW provides a loan of EUR 300 million for a socially responsible and ecologically sustainable transformation of the energy sector in South Africa. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 The investment plan forms the basis for Germany's contribution of up to USD 1 billion to the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JET-P), which South Africa agreed with Germany, three other countries and the EU at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow last year. Under the JET-P, South Africa has been pledged up to USD 8.5 billion over the next 3-5 years by partner countries to support the coal phase-out. The South African government's goal is to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and phase out coal production. KfW is supporting South Africa's energy transition on behalf of the German government with a promotional loan of up to EUR 300 million. The French development bank Agence Franaise de Dveloppement (AFD) has also issued a loan of EUR 300 million. South Africa has been heavily dependent on coal-fired power generation. 80% of electricity is generated using coal. The low electricity prices attracted energy-intensive companies. But what once appeared to be an advantage is now proving to be a trap. Coal-fired power generation produces high carbon dioxide emissions, and an international comparison shows just how high: South Africa is among the 13 countries with the highest levels worldwide. Measured by its economic power, it even ranks fourth. In the meantime, a rethink has begun. The South African government is aiming for a complete phase-out of coal use. Renewable energies are to replace it. Preserving jobs in the coalfields as well The goal is to reduce the share of fossil fuels in the South African electricity mix to a maximum of 48% by 2030, while increasing the share of renewable energies to at least 38%. This will require major efforts. Both green power generation capacity and the grid need to be expanded. This requires huge investments. But that is not the end of the story. The switch initially threatens many jobs. So far, 90,000 South Africans work in the coal industry. The unemployment rate is very high at just under 35%, and even higher in the coal regions. In order to make the energy transition in South Africa socially responsible, investments are needed in vocational training and alternative sectors such as green hydrogen or electric vehicles. KfW's promotional loan contributes to addressing these challenges. Source: KfW Development Bank [Category: Banking & Finance, Energy, Coal, ESG] \</doc>

India, Nov. 13 -- For the first time, food systems and agriculture are figuring at a Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) and The Rockefeller Foundation are hosting the official Food and Agriculture Pavilion at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) being held from 6 to 18 November at Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt. This welcome move comes at a time the world is faced with unprecedented drought, heatwave and floods. At the same time the Ukraine war has left one of the biggest impacts felt world-wide in the area of food security. All this has dented food production across the globe and agriculture is seen to be vulnerable to extreme weather events brought on by climate change. Drought across Europe, the US and Africa, heatwave in India and floods and drought in Pakistan and China are evidence that climate change has spared no one. Organisations representing over 350 million farmers and producers wrote an open letter to world leaders November 7, calling for adaptation finance to help subsistence farmers in poor nations. Small-scale farmers from developing countries produce one-third of the world's food, yet they only receive 1.7 per cent of climate finance even as they are forced to cope with droughts, floods, cyclones and other disasters. Ironically, while agriculture is a victim of climate change, it is also responsible for more than a third of all greenhouse gas emissions. "The Food and Agriculture Pavilion will put the transformation of agrifood systems at the heart of the COP agenda for the first time as an important part of the solution to the climate crisis," the FAO said in a statement. The array of discussions over the two weeks include adaption for resilient agriculture in Africa, climate security for drylands, vulnerability of food systems to global food crisis, conflicts and trade shocks, and low emission climate resilient development strategies. Dina Saleh, the Regional Director of IFAD called on world leaders from developed nations to honour their pledge made 13 years ago at COP15 Copenhagen to provide $100 billion a year in climate finance to developing nations and to channel half of that amount to climate adaptation. Ms. Saleh cautioned that there is a "narrow window" to help rural poor people to survive and protect their communities, and that crop yields could reduce by as much as 50 per cent by the end of the century. "The choice is between adapting or starving," she warned, urging COP27 to be about action, credibility and justice for the invisible and the silent. To address these issues, the COP27 Egyptian Presidency launched on 11 November a new initiative Food and Agriculture for Sustainable Transformation (FAST), to improve the quantity and quality of climate finance contributions to transform agriculture and food systems by 2030. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization(FAO), along with other UN agencies, will be the facilitator of this initiative, which, according to Zitouni Ould-Dada, Deputy Director of the agency's Climate and Environment Division, puts agriculture at the heart of efforts to tackle climate change. "The message really is to recognize that agriculture must be an integral part of the solution to the climate crisis," he said. India story While Indian agriculture is adversely impacted by climate change, the sector also is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As per the Third Biennial Update Report submitted by the Government of India in early 2021 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the agriculture sector contributes 14 per cent of the total GHG emissions. India's approach has been a balancing act between growth and sustainability in its climate change policies. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research and International Agricultural Research Centres of the CGIAR system (a France-headquartered public agricultural innovation network), including International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), have developed climate smart agricultural technologies and approaches to assist the agricultural sector to be less vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. Agriculture remains the backbone of India's economy and smallholder farmers constitute the bulk of the country's agrarian population. However, Indian farming is highly dependent on rainfall, which continues to defy projections and has been increasingly erratic in recent years. To meet the challenge posed by climate change, while meeting food and energy needs in an environmentally and socially sustainable way, climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is becoming popular around the globe. CSA is defined by the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) as a strategy to transform agri-food systems to be more environmentally friendly and climate-resilient. CSA thus focuses on adapting and building resilience to climate change. It is an approach to transform agriculture systems to effectively respond to the challenges posed by climate change and ensure food security. At the COP26 conference in Glasgow, Scotland, last year, scientists and farmers called for more climate-resilient food and energy systems while highlighting the existing technology. They pressed on the fact that transformative agricultural systems exist and agriculture can be climate-friendly. India has seen in recent years, improved technologies and practices for better water management and climate-smart agriculture. Some of these CSA methods include solar-based irrigation systems and Direct Seeded Rice (DSR). Taking this CSA method further, a rural development NGO, S M Sehgal Foundation has developed a two-pronged approach to build resilience in agriculture and create mechanisms to cope with or adapt to the effect of climate change in agriculture. Under its Agriculture Development programme, the Foundation's team works with farmers to promote water use efficiency in agriculture, soil health and nutrient management, renewable energy, appropriate farm machinery, protected cultivation and salt tolerant varieties of cereal and vegetable crops. The programme promotes sustainable livelihoods by building the capacities of farmers, including women producers, on improved agricultural practices and new technologies. Smallholder farmers in rain-fed and irrigated areas are facilitated to adopt improved and advanced agricultural practices that include soil health management, crop production management, input-use efficiency, small farm mechanization, water-efficient irrigation techniques, horticultural development, livestock management, and the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in agriculture. "A planned approach to adaptation in agriculture and development practices are necessary to cope with climate change and make agri-production resilient to climate changes and shocks," the Foundation has said. Using a "learn-by-doing" approach, the programme helps build the farmers' capacity to maximize their crop productivity and manage soil health. Results are demonstrated on the farmers' own fields with side-by-side control and treated fields. Water-saving agri techniques Irrigation and water-use efficiency can be improved through micro irrigation, mulching, laser leveling, direct seeded rice (DSR) and use of water absorbents to maintain soil moisture. The use of these water-saving irrigation practices reduces the consumption of water by 25-85 per cent, while reducing the cost of labour and the incidences of weeds and diseases in crops. Zero tillage and laser levelling are not known to most farmers in India. Zero tillage preserves moisture in the soil thereby reducing the irrigation cycle for crops. Laser-levelling technology, which has huge potential to save irrigation water, is a precision levelling technique for agricultural fields, which levels the field and reduces the slope. Promotion of renewable energy is another crucial facet of improved agriculture technique. Adoption of renewable energy in farming practices without compromising on productivity reduces input costs, particularly as an alternative for petroleum products. These measures include solar water pumps and solar sprays. Greenhouse farming has been promoted to support growth of crops within sheltered structures for favourable growing conditions and protect crops from vagaries of weather and various pests. Sehgal Foundation has also conducted pilot initiatives in some areas, including subsurface irrigation that uses buried diffuser that supplies water directly to the root zone and are 15-20 per cent more efficient than drip irrigation, and use of zeba that maintains the soil moisture.

Cairo, Sep 12 (IANS) Egyptian Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Hani Suweilam said on Sunday that Egypt is one of the world's most affected countries by climate change, a news website reported. The Egyptian minister made the remarks during the opening session of an environmental and development forum on Egypt's preparations to host the 27th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) that will be held in the Red Sea resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh in November, Xinhua news agency reported, citing Ahram Online news website. Egypt is suffering water scarcity, high temperature, erosion and saltwater intrusion into fresh water, the minister was quoted as saying. The increases in population, unstable water shares (from rivers such as the Nile) and climate impacts have led to a shortage of water used for drinking, agricultural and industrial purposes in several countries, he added. The minister also urged all countries to strengthen cooperation on dealing with extreme climate, stressing the need to place the water sector, food and agriculture on the global climate agenda. Egypt is making great efforts in improving water management, which includes rehabilitating canals to better deliver water to farmers, Suweilam said, adding water is a key element in agriculture and food security. The minister underlined the necessity of expanding water desalination projects, studying less costly and more efficient ways of reusing wastewater. --IANS int/shs \</doc>

Sharm El Sheikh, Nov. 22 -- World leaders failed to rise to the climate crisis challenge at this year's UN Climate Conference ( COP27 ), experts said on Monday, pointing out how there was a lack of any commitments to cutting emissions or providing more money to help the transition to clean fuels. COP27 was concluded in Egypt's Sharm El Sheikh on Saturday, extended by a day after dramatic remarks from several country representatives who rued the lack of "ambition" to do more on the climate crisis, even as some of them - especially those from developed nations - were accused of trying to divert some of their responsibilities to poorer nations. This is despite the fact that the talks took a much-awaited decision to set up a Loss and Damage fund to help developing nations deal with disasters linked to global warming, although much needs to be clarified on this front too, including who will contribute to it and how the money will be paid out. " COP27 Mitigation refers to efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouses gases, a step that is taken, among other things, by shifting to cleaner fuels. "Does this mean that nothing will happen on mitigation? Not necessarily. Countries, including India, seem to be putting in place efforts at transitioning to green technologies such as energy storage and hydrogen, driven by the hope of competitive advantage. We may be in a phase where actual action outstrips international statements of ambition, at least in some parts of the world, which would not be a bad outcome," Dubash added. To be sure, the COP27 cover text, which summarises the key decisions agreed upon by 197 countries, mentions that more efforts must be made to keep global warming under 1.5degC - the call was first made last year, at Glasgow during COP26. " COP 27 does not reflect the need for urgency in action -- both in terms of mitigation and financing. The loss and damage fund, though agreed upon, is weak on detail and intent. The fact that the EU (European Union) and other western countries faced with energy crisis want to continue use of natural gas, also a fossil fuel, has made the rapid transition out of fossils now even more difficult. I believe this COP should go down as one in which the world leaders failed us badly," said Sunita Narain, director general, Centre for Science and Environment. Narain's reference on the transition was to a change in wording in one section, which called for efforts to be made to use "low emission" sources. "Apart from reiterating the same intent, the final resolution does not call upon parties to decarbonise faster and in fact weakens the global need to move away from fossil fuels by bringing in low emissions energy (alluding in all likelihood to gas) in addition to renewable energy," said Ashwini Hingne, senior manager, Climate Program, World Resources Institute India. Behind a lot of the inertia are geopolitical complications. The European Union acknowledged at the conference that it will have to depend on diversified sources of natural gas for the next three years. When EU Climate chief Frans Timmermans was asked on EU looking to source natural gas from Africa, he said during a press briefing at COP27 on November 15 that: "We have to make sure our households and businesses survive in the next couple of years. We will be faced with this winter and next two winters where we have to ensure we have fossil fuels to survive. Because of speeding up deployment of renewables and because of consumption reduction we are still on target. So yes, we are burning more coal than we had intended and look for LNG where we can find it but that's only for next three years," he said, referring to the disruption in gas supply to Europe due to Russia's war on Ukraine. This was even when developed countries like EU pushed for global commitments to phase out fossil fuels, a stand experts said did not have a moral ground because of their plans to press ahead with more oil and gas use.

Sharm El-Sheikh, Nov 16 (IANS) The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) announced a new initiative on Wednesday at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ), the Nature for Cool Cities Challenge, which incentivises cities to use the cooling power of nature. The Nature for Cool Cities Challenge is a joint effort under the framework of the UNEP-led Cool Coalition. SEforALL, WWF, Mission Innovation, RMI, WRI, the University of Oxford, Durham University and other Cool Coalition members joined forces to set up this challenge. By 2100, cities around the world could warm by four degrees Celsius on average, exposing the growing urban population to conditions that will damage human health, productivity, and quality of life. Cities are on the frontlines, dealing daily with the impacts of climate change. Solutions exist to cool the cities sustainably. The cities can turn to nature to reduce local temperatures and increase the resilience of their citizens. Nature-based solutions such as forests, green belts and parks in and around cities can deliver cooling services, without damaging emissions. The cooling benefits of such solutions are well-documented, but they need to be better understood and leveraged to increase implementation and bring about change at a global level. "We have come to COP27 at a time of global crisis, but these crises are a reason to increase our climate ambition, not reduce it. The Challenge's goal -- scaling up nature-based solutions to tackle climate change impacts in cities -- is an important one," said WWF Global Lead for Climate and Energy, Manuel Pulgar-Vidal. "Cities play a key role in avoiding the most severe impacts of global warming and it is important that we champion ambitious and sustainable efforts to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change." Municipalities, groups of municipalities, or regional governments will pledge to increase the number of high-quality nature-based cooling solutions by 2030, with demonstrable progress by 2025. They will have to agree on a quantitative and funding target for local spending, and at least three implementation actions to back their pledges. "In a warming world, cities have a critical role to play in achieving SDG 7, delivering sustainable cooling, and meeting the climate crisis. We urge them to embrace nature as a tool to cool their cities and pledge to scale up nature-based solutions by joining this challenge," said Sherry Kennedy, Director of Communications at SEforALL. "The Nature for Cool Cities Challenge will help us demonstrate the power of urban nature to adapt to the effects of extreme heat, avoid emissions, and reduce energy demand." In an effort to harness the power of nature for cooling in the Global South, the Cool Coalition partners convening the challenge will provide incubation support for a cohort of cities in low and lower-middle income countries that require assistance in defining their ambition. For the award winners, matching finance for implementation of their pledges will be provided, based on the value of investment committed, tiered by the income level of the country, alongside technical assistance, support for the development of partnerships and matchmaking. "To make peace with nature, we need to rebuild our cities with nature in mind,a said Sheila Aggarwal-Khan, Director of UNEP's Economy Division. "But truly replicable nature-based solutions require partnership between local governments, the private sector, experts, and practitioners. It is decisive that financial institutions, investors, and businesses step up and help make this vision a reality." The Nature for Cool Cities Challenge will demonstrate urban nature-based solutions' ability to reduce the urban heat island effect, avoid emissions, and lower energy demand. One year from now, at COP 28, the Cool Coalition will showcase challenge participants, their pledges, and donor contributions that are helping cities deliver on their pledges. --IANS vg/svn/ \</doc>

Vice President Faisal Naseem asked on Tuesday for the support and assistance of the international community for the Maldives to realise the goals outlined in its Climate Prosperity Plan (CPP). He made the call in his keynote address at the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) and Vulnerable Group of 20 (V20) event held on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ). Shedding light on the threats and drastic impacts of climate change on the Maldives and other climate-vulnerable nations, the Vice President stressed that the countries exposure to the slow onset of climate threats was bound to increase due to insufficient action from the international community. We therefore gather here today as climate-vulnerable nations fighting for survival, pleading for more than mere survival, he added. Our nations deserve to thrive. They deserve to tap into prosperity and abundance and to guarantee the greatest well-being for our people. Speaking about the Maldives CPPs, the Vice President stated that they serve as investment instruments and as plans for raising the funds required for ambitious climate action. He noted that the prosperity plan is about turning this challenge into an opportunity for growth, health, and development. The Vice President stated that the Maldives CPP details a strategy to manage sea level rise and not only preserve but also rebound biodiversity, including the highly threatened coral reefs of the Maldives. He also noted that the CPP would help the Maldives advance on an integrated energy system to scale up the renewable energy transition in the country rapidly. The Vice President added that a successful transition to a prosperity pathway would call for a full-economy strategy that includes the contributions of all stakeholders. Announcing that the Maldives anticipates the completion of its CPP in the coming months, the Vice President emphasised the necessity for complete cooperation and the full concessional finance envelope at our disposal to make this happen. \</doc>

India, Nov. 20 -- WEB DESK COP 27 was held today at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt. The conference which was held with the view to building on the previous successes and paving the way for future ambition concluded with countries coming together to take action towards achieving the world's collective climate goals. Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav made the intervention at the Closing Plenary and said termed it as a historic COP where agreement has been secured for loss and damage funding arrangements including setting up a loss and damage fund. He welcomed the inclusion of the transition to sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of consumption and production in efforts to address climate change in the cover decision. The Minister stressed that for most developing countries, just transition cannot be equated with decarbonization, but with low-carbon development. He added that developing countries need independence in their choice of the energy mix, and in achieving the SDGs. He said that developed countries taking the lead in climate action is therefore a very important aspect of the global just transition.

In preparation of the forthcoming COP27 meeting that will take place from 6 to 18 November 2022 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, UN Resident Coordinator Office, British Embassy in Kazakhstan, Embassy of Italy in Kazakhstan and Embassy of Egypt in Kazakhstan in partnership with KazGUU University organised a student debate COP27 : the Voice of Youth from Glasgow to Sharm El-Sheikh. The event was aimed to raise awareness about climate change, to put the topic on the public agenda, inspire and encourage youth to find climate solutions. The pre- COP27 debates united about 30 students of International Relations, Economics, and Law faculties from KazGUU University, forming 4 teams to discuss countries collaboration, climate change mitigation, adaptation and sustainable finance. Addressing the students, UN Resident Coordinator in Kazakhstan Ms. Michaela Friberg-Storey noted: Todays event is a continuation of a good tradition. Its time to regain trust and work together constructively to build on Glasgow and deliver a package of concrete outcomes at COP-27 . UN Country Team collaborates with the Government of Kazakhstan in terms of updating NDC for further submission to the Conference of the Parties this year. It wont be easy, but scientists say that it is possible-and that each degree matters, each year matters, and each decision matters. In this regard youth is a strong force, which helps us to accelerate the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals and make us more accountable.The Glasgow COP brought together close to 200 countries (including over 120 world leaders) and gave the world the tools needed to keep 1.5C alive. The Glasgow Climate Pact remains the blueprint for accelerating climate action in this critical decade. Yet the Pact is simply words on a page without action. This is a pivotal moment to redouble our efforts. Every country must revisit and strengthen their climate change targets. We must also support climate vulnerable countries by making sure commitments on adaptation and loss and damage are honoured, driving real, practical action on the ground. None of this will be possible without mobilising climate finance. We continue to work with countries, international financial institutions and private financial institutions to meet the commitments they have made and help secure greater access to critical finance.COP26 messages were pretty clear: ensuring promises on emissions reductions; delivering for climate vulnerable countries by ensuring commitments on adaptation and loss and damage are honoured; getting finance flowing; working together and continuing to be an inclusive Presidency. This is the very core of the message we would like to deliver to our Egyptian friends. The strapline of COP27 , Together for implementation is made up of 2 key words: implementation, which is the common goal we must share to save the planet; and together, which indicates the path we must pace if we want to reach out to that goal. Next month, Egypt will be hosting COP27 with a view to building on previous successes and paving the way for future ambition.? Ms. Manal Elsayed Yehia Elshinnawi, Ambassador of Egypt to Kazakhstan, said: Egypts COP27 Presidency believes in the necessity to have inclusive, rules based, ambitious and substantive outcomes, up to the scale of the challenge and reflective to the political will, based on science and guided by principles, building on decisions and commitments from Rio 1992 to Glasgow 2021. Effective implementation requires meaningful and inclusive engagement with all stakeholders. This acquires particular significance in relation to youth, as we live in a world where 52% of its inhabitants are under 30 years old. Youth as well are leading at the frontline of creative and effective solutions that support their local communities and the broader global response to the climate crises. Thus, the incoming Egyptian Presidency is keen to make COP27 a hallmark for youth inclusive and meaningful engagement. \</doc>

New Delhi: A formal draft of an UN summit's climate deal that came out on Friday makes no mention of India's call for phase down of all fossil fuels. The draft showed little progress on key issues like loss and damage funding, adaptation fund replenishment and a new collective quantified goal on climate finance. It also omits references to the need for rich nations to attain "net-negative carbon emissions by 2030" and their disproportionate consumption of the global carbon budget, something that India and other poor and developing countries have stressed during the summit in Egypt. The 10-page draft document is a refined version of the 20-page "non-paper" or an informal draft published by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at the climate change conference COP27 on Thursday. The "draft text on COP 27 's overarching decision" reaffirmed that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius requires rapid and deep emission cuts. It puts a "placeholder" for funding arrangements to address loss and damage, meaning that parties are yet to reach a consensus on the matter. Loss and damage refer to the consequences of climate change that go beyond what people can adapt to, or when options exist but a community doesn't have the resources to access or utilise them. A placeholder also exists for a new global climate finance target, also known as the new collective quantified goal on climate finance, from the floor of USD 100 billion per year. Financing or a new fund for addressing loss and damage -- for example money needed for relocating people displaced by floods -- has been a long-pending demand of poor and developing countries, including India. Developed nations, particularly the US, have opposed this new fund over fears it will hold them legally liable for massive damages caused by climate change. In a bid to prevent a collapse of talks, European Union chief negotiator Frans Timmermans proposed a plan that tied loss and damage with emission cuts. The success of the talks depends on progress on this matter. In exchange for the fund, the proposal asks countries to peak emissions before 2025 and phase down all fossil fuels and not just coal. \</doc>

India, Nov. 19 -- Developing countries and the West led by the US are at odds over climate change compensation in COP27 The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, has turned into a battleground of a sort with two sides clearly demarcated by their interests. On one side are developed countries led by the United States of America and on the other are developing nations. The fight of course is over the issue of who pays to clear the mess the planet is in. The pollution has led to climate change and rise in temperature of the planet. A small change in temperature has brought big and fundamental change in the economies of the developing countries. They are facing vagaries of weather which is resulting in catastrophes on a global scale. And it is no secret that the developed countries are to blame when it comes to polluting the planet earth. Of course new entrants to the polluters club are India and China, both from the developing countries.Now the premise of developing countries is simple. The climate has changed due to the pollution that comes from the developed countries and they happen to be the worst victims. They have neither money nor technology to fight the menace. So they should pay the money to the developing countries. Indeed developing countries disproportionately suffer the worst climate-change-related natural disasters, in part due to geographic location and vulnerable infrastructure. These countries have for years been calling for compensation for the effects of climate change, known as "loss and damage," in climate diplomacy speak. As the impact of climate change becomes more severe, those demands have intensified. After a year of dramatic disasters linked to climate change, such as record-setting heat waves, droughts and tropical hurricanes, representatives of developing nations - including Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, who is serving as president of COP27 - have said a successful outcome this time will have to include a loss-and-damage fund. In fact, small island nations have threatened to walk out on the conference if the text of an agreement does not include a fund for loss and damage. The, rich countries have been shying away from owning the responsibility so far. The damages could be as high as $400 billion per year by the end of this decade. They refuse to provide compensation for loss and damage. Even the U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has backed the developing nations. If the rich countries do not own up their responsibility we are heading for more trouble in times to come. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Pioneer.

Statement from the Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, on the United States multi-country Declaration to cut emissions from the oil and gas sector announced today at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ): Canada joins our continental ally, energy partner, and largest mutual trading alliance in a shared commitment to reduce emissions from the oil and gas sector. Canada welcomes the ambition outlined in the Declaration to focus on solutions to lower methane emissions, which is also a priority for the Government of Canada. Past climate actions by the Government of Canada, the oil and gas producing provinces, and the industry, provide a solid foundation to reduce emissions in the years ahead. With oil and gas profits reaching record heights, now is the time for those companies to invest in positioning themselves for future success in a decarbonized world economy. In fact, Canadas largest oil and gas companies have committed to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, and many are making significant investments to further reduce their methane emissions. We welcome and encourage this commitment. The Government of Canada is reinforcing these efforts with new regulations to cap and cut emissions in the oil and gas sector, including regulations to cut methane from oil and gas by at least seventy-five percent from 2012 levels by 2030, clean fuel regulations, and funding to clean up orphan wells, as well as tax incentives for carbon-capture technologies and the development of clean fuels and technologies, such as hydrogen, biomethanization, and more. Climate change wont wait for us. We have a short decade of opportunity for a smooth transition toward an economy powered by clean energy that supports good, sustainable jobs, and a liveable planet. Working together, we can make it happen. \</doc>

Ministers of Brazil, South Africa, India and China representing the BASIC Group met today at the 27th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 27 ) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Ministers pledged their full support to the Egyptian COP27 Presidency for a successful conference, which should deliver an ambitious, equitable and balanced outcome, including substantial progress towards the establishment of a finance mechanism for Loss and Damage. The principle of common but different responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of national circumstances was emphasised. Ministers highlighted that despite the enormous developmental challenges and pressures of poverty eradication at a time of global economic downturn and economic recovery, the BASIC countries continue to lead from the front on climate change actions, in the context of their overarching sustainable development imperatives. Speaking on this occasion Union Minister Shri Bhupender Yadav said: "Colleagues, It gives me immense pleasure to meet with you at COP27 at a crucial juncture for this conference. Our host and the COP President, the Arab Republic of Egypt, have worked tirelessly to make this COP a success. This COP has been rightly named the COP of Implementation. As BASIC countries, we have always been for action. Unfortunately, promises, either for 2030 or 2050, have been the dominant narrative that developed countries have sought to establish. At this COP, we have been active in promoting action in key areas of relevance particularly to the majority of the vulnerable populations of the world. Adaptation and loss and damage have been of particular importance to us in this regard. But the focus is always on mitigation, in one way or the other. So, I wish to elaborate on issues related to mitigation briefly. First of all, I am happy to inform you that India is submitting its Long-Term Low-Carbon Development Strategy to the UNFCCC, which I released yesterday at our India Pavilion here at COP27 . Our low-carbon development strategy details, across seven sectors, all the actions that we are currently pursuing, in order to enable us to achieve our NDC goals by 2030. We have not focused on targets. We recognize that various factors may shift targets, including the development of technology, global economic and geopolitical trends and the extent of international cooperation. There are of course inevitable risks in the long journey to net zero. But focusing on a range of immediate actions enables us to be confident that our way forward will evolve suitably, while taking into account changing circumstances. Our initiatives include the continued expansion of renewables and the strengthening of the grid, rational utilization of our fossil fuel resources, promoting e-vehicles through major initiatives, steady increase of bio-fuel blending in petrol and diesel, and expansion of our energy efficiency across sectors and drawing in more industrial units. We have a visionary initiative in green hydrogen as the fuel of the future. Colleagues, we have already brought many of these initiatives to the stage of implementation. Our annual financial budget this year, for 2022-23 provides a number of examples of the efforts we are making, using our own resources in the absence of climate finance. Recognizing the critical role of solar power, the budget has sharply increased the production linked incentive for domestic integrated solar manufacturing facilities from last year's allocation of Rs4500 crores to Rs, 19,500 crores. In a forward-looking initiative, energy storage systems, including grid-scale battery systems are to be given infrastructure status. Our rational utilization of our fossil fuel resources can also be seen in the initiatives in our budget. The first is the introduction of co-firing in all thermal power plants with biomass pellets as fuel, taking forward the current initiatives that are already under way in this respect. The use of biomass pellets in thermal power plants will not only reduce carbon emissions but also provide additional earnings for farmers, animal keeper and help reduce the incidents of stubble burning. The second is the renewed attention to coal, through four pilot plants for coal gasification and the conversion of coal into chemicals for industry that will establish technical and financial viability. To drive the wide range of the proposed initiatives across the range of environment, sustainability and climate action, the budget announced that government would issue sovereign Green Bonds, as a part of government's overall market borrowings in 2022-23, for mobilizing resources for green infrastructure. The proceeds are to flow to public sector projects which help in reducing the carbon intensity of the economy. For encouraging important sunrise activity such as climate action, the government is to promote thematic funds for blended finance with the government share being limited to 20 per cent and the funds being managed by private fund managers. While making such determined efforts, well beyond our share of responsibility, in undertaking climate action, India would like to reiterate its position on two key issues. The first is equity and climate justice. India holds that all countries are entitled to their fair share of the global carbon budget and must stay within this in their cumulative emission. Physical access to the remaining carbon budget must be provided by developed countries reaching net zero much earlier than their current target dates. Also access to the fair share of the full budget must be provided. This can be done through extensive negative emissions and monetizing the carbon debt of the developed countries. Second, we must clarify our view of Just Transition. Just transition cannot mean de-carbonization for all countries. For India, just transition means transition to a low-carbon development strategy over a time scale that ensures food and energy security, growth and employment, leaving no one behind in the process. Any partnership with developed countries, in our view, must be based on these considerations. At COP27 , we must once again impress on our developed country partners that actions are the key and not mere promises. One pledge after another, with several such pledges per COP, are not necessarily fruitful. Measuring progress through actions that then lead to direct emissions reduction - this is what the developed countries ought to demonstrate to the world. In climate action, no sector, no fuel source and no gas should be singled out for action. In the spirit of the Paris Agreement, countries will do what is suitable as per their national circumstances. With these words, I once again convey my greetings to all of you on the occasion of our meeting here at COP27 ." For BASIC Ministerial Joint Statement click here.  HS/SSV \</doc>

The governments of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and the State of Israel have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) to advance the clean energy and sustainable water desalination projects announced last year. The MoU was signed in the presence of H.H. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and UAEs Special Envoy for Climate Change and John Kerry, United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate. The agreement was signed by Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and the Environment Mohammad Al Najjar, Jordans Minister of Water and Irrigation, and Esawi Frej, Israels Minister of Regional Cooperation. The MoU relates to Project Prosperity, which has two components: Prosperity Green and Prosperity Blue. Prosperity Green includes a 600-megawatt (MW) solar photovoltaic plant, complemented with electric storage, which will be built in Jordan and produce clean energy for export to Israel. Prosperity Blue is a sustainable water desalination program, located in Israel, to export to Jordan 200 million cubic metres of potable water per annum. The three countries signed an initial Declaration of Intent to explore the feasibility of both projects at Expo 2020 Dubai in the UAE in November 2021. As per the MoU, feasibility studies for each of the projects have been ongoing and the parties affirm that both Prosperity Green and Prosperity Blue have positive potential prospects. The UAE, Jordan, and Israel will continue engaging to develop the necessary implementation plans in time for COP28, which is to be held in the UAE next November. Project Prosperity was proposed to help address some of the challenges posed by climate change on water and energy security in the Middle East, and to promote renewable energy, sustainable water supply, and stability in the region. \</doc>

Coca-Cola company, one of the sponsors of the COP27 summit, has been named the worst plastic polluter for five years running, as per a global brand audit report by 'Break Free From Plastic'. PepsiCo and Nestl took up the other two spots in the top 3 list of international plastic polluters, both for 2022 and for the past five years. In India, besides PepsiCo, Wai Wai noodles-maker CG Foods India Pvt Ltd and Perfetti Van Melle, the food company behind Mentos, Alpenliebe and the Chupa Chups lollipops, were among the top plastic polluters in 2022. Break Free From Plastic, a coalition of around 11,000 global organisations, said that it analysed the trash-collection data for the past five years with the help of over 2 lakh volunteers in 87 places to compile the 2022 Brand Audit report. It defined the top polluters as "corporations that pollute the most places around the world with the greatest amount of plastic waste." The primary criteria is the width of pollution, i.e. the number of countries where the product is found, while the secondary one is the depth, i.e. the number of branded items found. Predictably, plastic packaging was most commonly found in food products, followed byhousehold products, smoking and packaging material. Globally, the Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, Nestl, Unilever, Mondelez International (which makes popular snacks like 5 Star, Bournvita, Cadbury, Diary Milk, and Oreos), Mars Inc., Procter & Gamble, tobacco company Philip Morris International, French food company Danone, and Italian chocolate makers Ferrero Group were featured in the top 10 companies that are responsible for plastic pollution. The most common types of plastics deemed as pollutants were those used to make containers for food, bottles for shampoos and other personal hygiene products, and pipings. As per the report, Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), High-density polyethylene (HDPE) and Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) were the most common plastic types found in the last five years in India. The raw material for most types of plastics, including PET and HDPE, is derived from fossil fuels like crude oil and natural gas. One of the key talking points at the COP27 summit, being held in Egypt this year, is solutions to cut down dependence on fossil fuels. COP27 and Coca-Cola When COP27 announced its decision to partner with Coca-Cola in September 2022, several activists slammed the move, pointing out the American beverage company's record as a top plastic polluter. Greenpeace USA Oceans Campaign Director John Hocevar termed the choice as "baffling." "Coca-Cola produces 120 billion throwaway plastic bottles a year - and 99% of plastics are made from fossil fuels, worsening both the plastic and climate crisis. They have yet to even acknowledge that this is a problem or explain how they will meet their climate goals without ending their plastic addiction. This partnership undermines the very objective of the event it seeks to sponsor," Hocevar said in a statement. Super fun to have a climate summit in a police state sponsored by @CocaCola while most "civil society" delegates save their indignation for jacked up hotel prices instead of locked up political prisoners. # COP27 in #Egypt is shaping up to be very cool and normal. #SaveAlaa HYPERLINK https://t.co/28NEuyYxVD https://t.co/28NEuyYxVD - Naomi Klein "# COP27 Egypt Unsilenced" (@NaomiAKlein) October 1, 2022 Coca-Cola told that it "shares the goal of eliminating waste from the ocean". "Our support for Cop27 is in line with our science-based target to reduce absolute carbon emissions 25% by 2030, and our ambition for net zero carbon emissions by 2050," it told The Guardian. However, Von Hernandez, Global Coordinator of Break Free From Plastic criticised governments worldwide for not holding corporations accountable for the pollution they are causing. "Instead of allowing companies like Coke to greenwash their image, governments need to compel polluters to invest in reuse and alternative product delivery systems that avoid the problem in the first place. This is one of the key systemic changes required for the world to avert the full consequences of climate change and plastic pollution," Hernandez said. Through its report, the Break Free From Plastic group has asked polluting corporations to reveal and reduce their global plastic footprint, and redesign product packaging to minimise dependence on plastics. They have also called on world leaders to push for a legally binding Global Plastics Treaty, keeping in mind the ineffectiveness of voluntary commitments made by corporations. \</doc>

The Jordanian and Emirati governments signed today, Wednesday, a memorandum of understanding for cooperation in the field of renewable energy, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2022 ( COP27 ) held in Sharm El-Sheikh. Egyptian. The memorandum was signed by the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Dr. Saleh Kharabsheh, the Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology of the United Arab Emirates, the UAE's Special Envoy for Climate Change and Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar), Dr. Sultan Al Jaber. Key Highlights:  Minister Kharabsheh affirmed the Ministry of Energy's endeavor to increase this share to 50% by 2030, and for Jordan to become a regional center for green energy production by taking advantage of the abundance of renewable energy sources and Jordan's central location in the Middle East and Africa region.  Sustainable and achieve the desired reduction in the updated version of the Nationally Determined Contributions document, which has been amended to reach the goal of reducing 31% of greenhouse gas emissions. Amman, Nov. 16 -- Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources issued the following news release: - Kharabsheh: We are working to reach 50% electricity from renewable energy by 2030. United Nations Climate Change Conference 2022 ( COP27 ) held in Sharm El-Sheikh. Egyptian. The memorandum was signed by the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Dr. Saleh Kharabsheh, the Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology of the United Arab Emirates, the UAE's Special Envoy for Climate Change and Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar), Dr. Sultan Al Jaber. Regarding the details of the memorandum of understanding between Minister Kharabsheh, it stipulates cooperation between the two sides in the areas of research in the possibility of investment and development of wind energy projects with a production capacity equivalent to (2) gigawatts of economic feasibility, exchange of experiences and transfer of technology in the field of green energy, and cooperation in setting up qualification and training programs for experts and engineers. Young Jordanians on green energy projects, in addition to communicating with local and international universities in both countries to obtain specialized scholarships in this sector. Minister Kharabsheh presented the achievements made by Jordan in the field of renewable energy, and said that Jordan is one of the leading countries in the field of renewable energy development in the region, as about 29% of the electricity generated in the country is currently produced from renewable energy sources, and the total installed capacity of generation projects has reached Electric energy from renewable energy sources, at the end of last July, amounted to about 2,526 megawatts, which contributed 29% of the generated electric energy, compared to about 26% in 2021. He added that the energy generated from the total installed capacity of renewable energy projects amounted to about 5.5 TWh at the end of 2021. Thus, Jordan ranks first in the Arab world in terms of the installed capacity of renewable energy sources, without counting hydropower, and the third, after Egypt and Morocco, in the amount of energy produced. Minister Kharabsheh affirmed the Ministry of Energy's endeavor to increase this share to 50% by 2030, and for Jordan to become a regional center for green energy production by taking advantage of the abundance of renewable energy sources and Jordan's central location in the Middle East and Africa region. With regard to the partnership with the United Arab Emirates, Kharabsheh said, "We in Jordan have always believed in the importance of participatory work, whether at the regional or international level, and we believe that the partnership with our brothers in the United Arab Emirates and Masdar Company within this memorandum is in the Jordanian efforts towards access to energy." Sustainable and achieve the desired reduction in the updated version of the Nationally Determined Contributions document, which has been amended to reach the goal of reducing 31% of greenhouse gas emissions. For his part, Minister Al-Jaber said: "This new agreement is a testament to the close brotherly relationship between the United Arab Emirates and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, as well as our joint commitment to sustainability and the reduction of carbon emissions," as the projects that will be studied through this agreement will support Jordan's ambitious goals for renewable energy and will help He added that while the UAE looks forward to hosting COP28 next year, Masdar is working hard to support neighboring countries in the Middle East in their energy transitions. In turn, the CEO of "Masdar" Mohammed Jamil Al-Ramahi said, " The signing of the memorandum was attended by Dr. Muawiya Radaydah, Jordanian Minister of Environment and Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al-Zeyoudi, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Trade.

India, Nov. 21 -- T he Conference of Parties ( COP ) 27 , (or the climate change negotiations)in Egypt last fortnight, was grim. The G77 and China, representing 5 billion of the world's population, fought tooth and nail for a Loss and Damage (L&D) Fund, refusing to come under pressure by the developed world countries. We celebrated the Fund early morning Sunday as a step towards closing the inter-generational injustice gap. The youth celebrated mostly in absentia. If they put obstacles in the path for the Fund, the developed world cleared their own road for spewing greenhouse gases. Their key strategy was to avoid a treaty that stopped subsidies to and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Science tells these must be phased out, if we are to survive. For this reason, the developed world-historic emitters and gas guzzlers must shift drastically to greener energy, while reducing their own energy footprint. Not doing this means the developed world will continue harming successive generations, the indigenous and the poor everywhere and people of the Global South. This will cause growing inequity, income gaps and social unrest. Is this acceptable? Even a middle class urban Indian is hit by heat waves, intense rain and floods. The poor are devastated by every drought and cyclone. How much is our collective future in the Global South relevant to the developed world will be indicated by the money that comes into the L&D as well as other funds. But one thing is clear, this battle is far from over. The agenda for COP28 is already clear. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

India, Nov. 16 -- India and Australia will co-lead ministerial consultations on key outstanding issues for climate finance over the next three days at UN climate conference, COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, according to members of the Indian delegation. Climate finance is one of the main issues of contention at COP27 , cutting across finance for mitigation, adaptation and loss and damage. India is also among the countries that have highlighted the gap in delivery of climate finance from developed nations. It has also sought a multilaterally agreed definition of climate finance. In an interview to HT on November 4, Union minister for environment, forest & climate change, Bhupender Yadav said India expects a multilaterally agreed definition of climate finance at COP27 as the country doesn't recognise loans to be climate finance as they push poor and developing countries further into debt. The new collective quantified goal for the post-2025 period needs to be ambitious and concessional, India said intervening in a high level ministerial dialogue on climate finance at COP 27 on Monday. "We need a mobilisation target at grant/concessional terms. We require an ambitious flow of financial resources from various sources- public and private with the developed countries playing a pivotal role in incentivising flows to the developing countries so that finance-the key means of implementation- is at grant/concessional rates. The Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and the needs determination reports could be a good basis to estimate the requirement," Yadav said in his statement at the ministerial on climate finance on Monday. The issue of climate finance is critical at COP27 because the unfulfilled commitment of delivering 100 billion USD per year 2020 onwards by developed nations has eroded the trust of developing countries. There are several estimates of climate finance. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates the flows to be USD 83.3 billion in 2020 and USD 79.9 billion in 2018, while Oxfam estimates the mobilised amount to be USD 19-22.5 billion per year in 2017-18. Other estimates from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, are USD 45.4 billion in 2017 and USD 51.8 billion in 2018, according to the statement by India. At an informal stocktaking plenary on Monday, the Egyptian presidency called on parties to shift gears and complement the technical discussions with more political engagement. The COP president expected the majority of the work to be concluded by Wednesday, hoping that only a few issues will remain to be resolved by ministers. Meanwhile, discussions on finance matters remain deadlocked, including that on loss and damage funding, according to a bulletin by the Third World Network, an advocacy organisation on North South affairs which is an observer of the negotiations. At the climate finance dialogue, Oxfam, which has been tracking progress mobilising USD 100 billion per year, said that developed countries have failed to deliver much needed climate finance to developing countries, and communities. "We know money is not a problem. We have seen how rich nations have mobilised over USD 15 trillion to respond to the COVID pandemic. That is 150 times the USD 100bn goal. Developed countries are saying they have reached USD 83.3 billion in 2020, of which 68.3 billion has been public finance. However, it's not all as it seems. Oxfam estimates the real value, that is climate specific net assistance, to be between USD 21 to 24.5 billion. This is a third of what developed countries are reporting. To make matters worse, 70% of the public finance we estimate to be in the form of loans, pushing developing countries further into debt" TWN quoted the Oxfam representative. The mitigation work text will be co-led by South Africa and Denmark; adaptation by Maldives and Spain; climate finance by India and Australia; Loss and Damage by Chile and Germany and carbon markets by Singapore and Norway.

New Delhi, Oct. 27 -- As the world turns its focus to another COP - Conference of Parties, the 27th so far - to be held in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt, between November 6 and 18, two trends are rearing their heads, both in contestation with each other. In short, the desire to make COP27 an implementation session (to follow up on Glasgow's COP26 commitments) is likely to see geopolitics throttle the world's climate ambitions once more. The website of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) states: "At COP27 , countries come together to take action towards achieving the world's collective climate goals as agreed under the Paris Agreement and the Convention. Building on the outcome and momentum of COP26 in Glasgow last year, nations are expected to demonstrate at COP 27 that they are in a new era of implementation by turning their commitments under the Paris Agreement into action." You might also like India's antitrust watchdog barks but fails to bite off Prices may keep rising but inflation will fall Why investors must not rest on ICICI Bank's Q2 laurels For banks, the icing on the cake is about to melt China's tacit support for Russian aggression in Ukraine and Crimea has intensified the power struggle and now threatens to divide the world into two blocs. This geopolitical development, still trying to find a cogent shape and working its way through allies and multilateral institutions, is likely to cast its foreboding shadow over COP27 . Both the US and China are the world's largest greenhouse gas emitters and the likelihood of continued shadow-boxing between these two at COP27 bodes ill for the world's desperate attempts to limit global warming and climate change. There is another actor at play here: Europe, which is likely to dial down its rhetoric at COP27 this time. The Russia-Ukraine skirmish has affected energy supplies to Europe, with its attendant impact on prices, and this has forced the European Union and its member states to increase their investments in various fossil fuel platforms. The need to make affordable winter heating available to almost all households has also forced the European Union's hands in resurrecting some energy subsidies. This turn of events is likely to deprive the European nations of their customary high moral ground and their usual political bombast against developing nations, in which they routinely demanded greater sacrifices from poor economies while denying reparations for their overwhelming past contributions to global warming. As a matter of fact, the Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) - a grouping of 24 nations representing 50% of the world's population, of which India and COP27 host country Egypt are also members - recently released a ministerial statement, which provides the second dimension to the upcoming COP27 . COP27 with an implementation/achievement cache: "Consistent with the theme of 'Implementation', for developing countries, the provision of the means of implementation, including finance, technology transfer and capacity building from developed to developing countries, are fundamental for our climate actions, as we also strive to eradicate poverty and enable sustainable development in our countries. This is the basis for enhanced equity-based international cooperation on climate change envisioned under the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement." The statement then goes on to remind the rich nations of their commitment in 2009, in Copenhagen, to provide $100 billion of funding to developing nations every year till 2020, following which many other nations joined the Paris Agreement; but, unfortunately, the funding commitment of $100 billion has remained on paper. The LMDC statement then goes in for the kill: "&#65279;&#65279;&#65279;&#65279;In discussions on the new collective quantified goal on finance (NCQG), where a new climate finance goal is to be agreed upon by 2025, developed countries are delaying talking about the quantum of the finance to be provided. despite the existence of reports about the needs of developing countries for their climate actions. &#65279;&#65279;&#65279;&#65279;Instead, what we are witnessing are efforts by developed countries to dilute their responsibilities under the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement, as they seek to shift their existing obligations to the private sector and developing countries." The battle-lines - between super-powers on the one hand, and, between the rich and the poor nations on the other - have been drawn and the framework for futile debates seems tragically reminiscent of the past COPs. In the meanwhile, as state representatives indulge in oblique, endless conversations at official climate action conferences, unseasonal floods in Pakistan, Venezuela, Cuba, Nigeria or Chad have already displaced millions from their homes, with disease and hunger preying on these defenceless lives.

India, Nov. 18 -- This is a clear attempt to create divisions and to make the poor fight the poor, according to Sunita Narain, director-general of CSE Clear battle lines have emerged between wealthy historical polluter countries and developing ones on the last day of the 27th Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. The friction happened while discussing the three options:  A new fund  New and enhanced funding arrangements that will eventually also establish a fund On the penultimate day on November 17, the speaker for Barbados, on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), had lamented at a Heads of Delegation meeting that no time had been allocated for formal negotiations on loss and damage, and no joint contact groups had been formed. The COP27 On November 18, Minister Maisa Rojas of Chile and State Secretary Jennifer Morgan of Germany, tasked with facilitating discussions on loss and damage finance, asked Parties to state their preference for one of the options outlined in the text, for what must be established at COP27 . A fund, as part of new and enhanced funding arrangements for assisting developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in responding to loss and damage, complementing these arrangements with financial support from other sources, funds, processes and initiatives, including outside the Convention and the Paris Agreement. Many groups such as ABU (Argentina, Brazil, Urguguay) asked for the deletion of the second part, where sources outside of the Convention are mentioned. Pakistan's Climate Minister Sherry Rahman, speaking on behalf of G77 and China, said the bloc sees Option 1 as the only viable option. "This does not mean that we will adopt the text as is," she added. "A transitional committee must be established now to decide how the fund will be operationalised, and it should be established under the Financial Mechanism of the UNFCCC and PA. Options 2 and 3 off table for us," she said. "If this text had reflected the position of the vast majority of the world's population, then that would have been a good starting point. We support Option 1, and want the establishment of a loss and damage fund at this COP to be an operating entity of the Financial Mechanism of the Convention, and of course the Paris Agreement," Bangladesh said, speaking on behalf of the least developed countries. Developed countries overwhelmingly supported Option 3 which calls for "new and enhanced funding arrangements to assist developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in responding to loss and damage, with a view to complementing these with financial support from other sources, funds, processes and initiatives, including outside the Convention and the Paris Agreement". Mapping of support for Loss and Damage outcome at COP 27 Option 1 Option 3 Other Parties supporting G77 and China, LDC, AOSIS, AILAC, African Group, ABU, Arab Group, LMDC, Maldives, Philippines, Jamaica, Palau, Ecuador, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Vanuatu European Union, USA, Australia, EIG, Japan, United Kingdom Tuvalu - aligned with AOSIS, supports EU proposal Source: CSE from COP 27 A few caveats ran like a common thread throughout the speeches made by developed countries. The first is a focus on the "most vulnerable" countries - a position at odds with developing country blocs who have stated that a new fund must be open to "all developing countries". The second is the expansion of financial support from "all Parties in a position to do so", and the private sector as well. And the third is a focus on "ambitious mitigation" needed to achieve the 1.5degC target. "We have seen this for decades in climate change negotiations, and this makes sure that we do not get any outcome that will work for the poorest and most powerless in the world," she added. "What we want is a political commitment to establish a fund at COP27 . We can work out the other nitty-gritties at a later stage - where this fund will be established and who the donor base will be," a negotiator for small island nations told DTE on the condition of anonymity. At the November 18 negotiations, Tuvalu, which is not a member of the G77, differed on its stance from the other island nations, offering support to a proposal made by the European Union on Friday. The proposal states that the EU may agree to establish a "Loss and Damage Response Fund for the Most Vulnerable Countries" under Article 8 of the Paris Agreement. It "needs to draw from a broad base of contributors, since this is a global effort", according to their intervention on November 18. Stating that "all in a position to do so, should contribute to the fund ", the EU is referring to the fund inviting payments from countries like China, today's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. The proposal also links establishment of the fund to stronger mitigation commitments from all - strengthened NDCs, phasedown of unabated coal power, and reduction of methane emissions. At the negotiation, India stated that the discussions should avoid the creation of new categories for countries, and the assignment of enhanced responsibilities to the developing world. "We have to define the issue of the most vulnerable countries based on the question of who is responsible for the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere. Vulnerability is universal, but the differentiation is based on the contribution and responsibility, and in other words the liability. This is the principle that needs to be asserted. This is a clear attempt to create divisions and to make sure the negotiations go nowhere," Narain told DTE .

Ahead of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and the UN Climate Champions hosted the African Roundtable on Initiatives to Accelerate Climate Action and Advance the SDGs and Coordination Meeting of the African Group of Climate Change Negotiators and National UNFCCC Focal Persons from 2-4 August, 2022. The events brought together key stakeholders from both public and private sectors, to showcase both the success stories of private sector investments in climate areas as well as investment-ready climate initiatives in Member States towards ensuring enhanced actualizing enhanced climate action at scale and speed to strengthen African economies and build resilience. The Roundtable provided a platform to deliberate on catalytic mechanisms to mobilize climate finance investments and crowd in the private sector towards building climate resilience as well as advancing Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda. The event consisted of six roundtable sessions covering issues of energy access, food security, digital transformations, carbon credit markets, the blue economy and water and cities. Each session focused on channels and means to scale up financing around concrete initiatives, investment opportunities, and policy measures in climate action areas. The African Group of Negotiators (AGN) also gathered to lead negotiators and UNFCCC focal persons from across the continent to deliberate on the key outstanding climate change negotiations issues and discuss the latest information on the road to COP 27 . Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Amina J. Mohammed spoke to the importance of private sector investment: the private sector will play a key role in determining whether we succeed or fail, the Economic Commission for Africa estimates that investment in Africas green sectors brings a return as high as 420% in value addition and as high 250% in job creation. Dr. Mahmoud Mohieldin, UN Climate Champion and the UNSG special envoy for financing the 2030 Agenda emphasised the importance of focussing on implementation and on delivering finance directly to projects that deliver climate resilience and improve the lives of populations. The ECA is also supporting Member Countries of the Congo Basin Climate Commission to develop a high integrity carbon market in the region which could significantly contribute toward closing the financing gap for climate resilience and SDG implementation. Arlette Soudan Nonault, Minister of the Environment, Sustainable Development and the Congo Basin of the Republic of Congo stated this initiative could contribute significantly to the regulation of the global climate whilst mobilizing the revenue Africa needs to adapt to climate change. With a price of at least $50 per tonne, there is a potential to generate approximately $15 billion per annum for African countries. The ECA has also supported a study which showed the cost of battery precursor production close to the source of battery mineral extraction in the Democratic Republic of Congo would 15-20% cheaper than other destination and would contribute 30% less emissions than if manufactured in Asia. Reiterating earlier calls from Vera Songwe and Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs and COP27 President Designate, Sameh Shoukry Ephraim Shitima, the Chair of the African Group of Negotiators, called for COP27 to be focused on implementation, for financial pledges to be delivered on and concrete commitments from developed nations. The African Group will not only call for the delivery of the $100 billion goal that should've been made by 2020, but for an increase of at least $150 billion per year until 2025. The African Roundtable showed the importance of continued collaboration between public and private sectors as well as other concerned stakeholders. And in the discussion, calls were made for a just energy transition that prioritizes accessible, affordable and socially responsible climate financing is imperative. Also, a case was made for Africa to leverage the opportunity of a carbon credit market and other innovative financing mechanisms such as debt-for-climate swaps and KPI-linked bonds which can be used to reduce the cost of capital, provide longer and more secure loans and demonstrate more policy stability which in turn attracts new investors. Consensus was found to push for developing countries to make good on their climate commitments and request transparency and specific timelines on when these commitments will be delivered. The input from the Roundtables will be used to consolidate Africa's common position for COP27 . \</doc>

India, Nov. 18 -- Forty per cent of adaptation fund pledged in Glasgow not yet met The amount pledged for climate adaptation at the 27th Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is 35 per cent less than what was pledged in Glasgow last year, according to the United Nations Adaptation Fund. An amount of $230 million was pledged during COP27 , which is substantially lower than the $356 million pledged at Glasgow last year, the Fund has said. The Adaptation Fund is an international fund that finances projects aimed at helping developing countries to adapt to the harmful effects of climate change. It has been set up under the Kyoto Protocol of UNFCCC. The cut has happened despite a UN call in the Glasgow Climate Pact to developed countries for increasing adaptation finance substantially. The fund crunch is likely to hit developing and vulnerable countries as climate-change inflicted damages are likely to magnify in the absence of adequate adaptation safeguards. So far, the Fund has approved 140 projects globally, of which seven are in India and spread across the country. A senior official from the Fund also admitted to this reporter that "so far only 60 per cent of the pledged amount in Glasgow" has been actually realised. That puts in the shade the role of developed countries in countering global climate impact. Glasgow vs Sharm El-Sheikh The comparatively reduced pledge in Sharm El-Sheikh is despite the Glasgow Climate Pact urging "developed country parties to urgently and significantly scale up their provision of climate finance, . for adaptation so as to respond to the needs of developing country parties .". The latest draft negotiation text accessed by this reporter at COP27 also noted "with serious concern the existing adaption gap between current levels of adaptation and levels needed to respond to impacts and reduce climate risks in line with findings from the contribution of Working Group II to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report". The text in Sharm El-Sheikh - released at 12.30 pm Indian time - recognises "the centrality of the role of the adaptation fund in the climate finance architecture" and urged "all contributors to fulfil their pledges in a timely manner". But clearly nobody is listening. Apart from the US, Germany, Spain, Sweden and Japan paid more than $10 million while various other countries made smaller contributions. While Germany remains the main provider, funds have also started to flow from new countries like Austria, Japan, Iceland and the Republic of Korea. John Kerry, US special presidential envoy for climate, observed that the Adaptation Fund "is already proving itself to be remarkably effective," and promised $100 million in line to President Joe Biden's earlier comment about doubling the Adaptation Fund support. "We have so far received about 60 per cent of the money pledged during the Glasgow COP; few major country pledges are stated to be stuck in respective internal clearances," Mikko Ollikainen, head of the Adaptation Fund, told this reporter in an exclusive interview. "We have so far allocated about $1 billion of around $1.3 billion for around 140 concrete adaptation projects in about 100 developing countries including India covering 38 million beneficiaries. But definitely, we need much more support from all sources to expand the Fund's reach, as adaptation is a key instrument in countering climate change in developing countries," Ollikainen added. The official however claimed that the board still has enough money to approve projects but indicated that more money is required from all sources. "While we say all sources, we mean literally all sources including public and private sources; private sources are important as only public sources will clearly not be adequate," the official clarified. However private sources, so far, have remained symbolic with only $11,000 being promised in COP 27 .

Singapore has accepted the United States invitation to join the Collective 2030 Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Deployment Goal (Goal) on 18 November 2022, at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ). 3. Singapores participation in the Goal underscores our commitment to achieve a more sustainable land transport system, with vehicular electrification as one of our key thrusts. This comes on the back of strong momentum in electric vehicle (EV) adoption in recent months. ZEV registrations this year have so far accounted for over 10% of all new vehicle registrations, almost triple the rate in 2021. 4. Singapores Minister for Transport and Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations, Mr S Iswaran, said, Climate action is a global responsibility. The Collective 2030 Zero-Emission Vehicle Deployment Goal represents a shared aspiration among like-minded countries in transiting to a greener land transport sector. It is aligned with Singapores vision to electrify our vehicle population, and the steps we have and will take towards it. This includes ceasing the registration of new internal combustion engine cars and taxis from 2030, and phasing out internal combustion engine vehicles from our vehicle population by 2040. Singapore looks forward to working with the international community to build a low-carbon future. \</doc>

With a little more than 24 hours to go for the official closing of the COP27 climate summit, a large number of critical issues such as funding arrangements for loss and damage and collaborative efforts to increase emissions reduction in the period up to 2030 remain unresolved. Egypt has yet to provide a draft text for the cover decision. The 20-page second iteration of the "elements" of the cover decision that Egypt put out early morning on Thursday had key asks of countries missing from the list.Still missing is India's call for a phase down of all fossil fuels. This omission comes despite growing support from other countries and the civil society for the inclusion of a clear call for the phase down of fossil fuels.Issues raised by several other countries, such as the language around limiting global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius were also missing from this "elements non-paper". There were also some items such as the call "developed countries should attain net-negative carbon emissions by 2030" that appeared to have been included but had not been articulated in the consultation.The issue was raised with the Egyptian presidency by several countries. Ministers met with Egypt's foreign minister and COP 27 president Sameh Shoukry to express their concerns about the many gaps in the text. Among those who met with the COP27 president were COP 26 President Alok Sharma of the UK, European Commission executive vice president Frans Timmermans and Canada's environment minister Steven Guilbeault. "This morning I had a discussion with president Shoukry and he assured me that this text is a compilation of submissions they have received and not a presidency landing zone," said Timmermans.Egypt held consultations with countries that ran into late evening. Speaking at the meeting, India pointed out that key messages on ambition and mitigation were "missing". It did not explicitly mention the fossil fuel phase down.Sources confirmed that the fossil fuel phase down continues to be on India's list of asks. India's call has garnered some support from countries including the UK, US, France, Denmark, Tuvalu, Colombia, Norway, and the European Union. Given the range of support, it is likely that there will be consultations and negotiations on the exact language being used. For instance, US special presidential envoy for climate change John Kerry said the US would support a "phase down of unabated oil and gas", while Timmermans said "the only thing we want to avoid is that we put all fossil fuels in one batch". "I hope that the presidency will present us with a text soon that can provide us with the basis for negotiations," said Timmermans. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com \</doc>

According to a global brand audit assessment by "Break Free From Plastic," the Coca-Cola business, one of the sponsors of the COP27 meeting, has been identified as the worst plastic polluter for five years in a row. Both for 2022 and the previous five years, PepsiCo and Nestl occupied the other two positions on the top 3 list of international plastic pollutants. In India, besides PepsiCo, Wai Wai noodles-maker CG Foods India Pvt Ltd and Perfetti Van Melle, the food company behind Mentos, Alpenliebe and the Chupa Chups lollipops, were among the top plastic polluters in 2022. In 2019, SS Food Products (which makes cooking products like baking powder and ready-to-eat soups) was named the top plastic polluter while Perfetti Van Melle took that spot in 2018. Break Free From Plastic, a coalition of around 11,000 global organisations, said that it analysed the trash-collection data for the past five years with the help of over 2 lakh volunteers in 87 places to compile the 2022 Brand Audit report. It defined the top polluters as "corporations that pollute the most places around the world with the greatest amount of plastic waste." The primary criterion is the width of pollution, i.e. the number of countries where the product is found, while the secondary one is the depth, i.e. the number of branded items found. Predictably, plastic packaging was most commonly found in food products, followed by household products, smoking and packaging material. Globally, the Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, Nestl, Unilever, Mondelez International (which makes popular snacks like 5 Star, Bournvita, Cadbury, Diary Milk, and Oreos), Mars Inc., Procter & Gamble, tobacco company Philip Morris International, French food company Danone, and Italian chocolate makers Ferrero Group were featured in the top 10 companies that are responsible for plastic pollution. The most common types of plastics deemed as pollutants were those used to make containers for food, bottles for shampoos and other personal hygiene products, and pipings. As per the report, Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), High-density polyethylene (HDPE) and Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) were the most common plastic types found in the last five years in India. The raw material for most types of plastics, including PET and HDPE, is derived from fossil fuels like crude oil and natural gas. One of the key talking points at the COP27 summit, being held in Egypt this year, is solutions to cut down dependence on fossil fuels. COP27 and Coca-Cola When COP27 announced its decision to partner with Coca-Cola in September 2022, several activists slammed the move, pointing out the American beverage company's record as a top plastic polluter. Greenpeace USA Oceans Campaign Director John Hocevar termed the choice as "baffling." "Coca-Cola produces 120 billion throwaway plastic bottles a year - and 99% of plastics are made from fossil fuels, worsening both the plastic and climate crisis. They have yet to even acknowledge that this is a problem or explain how they will meet their climate goals without ending their plastic addiction. This partnership undermines the very objective of the event it seeks to sponsor," Hocevar said in a statement. Coca-Cola told that it "shares the goal of eliminating waste from the ocean". "Our support for Cop27 is in line with our science-based target to reduce absolute carbon emissions 25% by 2030, and our ambition for net zero carbon emissions by 2050," it told The Guardian. However, Von Hernandez, Global Coordinator of Break Free From Plastic criticised governments worldwide for not holding corporations accountable for the pollution they are causing. "Instead of allowing companies like Coke to greenwash their image, governments need to compel polluters to invest in reuse and alternative product delivery systems that avoid the problem in the first place." "This is one of the key systemic changes required for the world to avert the full consequences of climate change and plastic pollution," Hernandez said. Through its report, the Break Free From Plastic group has asked polluting corporations to reveal and reduce their global plastic footprint, and redesign product packaging to minimise dependence on plastics. They have also called on world leaders to push for a legally binding Global Plastics Treaty, keeping in mind the ineffectiveness of voluntary commitments made by corporations. \</doc>

With the 27th session of the Conference of Parties (COP) opening at Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt over the weekend, the delegation from the New Delhi-based The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) to the session underscored the need for the global climate negotiations to adopt a people-centric approach, and make headway on long-standing issues of climate finance and loss and damage. The delegation of 19 people will be headed by Dr Vibha Dhawan, Director General, TERI. "Considering the particularly fraught world in which COP 27 is set to unfold, and the continuing and devastating impacts of extreme weather events felt across the globe, it is imperative that the session at Sharm el-Sheikh engages with and tries to resolve issues related to long-term climate finance and the mechanisms for loss and damage," said Dr Dhawan. Key Highlights:  Mr Rashmi noted that the figure of 100 billion USD for developing countries was agreed upon much before the Paris Agreement was signed.  Based on the Nationally determined contributions (NDCs), there is a needs assessment report published by the UNFCCC which says the total cumulative financing requirements of the developing world is anything in the range of 5.8-5.9 trillion USD till 2030.  India voluntarily communicated to achieve additional sequestration of 2.5-3 billion tons of e Co2 through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.  On the basis of baseline year as 2005 and the analysis of Forest Survey of India, the country will overachieve its target by 1.25 billion tons of e Co2. Original Press Release: New Delhi, Nov. 3 -- The Energy and Resources Institute issued the following news release: With the 27th session of the Conference of Parties (COP) opening at Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt over the weekend, the delegation from the New Delhi-based The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) to the session underscored the need for the global climate negotiations to adopt a people-centric approach, and make headway on long-standing issues of climate finance and loss and damage. With the ongoing Russia-Ukraine situation and the energy crisis in Europe compounding the woes of world that has been wreaked by extreme weather events and its devastating impacts, particularly in the developing world, the delegates noted that COP27 should be resolving issues related to enhanced transparency framework, mobilization of long-term climate finance, adequacy of mitigation commitments by the Parties, the Global Goal on Adaptation, implementation of Article 6 (market-based mechanisms), the Warsaw international mechanism for loss and damage, and the implementation of gender-responsive climate actions. The delegation will be part of an array of events and be engaged with them in diverse capacities -- as organizer, co-organizer and panellist; and will discuss issues of decarbonization pathways, vulnerability and adaptation, technological change, climate governance, climate finance and enhanced transparency. The delegation of 19 people will be headed by Dr Vibha Dhawan, Director General, TERI. "Considering the particularly fraught world in which COP 27 is set to unfold, and the continuing and devastating impacts of extreme weather events felt across the globe, it is imperative that the session at Sharm el-Sheikh engages with and tries to resolve issues related to long-term climate finance and the mechanisms for loss and damage," said Dr Dhawan. Pointing out that any consensus on an enhanced scale of financial mobilization could be a welcome takeaway from COP27 , Mr RR Rashmi, Distinguished Fellow, TERI, and former climate negotiator under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), observed, "There has been a great degree of resistance and difference on this issue. A consensus on the need to scale up the level of financing mobilization will be a great achievement." Mr Rashmi noted that the figure of 100 billion USD for developing countries was agreed upon much before the Paris Agreement was signed. "Based on the Nationally determined contributions (NDCs), there is a needs assessment report published by the UNFCCC which says the total cumulative financing requirements of the developing world is anything in the range of 5.8-5.9 trillion USD till 2030. We should be able to agree on an enhanced scale of requirement." Ms Suruchi Bhadwal, Senior Fellow and Director, Earth Science and Climate Change Division, highlighted the crucial role Sharm el-Sheikh could play for the Global Goal on Adaptation. "The COP in Egypt is a reminder for providing a thrust to adaptation and discussion on its goals and contributions for the Global Stocktake." Drawing attention to the focus on nature and ecosystem-based solutions at COP27 , Dr JV Sharma, Senior Director, Land Resources Division, said, "India voluntarily communicated to achieve additional sequestration of 2.5-3 billion tons of e Co2 through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. On the basis of baseline year as 2005 and the analysis of Forest Survey of India, the country will overachieve its target by 1.25 billion tons of e Co2. India has the large potential to enhance income of farmers for their efforts made under agroforestry through carbon finance mechanism, and also uplifting the economic status of forest dependent communities through carbon finance mechanism under a conservation approach." Ahead of COP27 With the session envisioned to be an implementation COP, Dr Kedia added, "In terms of implementation, the global climate regime must benefit vulnerable people and not just vulnerable countries. Policy initiatives need to be supplemented by people-centric mass movements such as Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE) campaign of India." Dr Manish Shrivastava, Senior Fellow, Earth Science and Climate Change Division, said the upcoming COP in Egypt should set the record straight on Just Energy Transition Partnerships where G7 countries are offering financial partnerships with developing countries. "What does it mean for international governance of climate finance? It has to be set clear at COP as it has very important power implications," he said. Noting that Sharm el-Sheikh is a platform that will bring multiple stakeholders together, Mr Arupendra Nath Mullick, Fellow, Council for Business Sustainability, said, "It is important to create a case for an inclusive approach to engage both the supply and demand side, as well as the financial aspects for the transition of hard-to-abate sectors of cement, iron and steel. The time for action is now." The events TERI will be engaged with at COP27 are spread across the fortnight of the session.

Climate change: Focus on local actions Ahmedabad: As the Conference of Parties ( COP ) 27 or the United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNCCC) 2022 is underway in Egypt, city-based experts said the Heat Action Plan (HAP) of Ahmedabad and draft Chennai Climate Action Plan are examples of how local action can meet the challenges of climate change adaptation. The study by Prof Rajan Rawal, senior advisor and CRDF professor at CEPT University's CARBSE, was recently published in the Buildings & Cities journal. 'Ahmedabad and Chennai are examples of how local actions at the city level can help nations meet the challenges of climate change adaptation and mitigation. Keeping hope for 1.5C, these two cities demonstrate that by relying on science-based assessment and locally set targets alongside multi-lateral efforts, on the ground action is possible,' the study says. TNN > Consulting top choice at IIMA placements Ahmedabad: The third cluster of summer placement process for PGP concluded at IIM Ahmedabad (IIMA) on November 8, rounding off the process.

During the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), The Rockefeller Foundation announced more than US$11 million in grants to ten organizations scaling Indigenous and regenerative agriculture practices around the world. Evidence makes clear the central role food systems can play in mitigating climate change. The funding will help scale the development, data analysis, financing, and education around regenerative agricultural practices, which can improve global food systems and mitigate the global food crisis. Regenerative agriculture, a process with roots in Indigenous traditional ecological knowledge and food systems, takes a holistic approach to production that starts with the soil and includes the health of people, animals, and the environment. Together, these grants will establish the foundation to rapidly scale regenerative approaches by 2030 from Indigenous agroforestry in the Amazon to carbon-market financing of smallholder farmers in Africa and elsewhere. Regenerative agriculture offers a needed alternative to dominant, extractive food systems that have threatened people and planet alike, said Sara Farley, Vice President of The Rockefeller Foundations Global Food Portfolio. Our goal is to develop the know-how, networks and innovations needed to realize the full potential of regenerative agriculture at a moment of crises and climate change. Food systems produce about one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions, and agricultural expansion accounts for almost 90 percent of global deforestation. Conversely, new research finds that transitioning to more sustainable food systems could contribute about 20 percent of the global mitigation needed by 2050 to keep temperature increases below the 1.5C target. This change could also improve the nutrition and health of 3.1 billion people who currently cannot afford a healthy diet. Food systems impact every person on the planet and the planet itself, said Roy Steiner, Senior Vice President for the Food Initiative at the Foundation. Continuing to rely solely on conventional approaches cannot generate the profound shifts needed to improve food systems. The integration of traditional knowledge with other scientific and technological knowledge can transform food systems to be more resilient, nutritious, and equitable. The flagship grant is to the Meridian Institute, which will expand upon the work of Regen10, a global coalition galvanized to answer the question of what it would take to produce 50 percent of the worlds food in ways that benefit people, nature, and climate by 2030. This effort will directly support food producers and landscape stewards to adopt and scale regenerative practices and work collaboratively with other organizations to better define and measure the impacts of regenerative agriculture. By bridging outcomes measurement with landscape-level demonstrations, Regen10 will support landscape leaders practicing or advancing regenerative agriculture to access financing, technical assistance, and data. The Foundation is also providing funding and support to: Grants for Indigenous Peoples Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Food Systems Amazon Conservation Team to advance and monitor Indigenous agroforestry and regenerative agricultural practices in two landscapes in tropical South America using a community-led approach. The project will engage traditional elders, women, and youth in the Andean Amazon and Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (which is currently dominated by palm oil monocropping). The grant will support dialogue between the two communities as they connect biodiversity conservation, ecosystem management, and sustainable agriculture. Deep Medicine Circle to support its Farming as Medicine program by returning land to Indigenous People recognizing farmers as health stewards elevating evidence of the regenerative impacts of Indigenous food systems decommodifying food and removing fruits, herbs, and vegetables from the market economy and returning them to a system of care. The grant will support Indigenous land management on the 38-acre Te Kwe Anaa Warep (Honor Mother Earth) farm in rural Ramaytush territory (San Gregorio, California). Indigenous Partnership for Agrobiodiversity and Food Sovereignty to demonstrate how people and landscapes thrive through Indigenous Peoples Food Systems, working with Indigenous youths in Northeast India Northern Thailand Mau Forest, Kenya and Quintana Roo, Mexico. The organization will provide training, build capacity, and networks to support a cadre of skilled and passionate Indigenous Peoples Youths who will anchor future activities. The grant will also support a global Indigenous Regenerative Food Systems Summit in 2024. RSF Social Finance in support of the Pawanka Fund, which aims to deepen collaboration among community-oriented NGOs in Kenya, Brazil, Nigeria, Fiji, and Canada. The NGOs will work with their communities to operate Indigenous Food Systems Solution Lab and provide microgrants to implement the most promising Indigenous-led and locally developed regenerative agriculture solutions. Lessons will be shared across countries and contexts. Grants for Regenerative Data and Networks Dalberg Catalyst to make a package of climate-smart agricultural technologies available to smallholder farmers in Africa, and to understand the price of carbon needed for farmers to benefit. The package contains solar irrigation systems, biodigesters, and soil carbon measurement. The project aims to overcome market limitations around the uptake of climate-smart practices and demonstrate that smallholder farmers provide an important climate solution. Ecdysis Foundation to develop a Fellowship for Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color to train under-represented groups in regenerative agriculture and related science through the North American-based 1000 Farms Initiative. \</doc>

The Bill Melinda Gates Foundation echoed African leaders calls for countries to rapidly scale-up finance for climate adaptation and pledged to invest $1.4 billion to help smallholder farmers address the immediate and long-term impacts of climate change. The announcement was made by Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 ). For many regions, climate change is a food and economic crisis without precedent. More than 2 billion people depend on smallholder farms for food and income, yet less than 2% of global climate finance is devoted to helping these farms adapt to climate change. Food and economic crises will last longer and become more severe as climate threats escalate and further threaten food security by limiting smallholder farmers yields and resilience. The effects of climate change have already been devastating, and every moment the world delays action, more people suffer, and the solutions become more complex and costly, said Suzman. Our commitment will help smallholder farmers adapt and build resilience for the future. It is essential for this climate summit to produce bold commitments that address immediate and long-term needs. Leaders must listen to the voices of African farmers and governments to understand their priorities and respond with urgency. The foundations commitment will fund immediate action and long-term initiatives over four years to help smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia build resilience and food security. Funding will focus on spurring African-led innovation to build a pipeline of climate-smart agriculture projects, new applications of digital technologies, climate-smart innovations for smallholder livestock farming, and support for women smallholder farmers to capitalize on their untapped potential. Women in rural Africa are the backbone of their food systems, but they have never had equal access to the resources they need to reach their full potential or build resilience to looming climate threats, said Melinda French Gates, co-chair of the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation. As the climate crisis accelerates, womens vital role in their economies is too important to overlook. With the right financing and marketing support, women smallholder farmers could earn more in a day than they currently earn in a month, ultimately transforming these regional food systems and unlocking a healthier, more sustainable, and more prosperous future for families and communities across the continent. To improve the livelihoods of rural women in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the foundation is deepening its ongoing partnership with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The goal is to scale up initiatives that empower women farmers, support innovations at the nexus of gender and climate adaptation, and increase climate finance that gives rural women better access to the climate-smart resources they need to strengthen food systems. To accelerate the development of new adaptation innovations, the foundation is continuing to work with a coalition of partners to double the budget for the CGIAR agriculture research system. The CGIAR Excellence in Agronomy initiative partners with African research institutes, local businesses, and farmer organizations. Together, they are using big data, analytics, and digital platforms to deliver insights that can boost incomes, food security, and ecosystem health in smallholder farming communities. The climate crisis is causing enormous harm every day as it jeopardizes entire regions of people and economies, said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation. More funding is necessary to ensure agricultural and technological innovations are widely available to vulnerable communities, helping them to adapt to climate change, save lives and increase economic growth. Additional investments included in the commitment announced will support: The Africa Adaptation Initiative (AAI) to quickly build a pipeline of climate-smart agriculture projects across 23 countries in Africa. Funding will provide targeted support for the technical capacity, planning, and project development required to implement programs. The development of new applications of digital technologies to ensure smallholder farmers can anticipate and respond to climate threats. This includes an innovative weather intelligence platform developed through a new partnership between the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) and TomorrowNow, which provides climate-smart agriculture strategies to farmers in East Africa via text messages. African-led innovations to develop climate-smart options for improving livestock health and productivity while also reducing their climate footprint. This will be done in partnership with Canadas International Development Research Center (IDRC). This funding builds on more than a decade of investments and the foundations recent announcement during the United Nations General Assembly of $100 million in funding to help alleviate the current food crisis in Africa and South Asia and address its underlying causes. It also builds on funding commitments focused on agriculture adaptation made at previous climate summits: 2021 at COP26: Bill Melinda Gates Foundation Pledges $315 million to Support Innovations That Help Smallholder Farmers Adapt to Climate Threats 2017 at One Planet Summit: Bill Melinda Gates Foundation Commits $300M (255M) to Help Farmers in Africa and Asia Cope with Climate Change \</doc>

Allegations of the allegedly possible death of mankind by 2050 due to climate change are nothing more than horror stories in the media, humanity is not idle. This was stated by the head of the Russian delegation at the 27th UN Conference on Climate Change ( COP27 ), Advisor to the President of the Russian Federation Ruslan Edelgeriev. On Wednesday, the Western press published a publication that the World One supercomputer allegedly predicted the death of mankind by 2050 due to climate change. According to the head of the delegation, such messages are horror stories and intimidation. Of course, if we do not take action, nothing good awaits us, but not as dramatic as they say. We are not idle, we are working, Edelgeriev said in an interview with RIA Novosti . According to him, in particular, in Russia there are significant shifts in the authorities and their understanding of the problem of climate change. He also cited the example of China, one of the leaders in greenhouse gas emissions, at the same time, Beijing receives significant profits from new technologies, in particular, the production of solar panels. According to him, Russia is moving in the trajectory of Chinas actions in terms of climate. The matter of combating climate change is the task of the state, it cannot be shifted to citizens, the adviser said. COP27 opened in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on November 6th. The main topics of the summit so far have been the lack of implementation of the Paris Agreement and efforts to raise funds for the poorest countries most affected by climate change. \</doc>

The financial sector has profitable opportunities in financing climate change, says Jonathan Larsen, Chief Innovation Officer of Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd. ("Ping An" or the "Group", HKEx:2318; SSE:601318) is using financial innovation to support China's energy transition and combat climate change risk, said Richard Sheng, Secretary of the Board of Directors. "Climate is a common challenge faced by all mankind," said Mr. Sheng. "As estimated, in order to achieve carbon neutrality, China needs direct investment amounting to more than RMB100 trillion, presenting financial institutions with opportunities to undertake the mission of creating social value while improving revenues." Key Highlights:  As of September 30, 2022, Ping An's green investment and financing totaled approximately RMB319.8 billion.  As of the end of June 2022, Ping An Capital's carbon neutrality equity investment totaled RMB25.6 billion, including RMB13.2 billion related to clean energy.  After investing, Ping An Life holds a stake of 2.16% in the company.  According to Ping An's 2021 TCFD report, less than 2% of the estimated RMB7.92 trillion in Ping An's assets in investment and banking services were related to the eight major high-carbon emission, or "brown", sectors. Original Press Release: Hong Kong, Shanghai, Nov. 21 -- Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd issued the following news release: The financial sector has profitable opportunities in financing climate change, says Jonathan Larsen, Chief Innovation Officer of Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd. ("Ping An" or the "Group", HKEx:2318; SSE:601318) is using financial innovation to support China's energy transition and combat climate change risk, said Richard Sheng, Secretary of the Board of Directors. Mr. Sheng, speaking via videoconference, joined a seminar on green and sustainable finance at the China Pavilion of the 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ). Managing the risks related to climate change is an important part of the Group's long-term development strategy. In its second Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report in 2021, Ping An disclosed the bank's credit and investment portfolio and the corresponding risk exposure in eight high-carbon emission sectors: coal power, steel, cement, non-ferrous metal, paper making, aviation, petrochemical, and chemical. Ping An has made a visionary move to invest in green and low carbon assets and reduce the proportion of high-carbon emitting assets to mitigate the financial risks related to climate change. It is supporting China's goals of peaking carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. For China, as the second largest economy in the world and the largest importer and consumer of energy, energy security is critical, said Mr. Sheng. "A secure transition of energy is a trend with rather high certainty," he said. "Ping An is fully harnessing its advantage in long-term capital from insurance," said Mr. Sheng. "In coherence with the long cycle of green projects, it gives fresh impetus to low-carbon development while obtaining steady income." "Ping An has leveraged its strength of integrated finance and has also scaled up the investment in green industries in terms of investment mix," said Mr. Sheng. As of September 30, 2022, Ping An's green investment and financing totaled approximately RMB319.8 billion. As of the end of June 2022, Ping An Capital's carbon neutrality equity investment totaled RMB25.6 billion, including RMB13.2 billion related to clean energy. In November 2021, Ping An Capital served as investment consultant for Ping An Life's RMB2 billion investment in CGN Wind Power, which is developing clean energy projects such as wind and photovoltaic power. After investing, Ping An Life holds a stake of 2.16% in the company. Insurance is one of the major sectors of the financial industry confronting climate change risks, said Mr. Sheng. Ping An's pursuit of innovation in insurance products aims to make insurance an economic "shock absorber" and a social "stabilizer". For example, Ping An has combined Catastrophe Parametric Insurance and index insurance, which makes use of heavy rainfall and typhoon data as parameters for insurance payouts. Once the compensation conditions are met, the compensation amount can be determined without on-site inspection, which helps accelerate post-disaster reconstruction and resumption of business operations. In 2022, Ping An also piloted forest carbon sinks remote sensing index insurance in six provinces: Hebei, Guangxi, Hunan, Anhui, Guangdong and Guizhou. It provided carbon sink risks protection with RMB34.28 million for 340,000 mu (22,667 hectares) of forest land. According to Ping An's 2021 TCFD report, less than 2% of the estimated RMB7.92 trillion in Ping An's assets in investment and banking services were related to the eight major high-carbon emission, or "brown", sectors. While supporting the transition of traditional coal-powered and high-carbon emitting clients, Ping An has also helped to raise their awareness of emission control and consumption reduction, and offered technology to monitor emission data and better navigate the path of transition. Ping An will continue to enhance the accuracy and precision of climate risk assessment, while fulfilling its corporate social responsibility as a financial institution. The Company will also dynamically adjust the control of high-carbon industries and support for green industries according to relevant national policies and market conditions. It will promote quality industrial and social transformation through its professional financial products and services to empower sustainable development.

AIB yesterday raised (EURO)750 million from the issuance of its fourth green bond. The issuance came as world leaders were meeting in Egypt at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP 27 , to focus on the role that climate finance can play in helping cut greenhouse gases, boost climate resilience and restore nature. In the case of Ireland, the International Monetary Fund estimates the cost will amount to c. (EURO)20 billion per annum over the next decade, much of which will come from the private sector. Key Highlights:  Recognising the importance of climate finance in funding the transition, AIB has over the last two years raised a combined (EURO)3.25 billion from the issuance of green bonds after becoming the first Irish bank to issue a green bond in 2020.  In May this year, AIB raised (EURO)1 billion through the issuance of a social bond, the first social bond issued by an Irish bank.  Its ambition is that 70% of new lending will be green or transition by 2030.  Investor interest in the bond peaked at just shy of (EURO)1.5bn, allowing the bank to issue the bond at a level of MidSwaps +2.85%, equating to a coupon of 5.75%.  The final order book was (EURO)1.4bn, comprising 94 investors, spread across 22 countries globally. Original Press Release: Nov. 10 -- AIBissued the following news release: - Proceeds will fund the financing of projects with clear environmental benefits supporting customers to make the required transition to a low carbon future - Issuance comes as world leaders meet at COP 27 to highlight the role of climate finance in funding the transition - Brings to (EURO)4.25 billion AIB has raised from issuing environmental and social bonds to date AIB yesterday raised (EURO)750 million from the issuance of its fourth green bond. The proceeds will contribute to the financing of projects with clear environmental and climate action benefits while further strengthening AIB's capital position. The issuance came as world leaders were meeting in Egypt at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP 27 , to focus on the role that climate finance can play in helping cut greenhouse gases, boost climate resilience and restore nature. The investment required to finance the transition to a low carbon economy can be counted in the trillions of dollars globally. In the case of Ireland, the International Monetary Fund estimates the cost will amount to c. (EURO)20 billion per annum over the next decade, much of which will come from the private sector. Recognising the importance of climate finance in funding the transition, AIB has over the last two years raised a combined (EURO)3.25 billion from the issuance of green bonds after becoming the first Irish bank to issue a green bond in 2020. Also in May this year, AIB raised (EURO)1 billion through the issuance of a social bond, the first social bond issued by an Irish bank. AIB Chief Executive Colin Hunt said "As Ireland's largest financial services provider with 2.8 million customers, AIB is already actively supporting the transition to a low-carbon future by reducing our own carbon footprint and helping our customers to do the same. We aim to play a significant role in helping the Government and the European Union meet their carbon reduction targets. Our ambition is that 70% of new lending will be green or transition by 2030. And we are making great progress towards achieving that goal as green lending already increased to 24% of new lending in the first nine months of the year. The more green lending we do, the more green capital we can attract as Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investors increasingly want to invest in companies with strong green credentials. The success of this transaction recognises our position as a national champion with a very strong capital and financial position and our ongoing commitment to our sustainability goals,'' he added. Investor interest in the bond peaked at just shy of (EURO)1.5bn, allowing the bank to issue the bond at a level of MidSwaps +2.85%, equating to a coupon of 5.75%. The final order book was (EURO)1.4bn, comprising 94 investors, spread across 22 countries globally. The quality of the investor base was very satisfying with excellent participation by both ESG focused investors and many of the leading international investment managers who recognise AIB's strong balance sheet and ESG credentials. This played an important role in supporting the scale, diversity and pricing of the order book. Yesterday's proceeds contribute to AIB's ongoing Minimum Required Eligible Liabilities. In order to be labelled green, the AIB bond must comply with the International Capital Markets Association's Green Bond Principles governing the use of the bond proceeds and related transparency and reporting requirements. In light of the urgency of the climate action agenda, AIB last year doubled its Climate Action Fund to (EURO)10bn and accelerated the rollout of products and services that assist personal, corporate and small business customers in the transition to a low carbon economy.

Highlights: India and Sweden hosted the LeadIT Summit, today, on the side-lines of COP27 . The LeadIT (Leadership for Industry Transition) initiative focuses on low carbon transition of the hard to abate industrial sector. Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, India, Shri Bhupender Yadav, Minister for Climate and the Environment, Sweden, Ms. Romina Pourmokhtari and the Minister for International Cooperation, Egypt, Ms. Raina Al-Mashat participated in the event. Union Minister Shri Bhupender Yadav at the LeadIT Summit 2022 at COP 27 During the opening address Minister, Shri. Bhupender Yadav talked about the activities of LeadIT with a special focus on the road mapping exercise that was undertaken for the cement and steel sector in India. He mentioned that going forward, similar exercises are expected to be taken up in other member countries of LeadIT. He also emphasised that co-development is the only option to meet the targets that the world has taken for itself and without it, low carbon transition could be delayed by decades. "The low carbon transition of the industrial sector will not only contribute towards the reduction in required greenhouse gas emissions. It has several co-benefits that include increasing resilience to changes in climate, enhanced energy security, innovation, socio-economic development and job creation", Shri Bhupender Yadav. He also highlighted that the current phase of LeadIT is set to conclude in 2023 and the next year is the time to reflect on the performance and achievements so far. Also, the post-2023 process needs to be deliberated on to identify the priorities in a consultative manner. The event included roundtable discussions that focussed on finance and other cross-sectoral issues. The LeadIT members that include countries and companies, shared their initiatives in the industry sector and views on the requirements for successful low-carbon transitions. The summit concluded with the adoption of the summit statement by the members of LeadIT which re-emphasized the commitment to continue pursuing the low-carbon transition of the industry. The members also committed to providing technical assistance to new members and emerging economies. The importance of de-risking investments in the transition of heavy industries in emerging and developing countries was also highlighted. \</doc>

New Delhi, Nov. 5 -- Ahead of the annual climate mitigation summit, India said it looks forward to substantial progress on the discussions related to climate finance, particularly for developing countries, and clarity on its definition. Climate finance typically refers to any financing that seeks to support mitigation and adaptation actions that will address climate change. The annual, widely followed climate mitigation summit is scheduled to be held at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt during 6-18 November 2022. "As it is a saying that "what gets measured gets done", more clarity is needed on the definition of climate finance for the developing countries to be able to accurately assess the extent of finance flows for climate action. While the Standing Committee on Finance will submit a report on the various definitions, we hope to have good deliberations on this to arrive at a common understanding," a statement put out by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change said on Friday. The interpretation of the term, the statement said, must be in line with the commitments made by the countries on climate finance in the Convention and its Paris Agreement. India said the goal of USD 100 billion per year of climate finance by 2020 and every year thereafter through 2025 is yet to be achieved. "Due to lack of common understanding, several estimates of what has flown as climate finance are available. While the promised amount must be reached as quickly as possible, there is a need now to substantially enhance the ambition to ensure adequate resource flow under the new quantified goal post-2024," the statement from the ministry said. Reaching the USD 100 billion per year goal must come first, and the developed countries must be asked to show the roadmap for the same, it said. Further, about the Egyptian Presidency of COP27 , which is also a member of the Like Minded Developing Countries, the statement said the country has rightfully named COP27 as the COP of "Implementation". "India welcomes this step as over the last twelve months the world has seen the widening gap between the statements by developed countries at COP 26 in Glasgow and the reality of their actions." India is ready to support the Egyptian Presidency, with a plan of action that answers the needs of developing countries. Adaptation and loss and damage are two issues at the centre of attention, and progress on these two issues will complement each other. Meanwhile, India's Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Bhupender Yadav will lead the country's delegation to the 27th Session of the Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC ( COP 27 ). The statement from the ministry added India is fully engaged with the process and is supportive of the efforts by the government of Egypt for substantive outcomes at COP27 . announce at COP26 held in 2021? At the COP26 summit in Glasgow in late 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi committed to an ambitious five-part "Panchamrit" pledge, including reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity, to generate half of all energy requirements from renewables, to reduce emissions by 1 billion tons by 2030. India also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent. Finally, India commits to net-zero emissions by 2070. Walking the talk, India has gone ahead and banned the use of several single-use plastics starting July 2022. The adverse impacts of littered single-use plastic items plastic on both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, including in marine environments are globally recognized. Addressing pollution due to single-use plastic items has become an important environmental challenge confronting all countries. India is expected to raise matters and argue matters related to climate finance for the developing world where per capita emissions are comparatively quite low against the developed world in order to address carbon mitigation.

From November 6 to 18, 2022, Sharm el-Sheikh will host COP27 the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference . Ukraine, which had previously participated in the event for many years, was represented for the first time by a separate pavilion. His key task is to demonstrate the devastating impact of the war on the whole world and gain support for the revival of the country. The presentation of the pavilion took place on November 7. At the main annual world event dedicated to the fight against climate change, Ukraine also plans to hold various events aimed at starting an international dialogue to agree on common approaches to calculating the damage and consequences caused by war. In particular, the Green Grain Paths initiative will be presented, which raises the issue of the global threat to the worlds food security and the creation of partnerships at each stage of the grain supply chain. Our task is to convey to the world information about Ukraines commitment to climate goals, aspirations for development, as well as to tell about Russias climate crimes and their global consequences, says the Minister of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of Ukraine, Ruslan Strilets. The Ukrainian delegation will block all attempts by the Russian Federation to legitimize its illegal climate reports. Also, as part of this years negotiation process, it is important for Ukraine to receive financial support and market and non-market mechanisms for implementing the goals of the Paris Agreement. The pavilion of Ukraine consists of 3 semantic blocks. In its center is an installation in the form of a projectile burst. Fertile Ukrainian lands are now dotted with such. Inside, more than five hundred cubes of recycled Polygood material from The Good Plastic Company burst out with sixteen types of Ukrainian soils a reminder of Ukraines enormous potential and its importance to global food stability. Thematically, the pavilion is divided into two blocks - the consequences of the war for the climate and the vision of the future of Ukraine as one of the guarantor states and participants of the UN climate goals. \</doc>

The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, Port of Long Beach, Port of Los Angeles and C40 Cities are establishing a green and digital shipping corridor between Singapore and the San Pedro Bay port complex. The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), Port of Long Beach (POLB), Port of Los Angeles (POLA), and C40 Cities have begun discussions to establish a green and digital shipping corridor between Singapore and the San Pedro Bay port complex. According to the announcement, the corridor is expected to focus on low- and zero-carbon ship fuels, as well as digital tools to support the deployment of low- and zero-carbon vessels. This collaborative effort supports the Green Shipping Challenge launched during the World Leaders' Summit at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, this week. "Decarbonising the supply chain is the future of our industry, and partnerships like this on the world's most important trade route are important for fulfilling that ultimate goal," pointed out POLB executive director, Mario Cordero. The three major container ports and C40 Cities will work closely with other stakeholders in the maritime and energy value chains to accelerate the deployment of low- and zero-carbon emission solutions, identify digital shipping programs, and develop green fuel sources for bunkering to support efficient cargo movement, according to a statement. The new initiative also aims to accelerate investments in green infrastructure, including zero-carbon energy hubs linked to port and shipping demand. Teo Eng Dih, chief executive of MPA, commented, "Through this corridor, we hope to support the decarbonisation of global supply chains, complementing efforts undertaken by the industry and the International Maritime Organization to drive the decarbonization and digital transition for international shipping." "Accelerating efforts to decarbonise the shipping sector is urgent if we are to limit global warming to 1.5C," noted C40 executive director, Mark Watts, who added, "This initiative has the potential to serve a range of carriers and routes by reimagining infrastructure designs and operational best practices, and advancing the feasibility of zero-carbon fuel production, supply, storage and bunkering." \</doc>

WASHINGTON, Nov. 19 -- At the close of the COP27 climate conference, World Vision has welcomed an agreement to set up a loss and damage fund, but urges leaders that vulnerable children cannot wait twelve months for progress on the critical climate issues driving hunger, conflict and poverty today. "We understand the challenge of getting nearly 200 governments to agree on anything," said Ekkehard Forberg, a climate and peace expert at World Vision speaking from Sharm El Sheik, "but the children of the world-who have made the least contribution to climate change but suffer the greatest impact-need action today. Children who have been forced from their homes by floods and children who have no food to eat because of drought do not have time to wait for procrastination and pontification." "We are pleased that an agreement was reached today to set up a loss and damage fund to help countries worst affected by the climate crisis. But children and young people cannot wait years for countries to start contributing and investing those funds. In humanitarian work around the world, World Vision is seeing the damage climate disasters are having every day and with increasing frequency and ferocity," said Mr. Forberg. While World Vision was pleased that, for the first time, there were official spaces and meetings dedicated for children and youth at a COP, the organisation believes that children are still not the focus of national and global climate plans. "Children are disproportionately affected by climate change and thus should be at the very centre of the national and global response," said Mr. Forberg. "Their voices need to be heard and their rights defended. COP27 was held in a desert resort, and next year it will be in one of the world's richest oil states. We would invite COP negotiators to come sit under the community tree with children and young people in rural Niger or in Kenya and see first-hand the impact of their decisions." These youth representatives would, among other topics, certainly recommend nature-based solutions to the climate crisis such as World Vision's Farmer-Managed Natural Regeneration programme - a powerful way to regreen communities and capture carbon. Young people in those countries have seen the transformative power of this approach themselves. World Vision argues that if the international community adopted such solutions the world would be more likely to achieve the 1.5 degree goal. Tanzanian 15-year-old Shania - a participant in World Vision's Citizen Voice and Action programme - attended COP27 to speak out on the issue of climate change. Her attendance was facilitated by World Vision, the European Union and the African Union. Addressing the representatives of the COP 27 presidency she movingly said, "We are the least responsible for climate change, but we are the most affected by its impacts. This is not fair. Governments of all countries need to take bolder decisions and act quickly and decisively, and they need to do it NOW." Mr. Forberg said, "The world must listen to young people like Shania. We are running out of time, but we can, and we must, make changes now in order to protect the planet and ensure that all children can look forward to, rather than dread, their future on this planet."

Bhupendra Yadav said that most developing countries, just transition cannot be equated with decarbonisation, but with low-carbon development Developing countries need independence in their choice of energy mix, and in achieving the sustainable development goals (SDSs), said Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Bhupender Yadav on Sunday. COP 27 ) of the UNFCCC at Sharm El-Sheikh. He said that developed countries taking the lead in climate action is therefore a very important aspect of the global just transition. Yadav welcomed the inclusion of the transition to sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of consumption and production in our efforts to address climate change in the cover decision. "We note that we are establishing a 4-year work program on climate action in agriculture and food security," he stated. The minister also said that agriculture, the mainstay of livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers, will be hard hit by climate change. So, we should not burden them with mitigation responsibilities. "Indeed, India has kept mitigation in agriculture out of its NDCs. We are also establishing a work program on just transition," as per the minister. He said that for most developing countries, just transition cannot be equated with decarbonisation, but with low-carbon development. \</doc>

Representatives of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) participated this week in the panel "Brazilian Energy Matrix: opportunities for transition", at the 27th United Nations Conference on Climate Change ( COP 27 ), in Sharml el-Sheikh, in Egypt. The theme was presented by the director of Energy Development at the MME, Marina Rossi, and by the assistant secretary of the Secretariat of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (SPG) at the MME, Marisa Barros. Original Press Release: Nov. 18 -- Ministry of Mines and Energy of Brazil issued the following news release: - During the Brazil Panel at COP 27 , in Egypt, MME representatives highlighted topics such as biofuels, regulatory frameworks and the participation of women in the energy and mining sectors. Representatives of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) participated this week in the panel "Brazilian Energy Matrix: opportunities for transition", at the 27th United Nations Conference on Climate Change ( COP 27 ), in Sharml el-Sheikh, in Egypt. The theme was presented by the director of Energy Development at the MME, Marina Rossi, and by the assistant secretary of the Secretariat of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (SPG) at the MME, Marisa Barros. In her participation, Marisa emphasized the strategic relevance of biofuels for energy transition. Regarding green diesel, she pointed out that its use will be increasingly relevant in the world. The renewable fuel is used in diesel cycle combustion engines and is produced from vegetable and animal fats, sugar cane, alcohol and biomass, with properties similar to diesel from fossil sources. According to her, an alternative that benefits the environment, consumers and agents in the sector. "As green diesel can be added to commercialized diesel oil, it ends up causing an increase in competitiveness, resulting in better qualities and prices for the consumer", points out Marisa. She says that this biofuel also offers improved energy efficiency for oil refining, "in addition to being an excellent way for refineries to survive in this scenario of energy transition, in which it is necessary to seek a matrix that is increasingly rich in low-carbon sources ". The deputy secretary of SPG also highlighted the National Biofuels Policy (RenovaBio), established by Law n 13,576/2017 , as an important step in expanding the use of biofuels in the Brazilian energy matrix and mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. . The policy also provides more energy security, predictability for investors and the national fuel market. Regulatory Frameworks and Debureaucratization Women lead energy debate The Sustainability and Carbon manager at 2W Energia, Mariana Fieri, and the special advisor to the Ministry of the Environment (MMA), Vera Stum, also participated in the panel. This strong female representation was perceived throughout COP 27 . Around 40% of the event's audience was women, according to MME representatives. They took the opportunity to publicize the work done by the "Yes, they exist" movement . The collaborative and voluntary initiative has existed since 2018, promoting diversity and gender inclusion in the energy and mining sector, extolling the valuable contributions of competent professionals in these sectors.

Sharm El-Sheikh (Egypt), Nov 8 (IANS) Carbon markets offer an incredible opportunity to unlock billions for the climate finance needs of African economies while expanding energy access, creating jobs, protecting biodiversity, and driving climate action. However, Africa currently produces only a tiny percentage of its carbon credit potential. Led by a 13-member steering committee of African leaders, CEOs, and carbon credit experts, the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI) was launched on Tuesday with the aim of dramatically expanding Africa's participation in voluntary carbon markets. The initiative was inaugurated at COP 27 in collaboration with The Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP), Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), and the UN Economic Commission for Africa, with the support of the UN Climate Change High Level Champions -- Mahmoud Mohieldin and Nigel Topping. ACMI announced a bold ambition for the continent, to reach 300 million credits produced annually by 2030. This level of production would unlock six billion in income and support 30 million jobs. By 2050, ACMI is targeting over 1.5 billion credits produced annually in Africa, leveraging over $120 billion and supporting over 110 million jobs. Commenting on ACMI's ambition, Damilola Ogunbiyi, the CEO of SEforALL and a member of the ACMI's steering committee, said: "The current scale of financing available for Africa's energy transition is nowhere close to what is required. Achieving the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative targets will provide much-needed financing that will be transformative for the continent." Crucially, ACMI is committed to supporting high-integrity credits where an equitable and transparent distribution of revenue goes to communities. ACMI steering committee member and USAID Chief Climate Officer Gillian Caldwell noted: "The African voluntary carbon market will only succeed if people trust that African credits are driving real climate action and having a positive human impact. As the VCM scales in Africa, USAID and ACMI will ensure that it does so with integrity as a core pillar." To stimulate the production of high-integrity credits, the ACMI is collaborating with global integrity initiatives like the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (IC-VCM) and the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMI), as well as other regional carbon market platforms. ACMI released Africa Carbon Markets Initiative, Roadmap report: Harnessing carbon markets for Africa at the initiative's COP 27 launch event. The report identifies 13 action programs to support the growth of voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) on the continent. Although voluntary carbon markets are already growing quickly, retirements of African credits have grown by an average of 36 per cent annually over the past five years, aggressive action will be required to maintain this level of growth over the coming decades. Multiple African nations, including Kenya, Malawi, Gabon, Nigeria and Togo, shared their commitment to collaborating with ACMI to scale carbon credit production via voluntary carbon market activation plans. --IANS vg/ksk/ \</doc>

India, Sept. 27 -- Can no longer pretend normality is fine, claims group; announces protest days after global climate strike Thousands of young people staged a coordinated "global climate strike" September 23, 2022 to protest inaction against the climate crisis. Now, students have planned another radical step to occupy schools and universities globally to demand climate justice. After three years of climate strikes, End Fossil: Occupy movement is calling out to students internationally to occupy their schools and universities anytime between September and December 2022. The demonstations are aimed at putting an end to fossil fuel for a safe and sustainable climate. "We will use the spaces we have - schools and universities - to organise the change of the course of history," stated students and activists of climate organisation 350.org in a press release issued September 26. In August 2018, 15-year-old Greta Thunberg began a school strike for climate. In the three weeks leading up to the Swedish election, Thunberg sat outside the Swedish Parliament every school day, demanding urgent action on the climate crisis. Thunberg's protests had sparked #FridaysForFuture (FFF) - a youth-led and -organised movement. The demonstrations encouraged other young people all over the world to join them, marking the beginning of the global school strike for climate. The September 23 protests were coordinated by FFF. We have the common goal of ending the fossil economy at an international level and feel the need to be more radical, 350.org said. "We will disrupt schools and universities because we can no longer pretend normality is fine: Our duty as youth is to fight," it stated. Schools and universities are being targeted because each group of society should mobilise where it can to build a mass climate justice movement that will win, the organisation said. "Thus, we will use the spaces we have - schools and universities - to organise the change of the course of history," it stated. The group also asked for global support, asking people to help occupy a school or university on ending the fossil industry. They need to follow "three action principles: Youth-led occupation, climate justice framework for the demands and occupy until we win the demands," the press statement added. Schools and universities in several cities such as Boston, Lisbon, Los Angeles, Barcelona, Madrid, Oviedo and more will be occupied, the climate group said.

In 2021, the European Union and its 27 member states committed 23.04 billion1 in climate finance from public sources to support developing countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The Council approved the figure today, in preparation for the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ), which will take place from 6 to 18 November in Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt. The figure is based on the detailed EU climate finance reporting rules laid down in the governance regulation.2 In 2021, over 54% of the funding for developing countries was dedicated to either climate adaptation or cross-cutting action (involving both climate change mitigation and adaptation initiatives) and close to half of the total funding was committed in the form of grants, according to data compiled by the European Commission. The EU and its member states are determined to continue delivering on their international climate finance commitments towards the developed countries collective goal of mobilising USD 100 billion per year, which is applicable through to 2025. This resolve is demonstrated by the steady level of EU climate finance in 2021, which exceeds 23 billion for a second time in a row, despite the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. International public climate finance plays an important role in helping developing countries to implement the 2015 Paris climate change agreement, together with climate finance from private sources. 1 Climate finance from public budgets includes 2.50 billion from the EU budget and the European Development Fund and 2.56 billion from the European Investment Bank. The overall figure is calculated based on commitments made for bilateral and multilateral support and does not include financial support mobilised through public interventions (private finance mobilised). As certain commitments cover a multi-annual period, reported annual amounts may fluctuate over time. 2 EU member states reported data on commitments pursuant to article 19.3 of regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 (governance regulation) and article 6 and annexes III-V of Commission implementing regulation 2020/1208. \</doc>

India, Nov. 15 -- No mention in India's statement at COP27 on key negotiating agendas, complain experts India's national statement made November 15, 2022 during the plenary session of the 27th Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, was dominated by LiFE - 'lifestyle for environment' - that was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during COP26 at Glasgow. The programme, formally launched by the Prime Minister a month back in Gujarat, was referred to as the "heart of India's vision" in the statement made by Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Bhupender Yadav. Experts however said the statement did mention any key issues on the negotiation table; ranging from financial support from developed countries, loss and damage as well as fossil fuel cut. India claimed in the statement that it had already made an "arduous effort" on cutting emissions. "India, home to 1.3 billion people, is undertaking this arduous effort, despite the reality that our contribution to the world's cumulative emissions so far is less than four per cent and our annual per capita emissions are about one-third of the global average," the minister said in his address. Yadav pointed out that India had already submitted its 'Long-Term Low Emissions Growth Strategy' indicating low carbon transition pathways in key economic sectors. This was done within a year of the prime minister announcing India's commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2070, he added. Climate experts however pointed out that India's long-term strategy is basically a rehash of old commitments and short of data and specific targets. "Though India's long-term strategy to transition from fossil fuels released at COP27 is an encouraging step, the policymakers must now develop specific targets and milestones to implement the strategy in a time-bound manner," Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy, Climate Action Network International, said. The minister claimed that India has already updated its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) in response to the call for increased ambition in its 2030 climate targets. NDCs are the voluntary commitments to cut emissions made by countries. The statement also referred to how the country has "embarked on far-reaching new initiatives in renewable energy, e-mobility, ethanol blended fuels, and green hydrogen as an alternate energy source". It referred to the country's international initiatives like International Solar Alliance and Coalition of Disaster Resilience Infrastructure. Yadav further said India would assume the Presidency of the G20 in 2023 with the motto of 'One earth, One family, One future'; emphasising the need to undertake "a collective journey . with equity and climate justice as our guiding principles". 'Plain rhetoric' The focus of the statement was however Mission LiFE, which covered about 30 per cent of the statement length. "At the heart of India's vision of a safe planet is a one-word Mantra - Lifestyle for Environment - that Prime Minister Modi set forth in our national statement at COP26," Yadav said. "The world urgently needs a paradigm shift from mindless and destructive consumption to mindful and deliberate utilisation . as the world's most populous democracy and a vibrant emerging economy, India seeks to lead by example, and invites the global community to be a part of Mission LiFE for individual, family and community-based actions," he added. A climate expert with whom this reporter spoke, hailed the idea of LiFE. However, the expert pointed out that at the moment, the statement might end up as just rhetoric and a bragging point, rather than a true weapon to combat climate change. "If you look at the 75 points being referred under 'list of actions', you will find that most of them are mere wishful suggestions than real actions on the ground. "Moreover, there are some like 'take the stairs instead of an elevator wherever possible' or 'plant trees to reduce the impact of pollution' either look non-serious or too generalised," the expert said. "The statement has nothing on the key issues here, perhaps for strategic reasons," a senior climate expert at Sharm El-Sheikh said, while accepting that India has so far been more proactive at COP 27 compared to a few earlier ones. "Once the negotiation text is available, we will know how much India has been able to push through its agendas, particularly the phase out of all fossil fuels rather than only coal and likewise. But it could have been definitely stronger in its national statement," the expert said. Other countries have categorically placed demands about the key agendas on the negotiating platform. Bangladesh, in its national statement, highlighted the need to take immediate steps "to reduce global emissions by 45 per cent by 2030"; placed its demand for $100 billion from this year to 2025 and asked for a financial mechanism for loss and damage in this COP.

India, Nov. 16 -- History shows fossil fuel extraction in Africa hardly benefits locals Climate activists and experts from Africa have protested the attempts by wealthy countries to consider fossil fuel, particularly Africa's natural gas, as an alternative energy source at the expense of the ongoing green transition. The reaction was after it emerged that the wealthy nations, especially Europe, were using other underhand tactics besides pushing the 'transition fuel' agenda. For instance, they had deployed a battalion of over 600 lobbyists at the 27th Conference of Parties ( COP 27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to promote gas as a substitute low-carbon fuel for high-content fossil fuels like coal and oil . The African activists and experts released a report, " Fossil Fuelled Fallacy: How the Dash for Gas in Africa Will Fail to Deliver on Development ," explaining why the move will further worsen the climate crisis in Africa. "This report confirms that the pro-gas rhetoric is in no way intended to help African to develop. It is once again a trap to turn Africa into a gas station. We don't need more fossil fuels," said Mohamed Adow, a director at Power Shift Africa, a non-profit. Read more: Climate vulnerable countries, G7 launch plan for quick loss and damage funding Africa needs a decentralised but democratic energy system based on the continent's renewable energy sources, he added. Adow said it was the only way of greening African economies inclusively and fairly. He described it as the real solution to end the continent's energy apartheid. It was almost certain the suggestion of a "transition fuel" would not be entertained when the continent is experiencing climate carnage of epic proportions and already transitioning to green energy sources. The energy crisis and desperation for alternative fossil fuel faced by European countries result from Russia. Russia, a former top supplier has been restricting exports as retaliation against sanctions slapped on them over the Ukraine invasion. So relentless are the "anti-gas as transition fuel" activists that they have a special campaign christened "Don't Gas Africa." The movement is led by African civil society and its sole purpose is to ensure Africa is not locked into mega-fossil gas production, according to their website. "Europe, multinational fossil fuel entities and their financial backers are willing to subject Africans to needless pollution, environmental degradation and severe vagaries of climate change as they profit," said Dean Bhekumuzi Bhebhe, a lead activist at Don't Gas Africa. Read more: COP27 He insisted that Europe and other developed countries are up to no good and called upon African leaders to remain firm and reject the 'transition fuel' agenda from Europe's negotiators. Fossil fuels remain hazardous investments and the desire to expand fossil fuel industries should be condemned by all those concerned about climate change in Africa, according to a new report by the Don't Gas Africa activists and experts. The continent needs a green transition even though "fossil fuels are still with us for some time," said Eng Raila Odinga, Kenya's former Prime Minister. We must all agree to go green. It is the only way that we will be able to save the globe and this requires a global approach and determination of all countries, he said, giving reservations about mega fossil fuel investments in Africa by the West. It's not just Africa fighting the so-called 'transition fuel' agenda by the developed countries. Investors should not fund new mega oil, coal and gas supply projects if the world wants to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century, according to The International Energy Agency's latest report Net Zero by 2050: a Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector . Read more: 'Explosion' in number of fossil fuel lobbyists at COP27 climate summit Africa must prioritise investments in low-carbon and sustainable green energy sources, noted the agency, which works with countries worldwide to shape energy policies for a secure and sustainable future. Many African leaders, including African Programme Director at Oil Change International, Thuli Makama, said history shows fossil fuel extraction in Africa hardly benefits locals. Others argued that the Ukraine war would not last long and Africans might be left with 'white elephant' infrastructure for fossil fuels as the world switches to renewables. However, not all African leaders are against fossil fuels, particularly gas, as a transition fuel. For example, Senegalese President Macky Sall said there was no need to rush the transition because the potential benefits of producing and exporting fossil fuels for Africa still outweighed the harm. "We are all in favour of both a just and fair green transition, instead of decisions that harm our development process," said Sall, even as he backed the 'transition fuel' agenda.

President Uhuru Kenyatta has called on African nations to develop and advance a common agenda as the continent prepares to host the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt in November this year. Africa and its member states, under the umbrella of the Africa Union and African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) must synchronise its messages and speak with one voice in all inter-related global events. We must use our collective bargaining weight to its full advantage to influence the outcome of these multilateral processes, the President said. President Kenyatta, who spoke during a meeting of the Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC) on the sidelines of 2022 UN Ocean Conference in Lisbon, encouraged Africa to take advantage of its hosting of COP27 to push for equity and justice in climate financing. As agreed in Glasgow, ambition in all fronts remains critical to solving the climate crisis. Sharm El-Sheikh must build on, and strengthen the commitments in the Glasgow Pact. But, ambition must also reflect equity, justice and the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibility and Respective Capacity (CBDR-RC) and must leave no one behind, he said. Once again, President Kenyatta regretted that despite Africa contributing less to global emissions, the continent suffers the most from the climate induced crises such as drought, floods and locust invasion while responsible countries are not operating in emergency mode. The on-going drought in the Horn of Africa, the cyclones in Mozambique and neighbouring southern African countries, the recent devastating floods in South Africa and a locust invasion in 2020, underscore the reality of the emergency," the President said. Because of their high vulnerability, President Kenyatta urged African countries to prioritise climate change adaptation interventions saying the continent risks losing between two to four percent of GDP annually by 2040. In this regard, we must continue pressing for recognition of special needs and circumstance of Africa as recognised in the convention. We cannot achieve progress without means of implementation. Adaptation only receives 25 percent of global finance, and Africa only receives three percent of this, President Kenyatta regretted. He said the time had come for Africa to hold to account big emitters by resubmitting more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by the deadline of 23rd September this year. The world is expecting us to build and maintain the momentum from Glasgow, and to deliver concrete results in Sharm-El-Sheikh. We must therefore work together to deliver ambitious decisions," President Kenyatta said. At the same time, President Kenyatta noted that the climate financing gap in many African countries is so huge that it surpasses government budgets and available donor funding". The fact that we are still struggling to reach USD 1 billion after 13 years, to say the least, is nothing but scandalous. We must change this narrative. "Adaptation finance must be tripled. A dedicated fund for loss and damage should be put in place to support the recovery from climate emergencies. "Building back better cannot be achieved without adequate, predictable climate finance. Funding for loss and damage must be made an emergency agenda when we get to Sharm-El-Sheikh, he advised. On the Kyoto Protocol, the President said the carbon market arrangement did not benefit Africa largely due to scanty foreign direct investment opportunities and lack of technical capacity to participate in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) on fair terms. At another side event, the UN Ocean Decade Alliance meeting, President Kenyatta underscored the tremendous potential of the blue economy to uplift economies despite being under severe stress from human action He said there was need to develop a new relationship between humanity and the ocean to enable communities to benefit more from marine resources, saying science was at the core of sustainable utilization of oceans. We must embrace the opportunity offered by the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development to close the knowledge and finance gap, and advance the quest for a healthy and well-managed planet," the President said. Separately, President Kenyatta on Monday evening held bilateral talks with President Joao Loureno of Angola in Lisbon, Portugal. At the meeting held on the sidelines of the ongoing UN Ocean Conference, the two African Heads of State discussed several subjects of mutual interest to Kenya and Angola as well as the Pan-African agenda of developing a peaceful, stable and progressive continent. President Kenyatta commended his Angolan counterpart for midwifing the ongoing peace process in eastern DR Congo and welcomed the country's delegation that's set to visit Nairobi next month to align the initiative with a similar exercise led by the East African Community. \</doc>

The SDC has been working in Egypt since 2017 to improve drinking water management and make water distribution more equitable in disadvantaged neighbourhoods of the Aswan Governorate. Egypt, where COP27 is being held in early November, is among the African countries with the highest water stress. Convening COP27 " COP27 "Climate change has left a particularly devastating legacy this year," said President of the Swiss Confederation Ignazio Cassis in his speech at the World Leaders Summit of the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ). He was referring in particular to the floods in Pakistan and the continuing drought and food crisis in sub-Saharan Africa and Central Asia. In his speech, the head of the FDFA also reaffirmed Switzerland's intention to continue pursuing the climate targets set at COP21 in Paris despite the current energy crisis. Specifically, Switzerland is committed to halving its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and to achieving climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest. The critical importance of water management in Upper Egypt Let us leave Sharm el-Sheikh for a while, crossing the Gulf of Suez to Hurghada, another coastal town on the Red Sea, and then travel several hundred kilometres, first to join the Nile at Qena, before arriving, 400 kilometres further on, at Aswan in Upper Egypt. There, in 2017, the FDFA's Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) launched the Potable Water Management Programme, which aims to improve the management of drinking water. The region is particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change. The Aswan Governorate was ravaged by a violent hurricane in November 2021. It caused flooding in the streets and power cuts to households, water towers and public services, and destroyed many houses. A great deal of poor areas of the governorate suffered critical infrastructure damage. In this particular case, Switzerland supported a small-scale project to renovate eleven homes. This project was implemented by the Egyptian NGO Misr El Kheir. This kind of vulnerability is not the only problem threatening Aswan's existence. The city of Aswan is plagued in particular by a lack of adequate infrastructure and high levels of poverty. Water supply and wastewater treatment infrastructure is in poor condition, leading to significant leakage, inefficient pumping and degraded water quality. This impacts the local communities adversely in many ways. The villages surrounding Aswan: the first victims of bad water management The SDC's programme has focused on a number of villages surrounding Aswan that it identified as areas with poor housing conditions. The villages of Kattereya, Amberkab, Khor Awada and Al Nasseriya have benefited from Swiss expertise, allowing the most vulnerable communities to gain access to drinking water. The distribution was made possible by the establishment of several working groups within Aswan Water and Sanitation Company (AWSC), the local wastewater management enterprise. In the first phase, for example, the programme enabled 1,000 residents of the Khor Awada neighbourhood, connected at the time to illegal water supply sources, to install water meters and enjoy AWSC services. The programme's second phase, currently under way, is specifically targeting two poor neighbourhoods El Sail and, to an even greater extent, Khor Awada whose water supply is particularly polluted. Taken together, there are 30,000 people who still do not have proper access to clean drinking water. Thanks to the SDC's work to raise awareness within local communities, in particular in the El Sail neighbourhood, schoolchildren have been learning about water-related and environmental issues, as well as how to ward off diseases through hygiene. But the target audience of these awareness-raising campaigns also includes over 6,000 students, teachers, women and young people. More broadly, the campaigns, as part of the SDC's programme's implementation, have the potential to indirectly benefit all the residents of the city of Aswan more than 620,000 people. Moreover, the programme also aims to improve how AWSC works. This involves working groups of experts within the company who are also striving to improve its energy efficiency and better manage its treatment costs. By gathering household consumption data and comparing the bills, AWSC has increased its coverage by 2%. \</doc>

Ahead of the crucial United Nations climate change conference COP27 next month, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has forecast a decline in cross-border investment in climate change mitigation and adaptation in 2022 amid a global investment downturn.Citing a bleak outlook for global foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2022, UNCTAD said the number of new investment projects across most industries have declined, notably those tackling climate change."Between January and September 2022, climate mitigation and adaptation sectors had, respectively, 7% and 12% fewer new projects announced, in stark contrast to the previous year's strong acceleration," UNCTAD said in a report.Among mitigation measures, low carbon transport witnessed the steepest decline of 25% while in adaptation actions, water management contracted 19%.As per the report, mitigation projects accounted for 94% of international climate investments, whereas adaptation ones continued to lag far behind. Most mitigation investments are in renewable energy and, to a lesser extent, in various energy efficiency projects.Europe alone accounted for more than half of renewables' projects, with more than 700 in the first three quarters of 2022. North America and developing Asia attracted about 200 projects each"The shift from fossil-fuel to green investments to support the energy transition risks a setback, due to the loss of momentum in renewables and high oil and gas prices," UNCTAD said.For now, the downward trend in investment is also affecting extractive industries and fossil-fuel-based energy generation, where project numbers dipped by about 16% in the first three quarters of 2022, it added.However, it warned that high profits of multinationals in these sectors, combined with the current energy crisis, could lead to a renewed push for investments in fossil-fuel based energy, whose production exacerbates climate change.An early indication of that is the value of cross-border mergers and acquisitions in the extractive industry, which rose six-fold between January and September 2022.

Climate change has already started hitting us and we all know to some extent that our planet is in crisis. With world's most important climate gathering, the COP27 , underway, the news is rife with what's happening in Egypt. Yet most people have little sense of what happens behind the closed doors of COP conferences, and they don't understand the technical lingo and endless acronyms used during the conference. Many of you may probably have no idea about what even COP27 means. First up COP27 isn't a political drama title (as it sounds). COP is short for Conference of Parties to the UN Convention on Climate Change and this is its 27th annual conference. What is COP27 ? For nearly three decades, world governments, businesses, scientists and environmental organisations have been meeting every year to create a plan of action to tackle climate emergency. This meeting is called Conference of Parties (COP), is hosted by the United Nations. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), every country on Earth is treaty-bound to "avoid dangerous climate change" and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. COP 27 2022: When and Where? This year, COP27 is being held in the Egyptian coastal resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. It started on the 6th of Nov & will go on until the 18th. Agenda: The countries submit plans on how they will tackle the climate emergency and track the progress of their previous commitments. Then what is Paris Agreement? COP21 in 2015 brought the Paris agreement where nearly 200 countries around the world committed to keeping global warming below 2 degrees and pursue efforts to not exceed 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Your COP27 Here are commonly used terms and acronyms, which will help you get a better understanding of the Climate Change debate. Adaptation Biodiversity It refers to all Earth's living systems including plants, trees and animals, on land and in the sea. Carbon Footprint It is a form of calculation of the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as a result of the activities of an individual, organization, or community. Carbon Offsetting The action or process of compensating for carbon dioxide emissions arising from industrial or other human activity, by participating in schemes designed to make equivalent reductions of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Companies, governments and, even, individuals can cancel out the impact of some of their emissions by investing in projects that reduce or store carbon like forest preservation and tree plantation. Climate Finance Financial aid provided to tackle climate change. This aid is aimed to be used by developing nations to reduce carbon emissions and to promote ways in which to adapt, mitigate and build resilience to the effects of climate change. Green Climate Fund (GCF) was set up in COP16 in Mexico, by the developed countries for the same purpose. Delegate A person who is sent to represent a country at COP. A legally binding plan to phase-out fossil fuels and accelerate an equitable transition. A process of assessing global progress towards achieving the long-term goals of Paris Agreement. Global Warming Global warming is the long-term heating of the planet, and is commonly measured as the average increase in earth's global surface temperature. It is human-induced, and is largely caused by an excess of greenhouse gas emissions. Heat-trapping pollutants - mainly carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, water vapor, and synthetic fluorinated gases-are known as greenhouse gases. Green Bonds Green bonds are fixed-income instrument specifically earmarked to finance climate and environmental projects. They work like any other corporate or government bond with borrowers issuing them to secure financing for projects that will have a positive environmental impact. IPCC Short for Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It is a United Nations body that assess the science related to climate change. Loss and Damage A term used to refer to the consequences of climate change that people can't adapt to, or when options exist but the communications affected don't have access to them. Mitigation Any action which helps to slow climate change either by decreasing greenhouse emissions or removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. NDCs Short for Nationally Determined Contributions. These are climate action plans by individual countries to reduce national greenhouse emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change under the Paris Agreement. They're updated every five years to ensure they're in line with global temperature targets Net-Zero A balance between the amount of greenhouse gases produced and removed from the atmosphere. In other words, net zero is the amount of carbon we put into the atmosphere is the same as the amount we remove. Over 130 countries have committed to, or are considering committing to, net-zero emissions by 2050. India aims to reach net zero by 2070. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Seventeen interlinked goals set by the United Nations that serve as a call to action by all countries to end poverty, inequality, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy health, justice and prosperity. United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) An overarching treaty to address climate change. COP27 : The controversy There's been a lot of controversaries surrounding the COP27 COP27 climate conference. Coca Cola has been ranked as one of the world's largest plastic polluters for four years straight. It's ironic that a company so tied to the fossil fuel industry is allowed to sponsor such a vital climate meeting. There's more. They are serving foods that are causing climate change at a conference designed to fight climate change. Ironic. Animal farming is one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions, including methane. Its well-documented that animal agriculture poses threat to the planet. Scientists around the world are urging people to switch to a more plant-based diet to fight climate change. A real missed opportunity. Leaders could have led by example, showcasing how switching to low-impact plant-based diet can make a huge difference to the future of our planet. And that it is delicious too! If this wasn't enough, the leaders even flew in their private jets, further burdening the planet with more emissions. Our world is run by leaders who put profits over the planet, social justice and human rights. Hope COP27 will be less talk and more action. Until then, let's save the planet together - our future is in our hands. \</doc>

Africa could capture as much as 10 percent of the global green hydrogen market, helping to create up to 3.7 million jobs and adding as much as US$120 billion to the continent's gross domestic product (GDP), according to a landmark report issued jointly by Masdar and its Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) platform on the sidelines of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ). Africa's plentiful solar and wind resources could be leveraged to produce 30 to 60 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of green hydrogen by 2050, about 5 to 10 percent of global demand, according to the report, "Africa's Green Energy Revolution: Hydrogen's role in unlocking Africa's untapped renewables," produced with analytical support provided by McKinsey & Company. Key Highlights:  An African hydrogen industry with that production capacity would likely create 1.9 to 3.7 million jobs and boost GDP by as much as US$60 to 120 billion by 2050, the report finds.  Africa could be among the most competitive sources for green hydrogen in the world, the report shows, with a cost of US$1.8 to 2.6 per kilogram (kg) in 2030, further decreasing to about US$1.2 to 1.6 per kg by 2050 as hydrogen production technology matures and renewable energy costs continue to decline.  Proximity to demand centers in Europe and Asia also optimally positions the continent to build an export-oriented hydrogen sector, the report suggests, noting African energy exports via green hydrogen and derivatives would reach 20 to 40 mtpa by 2050.  Enabling production on the scale of 30-60 mtpa would require between 1,500 and 3,000 terawatt hours (TWh) of renewable energy - equivalent to more than 50 times Africa's current total production from solar and wind, the report states.  The largest share of the investments (US$320- 610 billion) would go to the renewables needed to produce the hydrogen, followed by electrolysis plants (US$115-220 billion). Original Press Release: - Africa could capture up to 10% of global green hydrogen market, helping to create up to 3.7 million jobs and adding as much as US$120bn to GDP by 2050, report released at COP27 shows - Report produced by Masdar and Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week with analytical support provided by McKinsey & Company Africa could capture as much as 10 percent of the global green hydrogen market, helping to create up to 3.7 million jobs and adding as much as US$120 billion to the continent's gross domestic product (GDP), according to a landmark report issued jointly by Masdar and its Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) platform on the sidelines of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ). An African hydrogen industry with that production capacity would likely create 1.9 to 3.7 million jobs and boost GDP by as much as US$60 to 120 billion by 2050, the report finds. Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, Masdar Chief Executive Officer, said, "This report provides a blueprint for African nations to deliver sustainable, low-carbon growth while extending energy access across the continent. Green hydrogen has the potential to reduce emissions, unlock economic opportunities, and create new and valuable jobs for countries across the Middle East and North Africa region. Masdar has long recognized green hydrogen's potential, with investments as far back as 2008. With several green hydrogen projects underway today around the world - including a number in Africa - we look forward to continuing to work closely with our African partners to maximize the many achievable benefits of green hydrogen highlighted in this report." Africa could be among the most competitive sources for green hydrogen in the world, the report shows, with a cost of US$1.8 to 2.6 per kilogram (kg) in 2030, further decreasing to about US$1.2 to 1.6 per kg by 2050 as hydrogen production technology matures and renewable energy costs continue to decline. Proximity to demand centers in Europe and Asia also optimally positions the continent to build an export-oriented hydrogen sector, the report suggests, noting African energy exports via green hydrogen and derivatives would reach 20 to 40 mtpa by 2050. The remaining 10-20 mtpa would serve domestic hydrogen demand, helping to boost electrification of African communities and delivering other socioeconomic benefits, including a more sustainable energy grid, expanded clean energy access, and reduced reliance on fossil fuel imports. Masdar Director of Asset Management and Technical Services, Mohammad Abdelqader El Ramahi, said: "Scaling up green hydrogen is an opportunity to not only build a robust global-export sector on the African continent, but also to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy overall. The grid-connected renewables used for green hydrogen production can feed energy into the grid to provide affordable clean energy to under-resourced areas - notably, in Sub-Saharan Africa, which has an average electrification rate of only 48 percent." Enabling production on the scale of 30-60 mtpa would require between 1,500 and 3,000 terawatt hours (TWh) of renewable energy - equivalent to more than 50 times Africa's current total production from solar and wind, the report states. The largest share of the investments (US$320- 610 billion) would go to the renewables needed to produce the hydrogen, followed by electrolysis plants (US$115-220 billion). For export projects, most of the needed capital is expected to come from foreign investors, according to the report. Beyond investments, the report recommends six broad areas for action: development of an integrated master plan; governance, international coordination, and mobilization; establishment of regulatory frameworks for hydrogen exports; investments in infrastructure; sourcing and building a highly skilled workforce; and deployment of project de-risking mechanisms. Masdar, one of the world's leading clean energy companies, is actively involved in a number of projects related to green hydrogen production. In April, Masdar and Egypt's Hassan Allam Utilities signed agreements with leading Egyptian state-backed organizations to cooperate on the development of green hydrogen production plants in the country, targeting an electrolyzer capacity of 4 gigawatts by 2030, and output of up to 480,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year.

New Delhi, Nov. 4 -- Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav, who leaves on Saturday for the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) to be held in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt from November 6 to 18, spoke to HT on key issues such as climate finance, adaptation, and loss and damage. He also said that he was disappointed by ineffective monitoring and enforcement against paddy stubble fires by the northern states, particularly Punjab. Edited excerpts from the interview: What are your expectations from COP27 ? At COP 27 , India looks forward to substantial progress on the discussions related to climate finance. More clarity is needed on the definition of climate finance for developing countries to be able to accurately assess the extent of finance flows for climate action. The goal of $100 billion per year of climate finance by 2020 and every year thereafter till 2025 is yet to be achieved. Due to a lack of common understanding, several estimates of what has flown as climate finance are available. While the promised amount must be reached as quickly as possible, there is a need to substantially enhance the ambition to ensure adequate resource flow under the new quantified goal post-2024. The Egyptian Presidency of COP27 , which is also a member of the Like Minded Developing Countries, has rightfully named COP 27 as the COP of "implementation". India welcomes this step, as over the last 12 months, the world has seen the widening gap between the statements by developed countries at COP 26 in Glasgow and the reality of their actions. India will support the Egyptian presidency for a plan of action that answers the needs of developing countries. Adaptation, and loss and damage are two issues at the centre of attention, and a progress on these two issues will complement each other. On the Global Goal on Adaptation, there needs to be significant progress on actions, indicators, and metrics. There must not be any hidden agenda of mitigation, especially in the form of nature-based solutions, in the name of co-benefits. The Work Programme on Enhanced Ambition in Mitigation and Implementation cannot be allowed to change the goal posts set by the Paris Agreement. The global stocktake process and the other mechanisms of the Paris Agreement, including enhanced NDCs and submission of the long-term low-emissions development strategies, are sufficient. In the Mitigation Work Programme best practices, new technologies and new modes of collaboration for technology transfer and capacity building may be discussed fruitfully. India will emphasise again on its invitation to all countries to join the LiFE movement - Lifestyle for Environment, a pro-people and pro-planet effort that seeks to shift the world from mindless and wasteful consumption to mindful and deliberate utilisation of natural resources. India is committed to both domestic action and multilateral cooperation on climate change, and will continue to fight all global environmental concerns in the call to protect humanity's planetary home. But global warming also warns that equity and international cooperation, leaving no one behind, hold the key to success, where the most fortunate must lead the way. How will India push for delivery of the promised climate finance of $100 billion and take the agenda of post 2025 climate finance forward? At COP 27 , India, along with other developing countries such as the Like Minded Developing Countries, will be emphasising that the $100 goal mentioned above is yet to be achieved. The discussion on the new collective quantified goal (post-2024) must focus on the quantity of the resource flow and also on the quality and scope. Issues relating to access to and suggestions for improvement in the function of the financial mechanisms are also important. Besides this, improvement in transparency to ensure appropriate oversight of the quantum and direction of flows is imperative. On the issue of finance, a discussion on Article 2.1 (c), a subclause of Article 2 (collective goal reflecting the full scale of effort needed on finance to successfully address climate change), cannot be opened as a stand-alone COP27 agenda item at this stage. Article 2(1) (c) has to be read in conjunction with entire Article 2 as well as Article 9 on climate finance. Reaching the $100 billion per year goal must come first, and the developed countries must be asked to show the roadmap for the same. Strengthening of the financial mechanisms of UNFCCC and its operating entities is imperative to meet the climate finance delivery goals. What outcome would India like on loss and damage? COP27 and there must be specific progress on the issue of loss and damage finance. The existing financial mechanisms, such as Global Environment Facility (GEF), Green Climate Fund (GCF) and Adaptation Fund, under the Convention have not been able to mobilise or deliver funds for loss and damage due to climate change. These mechanisms are under-funded; accessing funding is cumbersome and time consuming; and most of the funding is for mitigation. Adaptation funding is highly inadequate, and loss and damage funding is perhaps none at all. These are the circumstances based on which G77 and China has proposed adoption of an agenda item on loss and damage finance. It is time that this issue is accorded prominence on the climate agenda that it rightfully deserves. Having submitted its updated NDCs, will India also present a long-term strategy to achieve its climate goals? India's target of achieving net zero by 2070 is a long-term strategy. India is already in the process of preparing its Long Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) towards achievement of its long term goal of achieving net zero emissions. How do you think the current geopolitical situation, particularly the Ukraine crisis, will impact the COP27 outcome? The supply chain issue has brought into focus the issue of energy security and optimum utilization of internal resources including renewable energy. The issue of concern is that developed countries have shifted to use of more fossil fuels. We are in the midst of an air pollution disaster which is threatening the health of citizens in Delhi NCR. Why do you think the Centre and states haven't managed to fix the stubble burning problem in Punjab and Haryana? The central government through its CRM scheme has made funds available to these state government to the tune of about more than Rs.6,000 crores during last five financial years, including the current year for procurement of wide range of farm machinery to facilitate in-situ and ex-situ management of paddy stubble. The requirement was, however, to map all machinery in custom hiring centres and cooperatives and to ensure optimised use of these machines including staggering harvesting schedule at village/cluster level. For supplementing efforts for in-situ management of paddy stubble, the commission has also advised for and facilitated the use of PUSA bio-decomposer in these states. Despite a very successful field experience with application of bio-decomposer for in-situ management of stubble in Uttar Pradesh and also in the NCT of Delhi, while about 500,000 acres has been planned for by Haryana this season, no efforts are visible in Punjab for employing this effective technique for management of stubble. CAQM has also brought out a detailed advisory on various possible options for ex-situ utilisation of paddy straw but the progress on this front has not been as satisfactory. The information and education activities and campaigns launched also seem to be ineffective as reflected in the substantially higher fire incidences this year. There is ineffective monitoring and enforcement at the field level is also evident despite large number of more than 8,000 nodal officers reported to be deployed for the purpose by the state governments. How do you think a commercial release of GM Mustard will help India? Is there any point in doing a post environmental release study of impact of GM Mustard on honeybees and other pollinators? GM Mustard has the potential to increase the per hectare yield by 25-30% over the traditional varieties. Given that mustard is one of the highest oil-bearing of oilseeds, domestic production of edible oils will rise considerably. At present, India meets nearly 55-60% of its edible oil demand through imports. Increased domestic production of edible oil due to deployment of GM Mustard hybrids will reduce the dependency on imports. This will contribute to India's self-sustenance with respect to production of edible oil. Studies done worldwide show that it seems unlikely that there will be any adverse effect of GM Mustard on the honey bees and pollinators. The expert committee, constituted by GEAC in 2022, which recommended the environmental release for GM Mustard and its hybrid seed production as per existing Indian Council of Agricultural Research guidelines, also recommended that as a precautionary mechanism, the field demonstration studies with respect to the effect of GM Mustard on honey bees and other pollinators. The production of seeds of GM mustard will take two years. After two years, the commercial cultivation of mustard will start. As a precautionary mechanism, the data in regard to the impact of GM Mustard on honey bees and other pollinators will be generated during these two years.

As decision-makers from around the world gather in Charm El Sheikh for the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), a consortium of companies is commissioning Africas first green hydrogen production facility. The facility is located in the Suez Canal Economic Zone in Egypt. Egypt wants to become the hub for hydrogen and its derivatives in Africa. This ambition is becoming a reality, as the North African country has just inaugurated the first green hydrogen production plant on the African continent. The plant is a demonstrator in a large-scale hydrogen production project developed by a consortium led by independent power producer (IPP) Scatec. The Norwegian company has teamed up with Egyptian flagship Orascom Construction, as well as Fertiglobe, an ammonia producer jointly owned by OCI N.V. and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). The consortium has formed the Egypt Green SPV, which plans to scale up the new green hydrogen plant in the Suez Canal Economic Zone. Large-scale production in 2023 The aim of the project developed since 2021 is to set up a 100 MW electrolysis capacity powered by 260 MW of solar and wind energy. This electrolyser will be able to generate 15,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year. This product will be used as a feedstock for the production of at least 90,000 tonnes of green ammonia per year. The processing will be carried out in two existing Fertiglobe ammonia plants in Ain Sokhna. Green ammonia is expected to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from nitrogen fertilisers. Maritime freight is another outlet, as ammonia can be used to store hydrogen. And this avenue is being seriously explored by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), which in 2018 adopted a strategy to halve GHG emissions from shipping by 2050. In order to ensure affordable, accessible and sustainable energy security for future generations, there is a need to accelerate the shift to renewable energy and low carbon fuels. Green hydrogen, which is produced from water using renewable energy sources, can play an important role in decarbonising hard-to-mitigate sectors such as heavy industry and global shipping, argues Scatec. According to Scatec, the consortium is currently finalising the engineering and technology choices for the large-scale plant and aims to reach the final investment decision on the facility in 2023. \</doc>

Highlights :  The deal opens the door for business action and climate finance to enable high-impact renewable energy projects for communities with insufficient access to energy.  Distributed Renewable Energy Certificates (D-RECs) alter corporate green energy procurement through the use of climate finance to quicken the energy transition, enhance local clean electricity supply, and increase transparency. Global technology investor Prosus and South Pole (top provider of climate solutions) have joined forces to use the new D-REC market tool to deliver distributed renewable energy projects in response to growing calls for greater corporate climate action at COP27 . High social impact projects in South Africa and India will be their main priorities. Prosus has agreed to purchase 3 GWh of D-RECs from the South Pole, delivering 1GWh annually, between 2022 and 2025. The transaction will provide the urgently-required funding for the establishment of innovative renewable energy projects that will replace carbon-intensive electricity and give rural populations access to energy. At the COP27 United Nations , Climate Change Conference in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, the agreement was announced on Finance Day. D-RECs expand the reach of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), a popular market tool, to smaller projects with patchy grid connectivity and/or difficult financial access. D-RECs have made renewable energy options practical, such as solar mini-grids, which provide clean electricity to households, schools, hospitals, and irrigation systems. The enormous development potential of D-RECs contributes to the UN Sustainable Development Goals on health, food security, education, and combating climate change through enhancing vital services for communities. Prosus is providing climate funding for renewable energy projects by purchasing D-RECs, which replace polluting off-grid energy generation like diesel generators and electricity from some of the most carbon-intensive networks in the world. The D-REC Initiative's open technology ledger has produced rigorous criteria for business reporting against renewable energy procurement targets by providing buyers with trust in the origination of their certificates, including Prosus. There are 759 million people worldwide who still lack access to power, and it will cost more than US$500 billion yearly to supply the rising demand for electricity by 2040, making the problem of energy access enormous in scope. The REC market, however, has been constrained by risks associated with conventional renewable energy finance, a perceived lack of transparency, and the need to demonstrate impact. The risk barriers present in conventional renewable energy financing are eliminated by D-RECs through leveraging business investments, among other advantages, such as new sources of revenue and improved unit economics for DRE projects, improved economics for Results Based Financing (RBF) programs, new mechanisms for corporates to achieve Scope 2 and 3 targets and secure verifiable impacts from ESG investments, new ways to measure and monetize other environmental and social benefits, such as carbon, energy access, and other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), accelerated deployment of DRE in emerging markets. \</doc>

The Minister of Environment, Agriculture and Sustainability, Silva Calv, together with the Secretary of State for Agriculture and Sustainability, Marc Rossell, have started this Tuesday the agenda of work and participation in the 27th session of the Conference of States Parties ( COP 27 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is celebrating the meeting of ministers this week. COP 27 takes place until November 18 under the presidency of Egypt, in the city of Sharm El-Sheikh. This Conference must urge all Parties to demonstrate the necessary political will to move towards improved climate resilience. The aim of the meeting is to promote and agree on an improved global climate action agenda, following the commitment adopted in Paris in 2015, which was reaffirmed and strengthened at COP26 with the Glasgow Climate Pact, which placed the global goal of adaptation to the effects of climate change, the mitigation of gas emissions and climate finance at the forefront of global action. Reaffirming Andorras commitment to the global fight against climate change and also following the lines marked as priorities by the Executive and the Governments action plan, Horitz 23, the minister has reaffirmed Andorras commitment to increase the ambition to reduce emissions with the greenhouse effect by the year 2030. Thus, and as the Head of Government already advanced last week, specifically Andorra has approved and presented its determined contribution on a national scale by increasing the ambition to reduce emissions by 2030, following the provisions of the Glasgow Climate Pact adopted during the last COP 26 in the United Kingdom. The update establishes the ambitious goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% in 2030, thus updating the percentage that was currently at 37%, compared to the immobilist scenario. The goal remains to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, that is, to balance the level of emissions with the level of absorption of these for that year. This is what Minister Calv stated during the participation in the ministerial meeting of the Coalition of the fifteen countries that have committed to achieving Carbon Neutrality, which was held as part of the COP 27 in the French pavilion. Andorra joined this alliance of countries last year and takes the lead, along with the rest of the partners, in demanding that all countries also commit to achieving carbon neutrality in their climate action agenda. In this meeting, in which the counterparts from France, Spain and Sweden took part, the minister also explained the mechanisms that are already being implemented in the country to move towards this more ambitious goal, such as free public transport or economic financing programs for the real estate and mobile stock such as the Plan Renova and the Engega. Along these same lines, Minister Calv also explained the recent launch of the first national carbon market project, which allows financing projects within Andorras borders that help mitigate greenhouse effect emissions. Likewise, he also explained that Andorra has had a green tax since 2021 that allows the administration to finance sustainable projects. Andorra defends the fourth report Andorra defended on Saturday, at a technical level in charge of the director of the Office of Energy and Climate Change (OECC), Carles Miquel, the results of the fourth biannual report to explain the measures and the current level of emissions in the country in front of the rest of the parties that make up the COP27 . Andorra made itself available to the rest of the countries to be able to answer any questions about the report presented. By defending the results, Andorra became one of the first 10 developed countries to do so, which reinforces the will to continue working to move towards carbon neutrality. Remember that on March 2, 2011, Andorra joined the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), as a Party to the Convention. The Convention establishes that the different parties must present updates of the national inventories of greenhouse gases. These updates must also include a description of the mitigation measures planned by the country to reduce emissions. The update reports must be delivered every two years and are the basis of the transparency that governs the relationship processes between the parties to the agreement. \</doc>

New Delhi, Oct. 19 -- The International Solar Alliance will raise the issue of climate finance for energy transition and energy access in developing countries at the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt between November 6 and 18, ISA co-President and Union Minister for Power and New & Renewable Energy RK Singh said. ISA, a global partnership for increased deployment of solar energy technologies as a means for providing energy access and ensuring energy security was launched by India and France in 2015 during COP 21, has 110 member countries . On Tuesday, the first day of the body's two-day general assembly being held in Delhi, Singh said there can be no energy transition without finance from developed countries. "At COP 27 we will focus on energy transition through solar. We will urge all the countries specially the developed countries to contribute as per the pledges they have made which will help in energy transition." He added that the money is needed for more than just capital investment. "Capital investment will come but what will be necessary is to put in place is funds for insurance and payment security. So, ISA will be floating two funds, one for payment security which is a must for generating private investments in our projects. The second is a fund for project insurance. As far as knowledge and consultancy is concerned, ISA is already providing that." Singh made it clear that there could be no energy transition if the funds do not come. Ministers from 20 countries and delegates from across 110 Member and Signatory countries and 18 prospective countries joined the inaugural ceremony of the 5th ISA Assembly. Co-President of the Assembly, Chrysoula Zacharopoulou, France's Minister of State for Development said in a statement: "The International Solar Alliance, co-chaired by France and India, has grown into a global provider of tangible solutions to enable universal access to affordable solar power. It is the kind of initiative that reconciles economic development with climate goals. As we move towards COP27 , the International Solar Alliance is playing a key role to build a broad coalition in favour of ambitious climate commitments. It can count on France's full support." Singh said India can provide technical knowledge on solar projects because it is among countries with a lot of experience in solar. "We in India have 60 GW of solar energy capacity. Another 55 GW is under installation. We will be a critical part of taking the energy transition journey forward. Jean Fanfan Jourdan, minister representing Haiti shared during the assembly that due to the ongoing fuel and security crisis in Haiti children haven't attended school since January. "The ISA project of streetlights in Haiti is helping our kids," he said. During the assembly, small island nations sought ISA's help in creating solar floating projects . "We have something similar in India on freshwater but not on saltwater. It can be done but needs to be studied," Singh said. ISA's work is focused around three key strategic priority areas: Analytics and Advocacy, Capacity Building, and Programme Implementation. The focus of ISA's programmes is to set up solar projects in countries most impacted by climate change, specifically in Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). India has released $ 27 million to the ISA and is extending further financial support. Other countries that have made financial contributions to ISA include France, UK, USA, Sweden, Japan, Australia, European Commission .

New Delhi, Nov. 11 -- Technology is the need of the hour for India and the World to mitigate the devastating impact of climate change, said the Secretary, MoEFCC, Leena Nandan on Friday. Speaking at a panel Discussion on "Technology Needs Assessment for Sustainable Life" at the India Pavilion at COP 27 She said, Climate change is not an issue confined to those who are seen as emitters and there is now a realization and larger and uniform understanding that Climate change cannot be wished away. "It is knocking at our door" she added. She reiterated the need to work through silos and also stated that technology cannot remain confined to big players due to their access to finance,adding that MSMEs and start ups need to be enabled to access finance to use technology optimally. Stating that climate change is leading to devastation in the form of several nature based occurrences, Leena Nandan said "Our lifestyles need to change to respond to the challenges that we are facing". She said, " that our discussions need to now focus on bridging the gaps between what we want to achieve and how to achieve it". Secretary MoEFCC said that science is there but how to apply this science and knowledge to our activities needs to be processed. Speaking in the context of technologies in road construction she said that one size fits all cannot apply to India due to India's huge diversity. Technology needs assessment is different for different states. The Secretary also spoke about the Circular economy. Reduce, reuse, recycle, restore and refurbish. All R's need the T that is technology, she said. She urged DST to engage with state governments to come up with innovative solutions. "We need to add our bits in the larger picture only then as a country we could say that we have taken decisive steps to tackle Climate Change", concluded the Secretary. India set up a pavilion with the theme of "LiFE- Lifestyle for Environment" at the ongoing 27th Session of Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC ( COP 27 ) Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Prime Minister Narendra Modi coined the concept of LiFE - Lifestyle for the Environment - at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) held in Glasgow November last year. The LiFE movement seeks to transform persons into 'pro-planet people', who would adopt sustainable lifestyles in the modern world.

Egypt, Nov. 9 -- Private investment opportunities to support climate change adaptation against floods and droughts in Africa could reach a total of $100 billion by 2040, according to an IFC study published today.Covering 43 of Africa's 54 countries, the study, "Adapting to Natural Disasters in Africa: What's in it for the Private Sector?", assessed commercially viable investment opportunities that will strengthen the continent's climate resilience and support development and job creation. It found that many of the most promising opportunities lie in Africa's lower-income countries, including Eswatini, Malawi, Namibia, Niger, and Mauritania.Specific opportunities include investing in weather-resistant crop varieties, crop insurance for farmers, irrigation systems to protect against drought, climate data and information systems, and building dikes to protect against coastal flooding. Despite being collectively responsible for less than four percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, African countries are some of the most vulnerable to climate change, in part because of their heavy reliance on rain-fed agriculture and a limited capacity to respond and adapt to shocks. Between 1990 and 2019, Africa suffered 1,107 floods and droughts, leading to nearly 44,000 deaths and at least $14 billion in damages, the study found, using data from the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters' Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT). The study also found that since 1990, droughts and floods have lowered African countries' GDP by an average of 0.7 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively.The study measured the upfront investments needed in each country to offset droughts and floods-induced losses, assuming unchanged severity and frequency of these events over the next 20 years. Since these disasters are likely to become more frequent and severe in the future, investment needs are likely to be even greater, according to the study.The study comes as the United Nations climate change conference , COP27 , highlights the central role the private sector can play in adapting to climate change, especially in Africa.In fiscal year 2022, IFC delivered $4.4 billion in climate finance globally and mobilized an additional $3.3 billion from other sources, with $2.1 billion supporting Africa's green transition.

The 27th Session of Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC ( COP 27 ) will witness discussions related to climate finance and clarity on its definition, stated a government press release. India will be focusing on discussions regarding achieving $100 bn per year climate financing."The goal of USD100 billion per year of climate finance by 2020 and every year thereafter through till 2025 is yet to be achieved. Due to lack of common understanding, several estimates of what has flown as climate finance are available. While the promised amount must be reached as quickly as possible, there is a need now to substantially enhance the ambition to ensure adequate resource flow under the new quantified goal post-2024," stated the release. The session which is scheduled to be held at Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt from 6-18 November, 2022, will be attended by Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Bhupender Yadav. India is fully engaged with the process and is supportive of the efforts by Government of Egypt for substantive outcomes at COP 27 .In the 56th Session of the Subsidiary Bodies held in June 2022 in Bonn, developing countries made it clear that UNFCCC is the centre of the collective and multilateral response to the issue of climate change. There must be a faithful, balanced and comprehensive implementation of the Convention and the Paris Agreement, in accordance with its goals and principles.According to the release, India has been looking forward to substantial progress on such discussions as more clarity is needed on the definition of climate finance for the developing countries to be able to accurately assess the extent of finance flows for climate action.India will emphasize countries to join the LiFE movement - Lifestyle for Environment, a pro-people and pro-planet effort that seeks to shift the world from mindless and wasteful consumption to mindful and deliberate utilization of natural resources.The deliberations will also revolve around the quantity of the resource flow, the quality and the scope. Issues relating to access to and suggestions for improvement in the function of the financial mechanisms are also important. "Besides this, improvement in transparency to ensure appropriate oversight of the quantum and direction of flows is imperative," said the release. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com \</doc>

The 27th United Nations Climate Change conference ( COP27 ) is the annual milestone for the most influential leaders in climate action from governments, business and the climate community. H&M Group set the ambitious goal to reduce the group's absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions and its scope 3 emissions by 56% respectively by 2030 (from a 2019 baseline). To work towards this goal and to financially support projects to reduce its emissions throughout the whole value chain, H&M Group implemented an annual budget of around SEK 3 billion. Original Press Release: Nov. 14 -- H&M Group issued the following news release: The 27th United Nations Climate Change conference ( COP27 ) is the annual milestone for the most influential leaders in climate action from governments, business and the climate community. Working towards its ambition to achieve net-zero by 2040, H&M Group joined the international forum in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt to build momentum for collaborative action and share about the company's progress and challenges. " We have been engaged in climate mitigation for years and continuously push ourselves to demonstrate climate leadership within our industry. Our recently strengthened climate goals are verified by the Science Based Targets initiative. We are dedicated to contributing to the limitation of the global temperature increase to 1.5 C and keeping our climate strategy aligned with the latest science-based target setting frameworks is crucial for us to create impact beyond our own organisation and value chain." Leyla Ertur, Head of Sustainability H&M Group " Instead of measuring the success of these initiatives by financial gain, we measure effective emission reductions. To turn our company growth, profit and greenhouse gas reduction into equal KPIs is a very ambitious decision that underlines the importance and value of our sustainability work for our business." Leyla Ertur, Head of Sustainability H&M Group Some of H&M Group's recent initiatives include: The Green Fashion Initiative will support the company in reducing greenhouse gas emissions across its supply chain, by making funding available to supplying factories to invest in the technologies and processes needed to reduce energy demand and replace fossil fuels across the fashion industry. Fashion Climate Fund by Apparel Impact Institute Sustainable Supplier Facility Many suppliers in the apparel sector are struggling with decarbonization due to a lack of funding and adequate technology implementation support. In order to reach beyond our own influence, H&M Group and Guidehouse have initiated a Sustainable Supplier Facility where other brands and investors will be able to co-invest to share the financial responsibility of a project and give further alternatives to support suppliers in their decarbonization journey. Internal carbon price A consisting tool within the H&M Group to drive behavioral change within its buying, design and merchandising teams as well as in production and logistics, that steers toward the purchase of low-carbon materials for our products and the selection of low-emission production units. Energy expert team The implementation of its own Energy expert team gives H&M Group's suppliers access to free data, information and training on energy efficiency and renewable energies. The Energy experts perform audits and support to identify potential energy efficiency measures. But the work doesn't stop there. Knowing that even after the greatest possible reduction of global emissions, there remains a certain percentage of unavoidable fossil fuel emissions, H&M Group also invests in carbon removal solutions: Carbon dioxide removal agreement with Climeworks Footnote: [] Emission scopes (based on GHG Protocol) Scope 1: All direct GHG emissions from our own operations. Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions from consumption of purchased electricity, heat or steam used in our own operations.

India, July 13 -- The issues prioritised by developing countries must be placed front and center with loud voices and clear asks The 27th Conference of Parties ( CoP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will be held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt this November. The expectations from the event - termed 'African CoP', 'Adaptation CoP' and 'Implementation CoP' - depending on who you ask, are high, and much hope rests on the unity and strength of voices from the developing world to fight for what they deserve. Down to Earth spoke to Mohamed Nasr, ambassador of Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at the 56th UNFCCC conference of the subsidiary bodies (SB56) held in Bonn, Germany last month. Nasr serves as Egypt's director of the department of climate, environment and sustainable development, and is also its CoP27 lead negotiator. As the incoming CoP Presidency, the Egyptian delegation spent their time in Bonn assessing the state of negotiations and the possible challenges and successes in store for them, said Nasr. "It is obvious where the issues of concern would be, and we're following it, and trying to assess where the 'landing zones' could be," he added. One of the outcomes of CoP26 was the finalisation of the "Paris Rulebook". As a result, the main theme of CoP27 is the implementation of the Paris Agreement. And there are a lot of expectations from Egypt in November. As the first developing world CoP since Marrakech in 2016, there are hopes that the priorities of developing countries will be placed front and centre. These include climate adaptation, climate finance, and loss and damage (L&D), among others. The narrative so far in the build up to CoP27 , however, has been skewed towards climate mitigation - an issue championed by the developed world which is keen that all countries, and not just historical emitters, should make drastic efforts to cut emissions. Wealthy industrialised countries who have emitted most of the current stock of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since the early 1900s, must take the lead and invest deeply in mitigation today, according to CBDR. This will allow the developing world to emit and grow its economies and achieve prosperity. Mitigation requires money and institutional capacity, which the developed world has in abundance. An oft-neglected fact is that it can also be monetised by the private sector. Adaptation and L&D have little scope for profit-seekers but are critical for poor countries hit hard by climate-induced extreme weather events. Thus, the latter issues are a priority for the developing world. At Bonn, developing country blocs like the Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) repeatedly lamented the lack of "balance" between issues like mitigation on one hand and adaptation as well as L&D on the other. They pointed to the struggle they faced to get the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) and the Glasgow Dialogue on Loss and Damage on the formal agenda of the Bonn conference. When asked how the Egyptian Presidency will prepare to avoid this issue in November, the ambassador, a seasoned diplomat, emphasised that as the hosts they must be "impartial and neutral". He added: The agenda is based on submissions and requests by the Parties or the groups. This is a Party-driven process so any Party can propose an agenda item. Being the Presidency does not automatically mean that we will be bringing some agenda items and inserting them. It has to happen through the agreed process and (according to) the rules. Countries who believe that certain elements should be included, like loss and damage, must come forward and say so. GGA and the Glasgow Dialogue were not in the initial agenda for SB56, Nasr said. The GGA was eventually inserted by consensus, while the Glasgow Dialogue was not, owing to ongoing discussions, the ambassador shared. "The most important thing is that they [the Parties] have to speak out and identify what they are asking for clearly. You need to go beyond general principles - such as asking for a 'balance', or that £daptation is important' - to what exactly you want to see," he said. They must have clear asks, as they do in the World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations, Nasr said. "Without those clear asks, what you end up with are generic principles and processes, instead of clear outcomes." At CoP 27 A widely held view is that the slew of pledges and announcements made by countries, private companies and other stakeholders at CoP26 were mostly 'noise' and diverted attention from the substance of the negotiations. These included Net Zero targets announced by various countries as well as abstract and voluntary initiatives outside of the intergovernmental process like the Global Methane Pledge. "We have been working not only with the President's team (the intergovernmental process), but also with the Climate Champions. Any pledges outside the intergovernmental process are under the Champions' mandate," said Nasr. The Climate Champions were appointed at CoP21 in Paris to oversee voluntary pledges and actions taken by non-Party actors to advance the goals of the Paris Agreement. This covers a wide range of entities including 'cities, regions, businesses and investors'. "The Champions are working with the UN system to try to bring some sort of accountability mechanism for the private sector's pledges and plans. All non-Party stakeholders would fit under this process within the UN system," added Nasr. "The goal of this will be to both track and encourage them to enhance their pledges." The Egypt presidency is also trying to map the existing pledges and initiatives to make sure they are not duplicating them but building on what is existing, he said. "It's not easy - there are many initiatives covering everything that came from Paris all the way to CoP27 , or, six CoPs. And there are a lot of pledge by private sector companies and other stakeholders - everybody is pledging!" "We know the challenge. As we said, it is an 'Implementation CoP' so our focus is to make sure that whatever is being said is being implemented," the ambassador said. In addition to ensuring that the interests of the developing world are prioritised, the Egyptian Presidency will have to address the growing issue of affordability. Hotel prices in the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh are already prohibitively high. Such price hikes will exacerbate "an already creeping trend for logistical issues to block the participation of many voices (like those from civil society) who attend COPs to fight for the rights of people who have diminished voices, to fight to save our planet, and make the voices of the vulnerable heard", civil society observers pointed out in Eco Newsletter by Climate Action Network.

The Head of Government, Xavier Espot, and the Minister of Environment, Agriculture and Sustainability, Silvia Calv, will participate in the Conference on Climate Change of the United Nations, COP 27 , which will take place in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, this month of November Thus, the head of government will participate and intervene in the climate application summit of heads of state and government, on November 7 and 8. For her part, the minister will participate in the ministerial segment on November 15, 16, 17 and 18. COP 27 brings together countries in Egypt to take action to achieve the world's collective climate goals agreed in the Paris Agreement and the Convention. Based on the results and momentum of the COP 26 in Glasgow last year, it is expected that the different States will show their commitments and the implementation processes carried out under the United Nations agreements. Thus Andorra, once again, will show its commitment to the fight against Climate Change, before the international community. The Head of Government, who will go to Egypt accompanied by the Secretary of State for Agriculture and Sustainability, Marc Rossell, will participate in the different round tables planned in the agenda of the High Level segment. Andorra's national declaration is expected to take place on Tuesday, November 8, at approximately 3 p.m. He is also expected to speak at the event under the title "Bet on the future of energy", on Tuesday itself around noon. On the other hand, Andorra is organizing a ministerial meeting, on November 17, led by Minister Silvia Calv, to give visibility to the impact that climate change is having on mountain areas, within the international community. During his stay in Egypt, Calv will also participate in different round tables as well as in the event organized by the United Nations Mountain Alliance, which Andorra supports. \</doc>

India will insist on "action" and a clear pathway that developed countries must follow to deliver long-promised finance to developing countries for adapting to climate change threats, Bhupendra Yadav, Minister for Environment, Forests and Climate Change, said on Thursday, ahead of the 27th edition of the United Nations Conference of Parties (COP) in Sharm-El-Shaikh, Egypt that begins on November 7. "This ought to be a COP for action. We will seek clarity on climate finance, technology transfer and clear definitions of what constitutes climate finance. There are several claims made on funds being given by the West but loans and grants must be clearly differentiated. We will make a strong case for this, this time," Mr. Yadav told reporters. Also ReadExplained | Is the world's climate action plan on track?Several world leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden and the U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, are likely to attend the two-week-long summit. However, it is unclear if Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend. A world leaders' summit is expected on November 7. Close to $100 billion annually has been promised to developing countries since 2008 for adapting and mitigating climate change but only a fraction has actually been made available, India and several other countries have maintained through the years. This August, the Union Cabinet approved an update to India's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which is a formal communication to the United Nations, spelling out steps to be taken by the country towards keeping global temperatures from rising beyond 2\'b0C by the end of the century. The latest NDC says India is committed to reducing the emissions intensity of its GDP by 45% by 2030, from the 2005 level, and achieving 50% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030. These are viewed as a step towards achieving India's long-term goal of reaching net zero by 2070, a commitment made by Mr. Modi at the Glasgow, Scotland COP summit in 2021. Also ReadAt COP27 There will be an India pavilion in Sharm-El-Sheikh themed on LIFE (Lifestyle for Environment), a theme frequently articulated by Mr. Modi. The pavilion will showcase India's leadership and achievements on climate action and will have at least 50 organisations hosting side events, the Environment Ministry said in a statement. \</doc>

As the world convenes for the latest United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP27 , in Egypt this month, a new analysis by Bain Company of reports from companies worldwide offers an insightful picture of the business communitys response to global warming and progress towards meeting carbon reduction and net zero goals. In 2018, only 144 companies had committed to or set a science-based decarbonisation target to address their GHG footprint. This doubled to 358 in 2019 and again to 764 in 2020, before rocketing by 179% to no fewer than 2,134 companies in 2021 ahead of the COP26 conference in Glasgow. And with Q4 yet to play out, there has already been a further 77% increase in the number of companies having committed to or set a science-based target, taking the total to 3,784 in the lead up to COP27 . Yet despite the surging number of commitments to these science-based targets by businesses, a third (33%) of the companies that report GHG emissions through CDP 2 and had an absolute scope 1 2 target expiring in 2021 failed to meet it , Bains report, COP27 : It Will Take Visionary Pragmatism to Accelerate Decarbonization in the Downturn reveals. Torsten Lichtenau, Senior Partner and global lead of Bain Companys Carbon Transition Practice comments on the context behind the figures and how companies can adopt more successful approach to sustainability. Setting ambitions is the easy part, but meeting those goals has proven difficult, with 33% of companies missing the absolute scope 1 2 targets that expired in 2021 according to the latest CDP disclosures, he said. There is a very steep rise in the numbers of businesses committing to or setting decarbonisation goals. This is very positive for the planet. But while ambition is an important and a vital first step for businesses to take true differentiation will come from ambition matched with the commitment and determination to deliver the targets in a consistent as well as a cost-effective way. At the same time, companies will need to be able to commercialize and make fully viable their low carbon offering to their customers. This is the essential next step in this journey that most companies are beginning to embark upon. As world leaders gather at COP27 , Bain Companys analysis highlights five areas which encapsulate its advocated approach of visionary pragmatism to accelerate decarbonisation efforts even during the present deteriorating economic environment. Bains findings highlight how leading companies can turn the energy and carbon transition into competitive advantage. The five areas that Bains report identifies as enabling companies to succeed against their green ambitions are: Strategic adaptation: Companies do not need ever more climate scenarios but, rather, clarity on the relevant ones. Most important, they need to identify the signposts that will indicate whats coming next. Investor and lender resonance: Shareholders are sharpening their expectations about decarbonization, and at the same time, they are often unwilling to compromise on near-term returns. It will be critical for companies to double down on proof points to clearly demonstrate for capital markets the progress made to date on decarbonisation and explain the flexible pathways available to a more sustainable business in the medium-to-long term. Customer-back decarbonization: Companies that are most successful in their climate transitions start decarbonization with the customer in mind and work backward across offerings, operations, and the supply chain. More than ever, it will be critical to clearly understand the sustainability priorities of customers who are navigating an economic downturn and are therefore very focused on costs. Partnerships for results: Carbon transition is a problem too big to be solved by any one organization on their own and companies need to engage the wider ecosystem of customers, suppliers, and peers up and down the value chain. Creating an empowered green organization from top to bottom: Top management and new recruits may be convinced of the need for aggressive decarbonization. Yet the task of delivering this has solidly moved into middle management. Leading companies are empowering middle management to get the job done. Its critical to integrate decarbonization delivery into a company performance management, by aligning KPIs and incentives, putting a price on carbon (internal carbon pricing) in decisions and providing clarity to middle management on resolving trade-offs. \</doc>

The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), Port of Los Angeles, Port of Long Beach and C40 Cities have begun discussions to establish a green and digital shipping corridor between Singapore and the San Pedro Bay port complex. The corridor will focus on low- and zero-carbon fuels for bunkering, as well as digital tools to support deployment of low- and zero-carbon ships. 2. This collaborative effort supports the Green Shipping Challenge launched during the World Leaders Summit at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, this week. Convened by the United States and Norway, the Green Shipping Challenge encourages governments, ports, maritime carriers, cargo owners and others in the shipping value chain to commit to concrete steps at COP27 to galvanise global action to decarbonise the shipping industry. 3. As hub ports, Singapore, Los Angeles and Long Beach are vital nodes on the trans-Pacific shipping lanes and key stakeholders in the maritime sectors green transition. The three ports and C40 Cities will work closely with other stakeholders in the maritime and energy value chains to accelerate the deployment of low- and zero-carbon emission solutions, identify digital shipping programmes, and develop green fuel sources for bunkering to support efficient cargo movement. In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the green and digital shipping corridor aims to catalyse investment in green infrastructure, including zero-carbon energy hubs linked to port and shipping demand. 4. Mr Teo Eng Dih, Chief Executive of MPA, said, The trans-Pacific corridor is one of the busiest trade routes in the world. MPA is pleased to support the development of a green and digital shipping corridor with the USA through the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach, given their strong connectivity and existing initiatives with C40 Cities. Through this corridor, we hope to support the decarbonisation of global supply chains, complementing efforts undertaken by the industry and the International Maritime Organization to drive the decarbonisation and digital transition for international shipping. 5. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the maritime supply chain is essential, and this trans-Pacific partnership will help us build a network of ports and key stakeholders to help decarbonise goods movement throughout the Pacific region, said Mr Gene Seroka, Port of Los Angeles Executive Director. We look forward to coordinating with our partners to develop an implementation plan on this critical initiative. 6. Decarbonising the supply chain is the future of our industry, and partnerships like this on the worlds most important trade route are important for fulfilling that ultimate goal, said Mr Mario Cordero, Port of Long Beach Executive Director. Were excited about developing this initiative in the coming months and what it means for making operations more efficient while advancing the fight against global warming. 7. Mr Mark Watts, C40 Executive Director, said, Accelerating efforts to decarbonise the shipping sector is urgent if we are to limit global heating to 1.5C. This initiative has the potential to serve a range of carriers and routes by reimagining infrastructure designs and operational best practices, and advancing the feasibility of zero-carbon fuel production, supply, storage and bunkering. \</doc>

"Our journey towards a planet safe for humanity is one that no nation can undertake alone. This is a collective journey to be undertaken with equity and climate justice as our guiding principles," Bhupender Yadav says Union Minister for Environment Forest and Climate Change Bhupender Yadav on Tuesday said that we are trustees of this planet earth and must nurture it through sustainable lifestyles that optimise resource use and minimise waste. While delivering India's national statement at COP 27 , he said that the world urgently needs a paradigm shift from mindless and destructive consumption to mindful and deliberate utilisation. Yadav talked about India's aim of achieving net zero emissions by 2070 at Glasgow. "Within one year, India has submitted its long-term low emissions growth strategy indicating low carbon transition pathways in key economic sectors," he said. Responding to the call for increased ambition in our 2030 climate targets, India updated its nationally determined contributions in August 2022. "We have embarked on far-reaching new initiatives in renewable energy, e-mobility, ethanol blended fuels, and green hydrogen as an alternate energy source," the minister said. India also seeks to foster strong international cooperation through action and solutions-oriented coalitions like the international solar alliance and coalition of disaster resilience infrastructure, both of which were launched and nurtured by India. He also said that India seeks to lead by example, and invites the global community to be a part of Mission LiFE for individual, family and community-based actions. The minister said that India is assuming the Presidency of the G20 in 2023 with the motto of 'One earth, One family, One future'. "Our journey towards a planet safe for humanity is one that no nation can undertake alone. This is a collective journey to be undertaken with equity and climate justice as our guiding principles," he added. \</doc>

Srinagar, Nov. 30 -- The 27th Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) drew to a close last week and despite the many challenges and divergence of views, member countries rose to the occasion. With COP27 being branded as the COP for Implementation, significant breakthroughs were achieved on key issues, the primary being the agreement on Loss and Damage funding, adaptation and encouraging mitigation work programme which tackles emission reduction headfirst and catalyses impactful implementation that keeps the global community on track towards the more ambitious Paris Agreement goal of keeping global temperature rise to 1.5degC above pre industrial levels. From India's standpoint the outcomes of COP27 have been significant as they accommodate concerns, views and suggestions proposed by India both individually or as the collective voice of developing nations. The Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan recognises that limiting global warming to 1.5degC requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions of 43% by 2030 relative to the 2019 level. The Plan also recognises that "this requires accelerated action in this critical decade, on the basis of equity and the best available scientific knowledge, reflecting common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities [CBDR-RC] in the light of different national circumstances and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty". India has been a vocal supporter of the CBDR-RC approach in setting and meeting climate action targets for nations to ensure that in this joint fight to save the planet from the vagaries of climate change we remain mindful of historic polluters and the technological and financial gap that developing countries need to cover in order to make the green switch. The Implementation Plan urged Parties "that have not yet communicated new or updated nationally determined contributions to do so as soon as possible". India is not only among the 29 countries to have submitted its enhanced NDCs after COP26, but is also on the list of less than 60 parties that have submitted their Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy within one year of its net zero announcement at Glasgow. The steps reflect the Narendra Modi government's commitment to be part of solutions in battling climate change. Making a pitch for countries to move towards low-carbon development, the COP27 Implementation Plan calls for "targeted support to the poorest and most vulnerable in line with national circumstances and recognising the need for support towards a just transition." It recognised that "enhanced support for developing countries Parties will allow for higher ambition in their actions." India highlighted that for most developing countries just transition cannot be equated with decarbonization, but with low-carbon development and that developing countries need independence in their choice of energy mix, and in achieving the SDGs. COP27 underlined the importance of focusing on all climate actions - mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology transfer and capacity building - not just mitigation. The COP27 It urged Parties to adopt a transformational approach to enhancing capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change. It also urged developing country Parties "to urgently and significantly scale up their provision of climate finance, technology transfer and capacity-building for adaptation so as to respond to the needs of developing country Parties". India has for long batted for the urgent need for giving due importance to adaptation and discussion on whether the scale of resources is commensurate with the scale of the needs of developing countries. The COP27 The Plan document expressed "serious concern that the goal of developed country Parties to mobilise jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020 in the context of meaningful mitigation action and transparency on the implementation has not yet been met." For India, another significant aspect was the inclusion of 'transition to sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of consumption and production in the efforts to address climate change' in the cover decision of the Sharm El-Sheikh Implementation Plan. This step is in consonance with Mission LiFE, which encourages Lifestyle for Environment, launched by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on October 20. COP27 also sets the stage for moving towards the New Collective Quantified goal on Climate Finance under the Paris Agreement. It acknowledged the need for substantive progress in the deliberations on the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance, which will take into account the needs and priorities of developing countries, including quantity, quality, access and sources of funding. As the Implementation Plan document focused on climate justice, addressing the concerns and issues faced by developing countries, India found its voice heard and captured in decisions at COP27 . Prime Minister Modi, under whom several international initiatives such as International Solar Alliance and Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure have taken shape, has time and again reiterated that no country should be left behind in the fight against climate change. India has made a special pitch for countries most vulnerable to the vagaries of climate change and sought climate justice in climate negotiations. COP27 has raised the pitch for urgent actions and implementation of promises in all areas from finance to adaptation. As India contributes significantly to the fight against climate change, it hopes that the global community, especially developed countries, will keep their promises too.

Political leaders, scientists, activists, technical experts, and business leaders are meeting at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference , known as the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) being held during November 6-18 at Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The idea is to brainstorm on various issues relating to climate change, including the commitments made earlier, the progress so far, and the way forward. One of the key issues is the role of globalisation in reducing carbon emissions and adapting to climate change. The first 'Human Environment Conference' was held at Stockholm in 1972. This was followed by the 'Earth Summit' at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992. Thereafter, regular annual meetings led to accords at the Kyoto summit in 1997, the Copenhagen meet in 2009, and the Paris conference in 2015, where the global leaders agreed to limit the global warming at 1.5 \'b0C above the pre-industrial levels. Achieving this target required drastic reduction of carbon emissions through meaningful co-operation of various countries in the world; in particular, through freer movement of goods, services, and technologies that would help reduce the carbon emissions and help vulnerable counties cope with the effects of global warming. In 2016, the United States walked out of the Paris agreement and later launched a trade war with China and other countries. The US rejoined the Paris agreement in 2021, but the trade war with China continues. The world is increasingly getting divided into major trading blocs, mainly in North America, Europe, and East Asia. Many countries, including India, have turned protectionist leading to de-globalisation of sorts. Last year, at the COP26 summit at Glasgow, Scotland, most political and business leaders committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, phase out of coal, increased financial assistance to poorer vulnerable countries and so on. India committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2070. Since then, the Ukraine-Russia war has diverted substantial resources to military purposes and refugee rehabilitation, taking attention away from actions to deal with global warming. In the meantime, effects of global warming have been felt through major floods in Pakistan, severe drought in China, hurricanes in Florida, heat waves in Europe, bush fires and torrential rains in Australia, forest fires in Brazil, and so on. So, the awareness that the global leaders should take the issue of global warming seriously is growing but the geopolitical tensions, especially the Russian invasion of Ukraine, China's belligerent stance on Taiwan and repeated firing of missiles near South Korea and Japan by North Korea have worsened the relations between major countries. The global leaders are not talking enough with each other and trying to address the global issues. That is making action on climate change more difficult. Freer flow of goods, services, technologies, finance and people is essential to deal with the challenges of climate change. "Globalisation and climate action are joined at the hip," says economist and former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan.\~ The participants at the COP27 should appreciate that and find ways to arrest de-globalisation. Protectionism does not help fight global warming. email : HYPERLINK mailto:tncrajagopalan@gmail.com tncrajagopalan@gmail.com \</doc>

The World Bank has approved a $30 million credit from the International Development Association (IDA) to enable Mali to improve agricultural productivity and strengthen the resilience of rural households living in the targeted drylands. This additional financing is made available under the Mali Agricultural Productivity and Diversification Development Project in Semi-Arid Zones (PDAZAM). These additional funds will cover the costs of an emergency response to food insecurity as well as those generated by inflationary pressures, due in part to the Ukrainian crisis and insecurity. The project activities target the poor and vulnerable, including women, young people, and internally displaced persons. These additional resources will increase the number of households receiving direct cash transfers from about 40,000 to 193,000 households, and will help alleviate the food insecurity they face, says Clara De Sousa, World Bank Country Director for Mali. She specifies that in addition with women playing a dominant role in subsistence farming and in the sale of processed foods in rural and urban markets, the households headed by them and women farmers will be targeted to amplify the benefits of the project. With these additional funds, PDAZAM will be able to assist a larger number of eligible recipients in the intervention area, i.e., the regions of Kayes, Koulikoro, Sgou, Mopti, and elsewhere in the event of a food crisis declaration. The rapid spread of food insecurity across the country has led to the emergence of affected areas needing support. These additional funds, provided a few days after the launch of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm-el-Sheik, Egypt, address the World Banks objectives of strengthening the production and resilience of food systems, facilitating trade, developing inclusive value chains, and supporting vulnerable households and producers. The World Banks International Development Association (IDA), established in 1960, helps the worlds poorest countries by providing grants and low to zero-interest loans for projects and programs that boost economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve poor peoples lives. IDA is one of the largest sources of assistance for the worlds 76 poorest countries, 39 of which are in Africa. Resources from IDA bring positive change to the 1.6 billion people who live in IDA countries. Since 1960, IDA has supported development work in 113 countries. Annual commitments have averaged about $21 billion over the last three years, with about 61 percent going to Africa. \</doc>

Rival 'developed' and 'developing' blocs struggled to find an agreement on a range of issues The global climate conference Cop27 , scheduled to end on Friday, was set to spill over to Saturday as the rival "developed" and "developing" blocs struggled to find an agreement on a range of issues, particularly a loss and damage finance facility. Cop27 decision. India has so far chosen to remain silent on the stalemate, saying only that it would support the developing countries' position. Experts feel that India is treading carefully because several countries, especially from the European Union, have begun demanding that emerging economies and emitters like China and India should also pay for the loss and damage. As the countries negotiated, a text prepared by ministers engaged with the issue came up on Friday, offering three options. One, a decision to establish the fundat Cop27 itself; two, a timeframe of 2024 for the fund's establishment; and three, providing the proposed financial support through existing funding arrangements. The first option, set in motion by the EU, has gathered momentum with the developing countries asserting that Cop27 will be a failure without the establishment of the facility. But this option comes with riders for India and China as it talks about phasing out all fossil fuels and turning around emission curves quickly, and demands that countries like China and India too pay for the loss and damage. "The proposal is an effort to divide the developing countries' unity on the issue and isolate China and India," an expert said. Nabeel Munir, Pakistan's ambassador and key negotiator, told The Telegraph: "We want the facility to be created right at Sharm El Sheikh; the modalities may be worked out in the coming one or two years. If that is not done, Cop27 will not be successful." \</doc>

The world is falling short of climate change goals set in Paris in 2015 and currently there is no credible pathway to restrict global warming to under 1.5 degrees Celsius, said the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) on Thursday. The agency's 'Emissions Gap Report 2022-The Closing Window' called for an urgent system-wide transformation to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) by unprecedented levels in eight years. The report comes weeks ahead of the 27th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) scheduled from November 6 to 18 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. The report said that despite a decision by all countries at COP26 to strengthen Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), progress has been woefully inadequate. NDCs submitted this year tackle 0.5 giga tonnes of CO2 equivalent, less than one per cent of projected global emissions in 2030 The full implementation of NDCs and additional net zero emissions commitments point to only a 1.8 degrees Celsius increase. However, this scenario is not credible due to the discrepancy between current emissions, short-term NDC targets and long-term net-zero targets. Unconditional NDCs are estimated to give a 66 per cent chance of limiting global warming to about 2.6 degrees Celsius over the century. For conditional NDCs, those that are dependent on external support, this figure is reduced to 2.4 degrees Celsius. "Current policies alone would lead to a 2.8\'b0C hike, highlighting the temperature implications of the gap between promises and action," said the UNEP report. Greenhouse gas emissions by China, India, Russia, Brazil and Indonesia GHG emissions rebounded in 2021, exceeding levels before 2019. "The highest increases between 2019 and 2021 were observed in Indonesia and China, at 6.8 per cent and 5.9 per cent respectively," the report said. "The top seven emitters (China, the EU27, India, Indonesia, Brazil, the Russian Federation and the United States of America) plus international transport accounted for 55 per cent of global GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions in 2020. Collectively, G20 members are responsible for 75 per cent of global GHG emissions," said the report. However, CO2 emissions rebounded to 2019 levels in 2021, with global coal emissions exceeding 2019 levels. Methane and nitrous oxide emissions remained steady from 2019 to 2021, and fluorinated gases continued to surge. India remains far below the world average at 2.4 tCO2e. It estimates a global transformation to a low-carbon economy would require $4 trillion to 6 trillion in investment a year and suggested six sets of measures to raise such resources, including carbon pricing and creating a market for low-carbon technologies. "The emissions gap is a by-product of a commitments gap. A promise gap. An action gap. That gap must be filled, starting with COP27 in Egypt," said UN secretary general Antonio Guterres in a video message ahead of the report's release.\~ \</doc>

The committee was briefed by the President of the Confederation, Ignazio Cassis, and State Secretary Livia Leu on the current status of the exploratory political and technical discussions with the EU. Still in the context of the European question, it adopted, for the benefit of the CSSS-N, a co-report relating to the motion20.3211. As part of a co-report for the National Councils Social Security and Public Health Commission (CSSS-N), the CPE-N considered the motion20.3211For greater leeway in the acquisition of medical devices intended to supply the Swiss population, from Councilor to the States Damian Mller. The committee rejected, by 14 votes to 11, a modification of the text of the motion which aimed to ensure that medical devices subject to a non-European normative regime could only be imported into Switzerland in the event of a shortage. By 14 votes to 11, the CPE-N proposes that the CSSS-N adopt the motion in its original version. The committee believes that the adoption of the motion will not influence the exploratory talks with the EU and will give Switzerland more leeway with regard to medical devices. The minority of the committee considers that the adoption of this motion represents a risk for the safety of patients and that the administrative work necessary for the implementation of a new authorization system is disproportionate. She also considers that the motion would aggravate Switzerlands problems with the EU in the part of the agreement on mutual recognition in the field of conformity assessment which concerns medical technologies. FOREIGN POLICY: STRENGTHENING PARLIAMENTARY PARTICIPATION The CPE-N held a new in-depth discussion on the involvement of Parliament in foreign policy. In the context of an exchange with the President of the Confederation, Ignazio Cassis, and the Federal Councilor Guy Parmelin, she focused in particular on the right to consult the committees responsible for foreign policy. It also dealt with various proposals from a joint sub-committee of the Foreign Policy Committees aimed at the general strengthening of parliamentary instruments in the context of foreign policy. These proposals have been developed with the main aim of improving Parliaments involvement in the development of soft law. The committee told the President of the Confederation, Ignazio Cassis, and Federal Councilor Guy Parmelin that the application of Parliaments right to be informed or consulted on matters of foreign policy should be improved in the future and that it it was necessary that the corresponding legal bases be rigorously respected. It welcomes the Federal Councils proposals and efforts in this regard, which it deems important and which, in its view, can contribute to strengthening the relationship of trust between Parliament and the Federal Council. Following the discussion with the President of the Confederation, Ignazio Cassis, and the Federal Councilor Guy Parmelin, the committee decided, by 20 votes against 0, to table the initiative22.482Parliaments rights of participation in foreign policy as well as the motion22.4260Information and consultation in matters of foreign policy ??systematic uniform administrative procedures. OTHER TOPICS AND DECISIONS By 12 votes to 11 with 2 abstentions, the CPE-N adopted a proposed motion (22.4259) instructing the National Council Office to strengthen the National Councils relationship with the Taiwanese parliament. In the eyes of the majority of the committee, this proposal falls within the framework of parliamentary diplomacy it aims to support collaboration between Swiss and Taiwanese parliamentarians in areas of common interest. The minority believes that this motion is inconsistent with the practice of the Federal Assembly, and inappropriate in the current international context of tensions. The Commission was briefed on the situation in Iran and expressed its deep concern about the use of violence by Iranian security forces against protesters. The discussion focused on the actions taken by Switzerland to ensure that the Iranian regime puts an end to the repression. Secondly, the CPE-N took stock of the latest developments in Ukraine , particularly on the military and humanitarian fronts. Other topics discussed included the situation at the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant, as well as the recent annexation of Ukrainian territory by Russia. The Commission has also considered the question of sanctions. Finally, the CPE-N was consulted on the Federal Councils negotiating mandates within the framework of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ) and the Convention on Plastic Pollution. The committee decided to support the mandate for COP27 by 16 votes against 5 and 1 abstention as well as the mandate concerning the convention by 19 votes against 1 and 3 abstentions. \</doc>

US private equity major KKR said on Thursday that it has signed agreements to invest $400 million (about Rs 3,262 crore) in decarbonisation platform Serentica Renewables, a group company of Anil Agarwal, which plans to provide clean energy solutions. Serentica Renewables is wholly-owned by Agarwal's Twinstar Overseas, which owns controlling stakes in Sterlite Power Transmission and Sterlite Technologies. The company had set up its decarbonisation platform in September this year. The company's medium-term goal is to install 5,000 MW of carbon-free generation capacity coupled with different storage technologies and supply over 16 billion units of clean energy annually and displace 20 million tonne of carbon-dioxide emissions. The company, which is in the process of developing 1,500 MW of solar and wind power projects across various states, including Karnataka, Rajasthan and Maharashtra has also signed three long-term power purchase agreements. "We are happy to have a like-minded strategic partner in KKR who believes in our model of sustainable development. The world is undergoing a clean energy transition and India is at the forefront of this effort with its ambitious target of 450 GW by the year 2030. This investment will allow us to leap ahead in our vision of decarbonising large energy intensive industries and help in reversing climate change," Pratik Agarwal, director of Serentica Renewables said. "This transaction is amongst the largest industrial decarbonisation investments in India to date and carries forward the global decarbonisation agenda which is centre stage at COP27 (2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference )," he added. Standard Chartered Bank was the sole financial advisor to Serentica for this transaction. "Our investment in Serentica reflects KKR's confidence in India's renewables sector and our commitment to advancing the energy transition in India. Energy-intensive, heavy-industry companies play an important role in society but have traditionally faced more challenges in meeting energy needs sustainably. With Serentica, we look to support these companies in their decarbonisation objectives," Hardik Shah, partner at KKR, said. KKR makes its investment from its Asia Pacific Infrastructure strategy (fund). Since 2011, KKR has deployed over $15 billion in equity globally to invest in renewable assets such as solar and wind, which have an operational power generation capacity of 23 GW as of December 31, 2021. Serentica intends to provide round-the-clock clean energy solutions for large-scale and energy-intensive industrial customers through long-term PPAs. It also intends to work closely with customers to design their paths to net-zero electricity. FE \</doc>

Vice President Faisal Naseem on Monday called on developed countries to fully recognise their contributions to climate change and take responsibility to offset the disproportionate ill effects of their actions on small developing states through grant aid. He made this statement while speaking at the Innovative Finance for Climate and Development high-level roundtable held as part of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. The government of Egypt organised the roundtable. Addressing world leaders and representatives of financial institutions, the Vice President revealed the economic realities facing the Maldives in the face of climate change and other global catastrophes, including the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. With the economic downturn that emerged with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic still lingering in Maldives, and as an import-dependent country currently faced with an energy crisis due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, we are stretched thin to take on more and more debt in loans to address the impact of climate change, that is progressively worsening, said the Vice President. As discussions are underway on the threat of climate change and ways to overcome its effects, the Vice President stated that it was vital to acknowledge the need to strike a balance between mitigation and adaptation in climate finance. He said that more than half of climate finance for countries like the Maldives should be dedicated to adaptation. He then stressed the need to scale up ambitions and meet the collective goal of US$100 billion per year in climate finance. Highlighting the need to remove heavy bureaucratic hurdles to accessing climate finance, the Vice President called on donors to do more to help climate-vulnerable countries like the Maldives access timely and sufficient climate finance needed for their survival. He also stated that the world needs to increase its ambition outside the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to fully implement the Paris Agreement. The Vice President urged international financial institutions to align policies with the Paris Agreement and proposed innovative financing solutions that would benefit climate-vulnerable countries. The time is running short as the existential threat posed by climate change looms ever larger, he warned, stating that we can only resolve a global crisis of this scale if we all do our part in concert with each other. \</doc>

Getting India to net zero emissions by 2070 will be a monumental task and will require a fine balance between people, profits, and the planet. Climate finance, action, and implementation were top of the agenda at Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, at the recently concluded COP-27 . Innovation was at the forefront as well, with a specially designated "Climate Change Innovation Zone", enabling discussions on everything from alternative materials to green hydrogen. India, at the heels of its now cemented "Nationally Determined Contributions", laid out its plan for long-term decarbonisation of the economy (LT-LEDs), adding to the list of 56 countries to have done so to date. Getting India to net zero emissions by 2070 will be a monumental task; and given the socio-economic fabric of our country, will require a fine balance between people, profits, and the planet. The focus areas laid down in India's LT-LEDS-namely electricity, urbanisation, transport, forests, industry, carbon removal, and finance-create numerous opportunities for technology-led innovation, which can help achieve this balance. There has never been a better time to be an early-stage startup building for climate. Decarbonising electricity is critical: the power sector is already India's largest greenhouse gas emitter, accounting for 49% of emissions, and electricity consumption per capita is expected to continue to increase. India targets to achieve 50% installed capacity from renewables by 2030. Innovative approaches will be required across the renewable energy value chain from generation to storage, creating opportunities in organising solar demand and supply, creating waste-to-energy systems, manufacturing cost-effective green hydrogen electrolysers (in line with the National Hydrogen Mission), and developing solutions for long-term and temporary energy storage. Grid optimisation/smart grid technology will also be essential for interoperability and decentralisation. By 2035, India's urban population is projected to grow to 675 million, necessitating climate-smart cities. Data platforms leveraging satellite and remote sensing data can enable better urban planning, while the use of IoT and big data can help improve energy efficiency for residential and commercial buildings. Steel and cement being hard-to-abate sectors will necessitate the development of alternative materials for the built environment. Low-carbon transportation across passenger and freight use cases will be imperative to combat the sector's 10% contribution to GHG emissions. Innovations across battery technology, electric vehicles, and charging can help accelerate electrification. Improved route mapping and optimisation in logistics will shorten distances and thus reduce emissions, as will increased popularity of alternatives to personal mobility, such as shared mobility and micro-mobility. Product and tech-first approaches to organising biomass supply chains can also help achieve the 2030 target for 20% ethanol-blended fuels. Forest cover preservation and nature-based carbon sequestration solutions can be scaled-up rapidly through AI/ML and remote-sensing-based measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV), while technology platforms can help democratise financing for such projects. Climate data platforms can help improve the predictability of forest fires and other calamities, enabling quick response. Land-use optimisation through vertical farming, sustainable animal feed (to substitute grazing), etc. can help reduce competition and associated deforestation. As India strives to boost domestic manufacturing, industrial demand for energy, steel and cement will continue to grow. Sustainable industrialisation can be achieved by improving circularity in industrial processes, including the use of alternative low-GHG materials, improved waste management, treatment of effluents etc. Digitising supply chains can help create process efficiencies across sourcing, production, distribution and end-of-life, which thus creates a large opportunity for innovative B2B businesses. Extensive R&D and international collaboration will be necessary to make carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) cost-effective and energy-efficient for the most polluting industries. Start-ups can also play a role in increasing the availability and deployment of green finance, by replicating the success of fractional real estate platforms - and shifting focus towards green assets such as solar and wind plants. Finally, the LT-LEDS also placed great emphasis on the concept of LIFE (Lifestyle for Environment)-which presents a large opportunity for innovations along sustainable consumption-as evidenced by the recent proliferation of plant-based meat alternatives, sustainable CPG and circular fashion platforms. These priorities reinforced at COP27 lay down a pivotal role for early-stage startups to innovate and disrupt legacy systems, processes and models, and create solutions for India Net Zero. \</doc>

Mount Sinai Health System was celebrated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) on Thursday, November 10, for pledging ongoing action to decarbonize the health care sector and make health care facilities more resilient to the effects of climate change. Mount Sinai has formally committed to pursuing the Biden administration's climate goal of reducing emissions by 50 percent by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and has already made large-scale efforts to decarbonize. A September 2021 consensus statement from more than 200 medical journals named climate change the No. 1 threat to global public health. Key Highlights:  A September 2021 consensus statement from more than 200 medical journals named climate change the No.  The health care sector also contributes to climate change, accounting for approximately 8.5 percent of U.S. domestic emissions.  Combined, this means that more than 1,080 federal and private sector hospitals have made such commitments, together representing more than 15 percent of U.S. hospitals.  Mount Sinai has already reduced its energy-related carbon footprint by more than 30 percent since 2005.  Earlier this year, Mount Sinai signed on to The Cool Food Pledge, a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from food purchases by 25 percent by 2030. Original Press Release: - Leadership recognized by administration officials at COP27 Mount Sinai Health System was celebrated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) on Thursday, November 10, for pledging ongoing action to decarbonize the health care sector and make health care facilities more resilient to the effects of climate change. Mount Sinai has formally committed to pursuing the Biden administration's climate goal of reducing emissions by 50 percent by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and has already made large-scale efforts to decarbonize. A September 2021 consensus statement from more than 200 medical journals named climate change the No. 1 threat to global public health. It exposes millions of people in the United States, and countless more around the world, to harm every year through increases in extreme heat waves, wildfires, flooding, vector-borne diseases, and other factors that worsen chronic health conditions. These impacts disproportionately fall on communities that are often already the victims of longstanding discrimination. The health care sector also contributes to climate change, accounting for approximately 8.5 percent of U.S. domestic emissions. The HHS Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, developed the White House/HHS Health Sector Climate Pledge to help focus industry response to climate challenges. In addition to reducing their carbon footprint, signatories also commit to producing detailed plans to prepare their facilities for both chronic and acute catastrophic climate impacts. One hundred two prominent health companies in the United States have signed the White House/HHS Health Sector Climate Pledge, including organizations representing 837 hospitals as well as leading health centers, suppliers, insurance companies, group purchasing organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and more. Federal systems like the Indian Health Service, Veterans Health Administration, and Military Health System are working together to meet similar goals to those embraced by these private-sector organizations. Combined, this means that more than 1,080 federal and private sector hospitals have made such commitments, together representing more than 15 percent of U.S. hospitals. "HHS returns this year to COP27 to report great progress," said Admiral Rachel Levine, the Assistant Secretary for Health. "Through the efforts of the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity and several other HHS agencies, we have made significant strides in introducing resources and supports to help communities and care providers accelerate their work to reduce harmful emissions and increase climate resilience in the health sector." Mount Sinai has already reduced its energy-related carbon footprint by more than 30 percent since 2005. Key to these efforts were chiller and heating plant optimization projects at The Mount Sinai Hospital, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Mount Sinai West. Additional investments in electric cooling and heating technology are underway at Mount Sinai's new laboratories and health care facilities throughout New York City to further reduce the Health System's reliance on fossil fuels. "Mount Sinai is excited to join with other leaders in the health sector to expand on the progress we have already made. We understand the impacts that climate change has on the health of the communities we serve. Thus, we are committed to reducing our impact on the environment while also ensuring that we are resilient to the impacts of climate change," said Christina McNeilis, MPH, Associate Director of Sustainability at Mount Sinai Health System. Additionally, Mount Sinai is working with its suppliers to better understand and decarbonize its supply chain-related emissions. Earlier this year, Mount Sinai signed on to The Cool Food Pledge, a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from food purchases by 25 percent by 2030.

NEW DELHI, NOV 11, 2022: DEPARTMENT of Science and Technology hosted a Panel Discussion on "Technology Needs Assessment for Sustainable Life" at the India Pavilion at COP 27 to identify technology needs and their assessment for adoption for sustainable well being of global citizens in future. Speaking at the discussion the Secretary, MoEFCC, Ms Leena Nandan said that what India and the world need today is technology. Climate change is not an issue confined to those who are seen as emitters. There is now a realization and larger and uniform understanding that Climate change cannot be wished away. It is knocking at our door. She further said that climate change has led to devastation in the form of several nature based occurrences. Our lifestyles need to change to respond to the challenges that we are facing, said Ms Leena Nandan. She said that our discussions need to now focus on bridging the gaps between what we want to achieve and how to achieve it. Secretary MoEFCC said that science is there but how to apply this science and knowledge to our activities needs to be processed. Speaking in the context of technologies in road construction she said that one size fits all cannot apply to India due to India's huge diversity. Technology needs assessment is different for different states. Terrain diversity forces states to find their respective solutions. The Secretary also spoke about Circular economy. Reduce, reuse, recycle, restore and refurbish. All R's need the T that is technology, she said. She urged DST to engage with state governments to come up with innovative solutions. Secretary MoEFCC reiterated the need to work through silos and also stated that technology cannot remain confined to big players due to their access to finance. MSMEs and start ups need to be enabled to access finance to use technology optimally. "We need to add our bits in the larger picture only then as a country we could say that we have taken decisive steps to tackle Climate Change", concluded the Secretary. Ms Leena Nandan, Secretary, EFCC visited India Pavilion @ COP27 Egypt today. During her address at @IndiaDST side event on Technology Needs Assessment, she said that #SustainableLifestyle is key to #climatechange solutions. #ProPlanetPeople #IndiaCOP27 #LiFE - MoEF&CC (@moefcc) November 10, 2022 Executive Director, Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC), Prof Pradeep Srivastava spoke about de carbonising initiatives of TIFAC. Dr. Rajesh Kr. Pathak, Secretary, TDB spoke about Technology Transfer and Commercialisation and Dr. Rajeev Garg, CTCN spoke about Technology transfer mechanism at the event. Mr. Menghanai Vijay Sr. Chief Engineer, CEA, Prof. Geeta Rai Associate Professor Banaras Hindu University(BHU) were also among the panelists. Dr. Nisha Mendiratta Advisor &Head, Climate Change Programme (CCP), DST was also present during the discussions. Background: Climate change is a global concern and countries are taking concerted actions to mitigate the impacts of climate change. The Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its 6th Assessment Report (August 9, 2021) observed that climate change is widespread, rapid and intensifying and it may cross 1.5 o C threshold line by as early as 2040 unless serious efforts are taken by all countries. This calls for a synergistic efforts by all nations to control demands on resources so that imbalanced demand-supply scenario is addressed appropriately towards sustainability. The concept of sustainable living qualifies for meeting the present ecological, societal, and economical needs without compromising with the needs for future generations. A decent life, demands 24x7 electricity, potable water, adequate Food & Nutrition and a sustainable habitat. The biggest challenge is to deliver these basic needs in a sustainable manner. Here, technology has the potential to play a critical role in maintaining sustainability in this ecosystem. Department of Science & Technology (DST), in association with Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC), conducted the panel discussion under the overall theme 'Lifestyle for Environment' involving experts from Academia, Industry and Scientists of DST and TIFAC in order to identify the technology needs which are to be adapted by the relevant stakeholders. The Indian best practices in all fields were also showcased for further discussions with the international community. \</doc>

UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi is urging global leaders to curb the most devastating humanitarian consequences of the climate crisis and avert a catastrophic future for millions of displaced people. COP27 must equip countries and communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis to prepare for extreme weather, to adapt, and minimize the impact of the climate emergency, said Grandi. We cannot leave millions of displaced people and their hosts to face the consequences of a changing climate alone. Climate shocks are combining with conflict, acute food insecurity, rising prices, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic to impact people across the globe, but those least responsible for the climate crisis and least able to adapt to its shocks are being hit hardest. This years UN Climate Conference takes place against a backdrop of climate catastrophes from historic floods in Pakistan to the worst drought in decades across the Horn of Africa. Inside Somalia, nearly one million people have been displaced by drought and the threat of famine. Devastating cyclones in Mozambique have affected tens of thousands of people previously displaced by violence, while South Sudan and Sudan are battling record floods for a fourth consecutive year. More than 3.4 million displaced people and their hosts are facing the consequences of recent destructive flooding in Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, and the Central Sahel countries of Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali a region already experiencing one of the worlds worst displacement crises. In Cameroons Far North, inter-communal violence has erupted between herders, fishers, and farmers over dwindling water resources as Lake Chad and its tributaries have dried up from drought. Over 100 people were killed or injured late last year, and tens of thousands fled their homes. Meanwhile, drought in Central Americas Dry Corridor has forced farmers to flee to nearby cities where they are vulnerable to violence from street gangs. And in other parts of the region such as Honduras, climate change is one more factor sparking displacement as hurricanes become ever more powerful and frequent. Over 70 percent of the worlds refugees and displaced people come from the most climate-vulnerable countries including Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Syria, and Yemen. They have an enormous stake in discussions about the climate crisis, but they are too often excluded. Only bold action and a massive boost in financing for climate mitigation and adaptation can alleviate the current and future humanitarian consequences of the climate crisis on displaced populations and host communities. Investments must be collaborative, inclusive and seek solutions for the most vulnerable. World leaders must look to transformational, lasting, and integrated action that involves local communities, governments, and partners already battling climate extremes. In some contexts, adaptation will not be enough and additional financing will be needed for inevitable loss and damage, a stark example of which is being forced from home. The concerns and solutions for displaced people must be given a place not only in discussions like at COP 27 but also must receive much more support in the climate hotspots. \</doc>

As part of its commitment to a carbon neutral world, Mitsubishi Power, a power solutions brand of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (MHI), participated in COP27 , which took place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, where it showcased its pioneering technology advances in decarbonization and their application to accelerate the energy transition. At COP27 's Hydrogen Transition Summit, one of Climate Action's key events this year, Mitsubishi Power underscored the opportunity of hydrogen as a main enabler of energy transition, and as an integral constituent of a future decarbonized energy system. In the opening session of the Summit, Javier Cavada, President and CEO of Europe, Middle East and Africa at Mitsubishi Power, highlighted the key role the MENA region can play in this regard: "The MENA region's potential to become a major exporter of hydrogen, with the availability of abundant and low-cost renewables, existing export infrastructure, as well as financing resources." Key Highlights:  The solution will be installed at the ARNPC refinery plant in Alexandria, which provides 30% of Egypt's gasoline supply for domestic consumption.  Under the terms of the contract, Mitsubishi Power is responsible for the design, engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning of fuel conversion solutions for the existing 100 ton/hour boiler, enabling it to fire up to 100% hydrogen by the end of 2023. Original Press Release: SHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 17 -- Mitsubishi Power, Ltd. issued the following news release: - Javier Cavada, President and CEO of Europe, Middle East and Africa at Mitsubishi Power underscores MENA's potential to leapfrog developed nations in hydrogen production, at COP 27 's Climate Action Hydrogen Transition Summit As part of its commitment to a carbon neutral world, Mitsubishi Power, a power solutions brand of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (MHI), participated in COP27 , which took place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, where it showcased its pioneering technology advances in decarbonization and their application to accelerate the energy transition. A global leader in low carbon engineering and technology, the company brings decades of experience and expertise that can play a vital role in the development of sustainable, resilient and carbon-neutral energy systems. At COP27 In the opening session of the Summit, Javier Cavada, President and CEO of Europe, Middle East and Africa at Mitsubishi Power, highlighted the key role the MENA region can play in this regard: "The MENA region's potential to become a major exporter of hydrogen, with the availability of abundant and low-cost renewables, existing export infrastructure, as well as financing resources." Dr. Cavada also stressed the importance of collaboration to realize the potential of hydrogen. "While hydrogen will continue to play an essential role in decarbonization, its widespread deployment will require unprecedented collaboration with both existing and new technologies, industry partners, policymakers, and NGOs." Demonstrating the brand's commitment to realizing a carbon neutral society, MHI is committed to achieve carbon neutrality across its operations by 2040. MHI is also adopting a new goal to achieve Net Zero emissions through its entire value chain by 2040. In line with this ambition, Mitsubishi Power continues to develop energy solutions and processes that enable hydrogen's transition from industrial use to being the clean fuel of choice. "Since 1970, Mitsubishi Power has pioneered hydrogen fuel combustion technologies. With our recent projects that have demonstrated the large-scale commercial validation of our technology and decades-long expertise in this field, we are committed to support our customers across the region accelerate their energy transition with affordable and reliable solutions. This is going to be essential to demonstrating how hydrogen can competitively fulfil clean energy expectations and bring us one step closer towards a carbon neutral society," added Cavada. One recent example is the full turnkey contract Mitsubishi Power signed with leading Egyptian oil & gas company, Alexandria National Refining & Petrochemicals Company (ANRPC), to provide advanced hydrogen fuel conversion technology solutions, supporting the company to achieve its decarbonization goals. The solution will be installed at the ARNPC refinery plant in Alexandria, which provides 30% of Egypt's gasoline supply for domestic consumption. Under the terms of the contract, Mitsubishi Power is responsible for the design, engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning of fuel conversion solutions for the existing 100 ton/hour boiler, enabling it to fire up to 100% hydrogen by the end of 2023. This includes the installation of state-of-the-art hydrogen burner technology and advanced control solution to ensure efficient and safe operations. Dr. Emmanouil Kakaras, Executive Vice President Next Energy Business at MHI EMEA, also participated in Climate Action's Sustainable Innovation Forum, where he joined a panel of experts to discuss advanced energy solutions that can cut emissions rapidly enough to stay on track for a net-zero 2050 goal. "Decarbonization will be achieved by focusing on increasing energy efficiency and collaborating closely to develop and scale up hydrogen and CO2 value chains. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to net-zero 2050 - different regions and sectors will choose different pathways. As emissions cannot be avoided altogether and disruption to existing economies needs to be kept at a minimum, particularly as we're faced with the "energy trilemma" of sustainability, solutions such as hydrogen will play a central role in many of these approaches," Dr. Kakaras said. As a leading energy innovator, Mitsubishi Power is delivering its pioneering breakthrough power generation and decarbonization technologies to the MENA region and globally. From advanced class hydrogen-fueled gas turbines to autonomous power plants, Mitsubishi Power is continuing to harness the capabilities of the wider MHI group of companies to provide a comprehensive portfolio of energy transition solutions for cleaner, more efficient, and affordable energy.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday encouraged state governments and citizens to focus on green growth and green jobs to help achieve the net zero carbon emissions target by 2070. "Now, the focus of the country is on growth, on green jobs. And to achieve all these goals, the role of the environment ministry of every state is enormous," Modi said at the National Conference of Environment Ministers in Gujarat. Ahead of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , commonly referred to as COP27 , the Centre reached out to states to encourage them for devising stronger climate action plans. COP27 Modi also urged state ministers against unnecessarily allowing obstacles in the name of the environment and to ensure ease of living and doing business, while highlighting the importance of the PARIVESH portal for the single-window forest, wildlife, environment, and coastal regulation zone clearances. "Where environment clearance used to take more than 600 days 8 years ago, it takes 75 days today," the PM said, calling for expedited clearance of more than 6,000 proposals for environmental and 6,500 for forest that were pending with the states. "Expedited clearances should also take care of the rules and give priority to the development of the people. It is a win-win situation for both the economy and ecology," he said. Modi said the role of the environment ministry was more of a promoter of the environment than a regulator. "It should be our endeavour that by raising the name of the environment unnecessarily, no obstacle should be allowed to be created in the quest of ease of living and ease of doing business. We have to remember that the faster the environment clearance is available, the faster the development will also take place." Stressing the need to maintain equilibrium with nature, the PM said the role of the environment ministries of the states in achieving these goals was of vital importance. Modi emphasised the need for a participative and integrated approach by the environment ministries and citizens to create awareness about biodiversity. The PM went on to add that India is a rapidly developing economy and that it was continuously strengthening its ecology as well. "Our forest cover has increased and wetlands are also expanding rapidly," he said, asking the states to work on measures, such as vehicle scrapping policy and ethanol blending. The conference has been convened to improve synergy between the central and state governments in formulating policies on issues such as plastic pollution elimination and for action plans to combat climate change with a focus on the Lifestyle for the Environment (LiFE) Movement. Modi launched LiFE in June for people to have a lifestyle in tune with their planet. Modi said India's share in global emissions is negligible. In its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), India has put forth a target of creating an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent by increasing forest and tree cover by 2030. \</doc>

BATHINDA: Going by the losses suffered in terms of lives, property and income as the most real face of Loss & Damage due to climate change, especially for the more vulnerable and developing nations, an online programme 'Way forward for loss and damage finance' was organised by Climate Trends and Bangladesh based International Centre for Climate Change & Development (ICCCAD). It was felt that as 2022 witnessed thousands of people getting killed and displaced in a spate of unprecedented extreme weather events, India's heatwaves which broke 122 years of record, Pakistan's unprecedented floods, earlier in Bangladesh, and drought in many parts of the world, there is dire need to raise voices to raise the issue of loss and damage and compensation at the upcoming COP 27 . It was stated that even UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres raised the alarm on loss and damage at UN General Assembly, describing it as a fundamental question of climate justice, international solidarity and trust - adding that 'polluters must pay' because vulnerable countries need meaningful action. In some hopeful action ahead of the upcoming UNFCCC COP27 , developed nations like Denmark and Germany though are seemingly stepping up on Loss & Damage but more nations needs to come up. It was felt that the concerns about the fact that Loss & Damage is still just a provisional agenda item which any country can veto from the official UNFCCC COP27 agenda in Egypt, experts claim it would be a failure of the entire UNFCCC dialogue process if such a situation arises. Prof Saleemul Huq, Director, ICCCAD stated that it is important to come up with the finance now and the management can follow accordingly. Denmark's government put money into the "Global Shield" of Germany, but it will take a long time to operationalize. Several funding mechanisms have previously been set-up, such as the adaptation fund, and Green Climate Fund. Hence, setting up a loss and damage fund will not be impossible. The magnitude of the funding can be explored further but it is about the principles and we must make the polluters pay for that. Hence, it is important to highlight the issue of loss and damage in COP27 this year. Harjeet Singh, Head, Global Political Strategy, Climate Action Network International said "To put the whole issue of loss and damage into perspective, it's a story of thirty years of inaction. It's about injustice and violation of human rights. It's about the greed and apathy of rich countries and corporations who have handed death sentences to people who have not caused the problem in the first place. This is about climate justice.Anurag Danda, Senior Advisor - Climate Change Adaptation, WWF said Loss & Damage is more than an economic loss. We have been able to reduce the number of lives lost due to intense cyclones. However, we have not been able to reduce the quantum of damage and we have clearly not been able to rebuild the lives that were devastated due to the extreme weather events. We do not even need catastrophic events for loss and damages to occur as even smaller systems like Monsoon low pressure areas are able to bring flooding rains as we witnessed in Monsoon 2022.Shreyansh Jain, Business Strategy Consultant, Accenture stated Loss & Damage finance is different from mitigation finance and adaptation finance. While adaptation finance contributes to minimising loss & damage, mitigation finance contributes to averting L&D. L&D finance is therefore a third dimension and typically includes the adverse impacts of human-induced climate change that can neither be averted nor avoided by mitigation and adaptation. Farah Kabir, Executive Director, ActionAid, Bangladesh said "The COP process is not always democratic and dominated by members. CSOs are not even placed in the negotiations. Hence, we need to start at the home and national level. CSOs and academia in Bangladesh managed to influence our political actors." For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com \</doc>

Today at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), the Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, and John Kerry, Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, together welcomed continued close collaboration between Canada and the United States to further reduce methane emissions from their respective oil and gas operations. Both countries agree that significant opportunities exist to eliminate routine venting and flaring, enhance leak detection and repair, and address problems such as blow-downs and other potentially large releases. This builds on existing work on both sides of the border. In Canada, earlier this year, Minister Guilbeault committed to working with the Canadian oil and gas industry to identify pathways to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and reaffirmed Canadas commitment to reduce methane emissions by at least seventy-five percent by 2030. Today, Environment and Climate Change Canada published a proposed framework outlining the main elements of the new regulations. The draft regulations will be published early next year. During their meeting on the sidelines of COP27 , Minister Guilbeault and Special Envoy Kerry took note of the pivotal moment in time with respect to climate. Both underscored the need to avoid backsliding on commitments made at COP26 in Glasgow, the importance of countries implementing concrete actions to reach their climate goals, and limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Cutting oil and gas methane emissions is one of the fastest and most cost-effective ways to combat climate change. Methane is a potent, but relatively short-lived, greenhouse gas, and is eighty-six times more harmful than carbon dioxide over a twenty-year period. Now that profit margins are robust and energy prices are high, the time is right to invest to reduce emissions in the oil and gas sector. Making investments now will position the North American oil and gas industry among the cleanest in the world and enable it to compete in an increasingly decarbonizing industry. Quotes Canada is already on track to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 75 percent by 2030, which is just about the most ambitious target in the world. Todays announcement shows our continued commitment to tackle methane emissions by collaborating with other countries that share similar priorities. Our work with the US will strengthen regulatory ambition and alignment to support the competitiveness of our oil and gas sector. Cooperation between our two countries on methane emissions in the oil and gas sector is critical to fighting climate change, strengthening our economies, and protecting the health and safety of North Americans. The Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change We welcome Canadas deep commitment and ambition in tackling methane emissions. Cooperation on methane between the United States and Canada is, and will continue to be, a valuable tool in cutting emissions in our respective countries and around the world. John Kerry, United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate I welcome the demonstration of ambition today from Canada on reducing methane emissions from its oil and gas sector. Canadas new regulatory framework should provide a practical and strong step forward towards achieving its target of reducing oil and gas methane emissions by at least 75 percent by 2030. The IEA has identified the transformative potential of reducing methane emissions. If the world reduces methane emissions by 30 percent by 2030, the goal of the Global Methane Pledge, this would have a similar effect on global warming as immediately switching all the worlds cars, trucks, ships, and planesthe entire global transport sectorover to net-zero emissions technologies.

At the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 in Egypt, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the President of the Republic of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, and French President Emmanuel Macron, together with other representatives of the G7 and the EU, pledged their support for the investment plan of the worlds first Just Energy Transition Partnership (JET-P) on 7 November. The investment plan forms the basis for Germanys contribution of up to USD 1 billion to the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JET-P), which South Africa agreed with Germany, three other countries, and the EU at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow last year. Under the JET-P, South Africa has been pledged up to USD 8.5 billion over the next 3-5 years by partner countries to support the coal phase-out. The South African governments goal is to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and phase out coal production. KfW is supporting South Africas energy transition on behalf of the German government with a promotional loan of up to EUR 300 million. The French development bank Agence Franaise de Dveloppement (AFD) has also issued a loan of EUR 300 million. South Africa has been heavily dependent on coal-fired power generation. 80% of electricity is generated using coal. The low electricity prices attracted energy-intensive companies. But what once appeared to be an advantage is now proving to be a trap. Coal-fired power generation produces high carbon dioxide emissions, and an international comparison shows just how high: South Africa is among the 13 countries with the highest levels worldwide. Measured by its economic power, it even ranks fourth. In the meantime, a rethink has begun. The South African government is aiming for a complete phase-out of coal use. Renewable energies are to replace it. Preserving jobs in the coalfields as well The goal is to reduce the share of fossil fuels in the South African electricity mix to a maximum of 48% by 2030 while increasing the share of renewable energies to at least 38%. This will require major efforts. Both green power generation capacity and the grid need to be expanded. This requires huge investments. But that is not the end of the story. The switch initially threatens many jobs. So far, 90,000 South Africans work in the coal industry. The unemployment rate is very high at just under 35% and even higher in the coal regions. In order to make the energy transition in South Africa socially responsible, investments are needed in vocational training and alternative sectors such as green hydrogen or electric vehicles. KfWs promotional loan contributes to addressing these challenges. \</doc>

<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span style="font-size: 58px;">T</span></strong></span></span>he 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , referred to as COP27 , is being held from November 6 to 18 at the Egyptian resort of Sharm El-Sheikh. With the devastating impact of climate change already being felt, COP27 will focus on implementation, whether it is adaptation, mitigation or building resilience. Finance and technology are crucial, with developed countries not meeting their targets to provide adaptation funds and the private sector yet to move in a big way to cash in on green projects. Economist <strong>Dr Mahmoud Mohieldin</strong>, a former Egyptian minister and former senior vice president at the World Bank, is the UN Climate Change High-Level Champion, whose focus is on getting non-state actors, particularly corporate houses, to invest in green technologies in a big way that could turn the tide in the fight to save the planet. On a recent visit to Delhi, Mohieldin spoke to Group Editorial Director <strong>Raj Chengappa</strong> on his priorities. Excerpts:</p> <p><strong><span style="color:#c0392b;">Q.</span> What would you like COP27 to achieve when it meets in November at Sharm El-Sheikh?</strong></p> <p>Adaptation to climate change needs to be the winner at COP27 . This would need finance, investment and projects to be highlighted. This is an implementation summit that needs to come up with practical solutions for disaster risk management. Unfortunately, when it comes to loss and damage funds, the issue is lost in endless discussions. I hope this will be tackled properly by the state actors in their negotiations. Otherwise, the role of non-state actors, who are a catalyst force and whom I represent, would be very much constrained.</p> <p><strong><span style="color:#c0392b;">Q.</span> Pakistan was devastated by floods recen\'c2\£dtly; other developing nations have also been hit by freak weather patterns. What can the international community do to compensate for the loss?</strong></p> <p>Two things. One, we need to recognise the importance of the loss and mobilise funds to help these countries. Secondly, we must expedite work in mitigation in order to reduce emissions and to do more on resilience to minimise the impact of such disasters. Developing countries cannot afford to do it on their own. It calls for international cooperation. It will not be solved by nice speeches but by action on supplying finance and technology and improving capacity development.</p> <p><strong><span style="color:#c0392b;">Q.</span> Developed countries had committed $100 billion annually for adaptation funds. Yet most reports say they have not even met half their commitments. Is it game over for the world?</strong></p> <p> COP27 needs to ensure that developed countries meet their commitments. But we must realise that even if the full $100 billion is delivered, that would still be no more than three per cent of what is required. Post 2025, we need to get them to commit to multiple times the amount. The most conservative annual figure for climate action is around $2.5 trillion and we need to recognise this challenge. The heavy lifting of finance is still coming from the public sector. The assets from states have to be transferred into investable funds. For that, we are creating a pipeline of projects to benefit from this kind of interest of the financial sector, to be presented at COP27 .</p> <p><strong><span style="color:#c0392b;">Q. </span>So you believe that private investment must help fill the gap?</strong></p> <p>Yes, but we are not asking for charity. We are after the golden rule that there is risk, there is cost and there is decent return. Solar, wind and green hydrogen has great interest for the business community, including in India. We will share some ideas about debt reduction mechanisms, including a new generation of debts for climate swaps that will allow opportunities for investment based on the Nationally Determined Commitments. In India, I held discussions related to the creation of carbon credit markets.</p> <p><strong><span style="color:#c0392b;">Q. </span>How have Covid and the Ukraine war affected climate change goals?</strong></p> <p>Covid has been a huge setback for all sustainable development goals by impacting investment and human capital in sectors like health and education. It affected poverty alleviation measures. The Ukraine war compounded the crisis. Morally speaking, the war should end. Its impact has seen countries fall back upon old means of energy, especially coal. But it has also helped diversify energy sources through investments in wind power, solar energy and green hydrogen.</p> <p><strong><span style="color:#c0392b;">Q.</span> What are you going to champion in COP27 ?</strong></p> <p>Developing countries expect us to deliver on climate action regarding mitigation, adaptation, damage and finance, but at the same time putting in a framework to deal with unemployment. For the first time since 1998, based on UN figures, we have numbers of the extremely poor increasing. So, we will not welcome climate action that will compromise the labour market or add to the numbers of the poor. We have the technological solutions and the means of production to pursue a high, inclusive growth that would create more job opp\'c2\£dortunities. For this. we need partnersh\'c2\£dips and coordination of our efforts.</p> \</doc>

Opportunities for private investment in climate change adaptation to floods and droughts in Africa could total $100 billion by 2040, according to IFC research published today. Covering 43 of the 54 African countries, the study, titled Adapting to Natural Disasters in Africa: Whats in it for the Private Sector assesses commercially viable investment opportunities that will build the continents climate resilience and foster development and job creation. The study reveals that many promising investment avenues are found in low-income countries, such as Eswatini, Malawi, Namibia, Niger and Mauritania. These investment opportunities include the planting of weather-resistant crop varieties, crop insurance for farmers, irrigation systems to protect crops from drought, climate data and information systems, as well as as the construction of dykes to prevent coastal flooding. In Africa, extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and severe, with floods and droughts being particularly devastating. However, governments alone cannot fund the investments needed to address them. The private sector will play a key role in providing the investments that will contribute to the climate agenda , underlines Srgio Pimenta, IFC vice president for Africa. This study shows that investors benefit from many opportunities to help Africa adapt to the new climate reality and support economic development. While African countries are responsible for less than 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions, they are among the most vulnerable to climate change, particularly due to their heavy reliance on rain-fed agriculture. and their limited ability to respond and adapt to shocks. Between 1990 and 2019, Africa experienced 1,107 floods and droughts, resulting in nearly 44,000 deaths and at least $14 billion in damage, according to the study, which draws on the Flood Situations Database. (EM-DAT) from the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters. It also shows that, since 1990, droughts and floods have caused an average drop in the GDP of African countries of 0.7 and 0.4%, respectively. The study measures the initial investments needed at the country level to offset losses from droughts and floods, assuming that the severity and frequency of these events remain unchanged over the next 20 years. As these disasters are likely to become more frequent and severe in the future, investment needs are expected to be even greater, according to the study. The study comes as the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) highlights the central role the private sector can play in climate change adaptation, particularly in Africa. In fiscal year 2022, IFC provided $4.4 billion in climate finance globally and leveraged an additional $3.3 billion from other investors. These investments have included $2.1 billion to support Africas green transition. \</doc>

As COP27 kicked off at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt, Union Minister for Environment, Forests and Climate Change Bhupender Yadav, who is leading the Indian delegation, met the team on Monday morning not only to check on India's preparedness for the climate conference, but also to enquire about their comfort and health. The Indian team had left for Egypt last week, ahead of the minister, to participate in the pre- COP27 negotiations and set the ball rolling. Yadav then held a short prayer meeting amid chanting of "Om sah naav-vatu; sah nau bhunaktu", which he had carefully picked for better teamwork. Tough Task In a telling example of how tough it is to effect even a small change in government style of working, the Railway Board is struggling to make its officials revise some details on its website. Under the Quality Council of India (QCI) initiative, what officials have to do is upload the revised information on the website. But that's not happening despite repeated and stern reminders from senior officers. Now, a 10-day compliance deadline has been set for the senior officers to get the needful done. At stake is image before the QCI, they have been told. Encroachments Encroachments on national highways by eateries, vendors and other shops have become a matter of concern for the Centre. It recently raised the issue of encroachments on approach roads to some main bridges in Chhattisgarh. The Centre has red-flagged the issue with states citing the danger they pose to the commuters. Since the Centre is legally empowered to take actions, it has now asked its field units to be proactive and remove such impediments. \</doc>

Private investment opportunities to support climate change adaptation against floods and droughts in Africa could reach a total of $100 billion by 2040, according to an IFC study published today. Covering 43 of Africas 54 countries, the study, Adapting to Natural Disasters in Africa: Whats in it for the Private Sector, assessed commercially viable investment opportunities that will strengthen the continents climate resilience and support development and job creation. It found that many of the most promising opportunities lie in Africas lower-income countries, including Eswatini, Malawi, Namibia, Niger, and Mauritania. Specific opportunities include investing in weather-resistant crop varieties, crop insurance for farmers, irrigation systems to protect against drought, climate data and information systems, and building dikes to protect against coastal flooding. Extreme weather events are occurring with greater frequency and severity in Africa, with floods and droughts being particularly devastating. However, governments alone cannot finance the investments needed to respond. The private sector will play a key role in providing the investments that will contribute to the climate agenda, said Srgio Pimenta, IFC Vice President for Africa. This study shows the abundance of opportunities out there for investors that will help Africa adapt to the new climate reality and that support economic development. Despite being collectively responsible for less than four percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, African countries are some of the most vulnerable to climate change, in part because of their heavy reliance on rain-fed agriculture and a limited capacity to respond and adapt to shocks. Between 1990 and 2019, Africa suffered 1,107 floods and droughts, leading to nearly 44,000 deaths and at least $14 billion in damages, the study found, using data from the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT). The study also found that since 1990, droughts and floods have lowered African countries GDP by an average of 0.7 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively. The study measured the upfront investments needed in each country to offset droughts and floods-induced losses, assuming unchanged severity and frequency of these events over the next 20 years. Since these disasters are likely to become more frequent and severe in the future, investment needs are likely to be even greater, according to the study. The study comes as the United Nations climate change conference , COP27 , highlights the central role the private sector can play in adapting to climate change, especially in Africa. In fiscal year 2022, IFC delivered $4.4 billion in climate finance globally and mobilized an additional $3.3 billion from other sources, with $2.1 billion supporting Africas green transition. \</doc>

In October 2021, India pledged to achieve a 'net zero' emission target by 2070 at the global platform of United Nations Climate Change Conference , Glasgow (COP 26). To achieve this target, India needs to sharply cut down on its coal based thermal power plants that are responsible for 75 percent of the country's total power output. 85 percent of the thermal plants depend on burning coal for power generation which accounts for 80 percent of industrial emissions of sulfur- and nitrous-oxides. This is not an encouraging scenario from the perspective of the carbon neutrality pledge. These gases contribute to a majority of air pollutants along with particulate matter of 2.5-micron diameters(PM2.5)which is also a byproduct of coal burning. As per the World Bank Report of 2019, around 1.4 billion people (100 percent of India's population) are exposed to unhealthy concentrations ofPM2.5. One of the major concerns faced by India is the economic fluctuations in the global coal market. Power shortages because of low coal inventories have been a constant issue since the last few years. During September- October 2021, this crisis was acute, owing to the impact of the geopolitical tensions centered around the AUKUS deal. Australia, US, and UK entered in a tripartite defense partnership to augment Australia's defense capability by transferring nuclear powered submarine building technology. This deal impacted the geopolitical balance between the US, China and its allies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Australia was the largest supplier of coal to China accounting for around 8.68 million tonnes supply in July 2020. Since 2020, the Chinese ban on Australian imports has made Indonesian coal costlier in the international market. India would previously buy thermal grade coal from international markets during the monsoon months, as most of the nation's open cast coal mines get submerged, making mining difficult and the sudden hike in coal around 2021 due to AUKUS, was alarming for the thermal power sector. Power cuts became frequent as power plants reserves ran dry, and was further amplified by India's pledge of carbon neutrality at COP 26 amidst this international coal crisis. This indicated the nation's strong will to shake off its dependency on the international coal market as well as reducing emissions. Repeating similar issues, currently India is going through another coal shortage for its thermal power plants. Global coal prices are at their peak now with a cost of $400 per tons which may put the nation through another undesirable bout of power cuts. Historically, there have been phases when coal prices fluctuate in the global market for different reasons- geopolitical being the foremost. During the times of Iraq-Iran war and Gulf war (1978 - 1984), coal prices increased drastically. In 2002, these prices stabilized to $50-$60 per tons for steam coal and $70-$80 per tons for coking coal. But with the Covid lockdown and geopolitical tensions, the coal market again started fluctuating around 2019-20. The option to unshackle the bonds of coal geopolitics and price fluctuations is to free India from the clutches of coal based thermal energy. One of the best alternatives can be nuclear energy. The cost of any power is assessed through Levelized cost of Energy (LCOE). This equates the lifetime coast of operations for a power plant including maintenance cost and total cost of produced energy during the period. Nuclear energy is at present the cheapest and carbon neutral alternative to fossil fuel based thermal power. Projected Costs of Generating Electricity reported that LCOE of nuclear energy will range between $55 and $95 per MWh in 2025. Apparently, this seems to be more than LCOE of other renewable alternatives such as- onshore wind power with more than 1 MW capacity ($80-$110/MWh), large scale solar energy ($40-$80/MWh). Also Read: India will do all that is required to ensure energy security, affordability: Hardeep Puri But this figure drops down to mere 40$/MWh for nuclear power plants operating for a long duration. Hydroelectric power grids are equally competitive to nuclear power but are again influenced by regional geopolitics or river water resources of a nation. Coal based energy will have higher LCOE ($100/MWh) than nuclear in future, which could be a major economic incentive for India to transition towards nuclear power. The maximum LCOE associated with nuclear power lies in the initial construction cost ($2,157 to $6,920 per kW), which also drops significantly after long term operation ($391 to $629 per kW). Recent technological advancements and introduction of small-scale nuclear reactors also aids in reducing the overall LCOE of nuclear energy. Small modular reactors (SMR's) have greater scalability and low LCOE and can be a solution to India's energy vacuum. SMR can produce 300 MWe equivalent or less energy. Companies across the world are rolling out new models of SMR because of its demand in the global energy market. Twin large reactors can cost around 10 billion dollars and offer less control over the grid. Ten 100 MW units (SMR's) will be cheap to install and give more control of the grid than a unit of 1 GW. Hence, premier energy companies like Rosatom are focusing on supplying SMR's to nations across the globe. If India wants to unshackle its dependency on international coal market fluctuations and achieve the 2070's target of 'zero emission', nuclear power is the way forward. This can reduce the power cuts during the rainy months and free the nation from investing in procuring coal at higher costs from the international market when the nation's open cast mines are inaccessible. This will also be more economically beneficial for the nation as small-scale nuclear reactors have lesser LCOE, compared to other renewable alternatives.

It's a sign of sheer desperation to say that the world has achieved "something" at the climate change conference of the parties ( COP27 ) that concluded recently in the Egyptian coastal city of Sharm el-Sheikh. The fact is COP27 should go down as the worst event in the history of the three-decade-long negotiations to find ways to mitigate emissions that are taking us to catastrophic damages. This meeting was a grand spectacle-almost like a mirage in the desert. It created a sense of hyper action when it was about reversing the little gains made till now to combat this existential threat. I was one of the 45,000-odd people at this conference. What struck me was that it was actually designed to take the heat off the negotiations. The organisers-The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) secretariat and our host, the Egyptian government-had set up hundreds of country and agency pavilions, each with small conference rooms where five to six events were held every day, each participated by 30-50 people. There was so much going on through the day that negotiations, the real business of a COP, became the sideshow. It had little influence on what governments should have agreed upon. So, do not be surprised when I say that the final decisions at COP27 were either no-decisions-all crucial texts remained heavily bracketed (UN language for when parties disagree) until they were finally agreed upon in the early morning of November 20-or, to put it mildly, regressive. We just do not have the courage to call it out. Take the issue of loss and damage fund, seen as the big achievement of COP27 . The Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan "expresses deep concern regarding the significant financial costs associated with loss and damage for developing countries" associated with the adverse effects of climate change. The Plan then goes on to say that it will establish institutional arrangements for addressing loss and damage which will catalyse technical assistance to developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to climate change. The only "decision" is that by 2023, it will select the host country for the secretariat. In this way, there is no agreement to create a fund; no agreement who will pay for it; but there is a new categorisation that all this will be directed towards countries that are particularly vulnerable. Who and what are they? This is where the politics begins. Should bigger developing countries like India also pay other developing countries for loss and damage? This question was raised repeatedly at COP27 and, of course, led to pushback. Then, does India qualify as particularly vulnerable because it has mountains and coastlines? This will be contested at the next round of negotiations and will go nowhere, even as natural disasters reach catastrophic levels and deeply damage people and economies. This is why the world needed to return to a rule-based system of climate governance. We know that the growing intensity and frequency of weather disasters are linked to climate change, which in turn is linked to the stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Therefore, it is a simple proposition, all well established in law, that the country responsible for the pollution must pay. This is why loss and damage discussions are about liability and compensation. In this rule-based scenario, it would be established that a country like India would also contribute to the fund, but only when it has crossed a certain agreed threshold of greenhouse gas emissions. This rule-based governance was not convenient to the big polluters. So, it was taken apart in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Now, there is no agreed way to differentiate between the polluters, and this gives a country like China a free pass. China is yesterday's United States; its per capita emissions will be equal to those of the US in 2030. It should have been moved to the category of polluters. But it continues to hide behind the Group of 77-all developing countries. Frankly, the Group of 77 also finds the power of China convenient for it to take shelter under. The zero-sum game continues. At our cost. But why do I say COP27 was regressive? This is because for the first time the agreement has decided to differentiate between the white and black fossil fuels. At the very last moment, it added the term "low-emission energy" in the clean energy mix-a tacit way of saying that natural gas is cleaner because it emits half the carbon dioxide of coal. This is what the European Union did when it baptised natural gas as clean. And we know that this part of the world, which requires deep decarbonisation, is desperately digging for more natural gas in all parts of the world, including the host country Egypt. This is not alright. The world is speeding towards breaching the 1.5 \'b0C temperature rise guard rail. At 1.1 \'b0C, we are seeing such massive devastation and human pain. We cannot be parties to this procrastination and lack of intent. The least we can do is to call it out for what it is: A massive and tragic failure to act.

Manipur, Nov. 7 -- COP27 for human survival Science has established beyond doubt that the window for climate action is closing rapidly. The world's most significant climate summit, COP27 is a make-or-break moment for the global action on climate change with 198 member countries in the coastal town of Sharm al-Sheikh in Egypt, from last Sunday, November 6, to 18 with a view to building on previous successes and paving the way for future ambitions. Environmentalist at COP26 were clear for the countries 2030 global emissions reduction targets will cause at least2.5degC warming by 2100. However, this is well above the target of Paris Agreement. Therefore, 1.5degC target is just like being on 'life support in ICU'. COP27 is a golden opportunity for all stakeholders to rise to the occasion and tackle effectively on the global climate crisis. We all know the gravity of climate crisis and the need to address the value of multilateral, collective and concerted action to fight this global threat. The world is not on track to keep warming within 1.5degC, and past events have made the path to success even more difficult. The continuing global economic effects of Covid-19 and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, along with mounting impacts of climate change in the form of various disasters, have created huge stumbling blocks for decarbonisation and international cooperation on climate. As it stands, the Paris Agreement is teetering on the brink of irrelevance. A successful COP27 - which will include delivering on support for developing countries to deal with loss and damage caused by climate change - is essential to keep international cooperation on climate alive. India's stand on this issue will be a major discussion point at COP27 . Pakistan has also stressed to make the formal agenda at this climate talks. Thus, at COP27 , developed countries will be under pressure from vulnerable nations to prioritise support for loss and damage during the negotiations. In itslatest report, IPCC warned that climate change is impacting the world much faster than anticipated. Furthermore, it points out that even if we successfully limit global warming to 1.5degC, we won't be able to avert losses to nature, societies or economies entirely. The best-case scenario is to reduce them substantially. Limiting global warming is a matter of life and death for communities struggling to cope with weather extremes, and who lack the economic resources to adapt. Most of the developing countries rely on financial support from their richer counterparts to enhance mitigation and adaptation and meet their pledges under the Paris Agreement. The COP27 COP27 prioritiesshould be to deliver on previously agreed finance targets by the developed countries to meet their initial goal ofRs.48000 billion between 2020 and 2025. Moreover, at this summit, countries should develop road maps for balanced adaptation and mitigation finance to go into effect after 2025. According to some leaders, the previously agreed Rs.800 billion in annual financial aid isinsufficient. As a result, they urge to scale up the financial support to match developing countries' evolving adaptation and mitigation needs. The working group estimates the annual cost of adaptation in developing countries at betweenRs. 11200 billion and Rs.24000 billion by 2030 and 2050 respectively and the total may go up toRs.40000 billion. Current spending on adaptation are much smaller than needed. Only6% of climate finance goes to adaptation efforts. In fact, there have beencallsfor all climate finance to go towards adaptation to help it catch up. Countries must update their Nationally Determined Contributions in line with the 1.5degC target and lay out ambitious and long-term strategies. They also should agree on credible and audit-able financing mechanisms that can make those targets possible in the shortest period of time. According toreports, there is a significant discrepancy between climate finance figures reported by donor countries and the real provisions. For maximum transparency, a trusted third party must oversee the entire process. In reality, the most effective adaptation measurescan't preventall losses, especially for the vulnerable regions. As a result, COP27 The way in which the world responds to the present climate emergency is crucial to our future survival. Therefore, COP27 becomes the moment when the world moved from negotiation to implementation, words were translated to actions and where we collectively work towards sustainability for the planet and the future generations.

The United Nations Climate Change Conference 2022 - COP27 - opened on Sunday (November 6) in Sharm el-Sheikh with the aim of ensuring full implementation of the Paris Agreement adopted in 2015. A High-Level Segment mostly attended by Ministers will take place during the last four days of the fortnight-long conference, from November 15-18. COP stands for the annual 'Conference of the Parties' to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol signed in 1997, or the Paris Agreement. The meetings review the progress made by countries in the fight against climate change and in the implementation of decisions taken in earlier COPs. The COP meets every year, unless the parties decide otherwise. The first COP meeting was held in Berlin, Germany in March 1995. COP27 marks 30 years since the adoption of the UNFCCC. The venue: Sharm el-Sheikh In July 2009, then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met with his Pakistani counterpart Yousaf Raza Gilani in Sharm el-Sheikh on the sidelines of the NAM Summit, after which a joint statement was issued that created a political storm in India. The statement said "Both leaders agreed that the two countries will share real time credible and actionable information on any future terrorist threats... Prime Minister Gilani mentioned that Pakistan has some information on threats in Balochistan and other areas." The BJP, which was then in the opposition, attacked Singh ferociously, arguing that the reference to Balochistan had emboldened Pakistan to accuse India of involvement in fomenting insurgency in that restive region. The venue for the COP meeting rotates among the five UN-identified regions: Africa, Asia-Pacific, Eastern Europe, Latin America and Caribbean, and Western Europe and Others. The countries in the region propose a candidate, and a host is usually decided at least two years in advance. If no country agrees to be the host, Bonn, where the UNFCCC secretariat is headquartered, steps in as host. The rotation cycle has not been followed very strictly. The first and second COPs were held in western Europe (Berlin and Geneva), and so were the fifth and sixth (Bonn and the Hague). After the 2012 COP in Doha, the event has not yet returned to Asia. Countries are sometimes not enthusiastic to host the event. This is mainly due to two reasons. One, the host city incurs huge expenditure on the event, not all of which is reimbursed. There are many thousands of participants, a large number of high-profile visits by international dignitaries, and frequent disruptions by protesters who come from all over the world - all of which stretch the city's resources and are sometimes more trouble than they are worth. Two, the host country, which presides over the conference, is expected to demonstrate leadership in taking steps to combat climate change. This is the reason why countries like the US, China, or Russia, or even Japan, Australia, or Canada, are not keen to host COP. Japan hosted the 1997 event that produced the Kyoto Protocol, but it was also the first country to walk out of it in 2011. Australia, which too withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, has never hosted the conference. India, the third largest emitter, hosted the 2002 COP in New Delhi, much before climate change became a big thing. \</doc>

World leaders and hundreds of companies are gathered at COP 27 , the United Nations climate conference, which runs until November 18, in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. BRK, one of the main sanitation companies in the country, participates in two forums in the most important world event on climate challenges. Original Press Release: Nov. 16 -- BRK issued the following news release: - The Company detailed the first issue of blue debentures in Brazil, which will contribute to preserving water resources World leaders and hundreds of companies are gathered at COP 27 , the United Nations climate conference, which runs until November 18, in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. BRK, one of the main sanitation companies in the country, participates in two forums in the most important world event on climate challenges. This Wednesday, November 16, CEO Teresa Vernaglia led the debate "Blue issues and the potential of the blue economy", and commented on the first issue of debentures of this category in Brazil , recently made by BRK. The operation is also a pioneer both in Latin America and in the sanitation sector in the world. The panel revolved around how the sustainable economy can be an engine for the development of the country and the region, private sector initiatives and practices to promote it, and current challenges. It counted with Tom Eveson, VP of Sustainalytics, Gustavo Montezano, president of BNDES, and the moderation of Gabriella Dorlhia, executive director of ICC Brasil. "It is very important for sanitation to be present at an event that brings essential discussions to global climate issues. BRK has a strong commitment to sustainability and, among our ESG goals, is zero net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2040. Actions like these, combined with blue debentures, seek to generate concrete advances in the environmental agenda of the country. country", says the CEO. On November 14, the executive was part of the panel "Water resilience and climate adaptation: water risk and financial impact, including the value chain", promoted by the Global Compact - Rede Brasil, of which the executive is a spokesperson. The other participants were Andre Ferretti, manager of the Boticrio Group Foundation for Nature Protection, Cristiano Teixeira, general director of Klabin, and David Canasa, CEO of Reservas Votorantim. The mediation was by Cheryl Hicks, senior advisor of the Water Resilience Coalition, who also promoted the panel. Benefits in practice Blue debentures, or blue bonds, are debt papers issued specifically to finance projects with environmental benefits linked to the preservation of water resources. The BRK operation, announced on 11/9, totaled the issuance of R$ 1.95 billion in blue debentures with a maturity of 20 years. The resources will be used for the universalization of water supply and sewage treatment in Macei and surroundings, covering a total of 13 cities in which the company operates. In this way, more than 1.5 million people in the region will benefit. Disclaimer: The Above Content is Auto-Translated [Category: Energy] \</doc>

November 18 -- The UN COP27 in Egypt did not make the necessary progress as last year's COP26 agreement pact to work towards a 1.5C rise in global temperature appears to be failing. "Last year's COP26 agreement pact to work towards a 1.5C rise in global temperature appears to be failing,\~as governments struggle to cope with more immediate concerns, despite Wednesday's G20 pledge.\~The trouble is that governments\~tend to think in four- or five-year increments,\~rather than the longer term," Robert Pritchard, Senior Analyst at GlobalData, said. "The fact that we are able to use technology both to measure changes in climate and to lessen the impact of greenhouse gases is encouraging, and most enlightened corporations are actively pursuing such solutions. However, political leadership is lacking." Despite the disappointing lack of progress at this year's get-together, there remains encouraging signs that enterprises and consumers broadly recognize the climate challenge, and the majority are willing to change their behaviour where they can (and can afford to) to address sustainability challenges. Nonetheless, any ambitions to address long-term climate change will always be subject to short-term political imperatives, despite the broad consensus on securing the future of the planet being the most important issue facing us. The progress made during COP27 is being further slowed by the alarming increase and spread of climate disinformation, worsened by Musk's Twitter takeover. This is diluting the messaging around climate action while undermining any promises made at COP27 , making people continue to lose faith. COP27 than delegation from Africa. Not only is the messaging being lost through climate disinformation, but the debate may be shaped by fossil fuel companies. " COP27 should be an arena to lobby governments on climate action but it also provides a platform to highlight the impact of climate disinformation, and lobby governments to regulate Big Tech on their role. There is no easy way to curb our addiction to fossil fuel but letting fossil fuel companies shape the debate, whilst riding the wave of climate disinformation, seems incredibly counterintuitive," Rachel Jones, Thematic Analyst at GlobalData,\~said. \</doc>

South Africa has called on all Parties to work constructively and in a spirit of compromise to achieve the draft outcomes of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)s Sharm el-Sheikh Conference of Parties ( COP27 ), which frames the climate crisis. It reflects the urgency of the climate crisis and the need to keep the 1.5-degree temperature target alive during what the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) calls the Critical Decade, including by providing a clear programme to advance the mitigation agenda from now to 2030, said the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment on Saturday. The department said the draft correctly frames the climate crisis and its solutions in terms of the sustainable development goals and Just Transitions, leaving no one left behind, and the need for broader financial sector reform to achieve these. The proposal to seek multilateral consensus on making financial flows consistent with pathways towards low emissions and climate resilient development will open new investment opportunities in Africa for clean energy investments that will equally address the continents energy poverty crisis. COP27 is providing critical momentum to reform the Multilateral Development Banks and International Financial Institutions and we expect the shareholders of these institutions to take decisive action to scale-up climate finance in 2023 and make their institutional arrangements fit for purpose, the department said. The draft text further recognizes the urgency of finding a solution for developing countries for loss and damage caused by climate change and agrees to establish new financing arrangements and a mechanism to address this. On Africas priority issue of adaptation, there is agreement amongst Parties to accelerate work on identifying indicators and targets to facilitate support to achieving the goal and assessing collective progress. While South Africa welcomes the incremental progress reflected in the COP27 Presidencys package on finance towards the establishment of the new collective goal in 2025, further urgent action is required to meet developed countries obligations. On balance, the draft text suggests there can be good progress on implementation, and we are confident that we are well placed to call this African COP27 a success, the department said. South Africa has congratulated the Egyptian COP27 Presidency on the release of the draft outcomes text to the UNFCCCs Sharm el-Sheikh COP27 . \</doc>

The 27th Conference of Parties ( COP-27 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change concluded on Sunday, November 20, after the inevitable extension beyond the scheduled closure on Friday. The outcome was underwhelming. The UN Secretary-General had declared at the start of the conference, "We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator." Post the climate summit, we are still hurtling towards the abyss even if the foot is marginally off the accelerator. There has been celebration over the agreement, in principle, to set up a fund for compensating vulnerable countries, which have suffered irreversible damage from climate change. This has been a longstanding demand, particularly of vulnerable African and small island developing states. But the funding source and scale of this financial facility and its operating procedures have been left to a transitional committee which will present its report at COP-28 next year. Having been through such tortuous negotiations in the past, I see the focus on the loss and damage issue as a clever ploy by developed countries to use up all the oxygen at the summit and deflect attention from the really critical issues, including the repeated failure of the developed countries to own up to their historical responsibility for climate change, their refusal to make deep cuts in their own emissions and deliver on commitments for providing adequate finance and technology to enable developing countries to undertake climate action. On this score, the can has been rolled further down the road. The Sharm El-Sheikh Implementation Plan is an advance over Glasgow in its more categoric commitment to pursue "efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees centigrade." It acknowledges that such a goal will require "rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions". Drawing from the latest 6th Assessment Report of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it even quantifies the scale of reduction required by 2030 over the 2019 level- 43 per cent. It fails to mention another finding from the IPCC Report, that global emissions must peak by 2025, barely three years from now. However, the Implementation Plan does not spell out how this ambitious outcome is to be achieved. In an astute move, India urged that the COP27 acknowledge the need for a phasing out of all fossil fuels but that was not accepted. Instead, we have a commitment to "low emission pathways", a "phase down of unabated coal" and to the promotion of renewable energy. There is no advance on the Glasgow commitment. The Implementation Plan closely follows the formulation on the subject included in the G-20 Declaration at Bali, which preceded the climate summit. The document relating to finance adopted at Sharm El-Sheikh acknowledges that the commitment on the part of developed countries to provide $100 billion annually to support climate action by developing countries from 2015 onwards through 2025 has not been delivered on. There is no quantification yet of the additional financial commitment which must be made in the post-2025 period. While there is a rhetorical acknowledgement of the need for "climate justice", this is not matched by practical action. The energy transition away from fossil fuels requires the investment of massive resources. The question has remained the same over the years - who pays? The Implementation Plan in its section on finance highlights that "about US$ 4 trillion per year needs to be invested in renewable energy up until 2030 to be able to reach net zero emissions by 2050. And that, furthermore, a global transformation to a low carbon economy is expected to require an investment of at least US$ 4-6 trillion per year". These are figures for both developed and developing countries and are of an unprecedented scale. For developing countries, to enable them to deliver on their nationally determined contributions, the Implementation Plan estimates a figure of $5.8-5.9 trillion in the pre-2030 period. When even a modest figure of $100 billion has not been delivered on since 2015 what hope is there that in an international environment beset by multiple crises, these financial flows will actually materialise? The Ukraine war and the serious disruptions in energy supply chains have led to a surge in the prices of oil, gas and even coal. There has been backsliding on commitments to shift away from fossil fuels, in particular coal, even among champions of climate change action such as the European Union. Coal-based thermal power is being revived in several countries to deal with acute shortages of oil and gas, though this may be temporary. This points to the complexity of managing the energy transition towards renewables and clean energy. There will be a considerable period when the two energy systems will co-exist and will interact with each other. The transition enhances vulnerabilities and requires efficient and well-run fossil fuel as well as renewable and clean energy systems. The premature retirement of fossil-based energy systems should be avoided even as one accelerates the use of renewable and clean energy. The process must be measured and carefully synchronised. This means that even if resources are available, an accelerated energy transition may not be feasible. The world may have engaged in this transition too little, too late. This demands much greater attention to adaptation than has been the case so far. Where does that leave India? The imperative of energy security behoves India to undertake a strategic shift from its current reliance on fossil fuels to an energy system based on renewable sources of energy and cleaner sources of energy with the most promising being green hydrogen. India depends on imports for 90 per cent of its oil needs and 60 per cent of its natural gas requirements. Even 30 per cent of its coal requirements have to be imported. The sources of supply are in politically-sensitive regions and disruptions can be costly. India has abundant solar energy and recent advances have made green hydrogen a promising source of clean energy. It makes sense for India to engage wholeheartedly in carrying out this energy transition, which will also be a significant contribution to dealing with global climate change. There are also major opportunities for increasing energy security through enhancing energy efficiency. This too will contribute to addressing global climate change. India did well to preserve its equities at COP27 and in supporting the constituency of developing countries. It is well placed to use its forthcoming chairmanship of the G20 and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation to take the lead in tackling climate change through its own example.

The Bahamas joined countries from around the globe at the 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP 27 in Egypt 6 18 November. Member countries discssed opportunities to collaborate on actions towards achieving the worlds collective climate goals under the Paris Agreement and the Convention. This year, as part of the United Nations Forum The partnership initiative facilitates the training of BahamaHost certified transportation providers in the mangrove life cycle and their purposes, as well as mangrove replenishment and environmental stewardship for their eventual designation as Stewards of The Environment (SOTEs). Additional capacity building in the use of digital technology will create a unique destination tour experience for visitors interested in nature-based experiences or fostering environmental protections and volunteerism during their travels. The use of digital technology in booking these tours is intended to ease the burden of conducting business in a digital space for stakeholders on the islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama. One of the Ministrys signature Governance initiatives, Destination Stewardship, involves the partnership formed between the Ministry of Tourism, Investments Aviation and the Global Sustainable Tourism Council to bringsustainable tourism standards and leadership in destination management to the community level within the Family Islands, with more inclusive approaches to tourism governance through the formation of destination stewardship councils (DSCs) as legal entities. Once established, Councils undergo capacity building in sustainability standards, visitor expectations in tourism product and service delivery and good governance in destination management and competitiveness. They also undertake projects in areas such as culture and heritage preservation, environmental/waste management and safety and security based on their unique attributes and tourism priorities. The first cohort of five DSCs, located on the islands of Andros, Eleuthera, Harbour Island and Exuma, completed legal formation in 2020 and some have deployed branding strategies which have already attracted international partnerships. This year, another five (5) islands, namely Grand Bahama, Cat Island, Long Island, Abaco and Bimini, are engaging in sustainability training toward Council formation. It is the goal of the Ministry to facilitate destination stewardship council development on each of the 16 islands promoted by the Ministry of Tourism. Councils are exposed to knowledge products and capacity building webinars in Tourism Planning Management and Sample Case Studies in International Tourism Sustainability, Formation of Legal Entities in The Bahamas, Sustainable Waste Management for Destinations, Preserving Local Heritage, and Handicrafts Grant Writing, International Community-Based Tourism Networks (Planeterra) and International Best Practices in Destination Stewardship. In the New Year, Councils will participate in local programming in Community Tourism and regional programming to improve their knowledge of Disaster Risk Management policies and practices through the Multi-Hazard Risk Management training via the Caribbean Tourism Organizations online training platform to strengthen community crisis preparedness and emergency response capacities. The Ministry has also spearheaded an Aluminium Recycling Pilot Project within its headquarters with Cans for Kids and Wastenot Bahamas which seek to change attitudes and influence behaviours towards recycling and increase awareness of the hazards of waste to human health and the environment. Educational campaigns were launched to sensitize BMOTIA staff and enlighten their households on the long-term benefits of recycling to reduce solid waste in landfills. Collections of thirty cents for each pound of aluminium recycled is returned to the community to support essential childrens programmes. The Programme has expanded to include Festivals and local events in New Providence with future for replication in the Family Islands. \</doc>

The partners of the Systematic Observations Financing Facility (SOFF) met at a high-level event at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 to mobilize additional funding to ensure that the most vulnerable countries have the means to acquire and exchange the essential weather and climate data that underpins all adaptation efforts. SOFF focuses on supporting Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to close the large gaps in basic weather and climate data which are essential to forecasts, build climate resilience and to ensure effective implementation of the new Action Plan to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected by early warnings in the next five years. We must invest equally in adaptation and resilience. That includes the information that allows us to anticipate storms, heatwaves, floods and droughts, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the World Leaders Summit at COP27 in reference to the Early Warnings for All Action Plan. Early warning systems save lives and protect livelihoods. We must work to scale up SOFF in support of the Secretary-Generals Early Warning Systems for All Initiative as an urgent priority. stated Selwin Hart, the United Nations Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Climate Action and Just Transition. SOFF provides long-term technical and grant-based financial assistance to enable countries to acquire and internationally exchange basic weather and climate data. It was established at COP26 in 2021 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) as a United Nations Multi Partner Trust Fund (UNMPTF). One year later, SOFF is fully operational. Today, less than 10% of required basic weather and climate observations are available from Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas told the SOFF high-level event at COP27 . SOFF is vital to fast-track implementation of the internationally agreed Global Basic Observing Network GBON). Better global forecasts enable better local forecasts, applications and services that, in turn, can be used to prepare for extreme events and plan for specific environmental conditions and this ultimately benefits everybody explained Florence Rabier, Director-General of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Target to support 100 countries Mozambiques Minister of Transport and Communication, Mateus Magala, welcomed the start of SOFF support in these countries and encouraged funders and implementing partners to rapidly move ahead with SOFF implementation in all SIDS and LDCs. SOFF and its funding partners are rapidly stepping up their efforts Eight initial partners have already made a financial contribution to the SOFF UN Fund: Austria, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, the United States and the Nordic Development Fund that serves as a co-chair of the SOFF Steering Committee. And support is growing at COP27 . Earlier this week, Spanish President Pedro Sanchez announced a financial contribution from his country, and Anne Beathe Tvinnereim, Minister of International Development declared that Norway will substantially increase its contribution. Monica Medina, United States Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs emphasized that strengthening and sustaining climate data is critical if we want to provide high-quality climate information and early warnings at the local level where adaptation takes place. The United States is proud to support the Systematic Observations Financing Facility in filling observation gaps around the world. Speaking at the event, Inger Andersen, UNEP Executive Director thanked all partners for their support thus far and urged other potential funders to follow with concrete commitments: If we back SOFF, we can save lives, protect assets and property and foster economic growth in the countries suffering most from climate change. This is solidarity and climate justice in action. Weather data are economic data Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, keynote speaker at the event, said In the new climate economy, weather data are an important component of economic data and collecting and sharing this information is absolutely vital. Better data will improve climate models and climate risk assessments, and it will mean better targeting for critical adaptation investments. These data are also critical for the private sector. The CEO of the Africa Risk Capacity, Lesley Ndlovu, joined the event to emphasize the urgent need to fill these data gaps to ensure the effectiveness of disaster risk management and financing in Africa. In recognition of the foundational value of this data for more reliable and cost-effective responses to climate shocks and disasters, and sustainable resilience-building, SOFF formally joined the InsuResilience Global Partnership. Sigrid Kaag, Minister of Finance of the Netherlands and co-chair of the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action highlighted the importance of weather and climate data for effective economic decision-making. The importance of improving basic weather and climate observations will be on the agenda for the Coalitions event on 10 November, co-hosted with WMO. \</doc>

Rishi Sunak confirmed on Wednesday that he will attend the Cop27 climate change conference next week in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh after all after earlier saying he wanted to stay at home and focus on the financial statement due to be made on November 17. Sunak tweeted: "There is no long-term prosperity without action on climate change. There is no energy security without investing in renewables. "That is why I will attend Cop27 next week: to deliver on Glasgow's legacy of building a secure and sustainable future." The Prime Minister's official spokeswoman explained: "He has always recognised the importance of this summit and indeed on tackling climate change more generally. We wanted to make sure we were making good progress on the Government's domestic agenda and the Autumn Statement in particular. "Following discussions with the Chancellor (Jeremy Hunt) this week he has now agreed to attend. "The Prime Minister feels there is sufficient space to make this trip." It was a message Rishi repeated when he and Keir Starmer clashed in the Commons during Prime Minister's Questions. According to the BBC, the contest was a draw: "It was Rishi Sunak's second Prime Minister's Questions and the result was the same as his first outing against Keir Starmer as the pair exchanged jabs but failed to deliver a knockout blow." The Prime Minister's change of heart was welcomed by Alok Sharma, the Cop26 president, who said he was "delighted" Rishi was attending Cop27 - "completely agree with his comment that 'there is no long-term prosperity without action on climate change'." Boris Johnson has announced he will be attending Cop27 as a guest of the Egyptian government. But King Charles will not go. Labour's shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband attacked the Prime Minister: "The Prime Minister has been shamed into going to Cop27 by the torrent of disbelief that he would fail to turn up. He is going to avoid embarrassment, not to provide leadership." In the bigger scheme of things, although Cop27 is important what will shape Rishi's premiership is the autumn statement on November 17, which is aimed at calming the market after the chaos caused by the unfunded tax cuts in the mini-budget that was introduced by Liz Truss and her chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng. Labour is worried that although it is ahead of the Tories in the polls, Rishi has very quickly gone past Starmer at a personal level. Hence, Labour is now trying to destabilise Rishi on a number of fronts - his controversial appointment of Suella Braverman as home secretary, and the growing crisis caused by thousands of migrants crossing the channel in small boats and arriving on the shores of Kent. Labour focused not on the migrant numbers but on how they were being housed in very poor conditions at a "processing centre" in Manston, Kent. \</doc>

Lucknow, Oct. 20 -- To showcase the efforts of Uttar Pradesh government at the international level, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India has invited UP to host side event and to be part of India Pavilion at Sharm El-Sheikh CoP 27 between November 6 to November 18. The theme for India Pavilion at COP 27 is 'LiFE- Lifestyle for Environment'. The side event of the state government will focus on the sub theme 'Road to Resilience 2030: Innovative Approaches for Localising Climate Action at the District and Village Level'. The side event will address the overall theme of LiFE as It covers low carbon, climate adaptive, collaborative planning, and innovative financial mechanism at grassroot level to achieve global ambition while adopting a citizen centric approach. The side event will be hosted by the Government of UP in partnership with GIZ India (under CAFRI-MoEFCC project). Climate change is threatening achievements of the government's development objective and Sustainable Development Goals at large. While climate change is a global concern, its impacts are felt more at the local level and requires local solutions catering to the needs of local communities by involving local governance institutions. Localising climate actions further needs technology, finance and capacity for adaptation and mitigation. Panchayati Raj Institutions are central to localised planning and this makes them an important stakeholder for localized planning on climate change, disaster risks and SDGs. With this spirit, ahead of the Sharm El- Sheikh COP27 , UP government is successfully responding to the challenges of climate change via multi-stakeholder engagement, building upon on the response to these changes by process of integration, adaptation, collaboration, and mitigation at local levels with the support of researchers, scientists, policymakers and practitioners from the state, country and abroad. The partnerships and discussions initiated by the UP government have already led to the development of concrete interventions. For instance, based on the discussion on market mechanisms for climate action during the conclave, the state government has initiated the process for carbon financing of the agroforestry sector. With an objective of providing benefits to agroforestry farmers through a voluntary carbon market mechanism. Due to its high reliance on climate sensitive sectors such as agriculture, water, and forestry for resources and livelihoods, UP faces an urgent need for adapting to the risks posed by climate change. Additional Chief Secretary, Environment and Climate Change Manoj Singh said, "The state has been making significant efforts over the years to bring adaptation issues to the forefront. As part of its State Action Plan on Climate Change, UP has done a comprehensive assessment on climate risk vulnerability and has prepared a climate vulnerability map of the State." He said, "The UP government is taking climate action to the grassroot level. Informed by this vulnerability assessment, the state has now embarked on mainstreaming climate adaptation at the local planning level. In line with the 73rd Constitutional Amendment, Panchayati Raj Institutions and the Gram Panchayats represent the lowest level of the decentralized governance system." Secretary, Environment and Climate Change, Ashish Tiwari said they already have a mandate for the development of Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDP). "Communities are at the forefront of getting impacted by the changing climate. At the same time, effective community institutions are the first responders to such impacts. Therefore, it is important that their capacities are strengthened. Locally available resources like ecosystem services, schemes and programmes, knowledge and skills are important in such resilient planning," he said. Tiwari said the state government has initiated the process for development of risk informed and climate & disaster resilient gram panchayat development plans. "Further, the government has also developed capacity building and training modules to strengthen capacities of vulnerable target groups and their intermediaries (community-based and self-help groups, panchayats, Farmer Producer Organisations (FPO) and farmers associations cooperatives. Strengthening of such capacities will support mainstreaming of climate action in developmental plans by linking local adaptation needs to agencies and programs through strengthened intermediary organisations," he said. On World Environment Day in June, the State Government of Uttar Pradesh hosted the Conference of Panchayats (CoP). This event in Lucknow kickstarted a network of panchayats to deliberate on approaches and opportunities to empower panchayats for climate action. More than 40,000-gram panchayats participated at the CoP, as well as public-private actors. The objective of the Conference of Panchayats 2022 was to deliberate on strategies that will strengthen capacities of local institutions and actors on emerging climate risks and uncertainties, develop evidence-based local solutions, and implement climate initiatives over the long-term. This supports the guiding principles of the SAPCC and the decentralised government system in India. UNI AB SY GNK Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from United News of India.

Times at CLIMATE MEET Sharm el-Sheikh: The draft decision text of the 27th session of the UN climate talks ( COP27 ), released on Saturday, carried in the mitigation clause the two key points made by India, which had not been included in the initial draft released on Friday. The first point is  phase down of unabated coal power, while the second one is about the conditionality of fossil fuel subsidies which relates to  providing targeted support to the poorest and most vulnerable . The initial draft used  phase out (instead of phase down) for coal and missed the targeted support point, resulting in facing objections from India. India had got both these points inserted in the Glasgow Climate Pact (COP26) last year. These two will now continue to be in the final decision text of the COP27 . The relevant clause on the mitigation (para 28 of the final draft decision) now calls upon countries  to accelerate the development, deployment and dissemination of technologies, and the adoption of policies, to transition towards low-emission energy systems, including by rapidly scaling up the deployment of clean power generation and energy efficiency measures, including accelerating efforts towards the phase down of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, while providing targeted support to the poorest and most vulnerable in line with national circumstances and recognizing the need for support towards a just transition. Reference to India's stand on phasing down all fossil fuels, however, continues to be missing in the draft decision. The draft decision text will now be discussed in the plenary for final decision (outcome of the COP27 ) with consensus, involving 195 countries. The final outcome of the COP27 is expected late on Saturday night or early Sunday morning. \</doc>

India, Nov. 20 -- Sharm El-Sheikh has established a loss and damage fund; but there is no guarantee that the fund that takes shape eventually will even remotely resemble what was originally demanded The world's developing countries achieved a political win at the 27th Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on Novemer 20, 2022 at Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. They did this by securing the establishment of a fund "for responding to loss and damage whose mandate includes a focus on addressing loss and damage". "It is a historical day in climate change negotiations when it has been acknowledged after 30 years that increasing disasters causing loss and damage (both economic and non-economic) are affecting communities and countries which are least responsible for it. And these are caused due to historical cumulative emissions," Kunal Satyarthi, joint secretary of the National Disaster Management Authority and India's negotiator for loss and damage at COP 27 told Down to Earth . "The efforts have begun by creating a funding arrangement to address such loss and damage." The decision adopted at the closing plenary in the early hours on November 20 at Sharm El-Sheikh covered the following key elements:  Acknowledges that existing funding arrangements fall short of responding to current and future impacts of climate change.  Establishes new funding arrangements for responding to loss and damage, including with a focus on addressing loss and damage - and this includes the establishment of a new fund.  Focuses language on assisting developing countries that are "particularly vulnerable" to the adverse effects of climate change.  Talks about including funding arrangements both "under and outside the Convention and the Paris Agreement". The latter would include initiatives like the Global Climate Risk Shield which are outside the governance of the UNFCCC.  Establishes a transitional committee to help with the operationalisation of the new funding arrangements, which will be "chaired by two co-chairs, one from a developed country Party and one from a developing country Party".  Talks about "identifying and expanding sources of funding" which will be "from a wide variety of sources, including innovative sources".  Decides that the next Glasgow Dialogue will "focus on the operationalization of the new funding arrangements". How it happened The fund was a clear demand by the biggest negotiating bloc within UNFCCC climate negotiations - the G77 and China. The bloc, representing about 80 per cent of the world's population, precipitated 30 years' worth of struggles to secure payments for loss and damage by demanding that a facility be established at COP26 in Glasgow. The effort was unsuccessful last year. However, the pressure escalated in the following months, resulting in the establishment of a formal agenda item for loss and damage funding arrangements at COP27 . Negotiations on the agenda item in Egypt unveiled many points of divergence between the recipient (developing countries) and donor groups (developed countries). Late into the hours of November 19, when observers awaited the conclusion of the Heads of Delegation consultations with the COP27 Presidency, rumours leaked out of negotiation rooms that the United States (US), European Union (EU), Switzerland and the United Kingdom (UK) were walking away from a new fund owing to concerns about the phrasing put forth in the draft decision. Other reports suggested that their concerns were simply procedural and resolvable, and not related to the substance of the text. One source said they did not want the term "especially those that are particularly vulnerable", preferring to use the term " particularly vulnerable " instead from the UNFCCC. Already, on the morning of November 19, EU Chief Frans Timmerman had threatened to "walk out" of the talks if their demand for tougher emission cuts for all was not met in exchange for a loss and damage fund. "We cannot accept that 1.5 degrees Celsius dies here and today," he said. However, at the Closing Plenary which commenced at around 4 am on the morning of November 20, no such theatrics ensued, and the decision was adopted by the COP and CMA seemingly seamlessly. The road ahead While the political commitment to establish the fund is crucial, and must be considered a significant win, many unknowns remain. These will ultimately determine whether communities on the ground receive the support they need. Some of them are as follows:  It is not clear whether the new fund will be housed within the UNFCCC or outside of it - the G77 demands the former.  The definition of "particularly vulnerable" is a bone of contention, with experts commenting that such distinctions only serve to sow divisions among developing countries, and that the fund should be open to all developing countries.  Details on who will pay into the fund are scant. The adopted decision omits the reference to the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities enshrined within the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement, as well as reference to historical cumulative emissions. This makes it tricky for payment obligations to be placed on developed historically polluting countries in accordance with the polluter-pays-principle as originally envisioned. Already, groups like the EU spoke about broadening the donor base, alluding to large emitters like China. Many island nations have also called for China and India to pay into any future loss and damage fund, including Antigua and Barbuda, Mauritius, and Jamaica. The current achievement is monumental. Getting steadfast blockers of climate reparations such as the US to pass the decision would have involved deft tactical maneuvering and unwavering solidarity on the part of the G77 and its allies. And developed countries' past resistance should inform the process of handling battles concerning the above grey areas, which will commence in the coming months. There is no guarantee that the structure and modalities of the fund that take shape will even remotely resemble what the G77 originally demanded. Risks include efforts to narrow down the recipient pool, bring in unaccountable sources of financing like the private sector, or waste time on petty fights concerning the donor base. For now, however, those who have tirelessly worked to achieve the establishment of this fund must be allowed to derive joy from their win. "We established the first-ever dedicated fund for loss and damage, that has been so long in the making. And the "implementation COP" held in Africa is where the fund is finally established," said COP27 President Sameh Shoukry victoriously at the Closing Plenary this morning.

India, Nov. 17 -- European Union softens stance on loss and damage facility, albeit with a caveat Countries most vulnerable to climate change, some of which saw its devastating impacts this year, asked their developed counterparts November 17, 2022 to go beyond political will and show political action on a loss and damage finance facility. This happened even as some developed countries softened their stand on the issue with some conditions. Ministers representing blocs such as G77 plus China, Association of Small Island States (AOSIS), Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and the Independent Association of Latin American and Caribbean Countries (AILAC) made powerful statements at a press conference on the urgent need for the establishment of a loss and damage finance facility at COP27 . COP 27 and happy that loss and damage made it to the agenda. This was a success. Now all countries need to come together and find common ground," Sherry Rehman, minister for climate change, Pakistan, who represented G77 and China, said. She added that 134 countries had already formed a common ground on this. They wanted to take this agenda item forward and were hoping at least for a committee on the loss and damage finance facility. G77 plus China has put forth a proposal on the establishment of a loss and damage finance facility. Rehman reiterated several times that climate change was now a justice issue and that justice delayed is justice denied. At the core of the COP process should be people. And at the core of that should be vulnerable communities. "Why that matters is that the entire COP system is based on common but differentiated responsibilities. This is the central bargain and for this bargain not to be broken, we have to at least have a political announcement. "Later, the details along with the mosaic of options for loss and damage funding suggested by the developed countries can be discussed and worked out. Also, what needs to be taken care of is if the established facility can be easily navigated by vulnerable countries," she added. "The way forward would be a powerful message from this COP. This is crucial for not just our future but also salvaging what is left right now. Our recommendation is to timeline everything. There should be an action plan for operationalising the loss and damage finance facility," Rehman concluded. "At this stage we know the issues and expectations on the loss and damage finance facility. Our countries are most vulnerable and are paying a heavy price. Here, in Sharm El-Sheikh, the decision should be made on the establishment of the facility. "Our populations are expecting an answer to address their losses that they are unjustly facing. These would become worse as greenhouse gases rise further. The decision that can be taken today should not be pushed to eternity. Time to act is here and now," Alioune Ndoye, minister from Senegal representing the LDCs, said. "There is not enough discussion on the rights of young people and also of humans not born yet. To ensure their rights to planet Earth, we have to move towards a decision on a loss and damage fund. Anything less is a betrayal of the people who are on the forefront of climate change impacts and fighting for humanity," Molwyn Joseph, minister from Antigua and Barbuda, representing the AOSIS, said. "I have had the opportunity to speak to leaders and there seems to be political commitment. But this political commitment has not translated into political action to establish the facility. Why should I go to the UN for donations? That cannot be an expectation from a small island state," he added. On the other hand, the European Union seems to have somewhat softened its stand on a loss and damage finance facility albeit with a caveat that some developing countries, by which it perhaps means China, should also pay for loss and damage finance. At a press conference, Frans Timmermans, the executive vice president of the European Commission, said: "The EU has a problem with the G77 plus China proposal. The proposal started to count emissions in 1992 but countries that were developing in 1992 are now top economic performers and those countries should also contribute to a loss and damage funding." He added that the world of today "is far more complex than just being divided between developed and developing countries." The funding should be targeted. Those countries, which are most vulnerable to climate change such as the small island states, should get the funding first and as soon as they need it, according to Timmermans. He further wanted a mosaic of funding options available for funding loss and damage, among which the recently launched Global Shield initiative could be one. "What you can do with existing instruments can be done immediately. Vulnerable countries don't have the time. They need money right now," he added.

While talking about barriers, Bhupender Yadav said that for developing countries, accelerated low-carbon development is the route to ambition. This is a continuous process Access to climate finance and technology in developing nations is a must-have to protect the entire world, India said at the United Nations climate summit in Egypt on Monday. Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Bhupender Yadav intervened at the ministerial high-level roundtable on pre-2030 ambition at COP 27 . "Developed countries must take the lead - after all the bulk of both finance and technology transfer is available with them," the minister said. Yadav added that the Convention and the Paris Agreement both recognise this, but we have not had adequate action. Second, increasing ambition requires public action. Leaving it to markets alone will not help. Markets do not function well in normal times, but either do not function or function very inequitably in moments of crisis. "We see this with the energy crisis in developed countries. For developing countries, public action includes public sources of climate finance and technology. These are essential," he said. He also said that the right sectors must be identified for ambition. To target small farmers for mitigation in the name of ambition would be a serious mistake. "As in India, if in developing countries, if we target domestic and public lighting, and increasing use of clean fuel to replace biomass, we can achieve some significant gains in low-carbon development," the minister said. While talking about barriers, Yadav said that for developing countries, accelerated low-carbon development is the route to ambition. This is a continuous process. "This takes time, human and financial resources and sustained economic growth. So, it is not simply barriers but all three conditions have to be present consistently for low-carbon development to be achieved," he added Just transition in developing countries is simply about enabling low-carbon development. He said that it cannot be about an early start to decarbonization in any sector, though decarbonizing various sectors as and when feasible will arise sometime in the future. "This will be detrimental to both the overriding priority of achieving the SDG goals by 2030 and subsequent development," as per the minister. \</doc>

The African Union (AU) welcomed the Netherlands contribution of EUR 110 million in support of the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP) ahead of the COP27 Leaders Event on Accelerating Adaptation in Africa. The Prime Minister of Netherlands Mark Rutte announced the financial commitment during a high-level meeting with Senegals President Macky Sall who is also the Chairperson of the African Union, Patrick Verkooijen, CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation, and the President of the African Development Bank Group Dr Akinwumi A. Adesina. President Sall underlined the importance of action over words as world leaders meet this week to discuss the global response to the climate emergency, highlighting that Africa is ground zero for the global climate breakdown. Nobody benefits if Africa fails to tackle it. The AAAP is Africas response to the climate crisis to leverage investments in adaptation and resilience not just to protect ourselves from the threat of climate change, but to drive a green economic growth agenda for prosperity. Prime Minister Rutte said We have to face reality: climate change is already having lasting effects. Climate resilience must be our motto, climate adaptation our common endeavour. Adapting to climate change is in the DNA of the Netherlands and it is vital that we work with our partners in Africa to ensure investments flow through the bold and innovative roadmap that AAAP delivers for climate-proofing cities, farms, and infrastructure, to protect livelihoods and to ensure economic continuity. AAAP was developed by African Development Bank and the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) to mobilize $25 billion by 2025 to implement, scale and accelerate climate adaptation across the African continent. This ambition is delivered through the AAAP Upstream Financing Facility managed by the Global Center on Adaptation and the African Development Banks climate action window which is developed in the context of the 16th replenishment of the African Development Fund, the Banks concessional arm that supports the continents low-income countries. AAAP works across four bold interconnected pillars to achieve transformational results: Climate-Smart Digital Technologies for Agriculture and Food Security African Infrastructure Resilience Accelerator Youth Empowerment for Entrepreneurship and Job Creation in Climate Adaptation and Resilience and Innovative Financial Initiatives for Africa. AAAP has already guided over $3.5 billion of upstream investments in 19 countries with every dollar spent influencing $100 downstream. Professor Patrick Verkooijen, CEO of Global Center on Adaptation welcomed the financial contribution from the Netherlands, thanking Prime Minister Rutte and President Sall for their leadership on climate adaptation in Africa to mobilize the global community to honor their commitment of doubling global climate finance at COP27 : AAAPs catalytic interventions have already rapidly delivered impact at scale by mainstreaming adaptation into projects worth over $3.5 billion since 2021. The Netherlands support of EUR10 million for the AAAP Upstream Financing Facility will influence investments in adaptation worth a further EUR 1 billion for Africa. This scale of impact is vital as Africa indeed the world is confronting multiple global shocks that are reverberating through our economies. AAAP gives impetus to the critical actions and global finance needed to address the climate and food crisis today, and to build a more resilient continent. Speaking at the high-level meeting, the President of the African Development Bank Group, Dr Adesina said: The EUR 100 million financial support from the Netherlands towards the AAAP Climate Action Window of the African Development Fund is a major impetus for our efforts to bolster support for low-income countries of Africa that are most vulnerable to climate change. It is a great start as we accelerate efforts to mobilize more climate adaptation financing for Africa through the AAAP. This is a great outcome right here at COP 27 the Africa COP -- with a concrete action from Netherlands on adaptation finance for Africa. We look forward to other countries stepping up for climate adaptation in Africa as we approach the 16th replenishment of the African Development Fund in December. Adesina said. \</doc>

New Delhi, Nov. 6 -- India will push for clarifications on climate finance, one of the contentious issues between developed and developing countries, as leaders and officials from 200 nations gather on Sunday for the UN Climate Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt, coming together after a year in which war and economic turmoil is feared to have weakened the climate agenda, even though the crisis continued to trigger devastation worldwide. On the agenda for the November 6-18 summit in the resort town of Sharm El Sheikh will be discussions on implementation of various pledges on climate change mitigation and finance, most of which have not been put into action. It is also expected to discuss critical and highly debated issues like loss and damage and adaptation as part of the formal agenda. Officials in India have said they resist attempts to classify loans as climate finance. In 2009 at COP15, developed countries pledged to $100bn dollars in climate financing for developing nations starting 2020. COP27 as India doesn't recognise loans to be climate finance as they push poor and developing countries further into debt. First up on Sunday will be the formal adoption of agenda for the next two weeks. During a press briefing on Friday, ambassador Wael Aboulmagd, special advisor to COP27 president-designate Sameh Shoukry, said main issues are likely to be mitigation work programme; global goal on adaptation; loss and damage and climate finance.

Following intense debate at the recent UN Climate Change Conference in Egypt, BNPP AM evaluates the outcome and initiatives for investors to bear in mind. COP27 concluded with a breakthrough agreement to establish a USD 350 million 'loss and damage' fund to help those developing countries most vulnerable to natural disasters mitigate the long-term adverse effects of climate change. 27 new pledges worth more than USD 230 million were made regarding the Adaptation Fund, a separate fund to help vulnerable communities in developing countries adapt to climate change. Key Highlights:  COP27  Indonesia signed a USD 20 billion agreement with developed countries and major international lenders to help increase its use of renewable energy.  Disappointingly, there was no broad push to reduce emissions more quickly despite commitments announced during the conference, most notably the EU's shift from a 55% reduction target to 57%. Original Press Release: Nov. 28 -- BNP Paribas Asset Management issued the following news release: Following intense debate at the recent UN Climate Change Conference in Egypt, BNPP AM evaluates the outcome and initiatives for investors to bear in mind.

August 01 -- Africa deserves the highest priority attention at the United Nations climate conference, COP 27 to be held in November this year, \~panel members discussing the African Development Bank's African Economic Outlook 2022 in an event hosted by the Atlantic Council, said on Wednesday. A team from the \~African Development Bank Group, led by Acting Chief Economist and Vice President Kevin Urama, is in Washington D.C. to present the African Economic Outlook 2022, a flagship publication of the Bank, to international thought leaders and other targeted bodies. Under the theme, Supporting Climate Resilience and a Just Energy Transition in Africa, this year's report highlights climate change as a growing threat to lives and livelihoods in Africa.\~ In a video message during one of the sessions, president and Chief Executive Officer of\~ Bezos Earth Fund, Andrew Steer, urged African and world leaders to think bolder and work more creatively together as they prepare for COP 27 , which will take place in Egypt. Steer, a former World Bank Special Envoy for Climate Change believes that COP 27 gives the world an incredible opportunity to think big about Africa. "We need to make it Africa's COP. So, what the African Development Bank and the Atlantic Council are trying to do to raise awareness is exceedingly important." He described the 2022 African Economic Outlook as £n excellent report.' "It lays out beautifully this sobering time for Africa in particular, but actually for the whole world - a slowing world economy, the perfect storm of rising food prices and \~energy prices,\~ interest rates, and shocking increases in the impact of climate change and green vulnerability at a time that international resources are not what they need to be." In a presentation on the report, Acting Chief Economist Urama called for policy coordination and a more holistic approach to tackling climate change. "We have been losing 5% to 15% of GDP per capita growth in Africa because of climate change, and that is in addition to other issues that climate change is driving on the continent," Urama said. "Amid these difficulties lie opportunities for innovation. Let's think big, act big, and save the planet." "As we prepare for COP 27 , honoring the 2009 $100 billion yearly climate finance commitment that high-income countries promised to developing countries will help to restore confidence that we are serious about climate change, even though it is not enough." Deputy Assistant Administrator for Africa at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID),\~ Tyler Beckelman, said the African Economic Outlook "cogently and convincingly captures the very real and urgent challenges to realizing a just energy transition in Africa." "Make no mistake- the crisis is already here," Beckelman cautioned. "Four failed rainy seasons in the Horn of Africa- with a fifth likely to occur this summer- is a direct result of a warming climate, and sadly, it may become the norm." He said the United States would ensure that its African partners have the ability and resources to develop the foundation for a sustainable and low-carbon economy that provides ample energy for growth. He added: "While the challenges are enormous, we see plenty of reasons to be optimistic. Sustained investments in adaptation and mitigation, through renewable energy and climate-smart land use practices, will help provide a pathway for African countries to develop innovative ways, building a more just and equitable future for people across the continent." Senior Director of the Atlantic Council,\~ Africa Centre, Rama Yade, observed that it has become more important to look at Africa and climate change. The \~event featured a panel discussion on the report, comprising Anthony Simpasa, Acting Manager of the African Development Bank's Macroeconomic Policy, Debt Sustainability and Forecasting Division; Ayaan Adam, Senior Director and CEO of AFC Capital Partners at the Africa Finance Corporation; Jeffrey Krilla, Vice President for Global Public Policy and Government Affairs, Kosmos Energy; and Queen Quinn, Founding Partner at Kupanda Capital. The African Economic Outlook report 2022 provides evidence-based policy options for driving inclusive growth by building climate resilience and a just energy transition in Africa. The event was an opportunity to appraise policy stakeholders in Washington DC on the key findings of the report as well as discuss priorities and actionable recommendations in the preparation and run-up to COP27 . \</doc>

India, Nov. 9 -- The Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh is witnessing high profile climate discussions among 120 world leaders as part of the 27th Conference of Parties (COP) hosted by Egypt. The deliberations starting on 6th of November will continue over the next two weeks and endeavour to hammer out a consensus on how to rein in the runaway rise in global temperatures. However, since the very first COP meeting held in Berlin in 1995 to till date these climate meetings have come to signify more of discussions than actual action directed towards mitigating climate change. As a result there is a 50:50 chance of the annual average global temperature temporarily reaching 1.5 degC above the pre-industrial levels for at least one of the next five years, according to a new climate update issued by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). The 1.5degC figure is not some random statistic. It is rather an indicator of the point at which climate impacts will become increasingly harmful for people and the entire planet. The latest State of the Global Climate Report 2022 released by WMO as a backdrop to the COP27 meeting, ominously reflects this unfolding spectre. The call for credible action has assumed startling forms this year with ultra-aggressive climate activists adopting daring methods to draw global attention towards climate action. From throwing soup on Vincent Van Gogh paintings to blocking private jets from taking off at the Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, the Greenpeace and Extinction Rebellion members have upped the publicity ante this year. This year's COP conclave cannot get away with mere deliberations and paper pushing but will have to go beyond spoken words and tread on delicate issues such as compensating vulnerable and poor countries that are exposed to the vagaries of climate change. The inclusion of compensation is a welcome departure. Action on last year's pledges made at the Glasgow COP such as drastically dial down thermal power generation, making systematic protocols to stop deforestation by 2030 and to adopt implement strategies to cut methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030 must be seen. An ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has meant turbulent times for energy prices and this coupled with bitter tensions between US and China, the world's largest emitters, mean progress at COP27 could be agonisingly slow. Given this reality, the COP27 could try and focus on evolving an innovative financing program and mechanism to direct much-needed resources to the developing world. Besides, the wealthy nations could take this opportunity to create much needed financing mechanisms for highly vulnerable nations such as Africa which are staring at frequent climate disasters. India on its part must aim for clear takeaways from COP27 . This must include tangible and proven climate finance models, high-end technology transfers and capacity building initiatives. If the Indian government succeeds in achieving this, it will help reduce carbon emissions besides minimising the impact felt from the climate crisis in India. India must also realise that the wealthy nations have extracted their economic progress by compromising the environment and now the consequences of the same are set to be reaped by the developing nations.

The 'city of peace', Sharm el-sheikh became the city of ray of hope yesterday with a new dawn for climate justice and climate equity for the world. The world has waited too long for the consensus on the climate compensation fund and after number of intense negotiations and discussions, the COP27 (27th Conference of Parties) at the red sea resort town in Egypt resulted in a historic agreement being sealed by the creation of a loss and damage fund (L&D) on Sunday. A mission thirty years in making, being blocked for long by the rich or the developed countries was finally and successfully accomplished at the COP27 in Egypt. The concept of 'environmental compensation' which became the talking point in Egypt negotiations is already a very established mechanism in many countries across the world. Infact in India way back in 1996 in the historic judgment of Indian Council of Enviro-Legal Action v. Union of India [(1996) 3 SCC 212]. The Apex Court for the first time applied and defined the 'Polluter Pays Principle' where the polluter is absolutely liable to compensate for the harm/pollution caused to the environment. According to this principle, the polluter has to not only compensate the victims of pollution but also compensate for the restoration of environmental degradation caused. Thereafter, the concept of climate compensation was further defined and affirmed in the judgment of Vellore Citizens' Welfare Forum vs. Union of India [(1996) 5 SCC 647], that the polluter pays principle and the precautionary principle forms an intrinsic part of the environment laws of India. As an amplification of this very concept of climate compensation, in a first, at the global level, the Loss and damage fund is being created as a down payment for the future as a dedicated fund to help developing countries, particularly those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change to deal with climate related losses and damages. Based upon the concept of Common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR), a fundamental principle which was agreed upon years ago even in 2015 Paris Agreement that rich nations must bear a larger burden of tackling climate change since they emitted more green-house gases over the decades, the result of which has to be suffered by the developing or under-developed countries. Infact, the Sunday Egypt declaration for climate justice is a huge achievement as United States and many other countries were fundamentally against compensating vulnerable countries on account of higher emissions by developed nations. In an attempt to run away from their historic responsibility of irretrievable damage to the environment, the developed countries at the COP27 , were even pushing to include high income countries and emerging economies like China and India and wanted to narrow the beneficiaries to only most vulnerable such as island nations and under-developed countries. This year's COP resulted in deep dwelling upon the differentiation between developing and developed countries as the USA and EU kept pushing to China being a contributor to any fund being created as the largest current emitter in the world and second-largest historical emitter of green-house gases. A transitional committee constituting 23 members, 10 from developed and 13 from developing countries will now decide upon the modalities and answer questions about how payouts will be made under the fund and its sources, which will be further considered at the COP28 to be held in November 2023 at the UAE. Further, guided by the pragmatic suggestions from India, the COP27 even agreed to transition out all fossil fuels and not just coal which was lacking in the earlier COP26. This was supported by nearly 80 countries including the US and EU but faced opposition from the inclusion of oil and gas from a few developed countries The agreement however fell short and did not include a wider target on all fossil fuels, as proposed by India and several other nations. The COP27 with the Tagline - Together for implementation was initially meant to focus on how commitments would translate into reality but in vain. And since many are considering the COP27 and calling it £ missed opportunity' from India's perspective, the victories included the cop27 's endorsement of the sustainable lifestyle mission and a clause regarding energy transitions, which did not single out particular fossil fuels. As an Indian it is a proud moment that as a fifth largest economy India is voluntarily marching towards drastically reducing carbon emissions, shunning all fossil fuels in future, embracing non-conventional energy like never before and emphasizing in Egypt that our planet has no more patience. \</doc>

Sharm El-Sheikh, Nov 18 (IANS) United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on countries to take climate actions instead of "finger-pointing" at the ongoing UN climate change conference. He made the remarks on Thursday during a press briefing at the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is scheduled to close on Friday in the Egyptian coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh. Guterres said that COP27 will come to an end in 24 hours, but there is clearly a "breakdown" in trust between North and South, Xinhua news agency reported. There is no time for finger-pointing, he noted, adding "the blame game is a recipe for mutually assured destruction." On climate actions, Guterres urged the parties to act in three critical areas -- to respond to loss and damage, close the emissions gap, and deliver on finance. The UN chief also asked the developed countries to fulfill their pledge of providing $100 billion per year for developing countries and set a credible roadmap for doubling adaptation finance. He noted that developed countries "must" provide the support that developing countries need to develop renewable energy and enhance their climate resilience. "Renewables are the exit ramp from the climate hell highway," he said, echoing his earlier remarks about the so-called "highway to climate hell" made at the COP27 leaders' summit. Guterres called for quickly reaching a consensus at COP27 , warning that the "climate clock is ticking and trust keeps eroding." During the briefing, Egyptian Foreign Minister and COP27 President Sameh Shoukry stressed that there are still a number of issues lacking progress at the late stage of COP27 . --IANS int/sha \</doc>

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has provided Qatar with equipment and training to support the countrys efforts to prevent a nuclear security incident during the 2022 World Cup Championship. The Agency has worked with Qatars National Committee for the Prohibition of Weapons (NCPW) over the past year to build its capacity to thwart any attack involving nuclear or other radioactive material. Any such attack during the World Cup a championship of 64 matches held over 29 days, in 8 stadiums could have severe consequences on people and the environment. The IAEA works with countries around the world in enhancing security of nuclear and other radioactive material that could otherwise be used in a terrorist act. In the run up to this years World Cup, the IAEA has helped Qatar integrate nuclear security measures in its overall plans developed to tackle security challenges at such a large-scale event. Football is a unifying sport enjoyed by billions throughout the world, said IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi. Fans attending the games in Qatar deserve to do so without concerns about nuclear security. IAEA and other international experts provided comprehensive training to national counterparts on developing and implementing nuclear security measures and on responding to nuclear security events and related emergencies. As part of its technical support, the IAEA loaned over 120 radiation detection instruments including personal radiation detectors, radionuclide identification devices and portable backpack type detectors to Qatar. It was the first time such equipment was shipped to the host country of a major public event from a nuclear security support centre in Malaysia, where the IAEA has stationed equipment to facilitate the provision of training and support on nuclear security for major public events in the Asia and the Pacific region. The Agencys experience in supporting nuclear security measures at major public events was adapted to the Qatari needs, said Elena Buglova, Director of the IAEA Division of Nuclear Security. The deployment of the equipment loaned to Qatar was done in the most cost-effective and timely manner by the use of the regional loaner pool. The IAEA has provided nuclear security support to Member States for major public events over the last two decades. First supporting Greece with nuclear security arrangements for the Athens Olympic Games in 2004, the IAEA has worked with 43 countries to counteract potential nuclear security threats. Most recently, the IAEA supported Costa Rica in its nuclear security efforts for the Womens U-20 Football World Cup in August 2022, as well as Egypt as the host country of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ) in November 2022. \</doc>

The Federal Minister for Commerce and Investment, Syed Naveed Qamar, addressed the European Parliaments Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in Brussels. The Commerce Minister was joined by Pakistans Ambassador to Belgium, Luxembourg and the European Union, Dr. Asad Majeed Khan, says a press release received here today from Brussels. This was the 3rd debate which was held by the European Parliament regarding the devastating climate-induced Floods in Pakistan, which was unprecedented. The Commerce Ministers address was followed by an exchange of views with the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) belonging to different political groups. The Commerce Minister thanked the Chair MEP Pascal Canfin and the members of the Committee for inviting him to address the prestigious Committee of the EU Parliament and underlined the importance of regular parliamentary exchanges between Pakistan and the EU. Minister Naveed Qamar underscored that Pakistan is at ground zero of the climate crisis, despite contributing less than 1 percent of global greenhouse gases. He elaborated that the country has been suffering from extreme weather events such as droughts, forest fires, severe heat waves as well as catastrophic floods. The Minister indicated that Pakistan has taken a number of initiatives to tackle the adverse effects of climate change, however the size and scale of the current disaster is beyond our national capacity and is adversely affecting our progress on the sustainable development goals. The Minister indicated that the country is determined to Build Back Better in a climate-resilient manner with the support and cooperation of friends and partners. The Commerce Minister emphasized that sustained preferential market access will play a critical role in helping Pakistan achieve its economic rehabilitation, growth and development objectives, especially in the aftermath of the disaster. He stressed that the ongoing loss and damage discussion must be brought forward in all climate-related deliberations at multilateral forums including the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference COP 27 . The 81-member ENVI Committee is one of the most prominent and influential Committees of the European Parliament. It oversees and provides guidance on Environment policy and environmental protection measures, Public health, and Food safety issues. In a separate meeting with the Chair of the European Parliaments Development (DEVE) Committee, MEP Tomas Tobe, the Minister stressed Pakistans keenness in expanding Pak -EU development cooperation and tapping into EUs Global Gateway Strategy to rehabilitate and reconstruct the flood-affected areas. \</doc>

Source:Greenpeace Greenpeace is today celebrating the announcement from French President Emmanuel Macron at COP27 that France supports an outright ban on deep sea mining - saying it shows just how quickly the tide is turning against the destructive industry. "Coming so soon after both the New Zealand and the German governments spoke out against deep sea mining, this shows how fast the movement against dangerous exploitation of the deep sea is gaining momentum," says Greenpeace Aotearoa seabed mining campaigner James Hita. "This latest announcement shows the tide is turning on deep sea mining and there is no future for this destructive industry that threatens the health of the ocean and the lives and livelihoods of those who depend on it. "Right now the Canadian miner 'The Metals Company' is winding up deep sea mining tests in the Pacific, but this news must signal to them that they are on a losing wicket." Last week, New Zealand announced its support for a 'conditional moratorium', closely followed by Germany backing a 'precautionary pause' on the industry. They join Palau, Samoa, Fiji, and the Federated States of Micronesia who are also calling for a moratorium. France has taken that position a step further with Macron calling for an outright ban - the first head of state to do so. Greenpeace Aotearoa is calling for a ban on deep sea mining but supports a moratorium - or pause - as a step in the right direction for ocean protection. Says Hita: "The movement to halt deep sea mining is strong and it is growing. It started with opposition from civil society and a group of Pacific countries - people who will face the brunt of environmental impacts from deep sea mining - and is now rapidly expanding to include a number of nations. "This is people-power in action, thousands of people around the world are speaking out against deep sea mining and world leaders are listening. Together we can protect the ocean that connects and nourishes us." Macron announced his position on deep sea mining at COP27 . It comes as the second week of negotiations at the United Nations International Seabed Authority (ISA) are underway in Jamaica, where member states are negotiating the rules that would allow or disallow deep sea mining to begin. Without measures in place to prevent it, commercial scale deep sea mining could begin as early as mid 2023 and test mining is already underway with Canadian mining company The Metals Company conducting tests in the Pacific this month - pulling up 3,600 tonnes of polymetallic nodules from the seafloor. Several nations at the ISA, including Aotearoa, have been calling for a precautionary pause on deep sea mining with the New Zealand government backing a pause until such a time that strong regulations, backed by robust science, are in place to protect the marine environment in international waters.

December 02 -- With the COP27 now wrapped up, Wood Mackenzie's Energy Transition team shared their five key takeaways from the climate summit. During COP27 First, a rebalancing of the energy trilemma COP27 was heavily influenced by the immediate political necessities of energy security and affordability. But progress on a faster, sustainability-oriented agenda that was set in train last year will slow, at least through the near term. Sharm El-Sheikh instead emphasized longer-term goals to keep alive a 1.5 \'b0C pathway aligned with the Paris Agreement. Proposals to build on the commitment at COP26 to 'phase-down' coal (seen as a prelude for fossil fuels in general) failed to find a consensus. Major energy consumers baulked, joining the existing chorus of producing nations. The energy crisis means fossil fuels could play a bigger role in the solution to the energy crisis over the next few years. COP27 signaled that the world's efforts on climate change are shifting from mitigation to adaptation. With fossil fuels still very much in the mix, more CCS or alternative carbon removal tech will be needed to achieve net zero by 2050. The good news is that government support for CCS has accelerated. Second, loss and damage reparation Additional finance will be made available for countries vulnerable to the effects of climate change. With extreme temperatures, drought, floods, storms, and wildfires becoming more frequent, developing countries demanded stronger commitments to adaptation financing. This is a major step forward toward a just and equitable transition. What's not yet clear is how much money will materialize. Developed economies fell short of the annual climate financing goal agreed in 2009, with just $83 billion raised in 2020 of the $100 billion commitments. Member countries agreed to set up a new framework for the adaptation fund in time for COP28 in 2023, and contributors and recipients will be determined then. Finance requirements could be huge. Some studies project that the cost of adaptation alone will be closer to US$400 billion a year while the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) puts the cost of mitigation at three to six times higher than the capital flows so far committed. A risk for signatories could be a proliferation of lawsuits related to historical climate-related damage. Third, voluntary carbon markets Disappointingly, there was little concrete action. Governments deferred into next year signing an agreement to improve regulation that would make carbon trades more transparent. The current wording could lead to double counting since governments and corporates are not mandated to disclose details on their trades of emissions reductions. The new supervisory body has been tasked with making a new proposal on this issue to be considered at COP28. Private and regional initiatives are flourishing despite governments dragging their feet. The US, in the absence of a national carbon tax, is considering the introduction of the Energy Transition Accelerator, which would see US businesses offset their emissions by buying carbon credits from fuel-dependent low-income countries. India and Saudi Arabia have taken steps to establish national carbon registries and trading. And Singapore launched its Carbon Warehouse Initiative, with the ambition to become the key marketplace for all international credits. Fourth, methane pledges gaining momentum A key element in tackling climate change is methane, which is responsible for 30% of global warming. Only five more countries joined the Global Methane Pledge at COP27 . Total country endorsements are now 151 (including EU members), up from just over 100 after COP26. Methane savings could really narrow the 2030 gap in carbon emissions reductions. Although there is still work to be done to fulfill methane pledges, countries still appear committed. The Biden Administration's Inflation Reduction Act includes a tax on methane leakage. Meanwhile, Brazil's new president, Lula Da Silva, committed to zero deforestation by 2030, a support that could be crucial to saving global biodiversity. Fifth, the role of finance COP27 underlined yet again that finance is crucial for a stable global economy. Even though access to finance has improved over the last year, climate change is competing with other global crises, from inflation and energy shortages to the rising cost of capital. Not enough money is going into the right sectors of the economy in time to build out the technologies of the future and kick the hydrocarbon habit. If governments of major economies and global institutions such as the World Bank and IMF can set aside differences and collaborate finance can flow. Leadership will be the catalyst. \</doc>

India, Oct. 18 -- Adaptation finance will be on top of the upcoming United Nations (UN) Climate Conference, Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) agenda at Sharm El-Sheikh in November according to Amit Prothi, director general, Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI). CDRI, which was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the UN Climate Action Summit in 2019, has 39 members including 31 national governments will be launching a trust fund at COP27 to call for finance for adaptation to climate change. Excerpts from the interview: Q. What do you think will be the major issues on the COP27 agenda? A. The COP 27 The second one is: We are working on a flagship report on the state of global infrastructure resilience at a country level. This would involve the kind of hazards countries are likely to face. The report itself will come out next year but at the COP we will have a panel to talk about the methodology and need for such a report. CDRI will be releasing this report on a biennial basis. Q. Is money actually coming through for adaptation work? A. We are in the process of setting up a trust fund. This is something that is already in the CDRI charter. At COP27 we will launch the CDRI multi-donor trust fund. That fund will essentially be the place where the commitments of different governments will be received. The agreement is that these commitments will come in as grants and support technical work in vulnerable countries. There is no provision for repayment of this money. So, they are not loans. Over the last year, India has committed Rs.400 crores (~US$ 50 million) towards programmatic support apart from other funding for CDRI Secretariat etc; the UK has committed US$ 10 million towards corpus funding to IRIS and &#163;1 million towards biennial report and organization policies; Australia has committed AU$ 10 million (~US$ 7 million) towards corpus funding to IRIS; European Union: &#8364; 5 million (~US$ 5 million) towards IRIS; Netherlands: &#8364; 1 lakh (~US$ 97000); US has supported in kind through technical support on strengthening CDRI secretariat and EU, France, Germany, Australia have also promised support through secondment of manpower resources. Q. Will you be raising the issue of adaptation finance at COP27 ? A. Yes. All of this technical capacity-building work that CDRI is doing doesn't make any sense unless there is finance for it. When you map where financing is going for climate work, 90% is going towards mitigation. Only 10% or even less is going towards adaptation. There is also little work on how the private sector should come in to adaptation work and what should be the model of finance. We want to work on designing adaptation projects that can attract more financing. Q. Will you be voicing your opinion on finance for climate reparations or "loss and damage"? A. For CDRI, loss and damage and adaptation are separate issues. Loss and Damage is a political discussion and there are negotiations happening on a country level. CDRI is an international body with members from different countries and country types, our preference is not to enter this discussion. Where we come in strongly is: How does one support adaptation? This is because adaptation needs are increasing. If you read the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports and study the recent extreme events, climate variability and disasters are increasing Some of these are attributed to climate change while some are attributed to other factors. Urban development patterns, for example, may be contributing to flooding which may or may not have anything to do with climate change. We want to focus on how infrastructure is at risk from extreme weather events like heat wave spells, extreme floods or intense cyclones. Q. What is your take on the Pakistan floods in August? They also lost critical infrastructure due to extreme monsoonal rain. A. Let me put it this way. When we look at the amount of infrastructure we will be building, we need to build something like 20 new Mumbais worth of development by 2050 in India. So, while we are investing in infrastructure how do we build it in a way that we are not adding risk to the system? That will be critical. How do we ensure that the new infrastructure that will be built is not being built in areas that are risk prone? There is a third part also on how can you build infrastructure where you can reduce costs. For example, costal protection can be taken up through hard infrastructure versus a combination of hard and softer infrastructure like mangroves with sea walls, the cost calculations can be vastly different. Q. What work is CDRI doing to make critical infrastructure in India resilient? A. We have started some work on this in Odisha. Given climate change, changing wind patterns and intense cyclones, whether the power infrastructure is able to withstand those wind speeds. Early findings suggest there is a way to improving the robustness of the system based on an understanding of the risk. There are some places in Odisha for instance we are suggesting that the transmission lines be taken underground. These are mostly coastal areas which are affected by cyclones. This is an ongoing study and all the results are not yet out. We discuss with relevant government entity to understand their need and then develop terms of reference and then we give the work to a consultant. CDRI doesn't do the in-house, technical work but we are actually the intermediary between governments and the service providers on resilience building. Once the Odisha work is done we are going to work with other states on the resilience of power infrastructure. We have also just started some work on telecom sector resilience where we are trying to understand the assets and the network system. So, if there is a risk from extreme events to telecom assets then how is the network going to handle that? We are starting the telecom work in 5 states. The learning from these projects will also be taken to our member countries. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

London: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced on Wednesday that he will attend the COP27 climate summit in Egypt next week, reversing his previous decision to skip the meeting in Sharm El Sheikh to focus on domestic issues and the economic crisis in the UK. Sunak took to Twitter to reveal his plans after criticism from climate activists and within the government from Indian-origin COP27 President Alok Sharma, who said it was important for the prime minister to be present to show the UK's commitment on the issue of climate action. The pressure mounted further as his ex-boss, former prime minister Boris Johnson, confirmed that he would be attending the summit scheduled between November 6 and 18. "There is no long-term prosperity without action on climate change," tweeted Sunak. "There is no energy security without investing in renewables. That is why I will attend COP27 next week: to deliver on Glasgow's legacy of building a secure and sustainable future," he said, with reference to the COP26 summit chaired by the UK in Scotland last November. The Opposition Labour Party described the reversed decision to attend as Sunak being "dragged kicking and screaming into doing the right thing; embarrassing". \</doc>

WEB DESK, Nov. 13 -- The Adaptation and agriculture thematic day at COP27 in Egypt focused on how the world will feed eight billion people. Throughout the day, a series of sessions and initiatives shed light on pathways forward on adaptation and climate resilient agriculture. The focus comes at a particularly challenging year for food security as 37 million people now face starvation in the Greater Horn of Africa after four consecutive droughts; In Pakistan, unprecedented floods have battered the country's major agricultural regions; and record-breaking temperatures across Europe and the US have led to drastically reduced crop yields. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has caused global shortages and price hikes in wheat, oilseeds and fertiliser. Four initiatives were taken in today's session to address transformation of agrifood systems, the integration of climate responses to peace and security, the improvement of the quality of life of the most vulnerable in Africa by 2030, and delivery of healthy diets respectively. The inititives are Food and Agriculture for Sustainable Transformation (FAST), Climate Responses for Sustaining Peace, Decent Life for a Climate Resilient Africa, and Initiative on Climate Action and Nutrition (I-CAN). COP27 President Sameh Shoukry said the new initiative will increase climate finance contributions for agriculture and food systems to support the most vulnerable communities . By dedicating an entire day to Adaptation and Agriculture, COP27 brought together diverse voices from policymakers, scientists, researchers, civil society, and government, who can share their successes and help communities that also need to achieve their sustainable development goals.

African Development Bank President Dr. Akinwumi Adesina and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) President Odile Reinaud-Basso have agreed that their organizations would step up cooperation to enhance resilience among African businesses. The two development bank heads held talks earlier this month at this year's global climate summit ( COP27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. By partnering and working closely with government institutions, public utilities, local enterprises and communities, multilateral development banks like the African Development Bank and EBRD can play a catalytic role in developing the approaches to finance that underpin this transformation since financing models use both public and private channels. Key Highlight:  The Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program is mobilizing $25 billion by 2025. Original Press Release: Nov. 30 -- African Development Bank issued the following news release: African Development Bank President Dr. Akinwumi Adesina and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) President Odile Reinaud-Basso have agreed that their organizations would step up cooperation to enhance resilience among African businesses. The two development bank heads held talks earlier this month at this year's global climate summit ( COP27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Adesina highlighted that "climate adaptation in Africa was a key condition to preserving economic growth and maintaining social cohesion on the continent." Reinaud-Basso confirmed EBRD's commitment to support the implementation of the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP), an initiative jointly launched in 2021 by the African Development Bank and the Global Center on Adaptation. The program is mobilizing $25 billion by 2025. These funds will help accelerate climate adaptation action in Africa through initiatives in four priority areas: food security; resilient infrastructure; youth entrepreneurship and job creation; and innovative climate adaptation finance. Global heating entails rethinking of how infrastructure, cities, and financial systems are designed and operated. This requires effective partnerships between public and private actors and strong engagement with civil society. By partnering and working closely with government institutions, public utilities, local enterprises and communities, multilateral development banks like the African Development Bank and EBRD can play a catalytic role in developing the approaches to finance that underpin this transformation since financing models use both public and private channels. Multilateral development banks can also support the development of innovative financing products using blended finance approaches and developing market-based instruments that reward enterprises investing in climate resilience projects. Both institutions will collaborate to further develop the African Development Bank's Adaptation Benefits Mechanism. They will explore innovative non-market approaches under Article 6.8 of the Paris Agreement. The African Development Bank and EBRD will expand their cooperation in all these areas of work in the context of the Africa Accelerated Adaptation Program. They will prioritize support to countries and clients to understand physical climate risks and scale up adaptation investments. Reinaud-Basso said: "Africa has the potential to become a global leader in climate adaptation solutions and services and we want to expand our cooperation to support Africa fulfill its potential. Adesina said he and his EBRD counterpart were both fully aligned on the need for multilateral development banks to adjust their business models to respond to the multiple crises they face, including climate change, and the task of building resilient economies. "While preserving their triple-A rating, which must remain the cornerstone of multilateral development banks' business model, MDBs must find avenues to secure more risk capital to leverage more private sector investments," Adesina said. He added: "One of these in the short term is the reallocation of a portion of their International Monetary Fund Special Drawing Rights from wealthy countries to MDBs. These can apply a multiplier factor of 3 to 4 on it. Both the African Development Bank and the EBRD are ready to implement this option, which will offer significant value for money to the countries that will provide SDRs."

Sharm El-Sheikh, Nov 18 (IANS) A focus on solutions closed out COP27 's thematic days program on Friday with COP27 President Sameh Shoukry urging all parties to go the extra mile and take the necessary steps to reach much-needed conclusions and agreements. Joined by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, COP President Shoukry said: "While progress has been achieved on many issues, it is evidently clear that at this late stage of the COP27 process, there are still a number of issues, where progress remains lacking with persisting divergent views amongst Parties. "While some of the discussions are constructive and positive, others do not reflect the expected recognition of the need to move collectively to address the gravity and urgency of the climate crisis. The world has become a stage for a continuously running show of human misery and pain. This needs to end now, not tomorrow." Earlier in the day, the agenda featured several sessions that drew attention to urbanization and climate change and ensuring that cities around the world are part of climate solutions to accelerate multi-level action and bolder leadership to meet the goal of 1.5 Celsius degrees target by 2030. To this end, the COP27 Presidency, with the support of UN-Habitat, convened the first-ever Ministerial Meeting on Urbanization and Climate Change at a UN Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP). The Ministerial Meeting reinforced the commitment of the Paris Agreement and committed to accelerated climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation action and local climate finance, and focused on housing, urban development, and multi-level action in relation to climate change. The meeting took place on "Solutions Day", which concluded the thematic programming at COP27 ; a day when four initiatives were launched including Sustainable Urban Resilience for the Next Generation Initiative, Friends of Greening National Investment Plans in Africa and Developing Countries Initiative, Low Carbon Transport for Urban Sustainability Initiative and Global Waste Initiative 50 by 2050. The Methane Ministerial Meeting took place, almost a year after the initial launch of the Global Methane Pledge at COP26. The meeting highlighted the crucial efforts needed to address methane emissions. The Global Methane Pledge comes as a welcomed initiative in this regard, with an ambitious aim of achieving at least a 30 per cent reduction in global methane emissions by 2030, based on 2020 levels. The Global Methane Pledge Energy Pathway provides an important platform for countries that have signed up to the pledge to share experiences and best practices, showcase commitments, and benefit from enhanced access to finance and technical support through bilateral and multilateral arrangements. During the session, COP27 President Shoukry said: "Without fast, concrete, and concerted action to tackle methane emissions, achieving the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement will remain far from reach. The COP27 Presidency will continue to attract new signups and enhance the global collective effort to reduce methane emissions." --IANS vg/ksk/ \</doc>

COP 27 , the United Nations climate conference, has started. Vattenfall will be represented by Annika Ramskld, Head of Sustainability, who will attend several top-level meetings. Vattenfall strives for further efforts to reduce CO 2 emissions from cement and concrete production. The focus of the COP 27 climate change conference is on translating the ambitious goals and commitments set by Member States into practical action. The conference will take place in Sharm el-Sheikh (Egypt) from November 6th to 18th. Key Highlight:  By 2030, we will therefore replace 10 percent of our annual need for foundations for wind turbines, power line pylons and other construction projects with fossil-free cement and concrete. Original Press Release: Nov. 9 -- Vattenfall issued the following news release: COP 27 , the United Nations climate conference, has started. Vattenfall will be represented by Annika Ramskld, Head of Sustainability, who will attend several top-level meetings. Vattenfall strives for further efforts to reduce CO 2 emissions from cement and concrete production. The focus of the COP 27 climate change conference is on translating the ambitious goals and commitments set by Member States into practical action. The conference will take place in Sharm el-Sheikh (Egypt) from November 6th to 18th. The guideline is still the 1.5 degree target from the Paris Agreement. Annika Ramskld, Head of Sustainability, you are going to Egypt to take part in COP 27 . What are you going to do there? I will be on site for the first half, participating in a range of seminars and panel discussions, including high-level meetings organized by Caring for Climate, a United Nations Global Compact initiative, and the First Movers Coalition ( FMC), launched by the World Economic Forum, with the aim of driving demand for climate-friendly solutions. John Kerry, the US special envoy on climate change, will also attend. We are one of the founding companies of the FMC and have a history of committing to increasing our purchasing volumes in new technologies and solutions that make a climate difference in terms of fossil-free steel, air travel and trucking. In addition, we have now made commitments in another area - cement and concrete. Vattenfall is committed to purchasing low-carbon cement What does the new commitment mean for cement and concrete? Similar to the other areas, this means making demands on suppliers and our own purchasing when it comes to using a larger proportion of fossil-free alternatives. Cement and concrete production causes significant CO 2 emissions. By 2030, we will therefore replace 10 percent of our annual need for foundations for wind turbines, power line pylons and other construction projects with fossil-free cement and concrete. It's more expensive, but in the case of a wind turbine, for example, the overall increase in price is only a fraction of the total investment costs. With rising CO 2 prices in the future, the difference will become even smaller. We have taken steps in this direction before, e.g. For example, in the construction of a new dam at the Lilla Edet hydroelectric power station, where we used a new technology to reduce the proportion of concrete and thereby reduce CO 2 emissions. Climate-friendly concrete with less cement - Vattenfall What role does Vattenfall play in such a conference? We are there to show that we walk the talk and work to create fossil-free value chains. I hope that we can be a role model for other companies that haven't come as far as we have, to get off the starting blocks now. At last year's conference in Glasgow it became clear that it is companies that are driving the energy transition. Among other things, I will take part in several so-called implementation labs and discuss with executives and ministers how the fossil-free value chains can be realized. At the same time, the transition must be made in such a way that no one is left behind. In this context, one speaks of transition, a fair transition. It must not happen that already disadvantaged countries or groups have to bear the costs. The United Nations' Caring for Climate initiative, which I mentioned, therefore aims to highlight this important issue. Last year, CEO Anna Borg met US President Joe Biden. Will you meet him this year? Joe Biden has announced that he will attend COP 27 , which is very positive and sends important signals to other states. I won't be meeting him, but his special envoy, John Kerry, sits on the First Movers Coalition Leaders Panel, which I am on. Disclaimer: The Above Content is Auto-Translated [Category: ESG] \</doc>

On 24 September 2022, H.E. Mr. Don Pradmudwinai, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Thailand delivered statement at the General Debate of the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA77) at the United Nations Headquarters in New York. DPM/FM stressed the urgent need to strengthen multilateral cooperation to address current global crises, both from nature and man-made such as food and energy crisis, pandemic, conflict, and climate change. He urged the international community to reaffirm the commitment to multilateral system and called for collective efforts to drive forward collaborations during this crucial time in support of the Secretary-Generals initiatives outline in the Our Common Agenda report. DPM/FM further highlighted Thailands support for Black Sea Grain Initiative initiated by the United Nations and stressed the importance of this initiative to help keep global supply chains open. Apart from food insecurity, it is vital to strengthen healthcare system through Universal Health Coverages or UHC while reforming the global health architecture in order to address the current shortcomings of health systems. On climate change, DPM/FM demonstrated Thailands readiness to submit Nationally Determined Contributions: NDCs and long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies (LT-LEDS) at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ). He also emphasised the need for the international community to restore confidence in the multilateral system and working closely on the issues of mutual interest, which also includes providing humanitarian assistance to countries in need and the promotion human rights. To this end, Thailand presents its candidacy for the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) membership for the term 2025-2027. DPM/FM pointed out that Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) could be achieved only through international cooperation and Thailand considers the Bio-Circular-Green Economy Model (BCG) as a means to drive forward a more balanced development. DPM/FM stressed that regional cooperation such as Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) can complement the multilateral system. This year, Thailand plays host to APEC Economic Leaders Meeting under the main theme of Open. Connect. Balance. On this occasion, DPM/FM proposed that key stakeholders of the Ukraine crisis to assemble at three venues in Southeast Asia - ASEAN Summit in Phnom Penh, G20 Summit in Bali and APEC Economic Leaders Meeting in Bangkok to use the opportunities to talks towards exit to the crisis with possible participation of the UN. Moreover, DPM/FM encouraged the international communities to respond to global crises with a mindful and positive outlook in order to overcome challenges and to achieve global peace to all mankind. \</doc>

The overwhelming feeling at the end of COP27 was that despite decades of meetings and landmark accords, like the Paris Agreement, the world was still not doing enough to slow the climate crisis AMBASSADOR T P SREENIVASAN The scenario is the same at every Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change from the first one in Berlin in 1995 when I was the vice president of the COP, the Indian negotiator and spokesman of the G77, to the latest one in Sharm El Sheikh, which I followed from a long distance away. The issues are the same, but they appear in different nomenclatures, there is much expectation in the preparatory stage as delegates hold out promises ad referendum, there are more people active on the streets to exert pressure on the G=governments, endless meetings of negotiators, scientists, NGOs and others propose solutions, the situation becomes hopeless on the last day, the conference is extended by stopping the clock and a formulation appears in the wee hours of the night, which will make everyone equally unhappy. Negotiators celebrate, but the activists call the whole exercise a hoax. All the Climate Change exercises resolve around the phrase, 'Common, but differentiated responsibilities', formulated in Rio De Janeiro in 1992 as a compromise between the main responsibilities of the developed countries and the common responsibility of all countries. The gulf between the interpretation of the phrase by the rich and poor have never been bridged in substance, but various ways have been found to create an appearance of progress at every COP, only to find it collapsing at the next one. Kyoto, Copenhagen, Paris, Glasgow and Sharm El Sheikh changed the trajectory to find ways of reducing greenhouse gases, finding technology and financing, to alleviate suffering and to save the earth, but the global temperature keeps rising above acceptable levels, predicting impending doom. Concepts like 'Joint Implementation', 'Carbon trading', 'Phasing down coal' etc were life savers at different COPs and the achievement at the latest COP was 'loss and damage' funding for vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters. This also will pass without any benefit to the most affected countries. 'This outcome moves us forward,' said Simon Stiell, UN Climate Change executive secretary. 'We have determined a way forward on a decades-long conversation on funding for loss and damage - deliberating over how we address the impacts on communities whose lives and livelihoods have been ruined by the very worst impacts of climate change.' Pious hope indeed. The geopolitical backdrop of COP27 as abysmal, with the pandemic raising its head in China again and the war raging in Ukraine, with no guarantee that the worst is over. Countries reaffirmed their commitment to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by presenting various packages, which were supposed to cut greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the inevitable impacts of climate change, as well as boosting the support of finance, technology and capacity building needed by developing countries. Creating a specific fund for loss and damage is supposed to mark an important point of progress, as it has been added to the agenda for the first time. Governments decided to establish new funding arrangements, as well as a dedicated fund, to assist developing countries in responding to loss and damage. Governments also agreed to establish a 'transitional committee' to make recommendations on how to operationalize both the new funding arrangements and the fund at COP28 next year. But how is it different from the promises held out from 1992 onwards to compensate developing countries for the loss and damage suffered on account of loss of sustainable development? The new fund, which has been characterised by the UN secretary-general as £n important step to justice' is expected to see developing countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of the climate crisis supported for losses arising from droughts, floods, rising seas and other disasters that are attributed to climate change. While it recognised the need for financial support from a variety of sources, no decisions have been made on who should pay into the fund, where this money will come from and which countries will benefit. The fund could require everything from building sea walls to creating drought-resistant crops - could cost developing countries anywhere from $160 billion to $340 billion every year till 2030 and it could swell to as much as $565 billion by 2050 if climate change accelerates, according to UNEP. The UN claims that COP27 saw significant progress on adaptation, with governments agreeing on the way to move forward on the Global Goal on Adaptation, which will conclude at COP28 and inform the first Global Stocktake, improving resilience amongst the most vulnerable. The other key outcomes of COP27 are listed as the launch of a new five-year work programme at COP27 to promote climate technology solutions in developing countries, and the scaling up of mitigation implementation. The work programme will start immediately and continue until 2030, with at least two global dialogues held each year. Governments were also requested to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their national climate plans by the end of 2023, as well as accelerate efforts to phasedown unabated coal power and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. The decisions recognise that the unprecedented global energy crisis underlines the urgency to rapidly transform energy systems to be more secure, reliable, and resilient, by accelerating clean and just transitions to renewable energy during this critical decade of action. A crowded calendar of meetings till COP28 and beyond has been put in place, but none of these is expected to deal with the core problems like the reduction of greenhouse gases and funding.

Jammu, Nov. 27 -- The overwhelming feeling at the end of COP27 was that despite decades of meetings and landmark accords, like the Paris Agreement, the world was still not doing enough to slow the climate crisis AMBASSADOR T P SREENIVASAN The scenario is the same at every Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change from the first one in Berlin in 1995 when I was the vice president of the COP, the Indian negotiator and spokesman of the G77, to the latest one in Sharm El Sheikh, which I followed from a long distance away. The issues are the same, but they appear in different nomenclatures, there is much expectation in the preparatory stage as delegates hold out promises ad referendum, there are more people active on the streets to exert pressure on the G=governments, endless meetings of negotiators, scientists, NGOs and others propose solutions, the situation becomes hopeless on the last day, the conference is extended by stopping the clock and a formulation appears in the wee hours of the night, which will make everyone equally unhappy. Negotiators celebrate, but the activists call the whole exercise a hoax. All the Climate Change exercises resolve around the phrase, 'Common, but differentiated responsibilities', formulated in Rio De Janeiro in 1992 as a compromise between the main responsibilities of the developed countries and the common responsibility of all countries. The gulf between the interpretation of the phrase by the rich and poor have never been bridged in substance, but various ways have been found to create an appearance of progress at every COP, only to find it collapsing at the next one. Kyoto, Copenhagen, Paris, Glasgow and Sharm El Sheikh changed the trajectory to find ways of reducing greenhouse gases, finding technology and financing, to alleviate suffering and to save the earth, but the global temperature keeps rising above acceptable levels, predicting impending doom. Concepts like 'Joint Implementation', 'Carbon trading', 'Phasing down coal' etc were life savers at different COPs and the achievement at the latest COP was 'loss and damage' funding for vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters. This also will pass without any benefit to the most affected countries. 'This outcome moves us forward,' said Simon Stiell, UN Climate Change executive secretary. 'We have determined a way forward on a decades-long conversation on funding for loss and damage - deliberating over how we address the impacts on communities whose lives and livelihoods have been ruined by the very worst impacts of climate change.' Pious hope indeed. The geopolitical backdrop of COP27 as abysmal, with the pandemic raising its head in China again and the war raging in Ukraine, with no guarantee that the worst is over. Countries reaffirmed their commitment to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by presenting various packages, which were supposed to cut greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the inevitable impacts of climate change, as well as boosting the support of finance, technology and capacity building needed by developing countries. Creating a specific fund for loss and damage is supposed to mark an important point of progress, as it has been added to the agenda for the first time. Governments decided to establish new funding arrangements, as well as a dedicated fund, to assist developing countries in responding to loss and damage. Governments also agreed to establish a 'transitional committee' to make recommendations on how to operationalize both the new funding arrangements and the fund at COP28 next year. But how is it different from the promises held out from 1992 onwards to compensate developing countries for the loss and damage suffered on account of loss of sustainable development? The new fund, which has been characterised by the UN secretary-general as £n important step to justice' is expected to see developing countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of the climate crisis supported for losses arising from droughts, floods, rising seas and other disasters that are attributed to climate change. While it recognised the need for financial support from a variety of sources, no decisions have been made on who should pay into the fund, where this money will come from and which countries will benefit. The fund could require everything from building sea walls to creating drought-resistant crops - could cost developing countries anywhere from $160 billion to $340 billion every year till 2030 and it could swell to as much as $565 billion by 2050 if climate change accelerates, according to UNEP. The UN claims that COP27 saw significant progress on adaptation, with governments agreeing on the way to move forward on the Global Goal on Adaptation, which will conclude at COP28 and inform the first Global Stocktake, improving resilience amongst the most vulnerable. The other key outcomes of COP27 are listed as the launch of a new five-year work programme at COP27 to promote climate technology solutions in developing countries, and the scaling up of mitigation implementation. The work programme will start immediately and continue until 2030, with at least two global dialogues held each year. Governments were also requested to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their national climate plans by the end of 2023, as well as accelerate efforts to phasedown unabated coal power and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. The decisions recognise that the unprecedented global energy crisis underlines the urgency to rapidly transform energy systems to be more secure, reliable, and resilient, by accelerating clean and just transitions to renewable energy during this critical decade of action. A crowded calendar of meetings till COP28 and beyond has been put in place, but none of these is expected to deal with the core problems like the reduction of greenhouse gases and funding. COP27 was that despite decades of meetings and landmark accords, like the Paris Agreement, the world was still not doing enough to slow the climate crisis. UNEP's Emissions Gap Report 2022 found that policies currently in place point to a 2.8degC temperature rise by the end of the century, a number that could lead to catastrophic consequences for the planet. A credible pathway to reduce greenhouse gases to a 1.5-degree Celsius temperature rise is still eluding humanity. The ultimate solution to climate change will have to be scientific by developing technology to capture and disposal of carbon. Changing lifestyles in developed countries will never take place and their luxury emissions will continue and the poor countries will need their survival emissions. The hot air generated at the innumerable conferences only adds to the problem. T P Sreenivasan, (Indian Foreign Service, 1967), is a former Ambassador of India and Governor for India of the IAEA.

London, Nov 2 (IANS) UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak confirmed he will attend the Cop27 environmental conference in Egypt next week, the media reported. The UK PM had initially indicated he would not travel to North Africa despite the UK hosting the previous event in Glasgow last yea, Daily Mail reported. The change came after Sunak's predecessor Boris Johnson confirmed he would attend, having made the environment a key plank of his premiership. Writing on Twitter, Sunak said: "There is no long-term prosperity without action on climate change. There is no energy security without investing in renewables. "That is why I will attend Cop27 next week: to deliver on Glasgow's legacy of building a secure and sustainable future." He had previously said he had to focus on Britain's 'depressing domestic challenges' but faced growing pressure to join other world leaders at the conference next week. Labour's climate change secretary Ed Miliband said: "The Prime Minister has been shamed into going to Cop27 by the torrent of disbelief that he would fail to turn up. "He is going to avoid embarrassment, not to provide leadership." Labour had called Sunak's decision to skip Cop27 a 'massive failure of leadership'. Britain hosted Cop26 last year and holds its presidency until the start of the next summit, Daily Mail reported. The Prime Minister's own climate adviser Alok Sharma had said he was 'disappointed' that Sunak was not planning to attend. But today he praised the Prime Minister's U-turn. The outgoing Cop26 president tweeted: "Delighted that @RishiSunak is attending Cop27 -- completely agree with his comment that 'there is no long-term prosperity without action on climate change'." Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said Rishi Sunak had been 'dragged kicking and screaming into doing the right thing' after he committed to attend the Cop27 climate summit. "Embarrassing," she added, Daily Mail reported. The decision of his arch-rival and former Downing Street neighbour to attend made it even harder for Sunak to resist going. --IANS san/pgh \</doc>

New Delhi: With over 195 countries reaching a final agreement at UN climate talks ( COP27 ) in Sharm elSheikh on Sunday, India which actively participated in the two-week long negotiations through multiple interventions welcomed its outcome paving the way for setting up of a loss and damage fund, and inclusion of  transition to sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of consumption and production in its cover decision.  Inclusion of sustainable lifestyle is the most significant for us. It is Prime Minister Narendra Modi who has made the pitch for an environmentally-friendly lifestyle through his mantra of Mission LiFE (lifestyle for environment) and the world today moved in that direction by including it in the implementation plan to address climate change, environment minister Bhupender Yadav told TOIafter conclusion of the climate talks. The cover decision of the COP27 noted the importance of transition to sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of consumption and production for efforts to address climate change. It also noted the importance of pursuing an approach to education that promotes a shift in lifestyles while fostering patterns of development and sustainability based on care, community and cooperation.  Despite the many differences and individual concerns, the countries showed remarkable seriousness in trying to make significant headway on all issues that impact the fight against climate change, said the minister while referring to the gruelling rounds of negotiation at the COP27 . Asked about agreement on the loss and damage fund, Yadav said,  We all have waited far too long for this. The consensus over this was reached after untiring efforts from one and all. \</doc>

Eddie Rich, CEOof the International Hydropower Association has issued a statement following the conclusion of COP27 : " COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh was the centre of attention for two weeks this month as the world leaders met to make progress on tackling climate change. Let me offer a few reflections from the perspective of someone who is screaming out about how sustainable hydropower can play its role. Overall, I am frankly disappointed with the outcome. Whilst the establishment of the "Loss and Damage Fund" is welcome, there has been no discernible progress or action by governments on keeping to the 1.5C target." Original Press Release: Nov. 25 -- International Hydropower Association issued the following news release: Eddie Rich, CEO of the International Hydropower Association has issued a statement following the conclusion of COP27 : COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh was the centre of attention for two weeks this month as the world leaders met to make progress on tackling climate change. Let me offer a few reflections from the perspective of someone who is screaming out about how sustainable hydropower can play its role. Overall, I am frankly disappointed with the outcome. Whilst the establishment of the "Loss and Damage Fund" is welcome, there has been no discernible progress or action by governments on keeping to the 1.5C target. The Economist has already written it off. It's difficult to imagine how a Loss and Damage Fund can meet the growing need whilst there is not more political progress. However, I would highlight three major positives: Secondly, long duration energy storage is on the agenda. The narrative around backing up variable renewables with firm energy has made a lot of progress since last year. Announcements on Pumped Storage Hydropower in Australia, China, India and US, are increasingly part of a global "hydropower renaissance". So now it is more about getting the financial mechanisms and political momentum in place. Modernisation of existing plants and floating solar on hydro reservoirs were the other hot topics in the hydropower space. Finally, the global green associations are speaking as one. Two significant announcements were made: the Global Renewables Alliance and the Planning for Climate Commission, which cement sustainable hydropower's role alongside like-minded sectors (wind, solar, geothermal, green hydrogen and storage). There is a huge amount to do before COP28. IHA and its partners across the renewables will speak louder and louder about the need for the policies (to integrate hydropower in energy and industrial development), mechanisms (to incentivise investment in the sector) and processes (to remove permitting bottlenecks).

Africa deserves the highest priority attention at the United Nations climate conference, COP 27 to be held in November this year, panel members discussing the African Development Bank's African Economic Outlook 2022 in an event hosted by the Atlantic Council, said on Wednesday. A team from the African Development Bank Group, led by Acting Chief Economist and Vice President Kevin Urama, is in Washington D.C. to present the African Economic Outlook 2022, a flagship publication of the Bank, to international thought leaders and other targeted bodies. Under the theme, Supporting Climate Resilience and a Just Energy Transition in Africa, this year's report highlights climate change as a growing threat to lives and livelihoods in Africa. Original Press Release: July 29 -- African Development Bank issued the following news release: Africa deserves the highest priority attention at the United Nations climate conference, COP 27 to be held in November this year, panel members discussing the African Development Bank's African Economic Outlook 2022 in an event hosted by the Atlantic Council, said on Wednesday. A team from the African Development Bank Group, led by Acting Chief Economist and Vice President Kevin Urama, is in Washington D.C. to present the African Economic Outlook 2022, a flagship publication of the Bank, to international thought leaders and other targeted bodies. Under the theme, Supporting Climate Resilience and a Just Energy Transition in Africa, this year's report highlights climate change as a growing threat to lives and livelihoods in Africa. In a video message during one of the sessions, president and Chief Executive Officer of Bezos Earth Fund, Andrew Steer, urged African and world leaders to think bolder and work more creatively together as they prepare for COP 27 , which will take place in Egypt. Steer, a former World Bank Special Envoy for Climate Change believes that COP 27 gives the world an incredible opportunity to think big about Africa. "We need to make it Africa's COP. So, what the African Development Bank and the Atlantic Council are trying to do to raise awareness is exceedingly important." He described the 2022 African Economic Outlook as £n excellent report.' "It lays out beautifully this sobering time for Africa in particular, but actually for the whole world - a slowing world economy, the perfect storm of rising food prices and energy prices, interest rates, and shocking increases in the impact of climate change and green vulnerability at a time that international resources are not what they need to be." In a presentation on the report, Acting Chief Economist Urama called for policy coordination and a more holistic approach to tackling climate change. "We have been losing 5% to 15% of GDP per capita growth in Africa because of climate change, and that is in addition to other issues that climate change is driving on the continent," Urama said. "Amid these difficulties lie opportunities for innovation. Let's think big, act big, and save the planet." "As we prepare for COP 27 , honoring the 2009 $100 billion yearly climate finance commitment that high-income countries promised to developing countries will help to restore confidence that we are serious about climate change, even though it is not enough." Deputy Assistant Administrator for Africa at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Tyler Beckelman, said the African Economic Outlook "cogently and convincingly captures the very real and urgent challenges to realizing a just energy transition in Africa." "Make no mistake- the crisis is already here," Beckelman cautioned. "Four failed rainy seasons in the Horn of Africa- with a fifth likely to occur this summer- is a direct result of a warming climate, and sadly, it may become the norm." He said the United States would ensure that its African partners have the ability and resources to develop the foundation for a sustainable and low-carbon economy that provides ample energy for growth. He added: "While the challenges are enormous, we see plenty of reasons to be optimistic. Sustained investments in adaptation and mitigation, through renewable energy and climate-smart land use practices, will help provide a pathway for African countries to develop innovative ways, building a more just and equitable future for people across the continent." Senior Director of the Atlantic Council, Africa Centre, Rama Yade, observed that it has become more important to look at Africa and climate change. The event featured a panel discussion on the report, comprising Anthony Simpasa, Acting Manager of the African Development Bank's Macroeconomic Policy, Debt Sustainability and Forecasting Division; Ayaan Adam, Senior Director and CEO of AFC Capital Partners at the Africa Finance Corporation; Jeffrey Krilla, Vice President for Global Public Policy and Government Affairs, Kosmos Energy; and Queen Quinn, Founding Partner at Kupanda Capital. The African Economic Outlook report 2022 provides evidence-based policy options for driving inclusive growth by building climate resilience and a just energy transition in Africa. The event was an opportunity to appraise policy stakeholders in Washington DC on the key findings of the report as well as discuss priorities and actionable recommendations in the preparation and run-up to COP27 .

Expressing concern over the draft decision text on the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture, India said developed countries are blocking a pro-poor and pro-farmer decision by insisting on expanding the scope for mitigation to agriculture, thereby compromising the very foundation of food security in the world, a source in the Indian delegation said. ALSO READ COP27 In most developing countries across the world, agriculture is done by small and marginal farmers who toil hard and brave the vagaries of extreme weather and climate variability as well as the additional stress of climate change. "By seeking to extend the scope of mitigation to agriculture, the developed countries are wanting the world agriculture, lands and seascapes to become a site of mitigation for their profligate and excessive emissions," India said.

Britain showing up to work with world leaders is an opportunity to grasp. Not an event to shun: Labour leader Rishi Sunak has been accused of "a failure of leadership" for not attending Cop27 in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh from 6-18 November or even allowing King Charles to go to the global climate change conference. But the Prime Minister his defended his decision to stay away despite widespread criticism, pointing out: "I just think, at the moment, it's right that I'm also focusing on the depressing domestic challenges we have with the economy. I think that's what people watching would reasonably expect me to be doing as well." He stressed that he remains "very passionate" and "personally committed" to leaving behind "a better environment for our children and grandchildren". Rishi's spokesman at 10, Downing Street, explained the Prime Minister was focusing on domestic issues including preparations for the autumn budget, which has been delayed from October 31 to November 17. "The Prime Minister is not expected to attend Cop27 and this is due to other pressing domestic commitments including preparations for the Autumn Budget." Britain will be represented by Alok Sharma, who has been president of COP26, both under Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, but Rishi has stripped him of both his cabinet rank and ministerial position - possibly for backing Boris's return to Downing Street. Rishi was attacked by the Labour leader, Keith Starmer, who said: "Britain showing up to work with world leaders is an opportunity to grasp. Not an event to shun." Labour's shadow climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, twisted the knife: "This is a massive failure of climate leadership. We were the Cop26 hosts and now the UK Prime Minister isn't even bothering to turn up to Cop27 . Cop27 makes a mockery of any government claims on continued climate leadership - and what a shameful way to end the UK's Cop presidency." The UK hosted Cop26 in Glasgow last November. This was attended by Prince Charles, who has long been a passionate advocate of action to combat climate change. Although Charles is thought to be keen to go to Egypt, Rishi is sticking with Truss's decision that the King should not attend Cop27 for reasons that are not entirely clear. Rebecca Newsom, the head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said the move suggests Rishi does not take climate change "seriously enough". She said: "The UK Government is supposed to hand over the Cop presidency to their Egyptian counterparts at next month's summit. For Rishi Sunak not to show up is like a runner failing to turn up with the baton at a crucial stage of the relay," she added. A Number 10 spokesperson reiterated on Friday that the King would not be attending. "As is standard practice, government advice was sought and provided under a previous PM, and it was unanimously agreed that it would not be the right occasion for the King to visit in person." The British delegation to Cop27 will include the environment secretary Theresa Coffey, who was Truss's closest ally and deputy prime minister. She said: "Normally the big COPs tend to be every five years. The United Kingdom hosted that last year where we had attendance from many members of the Royal Family. But in between, it tends to be more of, I'm not going to say low key, but not quite the same level of heads of state and prime ministers attending." Meanwhile, Rishi's wife, Akshata Murthy continues to be news despite trying to keep a low profile. Saturday's Daily Telegraph revealed she "has received a payout of almost Pound 7m from her father's IT company". It added that Akshata "owns 39 million shares in Bangalore-based Infosys, or roughly 0.9pc of the business, according to public filings. She benefited from the company's decision to pay a half-year dividend of 16.5 rupees per share on Thursday, entitling her to about Pound 6.8m before tax. "The payment is on top of another Pound 12m in dividends she received last year. Ms Murthy's stake in Infosys, believed to be the primary source of her wealth, is currently valued at Pound 618m. "Ms Murthy publicly vowed to voluntarily pay British taxes on all her worldwide income in April, despite being legally entitled not to do so as a non-domiciled resident and Indian citizen." \</doc>

Sharm el-Sheikh: The draft decision text of the 27th session of the UN climate talks ( COP27 ), released on Saturday, carried in the mitigation clause the two key points made by India, which had not been included in the initial draft released on Friday. The first p oint is  phase down of una bated coal power, while the second one is about the conditionality of fossil fuel subsidies which relates to  providing targeted support to the poorest and most vulnera ble . The initial draft used  phase out (instead of phase down) for coal and missed the targeted support point, resulting in facing objections from India. India had got both these points inserted in the Glasgow Clima te Pact (COP26) last year. These two will now continue to be in the final deci sion text of the COP27 . The relevant clause on the mitigation (para 28 of the final draft decision) now calls upon countries  to accelerate the development, de- ployment and dissemination of technologies, and the adoption of policies, to t ransition towards low-emission energy systems, including by rapidly scaling up the deployment of clean power generation and energy efficiency measures, including accelerating efforts towards the ph ase down of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, while provid- ing targeted support to the poorest and most vulnerable in line with national circumstances and recognizing the need for support towar ds a just transition. Reference to India's stand on phasing down all fossil fuels, however, contin ues to be missing in the draft decision. The draft decision text will now be discussed in the plenary for final decision (outcome of the COP27 ) with conse nsus, inv olving 195 countries. The final outcome of the COP27 is expected late on Saturday night or early Sunday morning. \</doc>

India, Nov. 13 -- The 27th round of the United Nations-led Confe-rence of the Parties ( COP27 ) meeting currently underway in Egypt has completed a week, and the stage lights, as expected, are back on coal. On Saturday, as negotiations on the cover text began, India made it clear that participating countries must acknowledge that all fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas (and not just coal) - contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and that the 2015 Paris Agreement requi-res phasing down of all fossil fuels. The proposal would have to be agreed upon by consensus next week if it is to go into a final COP27 deal. COP27 told this newspaper, the selective singling out of sources of emissions, for either labelling them more harmful, or labelling them "green and sustainable" even when they are sources of greenhouse gases, has no basis in the best available science. Like it did in COP26 in Glasgow, India must stand its ground on coal and push for more immediate needs of the developing world: Climate finance and green tech at affordable costs from the rich nations. The Global North can't impose its agenda on everyone else. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Sharm el Sheikh/New Delhi, Nov. 21 -- The UN COP27 climate summit in Egypt, which saw polarised debates on responsibility and accountability among the global North and South, drew praise on Sunday for the landmark decision of creation of a "loss and damage" fund to help developing countries in efforts to avert, minimise and address loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change in the light of continued global warming. But there was also anger over a failure to push further efforts on cutting emissions to keep alive the aspirational goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels. Jubilation over the loss and damage fund was countered by stern warnings. UN chief Antonio Guterres said the UN climate talks had "taken an important step towards justice" with the loss and damage fund, but fallen short in pushing for the urgent carbon-cutting needed to tackle global warming. COP27 statement covering the broad array of the world's efforts to grapple with a warming planet held the line on the aspirational goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels. It also included language on renewable energy for the first time, while reiterating previous calls to accelerate "efforts towards the phasedown of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies". One of the main contentions on the Loss and Damage funding issue was that developed countries were pushing to expand the donor base to include high income countries and emerging economies like China and India and wanted to narrow the beneficiaries to only most vulnerable (island nations and least developed countries). EU had also sought to link the formation of the Loss and Damage facility to mitigation efforts such as peaking global emissions before 2025; reaffirming the call to reduce by 2030 non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions like methane; pushing all parties to urgently increase their efforts to closing the remaining mitigation gap to pathways consistent with 1.5 degrees; accelerating the phase down of unabated coal power as soon as possible and submit roadmaps towards this aim, HT had reported on November 18. But following overnight negotiations and efforts to find compromise, the issue of source of funding has now been moved to the transitional committee. EU and UK have been extremely disappointed with the Sharm El Sheikh package. In a scolding intervention as the talks went into Sunday morning, European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans said the EU was "disappointed" with a lack of ambition on reducing emissions. "What we have in front of us is not enough of a step forward for people and planet," he said. "It doesn't bring enough added efforts from major emitters to increase and accelerate their emission cuts." UN chief Guterres said the COP27 resolution managed to uphold climate justice. " COP27 took place not far from Mount Sinai, a site that is central to many faiths and to the story of Moses, or Musa. It's fitting. Climate chaos is a crisis of biblical proportions. The signs are everywhere. Instead of a burning bush, we face a burning planet. From the beginning, this conference has been driven by two overriding themes: justice and ambition. Justice for those on the frontlines who did so little to cause the crisis - including the victims of the recent floods in Pakistan that inundated one-third of the country. Ambition to keep the 1.5 degree C limit alive and pull humanity back from the climate cliff. This COP has taken an important step towards justice. I welcome the decision to establish a loss and damage fund and to operationalise it in the coming period," he said. India called COP27 "Our proposal on sustainable lifestyles and consumption has been taken on board and on cover decision. It was conceived in India's Lifestyle For Environment movement. We supported the Loss and Damage facility and suggested that the fund benefit all developing countries. We played a constructive role and the outcome is good," Yadav said. "It's a historical day in Climate change negotiations when it has been acknowledged after thirty years that increasing disasters causing Loss and Damage (both economic and non economic) affecting communities/countries which are least responsible for it are caused due to historic cumulative emissions. Efforts have begun by creating a Funding arrangement to address such a facility," Said Kunal Satyarthi, joint secretary, National Disaster Management Authority and India's lead negotiator on Loss and Damage. After overnight consultations and negotiations on these matters, when the COP27 president Sameh Shoukry hit the gavel on Loss and Damage fund, the plenary reverberated with loud applause.

November 22 -- The 2022 United Nations Conference of the Parties, more commonly referred to as COP27 , was held between November 6 and November 18, 2022, in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The conference included more than 90 heads of state and an estimated 35,000 representatives, or delegates, from 190 countries. These conferences are aimed at encouraging and guiding countries to take effective action against climate change. While the conferences address a larger set of issues, the built environment is recognized as playing a major role in ensuring that sustainability targets are achieved. The Building to COP27 , a group of sustainability-focused built environment NGOs and organizations, is working to position the built environment as a critical sector to achieve the needed transition to a resilient and zero emissions future at COP conferences. The group aims to raise awareness of the impact that the building sector can have while pointing out that more drastic measures need to be taken, as most countries do not include full building decarbonization targets, and certain areas, such as building materials are under-addressed. COP27 restated the importance of reducing carbon emissions across the board, as the window of opportunity for keeping global temperatures below a 1.5\'b0C increase narrows. As the carbon sector is responsible for more than 23% of global GHG emissions and consumes more than 30% of global resources, this subject has important consequences for the building industry. During this year's conference, the Clean Construction Accelerator was announced, an act that hopes to support the built environment sector in halving emissions by 2030 for all new buildings and infrastructure projects. A number of private practices have announced their support for this goal. The percentage of construction companies, by revenue, that have joined the Race to Zero has doubled since COP26. Coinciding with the start of COP27 , Arup has announced its commitment to undertaking whole lifecycle carbon assessments for all its building projects, new and retrofit, starting next year. Arup estimates that less than 1% of buildings projects are currently evaluated in a way that quantifies the scale and source of carbon emissions generated during their lifespans, a step that is essential if the most effective decarbonization actions are to be identified. A report by Arup and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development suggests that 50% of the whole-life emissions from buildings come from embodied carbon, the carbon generated from the manufacturing and transportation of building materials and the construction process itself. This aspect is often overlooked by other carbon assessment measurements. Despite the focus on operational CO2 emissions from the building sector, this category registered a peak in 2021, 2% higher than in 2019 and 5% higher than in 2020. The whole lifecycle carbon assessment promised by Arup incorporates both embodied and operational carbon. Resilient Development for the Global SouthOne of the key topics at COP27 was the necessity of building climate resilience in the countries in the Global South, a subject underlined by the fact that this was the first Conference of the Parties to be held outside of Europe since the COP22 in Marrakech in 2016. Campaigns were launched to address the lack of access to safe and decent houses for the most vulnerable communities. The Roof Over Our Heads campaign aims to improve the lives of 2 billion climate-vulnerable people living in informal settlements by 2050. The WorldGBC Guide to Climate Resilience and Adaptation in the Built Environment was also launched ahead of COP27 to provide actionable principles for implementing climate resilience and actionable strategies across the built environment value chain.At an urban level, signatories to the Cities Race to Resilience have more than doubled since 2021, an initiative that strives to ensure that climate resilience goals are treated with the same urgency as the global race to halve emissions by 2030. Similarly, the Summary for Urban Policy Makers was launched, with actionable policy guides for city and urban policymakers to decarbonize and build the resilience of urban environments. \</doc>

The second phase of a global project that helps three countries particularly vulnerable to climate change adaptation to improve their food security and nutrition was launched on the sidelines of the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm-El Sheikh, Egypt. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Government of the Canadian province of Quebec have signed a new technical and financial partnership to help Cte dIvoire, Haiti, and Senegal adapt to climate change. This is the second phase of a 2018 global project: Strengthening agricultural adaptation (SAGA). Since its inception, SAGA has built up a robust record of helping communities in Senegal and Haiti enjoy more nutritious diets and food security and will now extend assistance to a third country, Cte dIvoire. The project brings together civil society members, researchers, and governments to help create policy, improve farmers capacities, develop science-based data, and create tools to overcome climate change. The SAGA project has proven a fruitful collaboration between ministries, civil society, and research, placing adaptation of agrifood systems at the heart of climate solutions. We have solid foundations to renew and intensify our joint action, said Maria Helena Semedo, FAO Deputy-Director General. One of the key components of the SAGA project is the protection of biodiversity and the ecosystem by building on traditional knowledge and acknowledging the important role of rural women and youth in tackling the climate crisis. Climate-resilient agriculture in focus Over three years, SAGA has trained some 1600 farmers on resilient and sustainable practices in Senegal and Haiti and developed 11 scientific studies to enhance adaptation planning. By teaming up with civil society organizations and research centers, the program has produced data on the vulnerability of agriculture sectors and hydrological resources in Senegal and on the drivers of the adoption of resilient practices by farmers in Haiti. The results of both activities have informed planning processes such as National Adaptation Plans (NAP) and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC). In Senegal, SAGA trained 100 experts from the government on finance mechanisms for climate action and tools for assessing sustainability and vulnerability. It also produced two regional outlook studies in addition to a guidance document to facilitate NDC implementation. In Haiti, a practical guide to slow the pace of global warming and adapt techniques to tackle such changes by prioritizing best practices is being drafted. Martine Biron, Quebecs Minister of International Relations welcomed the deal, noting how in just a few years, the Government of Quebec has positioned itself as an active and credible player with FAO, giving value to the interest it has expressed in Quebecs leadership and expertise. Quebec remains committed to food security and to offering financially support to its partners, she said. The new technical and financial partnership between FAO and Quebec will operate from 2023 to 2026 with targets aligned with FAOs Strategy on Climate Change. \</doc>

Times at CLIMATE MEET Sharm el-Sheikh (Egypt): Over 190 participating countries, including India, on the first day of the UN climate conference on Sunday agreed to include funding for loss and damage in the agenda for the COP27 . It's an important step towards working out a mechanism to support poor and vulnerable countries who have to face the impacts of climate change due to historical emissions of rich nations.  We have always been in support of bringing 'loss and damage' finance to the COP agenda. India will contribute effectively for devising a mechanism in the interest of developing countries, said India's environment minister Bhupender Yadav who is leading a team of 18 negotiators at the annual climate talks which was opened on Sunday with the key aim of ensuring full implementation of the Paris Agreement. For more than a decade, wealthy nations have rejected official discussions on what is referred to as loss and damage, or funds they provide to help poor countries cope with the conse- quences of global warming. COP27 president Sameh Shoukry told the plenary the decision created  an institutionally stable space for discussion of  the pressing issue of funding arrangements . At COP26 last year in Glasgow, high-income nations blocked a proposal for a loss and damage financing body, instead supporting a threeyear dialogue for funding discussions. The loss and damage discussions now on the COP27 agenda will not guarantee compensation or necessarily acknowledge liability, but are intended to lead to aconclusive decision  no later than 2024 , Shoukry said.Times at It is believed that the loss and damage finance will be the most consequential negotiation topic at COP27 where the countries would try to institutionalise the facility to help people in poor and vulnerable countries recover from the impacts of the climate-change induced extreme weather events such as floods, drought, cyclones and rising of sea levels. The focus on addressing loss and damage means the discussion this year will go beyond mitigation and adaptation actions. Of course, the other critical issue of climate finance will remain on the table.  India looks forward to substantial pro- gress in the discussions related to climate finance. We also look forward to the introduction of new technologies, and new collaborations to facilitate technology transfers, said Yadav while inaugurating the India pavilion which is showcasing LiFE (lifestyle for environment) as its theme in sync with the country's stand on this issue. India is spearheading the Mission LiFE as a global mass movement that harnesses the power of individual and collective action across the world to address the climate crisis. It aims to resurrect the delicate balance between man and nature by encouraging a shift from mindless and wasteful consumption to mindful and deliberate utilisation to protect and preserve the environment. Mission LiFE is designed to mobilise at least one billion Indians and other global citizens to take individual and collective action for protecting and preserving the environment in the period 2022 to 2027. Within India, at least 80% of all villages and urban local bodies are aimed to become environmentfriendly by 2028. \</doc>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: 58px;">T</span></strong></span></span>he 27th Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), held at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt, began with low expectations. But defying all presumptions, it has achieved four key outcomes that will have far-reaching implications for energy transition and international climate collaboration.</p> <ol> <li><strong>It got developed countries to agree on something they</strong> had refused for three decades pay for climate disasters in developing countries. Wealthy countries have always stalled any deal on Loss and Damage (LandD) because it exposes them to liability for their historic contribution to the climate crisis. They did that in Sharm El-Sheikh as well. Ultimately, under tremendous pressure from developing countries, they agreed to a new funding window for LandD, but with many caveats attached to the fund. For instance, the fund will only support countries most vulnerable to climate change (which might not include India), and funding will not only come from developed countries but from a "mosaic" of sources, which could include emerging economies and wealthy countries from the global south. Nevertheless, with the LandD deal, the framework for international climate collaboration is complete mitigation to avert disaster, adaptation to minimise damage and LandD to compensate for losses. Of all three, it is cheapest to mitigate and most expensive to pay for LandD. This should motivate big polluters to cut emissions rather than be liable to pay billions for floods, droughts and cyclones.</li> <li><strong> COP27 also negotiated something that no UN climate</strong> conference had done before: phasing out fossil fuels, the essential element to limit global warming. And it is to the credit of India that this discussion took place. Last year at Glasgow, while nations agreed to phase down coal power to limit global warming, they kept silent on oil and gas due to pressure from big oil- and gas-dependent economies. This time, India pointed out the need to phase down use of fossil fuels and got the support of nearly 80 countries, including the US, and EU nations. Unfortunately, the oil and gas phase-down was excluded from the final decision due to opposition from Saudi Arabia and Russia. Nevertheless, Sharm El-Sheikh has set in motion the process to phase out all fossil fuels, and it is a matter of time before this is accepted at a future COP.</li> <li><strong>Just transition implementing a people-centric transition</strong> to phase down fossil fuels emerged as a crucial pivot to reduce emissions from fossil fuel-dependent developing countries. Mid-way through COP27 , a $20 billion deal was struck between Indonesia and G7 countries at the G20 meeting in Bali to phase down coal use in Indonesia. Called Just Energy Transition Partnership (JET-P), South Africa and G7 signed a similar deal worth $8.5 billion last year. A JET-P agreement was also offered to India, which it rightly postponed for future negotiations. Taking a cue from JET-P, at COP27 , parties have agreed to negotiate a possible future agreement to scale up support for just transition in other developing countries. Most likely, the future financial deal between the developed and developing countries would be through just transition partnerships.</li> <li><strong> COP27 has further diluted the traditional</strong> classification of developed and developing countries, as outlined in the 1992 convention. The question of who should pay for LandD brought focus on China, the largest current emitter and second-largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases. The fact that China is putting billions into the Belt and Road Initiative but prefers to be called a developing country at the UNFCCC was questioned by many countries, developed and developing. The same applies to nations like Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Singapore. It is clear that from now on, countries like China will find it challenging to avoid greater responsibility for the climate crisis. There will also be pressure on India to contribute more, as it is traditionally bracketed with China at the UNFCCC. Overall, COP27 has changed the nature of international negotiations. It is crucial for the government of India to recognise these shifts and revisit its negotiating strategy to advance the nation's development and climate agenda together.</li> </ol> <hr /> <p><em>The writer is CEO, International Forum for Environment, Sustainability and Technology (iFOREST)</em></p> \</doc>

At the 27th Session of Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC ( COP 27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, the India Pavilion hosted a side event on "Transformative Green Education: Experiences from India", today. This side event involved deliberations by officials and experts from the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH), Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and Deutsche Gesellschaft f\'fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH highlighting the need to encourage a sustainable lifestyle for the environment among children through innovative techniques, tools and methods. \~ Shri Bhupender Yadav, Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India gave the keynote address and released a book (both print and digital versions), calendar, postcards, bookmarks, and posters based on paintings by Indian schoolchildren on sustainable lifestyles, collected by the NMNH. On this occasion the Minister also released a short video on green transformative education. Experiences from India were also shared in the panel discussion. Addressing the gathering at India Pavilion, Egypt and children who joined virtually from India, the minister congratulated all the children who actively contributed to this campaign and said: "We have not inherited this earth from our ancestors but we have borrowed it from our children. It is a loan we have got from them and it is our responsibility to lead a sustainable life so that our children have a safe place to live". About the Campaign: To inculcate the environment friendly lifestyle among the school children, National Museum of Natural History organized a National Level Painting Competition for the school students of class 6th to 8th on the theme - "LiFESTYLE FOR ENVIRONMENT" through colours. Over 16000 entries were received from the children from 24 states of the country. The entries presented a broad perspective of the children on the environment and their thoughts on how they would love to see their environment in the years to come. The wealth of paintings thus collected will be utilised in calendars, posts card, bookmarks, books and videos in collaboration with GIZ India. The selected paintings of this competition were displayed at the COP27 Side Event at the India Pavilion. For thematic focus and relevance NMNH and GIZ India have planned activities to facilitate experiential learning for school children on themes covering Lifestyle for Environment and Climate Change, which contributes towards India's NDC Goal 1. The activities include innovative permanent exhibits, climate change learning labs, outreach events and awareness programs. These are intended to enable school students to relate to the impacts of climate change on their lives, help them understand the science behind climate change, and find pragmatic solutions, especially nudging them to adopt climate-friendly lifestyles. For more information on this click here. Speaking on this occasion, Shri Bhupender Yadav said: "Mission LiFE is a collective, conscious global movement that is human-centric and is aligned with the local culture and tradition will have a huge positive impact on the ongoing efforts on fighting climate change. Within such a community led environmental movement, children play a crucial role in our efforts towards combating climate change. Nurturing a sensitivity towards environment in young minds is the need of the hour to ensure their persistent involvement in environmental protection, as well as meaningful actions. As a country with one of the youngest populations in the world, school children in India will act as proponents of sustainable habits within their families and communities. I also would like to highlight that the National Education Policy of India, released in 2020 emphasises on education to be experiential, holistic, integrated, inquiry-driven, discovery-oriented, learner-centred, and discussion-based. Developing a robust and healthy environmental consciousness is part of the core theme of the education policy today. We look forward to more collaborations from children across the country and globe on leading a sustainable lifestyle - a lifestyle that is conscious about generation of unwanted waste, consuming resources in the right quantity, conserving the precious resources of nature; and living in harmony with nature."

7 in 10 urban Indians endorse government spending on subsidies to make environment friendly technologies cheaper (solar panels, electric vehicles) At least 7 in 10 urban Indians (72 per cent) endorse government spending on subsidies to make environment friendly technologies cheaper, e.g. solar panels, electric vehicles etc, shows a survey. "Some of the policy changes can offset the impact on climate change and further degradation. There is a strong case for adoption of environment friendly technologies with a lower carbon foot print like solar panels and electric vehicles. Govt investment to provide accessability to more number of people, through building of infrastructure and making it easy on the pocket, will lead to greater adoption," says Amit Adarkar, CEO, Ipsos India. Ipsos Global survey was conducted around the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference more commonly referred to as the Conference of the Parties of the UNFCC or COP 27 Summit is underway in Egypt's Sharm El Sheikh, 06th-18th Nov, 2022, which aims to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement. A treaty endorsed and crtiticized for combating climate change. Urban Indians support many other policy changes to combat the adverse impact of climate change. According to the survey, 69 per cent urban Indians support incentives for investing in green financial products and services, like pensions; 64 per cent urban Indians polled support changing product pricing to make environmentally friendly products cheaper and environmentally damaging products more expensive; 64 per cent urban Indians support giving more road space to pedestrians and cyclists, at the expense of motorists ; 58 per cent support increasing taxes on more environmentally damaging travel, for example for flights, diesel vehicles etc.; 57 per cent support banning petrol/ gas, diesel powered vehicles from central areas in cities and towns to create vehicle free zones; 57 per cent urban Indians support higher taxes on red meat and dairy products that have a bigger carbon footprint; 56 per cent support requiring all food outlets to provide vegan options, among others. About 54 per cent urban Indians believe the onus about educating the public about actions to combat climate change lies with the government departments/ ministers/ elected officials. 43 per cent feel it is the responsibility of local government and 37 per cent put the onus on news media. Global citizens too put the primary responsibility on govt departments (59 per cent), local govt (43 per cent) and news media (34 per cent). With the crisis around climate change brimming over, while the responsibility lies with everyone to save the planet, but the power custodians can set the tone in the implementation and awareness generation campaign to reduce more harm to the planet by informed actions," added Adarkar. \</doc>

India, Nov. 6 -- Loss and damage financinghas been a long-standing demand of developing and vulnerable countries including India Countries have agreed to discuss providing financial support to address loss and damage caused by climate change at the 27 th Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. The decision was taken as COP27 kicked off in the Red Sea resort town. It may have significant bearing for low-lying vulnerable coastal areas including the Sundarbans , the world's largest delta shared by India and Bangladesh. Loss and damage finance is a mechanism to support areas and communities that have already been severely affected by climatic impact. It has been a long-standing demand of developing and vulnerable countries including India. But developed countries so far have blocked the process. The issue was pushed in the 26th Conference of Parties in Glasgow, UK last year by developing countries. But the developed block, led by the United States, managed to turn the loss and damage provision to a dialogue on the last day. Developed countries are the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases and hence are likely to be pushed to provide the bulk of the funding. They finally allowed the item to be formally discussed as the developing countries and civil society threatened severe implications in the event of a refusal. The discussion will conclude within two years. "It's a very welcome start to COP27 and now we can discuss the modalities of the process in a formal manner. The United Kingdom and other developed countries more or less accepted it before but the US was not accepting," Saleemul Huq, a senior climate scientist and advisor to least developed countries, told this reporter. However, the developed countries accepted the agenda with a trade-off that it would not include 'compensation and liability' targeting to evade historical responsibility of emissions.

India, Oct. 25 -- The United Nations climate conference - Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) - will convene in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, early next month (November 6 and 18). However, while COP27 has been christened as COP of implemen-tation, the road is littered with several obstacles: The energy crisis, thanks to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, continuing coronavirus pandemic, and a global economic downturn, and as Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav, said, the widening gap between the pledges made at COP26 in 2021 by the developed countries and the actions taken by them. On Friday, Mr Yadav again raised the issue of climate finance and how the West has failed to pay for the damages it has caused. In an earlier interview with this newspaper, he said that the focus for India at COP27 India updated its nationally determined contribution in August. But its ambitious climate goals can be met only if it gets adequate funds. According to the IFSCA Expert Committee on Sustainable Finance report, India will require investments of $10 trillion to achieve the net-zero target by 2070. Without any real progress on finance, there will be no equity in climate negotiations and, crucially, no energy transition. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Mumbai.

Highlights :  It will be a first-of-its-kind living atlas intended to map and measure all utility-scale solar and wind installations on Earth.  Microsoft is providing the AI and platform technology, Planet Labs is contributing the underlying satellite imagery, and The Nature Conservancy is overlaying the subject-matter expertise to analyze the output. Microsoft said that this will be done using artificial intelligence and satellite imagery that will allow users to evaluate clean energy transition progress and track trends over time. The initial mapping of solar and wind installations will be done in Germany and India; also solar installations in Brazil and Egypt are completed. GRW will be publicly available renewable energy atlas with country-by-country insights into production progress and development trends. GRW will have to satellite data dating back to 2018 and it will be updates twice annually. The atlas will show countries' renewable energy capacity, assist in understanding that capacity, and recognize patterns about the potential impact of the renewable energy siting on the landscape over time rather than as a moment in time. The GRW inventory will be completed by early 2023 and the results then will undergo both scientific and technical validation. For this joint program, Microsoft is providing the AI and platform technology, Planet is contributing the underlying satellite imagery, and The Nature Conservancy is overlaying the subject-matter expertise to analyze the output. "The theme for Climate Week NYC this year is 'getting it done,' and to do that, we need to move from pledges to progress," said The Nature Conservancy's CEO Jennifer Morris. The CEO said that GRW will help researchers and policymakers understand current capacities and gaps so that decision-makers can scale much-needed renewable energy resources in a responsible, nature-friendly way. Microsoft said that the partners will continue to map additional countries and are aiming to build awareness of the tool among those tasked with managing the world's clean energy transition in the weeks leading up to and during the United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP27 , taking place in Sharm El-Sheik, Egypt in November, 2022. Juan Lavista Ferres, VP and Chief Data Scientist, Microsoft, said that GRW will serve as a critical tool for understanding humanity's progress toward fulfilling the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement and meeting the United Nations' goal to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. \</doc>

Sharm El Sheikh, Nov. 20 -- Negotiators from around the world salvaged climate talks from the brink of collapse late on Saturday, sealing a historic agreement on creating a "loss and damage" (L&D) fund to help vulnerable nations deal with the impact of global warming, a key victory for developing countries after days of hard parleys that pitched the Global North against the South. Vulnerable countries and environmental experts said the agreement on L&D acknowledges the impact of climate change, particularly since the warming of 1.1degC till now has led to large disruptions on lives and livelihoods across several parts of the world. At the same time, however, the deal fell short of what many said could have been a more ambitious stance on reining in emissions, and did not include a wider target on all fossil fuels, as proposed by India and several other nations. "It's a historical day in climate change negotiations when it has been acknowledged after thirty years that increasing disasters causing loss and damage (both economic and non-economic) affecting communities/countries which are least responsible for it are caused due to historic cumulative emissions. Efforts have begun by creating a funding arrangement to address such a facility," said Kunal Satyarthi, joint secretary, National Disaster Management Authority and India's lead negotiator on loss and damage. From India's perspective, the victories included the climate conference's ( COP27 ) endorsement of the sustainable lifestyle mission, and a clause regarding energy transitions, which did not single out any particular fossil fuel. "Our proposal on sustainable lifestyles and consumption has been taken on board and on cover decision. It was conceived in India's Lifestyle For Environment (LiFE) movement. We supported the loss and damage facility and suggested that the fund benefit all developing countries. We played a constructive role and the outcome is good," said Bhupender Yadav, Union environment minister, at Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt, where COP27 was held. An Indian delegate, who asked not to be named, added: "We have achieved a good breakthrough in just energy transitions because it talks about diversifying energy mixes and doesn't single out any one fossil fuel. It is important for us." Earlier, at the plenary after the COP27 cover text was drawn up, Yadav said the "world has waited far too long for this", referring to the L&D facility, while congratulating the COP27 presidency. "For most developing countries, just transition cannot be equated with decarbonization, but with low-carbon development. Developing countries need independence in their choice of energy mix, and in achieving the SDGs (sustainable development goals)," he said. The decision on L&D states that keeping the global average temperature rise to below 1.5degC will be essential to limiting future loss and damage, and expressed alarm that Working Group II to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has concluded that the gravity, scope and frequency of loss and damage will continue to increase with every additional fraction of a degree of temperature increase. The talks decided a transitional committee will decide the modalities - such as how the payouts will be made under the fund and the sources - which will be considered at COP28 to be held in November or December, 2023. One of the contentions on the L&D issue was that developed countries were pushing to expand the donor base to include high income countries and emerging economies like China and India, and wanted to narrow the beneficiaries to only most vulnerable (island nations and least developed countries). EU also sought to link the formation of the L&D facility to mitigation efforts such as peaking global emissions before 2025; reaffirming the call to reduce by 2030 non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions like methane; pushing all parties to urgently increase their efforts to closing the remaining mitigation gap to pathways consistent with 1.5 degrees; accelerating the phase down of unabated coal power as soon as possible and submitting roadmaps towards this aim, HT reported on November 18. But, following overnight negotiations and efforts to find compromise, the issue of source of funding has now been moved to the transitional committee. The Sharm El Sheikh Implementation Plan recognizes the impact of climate change on the cryosphere and the need for further understanding of these impacts, including of tipping points. This is possibly the first time a cop cover decision, a legal document mentions climate tipping points approaching beyond which adaptation will not be possible, said experts. Representatives of the European Union and the UK were disappointed with the outcome. They had pushed for consensus on peaking global emissions before 2025; accelerating the phase down of unabated coal power and submitting roadmaps to that effect; phasing out unabated fossil fuels and efforts to start the conversation on expanding the donor base to include high income and emerging economies - proposals that were thwarted. "Friends are only friends. If they also tell you things you might not want to hear. This is the make-or-break decade. But what we have in front of us is not enough of a step forward for people and that it is not big enough efforts for major emitters to increase and accelerate their emissions cuts. It does not bring a higher degree of confidence that we will achieve the commitments made on the Paris Agreement and in Glasgow last year. It does not address the growing gap between climate science and climate policies," said EU Climate Policy chief Frans Timmermans in a long and emotive speech at the closing plenary. UK's COP26 president Alok Sharma also said the Sharm El Sheikh decision is weak on many counts. "Indeed, those of us who came to Egypt to keep 1.5 of these alive and to respect what every single one was to bring to the basket, had to fight relentlessly to hold the line. We've had to battle to build on one of the key achievements of Glasgow, the call of all parties to revisit and strengthen their nationally determined contributions. We have ultimately reiterated that, and it is critical that commitment is delivered by all of us. But we also want to take definitive steps forward. We joined with many parties and proposed a number of measures that would have contributed to emissions reductions like peaking before 2025 which science tells us is necessary, not in this text. Phase down coal, not in this text; phase out all fossil fuels not in the text," he said. Experts, however, saw UK's and EU's stance as being duplicitous. "The scolding on mitigation progress by the EU smacks of duplicity. Without steep declines in developed country emissions and substantial new climate finance, keeping to 1.5degC will require squeezing energy demand in poor countries. Lack of progress on providing finance adds insult to injury," said Navroz Dubash, professor, Centre for Policy Research. Dubash added that "the creation of a loss and damage fund signals that it is now impossible for countries to claim an ethical climate stance without supporting this agenda". "Post Sharm we face a serious reckoning on 1.5degC. Not enough cuts in the North, not enough money to accelerate and understandable unwillingness to compromise development in the South. Something has to give and it may be 1.5," he added. But some vulnerable countries saw the progress as encouraging, if not ideal. "We have literally exhausted all of our efforts here at COP27 to bring home the climate action commitments our vulnerable people desperately need. Our ministers and negotiators have endured sleepless nights and endless days in an intense series of negotiations, determined to secure the establishment of a loss and damage response fund, keep 1.5 alive, and advance ambition on critical mitigation and adaptation plans. But after the pain comes the progress. Today, the international community has restored global faith in this critical process that is dedicated to ensuring no one is left behind. The agreements made at COP27 are a win for our entire world," said Molwyn Joseph, chair of Alliance of the Small Island States. Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary general, said the COP27 resolution managed to uphold climate justice. " COP27 took place not far from Mount Sinai, a site that is central to many faiths and to the story of Moses, or Musa. It's fitting. Climate chaos is a crisis of biblical proportions. The signs are everywhere. Instead of a burning bush, we face a burning planet. From the beginning, this conference has been driven by two overriding themes: justice and ambition. Justice for those on the frontlines who did so little to cause the crisis - including the victims of the recent floods in Pakistan that inundated one-third of the country. (And) ambition to keep the 1.5 degree C limit alive and pull humanity back from the climate cliff. This COP has taken an important step towards justice. I welcome the decision to establish a loss and damage fund and to operationalize it in the coming period," he said. COP27 was informally themed around implementation with a tagline 'together for implementation'. But the climate crisis seemed to take a back seat as politics around energy, accountability and mitigation efforts to keep warming to under 1.5degC took centre stage.

India, Nov. 25 -- The 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) ended last week in Egypt, and despite the many challenges and divergence of views, member-countries rose to the occasion. With COP27 being branded as the COP for Implementation, significant breakthroughs were achieved on key issues, the primary being the agreement on Loss and Damage funding, adaptation and encouraging mitigation work programmes that tackle emission reduction headfirst and catalyse impactful implementation. This keeps the global community on track towards the more ambitious Paris Agreement goal of keeping the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (C) above pre-industrial levels. From India's standpoint, the outcomes of COP27 have been significant as they accommodate concerns, views and suggestions proposed by us individually and as the collective voice of the developing nations. The Sharm El Sheikh Implementation Plan recognises that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions of 43% by 2030 relative to the 2019 level. The plan also recognises that "this requires accelerated action in this critical decade, on the basis of equity and the best available scientific knowledge, reflecting common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities [CBDR-RC] in the light of different national circumstances and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty". India has been a vocal supporter of the CBDR-RC approach in setting and meeting climate action targets for nations to ensure that in this joint fight to save the planet from the vagaries of the climate crisis, we remain mindful of historic polluters and the technological and financial gap that developing countries need to cover to make the green switch. The Implementation Plan urged the parties "that have not yet communicated new or updated nationally determined contributions to do so as soon as possible". India is among the 29 countries that have submitted enhanced NDCs after COP26 in Glasgow. It is also on the list of less than 60 parties that have submitted their Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy within one year of its net-zero announcement in Glasgow. The steps reflect the Narendra Modi government's commitment to be part of solutions in battling the climate crisis. Making a pitch for countries to move towards low-carbon development, the Implementation Plan calls for "targeted support to the poorest and most vulnerable in line with national circumstances and recognising the need for support towards a just transition." Furthermore, it recognised that "enhanced support for developing countries parties will allow for higher ambition in their actions." India highlighted that for most developing countries, just transition cannot be equated with decarbonisation, but with low-carbon development and that developing countries need independence in their choice of the energy mix, and in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). COP27 underlined the importance of focusing on all climate actions - mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology transfer and capacity building - not just mitigation. The Implementation Plan noted, "With serious concern the existing gap between current levels of adaptation and levels needed to respond to the adverse effect of climate change in line with findings from the contributions of Working Group II to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report." It urged parties to adopt a transformational approach to enhancing capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to the climate crisis. It also urged developed countries "to urgently and significantly scale up their provision of climate finance, technology transfer and capacity-building for adaptation so as to respond to the needs of developing country parties". India has long batted for the urgent need to give due importance to adaptation and discussion on whether the scale of resources is commensurate with the scale of the needs of developing countries. The Implementation Plan emphasises that a just and equitable transition encompasses pathways that include energy, socioeconomic, workforce and other dimensions, all of which must be based on nationally defined development priorities and have social protection to mitigate potential impacts associated with the transition and highlights the critical role of the instruments related to social solidarity and protection in mitigating the impacts of applied measures. The Implementation Plan document expressed "serious concern that the goal of developed country parties to mobilise jointly $100 billion per year by 2020 in the context of meaningful mitigation action and transparency on the implementation has not yet been met." For India, another significant aspect was the inclusion of "transition to sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of consumption and production in the efforts to address climate change" in the cover decision of the Sharm El Sheikh Implementation Plan. This step is in accordance with Mission LiFE, which encourages Lifestyle for Environment, launched by Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi with United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres on October 20. COP27 also sets the stage for moving towards the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on Climate Finance under the Paris Agreement. It acknowledged the need for substantive progress in the deliberations on the NCQG on Climate Finance, which will consider the needs and priorities of developing countries, including quantity, quality, access and sources of funding. As the Implementation Plan document focused on climate justice, addressing the concerns and issues faced by developing countries, India found its voice heard and captured in decisions at COP27 . PM Modi, under whom several international initiatives such as International Solar Alliance and Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure have taken shape, has repeatedly said that no country should be left behind in the fight against the climate crisis. India has made a special pitch for countries most vulnerable to the vagaries of the climate crisis and sought climate justice in climate negotiations. COP27 has raised the pitch for urgent action and implementation of promises in all areas, from finance to adaptation. As India contributes significantly to the fight against the climate crisis, it hopes that the global community, especially developed countries, will keep their promises too.

India, Nov. 29 -- COP27 was a grand spectacle; it created a sense of hyper-action, when it actually was about reversing the little gains made till now to combat this existential threat There was so much going on through the day at COP27 that negotiations, the real business of a COP, became the sideshow. Illustration: Yogendra Anand / CSE It is a sign of sheer desperation to say that the world has achieved "something" at the climate change conference of parties ( COP27 ) that just ended in the coastal Egyptian city of Sharm El-Sheikh. The fact is COP27 This meeting was a grand spectacle-almost like a mirage in the desert. It created a sense of hyper-action, when it actually was about reversing the little gains made till now to combat this existential threat. I was one of the 45,000-odd people at this conference. What struck me was that it was actually designed to take the heat off the negotiations. The organisers-the UN's climate change secretariat and our host, the Egyptian government-had set up hundreds of country and agency pavilions, each with small conference rooms where five to six events were held every day, each participated by 30-50 people. There was so much going on through the day that negotiations, the real business of a COP, became the sideshow. It had little influence on what governments should have agreed upon. So, do not be surprised when I say that the final decisions at COP27 were either no-decisions-all crucial texts remained heavily bracketed (UN language for when parties disagree) until they were finally agreed upon in the early morning of November 20-or, to put it mildly, regressive. We just do not have the courage to call it out. Take the issue of loss and damage, seen as the big achievement of COP27 . Read Down To Earth's full coverage of COP27 The Sharm El-Sheikh Implementation Plan "expresses deep concern regarding the significant financial costs associated with loss and damage for developing countries" associated with the adverse effects of climate change. The only "decision" is that by 2023, it will select the host country for the secretariat. In this way, there is no agreement to create a fund; no agreement who will pay for it; but there is a new categorisation that all this will be directed towards countries that are particularly vulnerable. Who and what are they? This is where the politics begins. Should bigger developing countries like India also pay to other developing countries for loss and damage? This question was raised repeatedly at COP27 and, of course, led to pushback. Then, does India qualify as particularly vulnerable because it has mountains and coastlines? This will be contested at the next round of negotiations and will go nowhere, even as natural disasters reach catastrophic levels and deeply damage people and economies. This is why the world needed to return to a rule-based system of climate governance. We know that the growing intensity and frequency of weather disasters are linked to climate change, which in turn is linked to the stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Therefore, it is a simple proposition, all well established in law, that the country responsible for the pollution must pay. This is why loss and damage discussions are about liability and compensation. In this rule-based scenario, it would be established that a country like India would also contribute to the fund, but only when it has crossed a certain agreed threshold of greenhouse gas emissions. This rule-based governance was not convenient to the big polluters. So, it was taken apart in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Now, there is no agreed way to differentiate between the polluters, and this gives a country like China a free pass. China is yesterday's US; its per capita emissions will be equal to the US in 2030. It should have been moved to the category of polluters. But it continues to hide behind the Group of 77-all developing countries. Frankly, the Group of 77 also finds the power of China convenient for it to take shelter under. The zero-sum game continues. At our cost. But why do I say COP27 was regressive? This is because for the first time, the agreement has decided to differentiate between the white and black fossil fuels. At the very last moment, it added the term "low-emission energy" in the clean energy mix-a tacit way of saying that natural gas is cleaner as it emits half the carbon dioxide of coal. This is what the EU did when it baptised natural gas as clean. And we know that this part of the world, which requires deep decarbonisation, is desperately digging for more natural gas in all parts of the world, including the host country Egypt. This is not alright. The world is speeding towards breaching the 1.5degC temperature rise guardrail. At 1.1degC, we are seeing such massive devastation and human pain. We cannot be parties to this procrastination and lack of intent. The least we can do is to call it out for what it is: a massive and tragic failure to act.

Showing remarkable political will, over 195 countries on Sunday agreed at the conclusion of the COP27 climate talks at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, to set up a  loss and damage fund for supporting poor vulnerable countries that are victims of extreme weather, worsened by cumulative emissions of rich nations. However, they could not agree to  phase down all fossil fuels even as India and most EU nations wanted it included in the final COP27 decision to keep the 1.5-degree C goal alive to limit global warming. The issue of  loss and damage found place in the agenda for the first time and the task of setting up a new fund looked difficult but the rich countries, including EU and the US, showed flexibility to make it happen. They argued that the fund's donor base should also be big economies like China and the beneficiaries must include only poor vulnerable countries. The points of donor base and beneficiaries will, however, be clarified by next year as big economies like India and China have not been in favour of being mandatory contributors to the fund. From India's point of view, inclusion of  transition to sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of consumption and production in the COP27 cover decision is the big takeaway as the country has long been pitching for a paradigm shift from mindless and destructive consumption (in rich nations) to mindful and deliberate utilisation of resources to combat climate change.  Inclusion of sustainable lifestyle is the most significant for us. It is PM Modi who has made the pitch for an environmentally-friendly lifestyle through his mantra of Mission LiFE (lifestyle for environment) and the world today moved in that direction by including it in the implementation plan to address climate change, said environment minister Bhupender Yadav while welcoming the move. After initial hiccups, the final outcome of the COP27 also retains the Glasgow climate pact's points on mitigation   phase down of unabated coal power and  phase out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies with conditions that's suitable for India. The inclusion of  sustainable lifestyle in the final COP27 document was significant for India, environment minister Bhupender Yadav told TOI .  PM Modi had made the pitch and the world moved in that direction, Yadav said. \</doc>

Nov. 14 -- E.SUN BANK issued the following news release: - The 27th United Nations Climate Summit ( COP27 ) is currently underway in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The theme of this year's summit focuses on "Climate Mitigation, Climate Adaptation, Climate Finance (Finance) and Multilateral Cooperation (Collaboration)" Four main axes... The 27th United Nations Climate Summit ( COP27 ) is currently underway in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The theme of this year's summit focuses on "Climate Mitigation, Climate Adaptation, Climate Finance (Finance) and Multilateral Cooperation (Collaboration)" Four main axes. Yushan Bank has been committed to ESG and sustainable finance for a long time. Chairman Huang Nanzhou was invited to participate in COP27 , and presented "Taiwan Climate New Finance "Speech speech, sharing Taiwan's renewable energy development experience and how the financial industry can support enterprises to face net-zero transformation. The wonderful sharing received positive feedback from many guests on site, including Dr. Walid from the Department of Transformation and Resilience of OECD, Lora-Ann, Director of Business Development Department of Asset Management ONE under Mizuho Group, and Sherief, Partner of Climate Resilience Venture Capital. Thank you from the chairman. The World Climate Summit has been held since 2010. It brings together leaders from the government, industry, academia and civic organizations to discuss. , dense high-tech industries, and independent power grids, zero-carbon energy transition has become a huge challenge for Taiwan to move towards net zero emissions by 2050. However, thanks to the active cooperation between the government and the private sector, benefiting from the abundant wind energy reserves in the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan has vigorously developed offshore wind power, and has also rapidly deployed multiple renewable energy sources such as solar photovoltaics and fishery power symbiosis, striving to achieve a balance between environmental protection and energy demand. , these experiences can be used as a reference for other island countries. As a member of Taiwan's "Sustainable Finance Pioneers Alliance", Yushan not only actively supports the development of wind power, solar photovoltaic, geothermal and energy storage industries, but also launched the "Yushan ESG Sustainability Initiative". At present, 133 like-minded companies have been called to jointly initiate the initiative , hoping to use financial influence to make more companies pay attention to climate issues and work together towards the goal of net zero emissions by 2050. On the topic of "Together For Implementation" (Together For Implementation) of COP27 , Yushan starts from itself and continues to meet the highest international standards, including exchanges and learning with international organizations such as SBTi, PCAF, The Climate Group, and World Climate Foundation. Through in-depth understanding International thinking, effectively importing standards internally. For example, Yushan has joined RE100 in 2022, and is the first bank in Taiwan and the third bank in the world to pass the SBTi carbon reduction target audit. Through greenhouse gas inventory, setting carbon reduction targets, introducing internal carbon pricing and gradually withdrawing capital from coal We have systematically carried out the net-zero transformation and have shown initial results. Extreme climate is an issue that the world needs to face together, and net zero is the goal that we must work together to achieve. Yushan believes that action can create change, and cooperation can gather strength. Through the joint cooperation of the government, industry, financial institutions, and civil organizations, everyone can exert influence in their respective fields, and they will surely gather into a positive force that affects the world and move forward together. A beautiful home to net zero. Disclaimer: The Above Content is Auto-Translated [Category: Partnerships and Alliances] \</doc>

India, Oct. 25 -- The United Nations climate conference --- COP27 --- will convene in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, early next month (November 6 and 18). However, while COP27 has been christened as COP of implementation, the road is littered with several obstacles: The energy crisis, thanks to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, continuing Covid-19, and a global economic downturn, and as Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav, said, the widening gap between the pledges made at COP26 in 2021 by the developed countries and the actions taken by them. On Friday, participating at a virtual meeting of likeminded developed countries, Mr Yadav again raised the issue of climate finance and how the West has failed to pay for the damages it has caused. In an earlier interview with this newspaper, the environment minister said that the focus for India at COP27 India updated its nationally determined contribution (NDC) in August. But its ambitious climate goals can be met only if it gets adequate funds. According to government calculations presented in Parliament a few years ago (based on the earlier NDC), India will need at least $2.5 trillion to meet its 2030 climate targets. It translates into $170 billion every year till 2030. But the updated NDC is much more ambitious and so the requirement for funds will be much more. According to the IFSCA Expert Committee on Sustainable Finance report, India will require investments of $10 trillion to achieve the net-zero target by 2070. Without any real progress on finance, there will be no equity in climate negotiations and, crucially, no energy transition.

India, Nov. 9 -- COP27 , the annual "conference of the parties" hosted by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, began this weekend in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, drawing tens of thousands of global activists, diplomats, and heads of state. They will be joined at the conference by dozens of students, faculty, and staff from the Yale School of the Environment and Yale University who will participate in key decision-making and negotiations centered on global climate action. This year's conference takes place against the backdrop of a growing energy crisis, rising inflation, and an ongoing conflict in Ukraine - all of which impact critical environmental issues. This is also the first UN climate summit since the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment report, which painted the starkest picture yet of our rapidly changing climate and the ever-increasing threats posed to people and ecosystems if urgent action is not taken. It also will be the first conference held on the African continent since 2011. The setting is expected to put a heightened focus on the Global South, where millions of people from low-emitting countries and regions are deeply impacted by the effects of climate change caused by the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitters. "With every slightest increment of warming, the impacts will only get worse, with a disproportionate impact on those who are still developing - and lack the resources and means to protect themselves - through implementing effective climate action," Sameh Shoukry, Egypt's Minister of Foreign Affairs and COP27 President-designate, said in a recent statement. During the two-week conference, students from YSE and Yale will provide support in areas such as climate finance, environmental justice, natural climate solutions, and ecosystem preservation. They will represent a range of NGOs and environmental organizations, including The Nature Conservancy, the Alliance of Small Island States, the Environmental Defense Fund, the International Union of Forest Research Organizations, and the Clean Air Task Force. Before leaving for Sharm el Sheikh, several YSE students shared their plans for COP27 and what they hope to achieve through their participation. "For COP27 , I will partner with The Nature Conservancy Chile with the purpose of identifying and reporting key outcomes of discussions - including trends, challenges, opportunities, new technologies - around natural climate solutions. The goal is to facilitate TNC's follow-up of climate negotiation implications for local action and build internal capacities to align project development to the current trends. I am excited to participate at the forefront of discussions around natural climate solutions, which I believe have the potential to contribute significantly to solving the climate and ecological crisis, if the incentives are placed correctly. "My research at YSE is focused on developing accurate emission baselines for forests in my home country of Chile, with the aim of reducing uncertainty and facilitating conservation and restoration project development. My purpose for attending COP27 is to obtain a more holistic understanding of natural climate solutions by getting involved in discussions related to finance, Indigenous community engagement, and governance. Hopefully, this broader perspective will allow me to promote project implementation in Chile and, in the future, contribute to international discussions from a project development perspective." "At COP27 "My master's thesis at YSE, advised by Dr. Dorceta Taylor, investigates the interlocking systems of power posed to Latina/x/e women when accessing food in the U.S. My experience at COP27 grants me the opportunity to share and further explore my research interests on a broader international scale. I am most excited to examine the proposed mitigation strategies in response to the cascading effects of the climate crisis on food production and security through the lenses of intersectionality, equity, and justice." "I will be working with the Regional Environmental Center for Central Asia at COP27 . CAREC is an independent, non-political and non-for-profit international organization with a regional mandate to assist Central Asian governments and regional and international stakeholders in addressing environmental and sustainability challenges across the Central Asian region and Afghanistan. I am excited to promote the Central Asian Climate Information Platform at COP27 - the first portal providing climate information of Central Asia - to various international stakeholders. "I am interested in the impacts of environmental pollution on human health, particularly vulnerable populations, and hope to pursue a doctoral degree focusing on environmental health issues in Central Asia after I graduate from YSE. At COP27 , I want to raise awareness of the environmental issues happening in Central Asia for an international audience and support my organization to attract green investments." "I am thrilled to attend COP27 with the organization that sponsored my attendance to the landmark COP21 in Paris, France: The Deep South Center for Environmental Justice. The women-led organization is based in New Orleans and is dedicated to improving the lives of people harmed by pollution and most vulnerable to climate change in the Gulf Coast region. I am helping lead their efforts to co-curate the first-ever Climate Justice Pavilion at the conference, which will be a space where people from the Global South, Indigenous nations, and communities experiencing environmental injustice in the U.S. can build the collective capacity to share local knowledge and create solutions for pressing issues at the human rights and climate change nexus. "My master's studies focus on designing urban ecosystems for climate adaptation, forest regeneration, and social equity. While in Egypt, it is my hope to leverage opportunities to learn more about community-oriented sustainable development, nature-based solutions for climate mitigation, and share the time, space, and energy with a diverse spectrum of thought leaders. Though I have attended COP twice in the past, this will be my first time both in the Blue Zone (where negotiations take place) and playing a leadership role to uplift crucial youth perspectives like my own." "I am working with Time for BETTER, a climate change communication agency. The mission of the organization is to 'bring together bright minds, bold learners, and diverse members of our climate community for a better world.' My excitement for COP27 lives in the hope that I have for the future and the determination that women - especially Indigenous, Black, and women of color - bring to the climate leadership space for ambitious, regenerative solutions. Earlier this semester, I interned for BETTER, leading programming and operations of our Climate Week NYC event series. After the internship ended, I was offered an opportunity to join the COP27 team as a videographer to bring my creative skills to the agency.

November 22 -- "Global warming" was decried as the cause of the apocalypse until relatively recently. Now it is "climate change," apparently because the data refused to comply. The UN's latest "climate change" jamboree was convened in Sharm el-Sheikh last week and produced what I thought was a widely heralded agreement to transfer funds from productive countries to unproductive countries. This is of course to ward off the apocalypse. Where is the Jonathan Swift who will subject these people to the ridicule they so richly deserve? Semafor is the newest of the sites to which I subscribe to keep up with the orthodoxies of the day. I take it as a good sign that Semafor's Tom Chivers reports in its Flagship edition this morning: " COP27 reaches bad-tempered end." That's the headline. Woo hoo! Chivers reports (bolding in original): The COP27 conference agreed that rich nations will pay poorer ones compensation for the damage caused by climate change. That was seen as a breakthrough, but many nations were left frustrated by the lack of progress on cutting carbon emissions. The summit came close to collapse after host Egypt refused to allow discussion of phasing out fossil fuels, and European Union ministers threatened to walk out. More fights await: Not least over whether China, now the biggest greenhouse gas emitter, contributes to the fund. I guess it's a good news/bad news situation. I have to say, however, I see Egypt with what the New York Times would call "strange new respect." \</doc>

To achieve its energy and climate goals, Africa needs $190 billion of investment a year, with two-thirds of this going to clean energy. A study by an African bank paints a mixed picture of the continents energy situation -- one of scarcity and abundance. This sets the tone for discussions at the premier global climate conference, COP27 , set to begin shortly in the city of Sharm-El-Sheikh located on Egypts Red Sea front. The report says that to achieve universal electricity access for the nearly 1.3 billion Africans, some 600 million of whom are off the grid, an annual investment of between $32 billion and $40 billion should be pumped into the energy value chain. The study, done under the auspices of the Banks New Deal on Energy for Africa, exposes a financing gap that stands between $17 billion and $25 billion, with the continents large economies like Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa accounting for some 33 per cent of this deficit. Africas most sophisticated economy, South Africa, is grappling with the worst energy crisis in years. Outages experienced by South Africa cost the continent 2 per cent to 4 per cent of its gross domestic product annually, according to the findings of the AfDB study. The study also reveals that between 2019 and 2020, some $15 billion, equivalent to 26 per cent of total climate finance, was channeled into Africas energy sector. The report shows that Africas energy investment needs are immense. The UN says that while a greater share of the global population gained access to electricity in the last decade, the number of people without electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa increased. According to the Sustainable Development Goal 7 tracking report, Africa is unlikely to meet the SDG7 targets. To achieve its energy and climate goals, Africa needs $190 billion of investment a year between 2026 and 2030, with two-thirds of this going to clean energy, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. Over 600 million Africans have no access to electricity Power consumption per capita in sub-Saharan Africa is the lowest globally at 370 kilowatt-hours (kWh) annually compared with 6,500 kWh (Europe) 11,000 kWh (United States) Universal access to energy crucial for achieving SDGs, including poverty eradication (SDG1) climate resilience (SDG13) At 46% in 2020, the share of fossil-based energy sources in Africas energy mix is modest compared with the share in other regions globally The principle of a just energy transition in Africa must consider past emissions how they shape future emission trajectories At 46 percent in 2020, the share of fossil-based energy sources in Africas energy mix is relatively modest compared with the share in other global regions. The World Bank, IEA and other partners have called on developed economies to provide more support to develop the energy and renewables sector in developing economies, including Africa. In July, to chart the continents comprehensive short-, medium- and long-term energy development strategy, the African Union (AU) Executive Council, meeting in Lusaka, Zambia, adopted the African Common Position on Energy Access and Just Transition. This is an important and major step towards ensuring and confirming Africas right for a differentiated path towards the goal of universal access to energy, ensuring energy security for our continent and strengthening its resilience, while at the same time acting responsibly towards our planet by improving the energy mix, AU Commissioner for Infrastructure and Energy Dr. Amani Abou-Zeid was quoted saying by Ghana News Agency (GNA). She made the remarks on the sidelines of the AU mid-year coordination meeting of the 41st Ordinary Session of the Executive Council: I urge stakeholders and potential public and private investors to accept and back Africas Common Position for Energy Access and Just Transition and support the African Unions various energy security initiatives. They are needed to develop technical and financial instruments and packages to fast-track Africas right to universal access to affordable and reliable electricity, added Dr Abou-Zeid. The principle behind the strategy is to ensure the acceleration of universal access to energy and transition, without damaging development initiatives. Undeniably, reliable and stable energy is critical for Africas economic development and growth. To meet the demands of its growing and urbanizing population, Africa must have a cost-effective, reliable and stable supply of energy, said Vincent Obisie-Orlu, a natural resource governance researcher at the Africa Policy Research Institute. The continents energy needs require the deployment of different sources -- a diverse mix of geothermal, nuclear, wind, hydro, solar and natural gas. Doing so ensures that the power grids of African countries are resilient to shocks. Mr. Obisie-Orlu attributes energy poverty in Africa to inadequate and poor planning, poor regulatory frameworks for electrification, underperforming state-owned enterprises, lack of investment in infrastructure and poor maintenance of existing energy and electricity infrastructure. Improvements in the regulatory framework for electrification and power pricing, in addition to better functioning of state-owned enterprises, will also support the goal of addressing energy poverty. With COP-27 , in Sharm-El-Sheikh, only a few weeks away, Africa reiterates its commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement, Senegalese President Macky Sall told the 77th session of the UN General Assembly in New York in September. Ms Sall is also the current Chair of the African Union. He added: At the same time, we wish to reach a consensus for a fair and equitable energy transition, as was called for at the Africa-Europe Summit last February, at the enlarged session of the G7 Summit in June and recently at the Africa Adaptation Finance Forum in Rotterdam. \</doc>

InterEnergy Group, one of the largest clean energy project developers, operators and owners in the Caribbean, Central and South America, and Bank of America, one of the world's leading financial institutions, announced today in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt at the COP27 United Nations Climate Change Conference , that InterEnergy's Dominican Republic-based utility, Consorcio Energetico Punta Cana Macao (CEPM) will secure a green loan from Bank of America and a multilateral development bank (MDB) to support its investments in renewable energy and clean transportation infrastructure projects to achieve its goal of 100% renewable energy generation by 2030. Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan initially announced the collaboration with InterEnergy at COP26 in Glasgow last year at the World Leader's Summit as part of the Sustainable Markets Initiative, which was founded by His Majesty King Charles III in his former role as The Prince of Wales. Original Press Release: Nov. 7 -- Bank of America issued the following news release: - InterEnergy's collaboration with Bank of America and the multilateral will scale renewable energy and infrastructure solutions in Small Island Developing States in the Caribbean InterEnergy Group, one of the largest clean energy project developers, operators and owners in the Caribbean, Central and South America, and Bank of America, one of the world's leading financial institutions, announced today in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt at the COP27 United Nations Climate Change Conference , that InterEnergy's Dominican Republic-based utility, Consorcio Energetico Punta Cana Macao (CEPM) will secure a green loan from Bank of America and a multilateral development bank (MDB) to support its investments in renewable energy and clean transportation infrastructure projects to achieve its goal of 100% renewable energy generation by 2030. Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan initially announced the collaboration with InterEnergy at COP26 in Glasgow last year at the World Leader's Summit as part of the Sustainable Markets Initiative, which was founded by His Majesty King Charles III in his former role as The Prince of Wales. InterEnergy's partnership with Bank of America will include a first of its kind, multi-asset, multi-jurisdictional warehouse financing facility which will support the construction and operation of eligible renewable energy and clean transportation assets located in the Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Future phases will finance additional technologies including battery storage, wind generation, biomass and green hydrogen that will support CEPM's net-zero-by-2030 goal ('CEPM Zero'). CEPM is a leading electricity provider in the Dominican Republic, powering approximately 65 percent of the national tourism sector representing over 50,000 hotel rooms and more than 50,000 residential and business customers. Reaching net-zero emissions across the utility's portfolio will require an estimated 501 MW of renewable energy assets and 120 MWh of storage capacity. The green corporate loan structured and arranged by BofA represents the first phase of Bank of America's partnership with InterEnergy to support its build-out of solar and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. "The transaction will help advance a more sustainable future for the Dominican Republic and serve as proof of concept for similar efforts in the SIDS," said Rolando Gonzlez Bunster, Chairman and CEO of InterEnergy Group. "Our hope is that CEPM's net-zero transition and blended financing structure will catalyze a flow of capital to clean energy and electric mobility infrastructure projects in the region." "As the world transitions to meet the critical net zero carbon emissions goals, it is crucial to ensure emerging markets' access to global banking and capital markets for the financing they need to achieve their targets," said Karen Fang, Global Head of Sustainable Finance at Bank of America. "This transaction is an important example of the impact that can result from collaborative, blended finance approaches, and we expect to replicate this in other SIDS and the Commonwealth countries that are vulnerable to climate change and historically lacked access to scalable transition financing capital." Bank of America is the sole structuring agent for the green A/B loan and acting as sole lead arranger and B lender, with the MDB acting as the lender of record. The loan is expected to have a three-year maturity and proceeds committed solely to the construction and operation of renewable energy assets. The transaction is expected to fund in December. InterEnergy Group InterEnergy Group is one of the largest diversified clean energy companies in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Group operates electric power generation plants in the region, specifically in the Dominican Republic, Panama, Jamaica, Chile and Uruguay, with a total installed, available and developing capacity of 2.1GW. InterEnergy plays a significant role in the tourism sector of the Dominican Republic where it owns and operates CEPM, the integrated utility that serves the fast-growing resort areas of Punta Cana, Bvaro, Macao, Uvero Alto, Miches, Bayahbe and La Romana, covering over 70% of all hotel capacity in the country. InterEnergy has also been leading the transformation of Panama's energy sector with the Laudato Si' Wind Farm, the largest in Central America and the Caribbean, with a capacity of 215 MW and the Ikakos solar farm with a nominal capacity of 40 MW, using renewable resources for the supply of 100% its energy. More recently InterEnergy started construction of 670 MW natural gas Gatn project, which will add important base load capacity to the Panamanian system. CEPM CEPM is a vertically integrated private utility and a leader in the production and distribution of electricity and communication services in the eastern part of the Dominican Republic, including the tourist region of Punta Cana-Bvaro and Bayahbe.

Today, the 27th UN Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) climate negotiations ended, with countries agreeing to develop new funding arrangements, including a dedicated fund to help the most vulnerable countries cope with the adverse impacts of climate change and reaffirming the need to stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. At the same time, negotiators could not agree on language to phase down oil and gas use globally, which scientists agree is essential to keeping climate change within manageable limits. That language would have built on the agreement at COP26 to accelerate the phase down of coal use globally. Additionally, the US made notable commitments and announcements at COP27 , including The EPA announced the long-awaited supplemental methane rule, which aims to establish strong, commonsense protections against methane and other harmful pollution from the oil and gas industry. The Biden Administration announced a new federal contractor emissions rule requiring major federal contractors to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions publicly and set targets for their reduction in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement. During his speech at COP27 , President Biden also committed to doubling the US pledge to the Adaptation Fund, launching a new initiative to support Egypt in deploying 10 gigawatts of clean energy and retiring five gigawatts of methane gas generation and launching a Climate Gender Equity Fund and an Indigenous Peoples Finance Access Facility. The United States announced with Japan and others a $20 billion package of public and private funding to help Indonesia retire coal plants and peak their emissions by the end of the decade. In response, Sierra Club Senior International Climate and Policy Campaign Director Cherelle Blazer issued the following statement: The progress made in Sharm El-Sheikh on creating funding arrangements for Loss and Damage is a landmark achievement. When the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was first agreed 30 years ago, rich countries committed to help climate vulnerable nations cope with the adverse impacts of climate change. That promise, however, has gone almost entirely unfulfilled in the decades since. This agreement from COP27 is the most significant step forward on Loss and Damage that we have ever seen, and it will provide desperately-needed assistance for the countries who need it most. Yet the work is still far from complete. Countries could not even agree on the need to phase down oil and gas use, which is absolutely critical to meeting the 1.5 degree limit. We are at a point in the climate crisis where we must do what is necessary to secure a livable planet for all, and failing to make progress toward all of our climate goals is unacceptable. \</doc>

India, Sept. 11 -- The floods in Pakistan have displaced 33 million people - almost the population of Canada - and assets worth millions have been lost. These angry waters are a result of wrong land use, aggravated by the climate crisis. For South Asia, this disaster and the climate crisis hold up a mirror to many realities. These show that there is an urgent need for regional collaboration, rethinking of development models, mainstreaming neglected local knowledge and spotlighting climate finance at the forthcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt. In the last two years, South Asia has been mauled by cyclones, heatwaves and floods. The intense, year-round air pollution is also influenced by the climate crisis. Regional collaboration can transform our preparedness in two ways. First, when tragedies occur, the first responders must be from the region; this is quicker, more appropriate and a collective means to keep our region safer. To do this well, we must set up emergency plans and protocols. Second, South Asia can build shared resilience to soften the blow. Whether these take the form of sharing innovation or building scientific capacity and joint research, we don't know till we do a deep dive. Inter-governmental institutions such as the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) in Nepal, where all South Asian nations participate, can serve as initial platforms while broader ideas are incubated. Political challenges will remain in this high-strung region, and so will intense climate upheaval. How the two intersect can save lives and dollars. Millions of South Asians living along rivers, deltas, forests and coasts are repositories of ecological knowledge. Why not deploy them to boost regional resilience? Prime Minister Narendra Modi has advocated Lifestyle for Environment (LIFE) as a key part of climate solutions. However, to mainstream this, we must reconsider our development pathway. Building large infrastructure along rivers and oceans, over grasslands and wetlands, and in mountains isn't economically viable anymore. Like other parts of the Global South, our region has been left to its own devices in the face of climate calamities. This is evident in the uneasy global silence around climate finance. The forthcoming COP27 is an opportunity to highlight the forgotten promise by wealthy countries of $100 billion annually in climate finance. South Asian negotiators must insist on new and additional payments, not re-labelling existing development aid, even if it fights this climate crisis. Funds must be paid by milestones, transparently. Payments for loss and damage are additional and non-negotiable. The developed world, home to 12% of the world's population, has contributed to well over 50% of the historic greenhouse gases. Funds alone are not the entire negotiation. The Asia Society Policy Institute recently released a report - Bringing India to Net Zero. It suggested India advance peak emissions and hit targets earlier, attracting greater investment. By making Indian emissions an issue, the report tosses aside the sacred premise of climate negotiations: Common but differentiated responsibilities. The think-tank, Council on Energy, Environment and Water, shows that China, the European Union and the United States will save 28.5% of the global carbon budget to stay below 1.5 degC, just by advancing their net-zero year by a decade. This effort will help the world's poor to survive. So why should the Global South, fighting poverty, take on the rightful responsibility of the wealthy? South Asia, home to 25% of the world's population, is also a climate-vulnerable region. Let's not shy away from holding developed countries accountable for the crisis they have burdened us with. Investing in South Asia offers everyone a better chance to live better in this age of uncertainty. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Lucknow.

No call for fossil fuel cuts, climate cash India on Tuesday told the Cop27 climate summit here in Egypt that it was making an "arduous effort" to battle climate change although "our contribution to the world's cumulative emissions so far is less than 4 per cent". The Union minister for environment, forest and climate change, Bhupender Yadav, delivered the country's national statement at the summit. Mission LiFE - or "Lifestyle for Environment", the pet programme of Prime Minister Narendra Modi - was the "heart of India's vision", Yadav said. LiFE, said to be a pro-people and pro-planet effort that seeks to shift the world from mindless and wasteful consumption to mindful and deliberate utilisation of natural resources, accounted for 126 words of the 437-word statement. The statement did not touch upon the key issues being deliberated at Cop27 , such as financial support from developed countries and fossil fuel cuts. Many developing nations had mentioned these in their agenda. He, however, said India was more proactive at Cop27 than at earlier editions. "Once the negotiation text is available, we will understand how much India could push through in its agenda, particularly the phase-out of all fossil fuels rather than only coal," the expert said. Yadav said at the plenary address: "India, home to 1.3 billion people, is undertaking this arduous effort, despite the reality that our contribution to the world's cumulative emissions so far is less than 4 per cent and our annual per capita emissions are about one-third of the global average." The minister said within one year of the Prime Minister announcing India's commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emission by 2070, the country had submitted its "Long-Term Low Emissions Growth Strategy" indicating low-carbon-transition pathways in key economic sectors. The country seeks to foster strong international cooperation through coalitions like the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition of Disaster Resilience Infrastructure, both of which were launched and nurtured by India, Yadav added. Independent experts, however, pointed out that India's long-term strategy was basically a packaging of old commitments and short on data and specific targets. "Though India's long-term strategy of transition from fossil fuels, released at Cop27 , is an encouraging step..., the policymakers must now develop specific targets in a timebound manner," said Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International. Yadav said in response to the call for increased ambition in its 2030 climate targets, India had in August updated its Nationally Determined Contributions, the voluntary emissions cut commitments made by countries, and turned that into a formal pledge. The minister spoke at length on LiFE, an initiative Modi announced at Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021 and formally launched in the presence of UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres on October 20, 2022, in Gujarat. "At the heart of India's vision of a safe planet is a one-word mantra - Lifestyle for Environment, that Prime Minister Modi set forth in our national statement at Cop26," he said. "The world urgently needs a paradigm shift from mindless and destructive consumption to mindful and deliberate utilisation.... As the world's most populous democracy and a vibrant emerging economy, India seeks to lead by example, and invites the global community to be a part of Mission LiFE for individual, family and community-based actions," Yadav said. \</doc>

CoP-27 , which begins today, offers yet another opportunity for the world to fight global warming Is the world serious about battling climate change? This question has haunted climate change negotiations since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 and will be at the root of contestations at the 27th Conference of Parties beginning today in Egypt. CoP-27 is taking place amidst the worst geopolitical tensions in years - the Ukraine war has set back greenhouse gas emission targets across the world by precipitating an energy crisis, while cost of living has been spiralling globally amidst deepening economic gloom. But the gravity of the climate catastrophe cannot be stressed enough. In September, a study published in Science said that the earth may have already passed through five dangerous tipping points owing to rising temperatures. The secretary-general of the United Nations, Antnio Guterres, has warned that the world is doomed unless developed countries come forward and sign a "historic pact" with poorer nations this year and act on it immediately. Resolving new and old challenges would decide the fate of CoP-27 . Given the inability to reduce the use of fossil fuel, much of global intervention has ended up being focused on carbon offset schemes, such as large-scale tree planting. It is true that the conservation of forests, along with other nature-based solutions, can provide up to 37% of the emissions reductions needed to tackle climate change. But naturally preserved forests - a thinning resource - are 40% more effective than planted ones. Another relevant question often missing from policy conversations is where the water to sustain afforestation will come from. Three of the eleven global water stress hotspots are in Africa where the CoP-27 is taking place. Then, there are the perennial bottlenecks. In spite of decades of deliberations, high-income countries have not yet described how they will contribute to the agreed $100 billion per year - the deadline to achieve this was 2020 - to help lesswealthy nations reduce emissions and adapt to climate change. In fact, one of the flashpoints at CoP-27 is likely to be the vexed question of 'loss and damage', which refers to the most devastating impacts of extreme weather that are impossible to adapt to. Poor countries want a funding mechanism that would allow for the rescue and rehabilitation of countries whose physical and social infrastructure has been destroyed by climate-related disasters. Rich countries have already shown that they can mobilise vast resources to tackle global emergencies - by one estimate, $15 trillion was committed and raised in 2020 by the major economies to fight Covid-19. Yet, climate change has not attracted such accelerated action. New Delhi would have its eyes on Egypt. At CoP-26, India and other developing countries understandably balked at the singling out of any one fossil fuel for curbs. As one of the largest economies with a defining role in fighting the worsening planetary climate crisis, India faces the prospects of a balancing act at the global climate negotiations. New Delhi has said that it will insist on £ction' by developed countries to deliver on long-promised finance to developing countries for adapting to climate change threats at CoP-27 . Yet, there is a need for nimbleness - from all participants - to get around roadblocks. Cop-27 offers another opportunity for the world to engineer a course correction on global warming. It must not be wasted. \</doc>

First, Gaia will use a range of 10-20 MW-scale H2Pro electrolyzer technology for a demo project in Morocco. H2Pro said that green hydrogen has become widely accepted both as a key tool for decarbonizing hard to abate sectors. As countries around the world rally for Green Hydrogen and vouch for its role in a sustainable economy, the ongoing COP27 has become a platform for them to advance Hydrogen. Consequently, leaders from around the world have signed pacts with each other to facilitate its production. In one such major announcement, Israeli company H2Pro and Moroccan renewable energy developer Gaia Energy have signed a strategic agreement on the sidelines of COP27 under which Gaia will use a range of 10-20 MW-scale H2Pro electrolyzer technology for a demo project in Morocco, while exploring in parallel the use of H2Pro technology in a Gigawatt-scale system currently being developed by Gaia within Morocco. The agreement was signed in the presence of Tamar Zandberg, Israel's Minister of Environmental Protection, Lior Ben Dor, Director for Egypt and the Maghreb at the Israeli Foreign Ministry, Rachid Tahiri, Head of the Division of Climate Change and Green Economy for Morocco's Ministry of Energy Transition & Sustainable Development, and Kelthoum Belhaj, Head of Green Economy Unit for Morocco's Ministry of Energy Transition & Sustainable Development. H2Pro held that the announcement comes amid the most high-profile climate action gathering of UNFCCC. Green hydrogen has become widely accepted both as a key tool for decarbonizing hard to abate sectors and as a clean molecule for storage and transport of renewable energy, mentioned H2Pro. "Morocco, and the MENA region at large, are poised to lead the world in the clean energy transition by making use of our abundance of renewable resources and becoming a green hydrogen hub. By combining the power of Gaia's renewable energy assets with H2Pro efficient and cost-effective green hydrogen production technology, we bring Morocco and our region one step closer to this vision," said Moundir Zniber, CEO of Gaia Energy. H2Pro, which was chosen to exhibit in Israel's first ever pavilion at a UN climate conference, came to COP27 as a champion of regional cooperation and with aspirations for the MENA region. Talmon Marco, CEO of H2Pro, said, " We chose COP27 as the platform for launching H2Pro and Gaia's partnership because this moment is not merely an achievement of two private companies, but rather a milestone in Moroccan-Israeli relations. It demonstrates the triumph of regional cooperation over climate change and is a clear indicator of the key role innovation plays in diplomacy." Minister Tamar Zandberg spoke about the importance of the government supporting the private sector when it comes to climate action. "No country, and no sector, and no one can do it alone. We are all gathered in this cause, and if we can use it for the sake of our children, we will be blessed," she said. Other Significant Pacts on Hydrogen 'Hydrogen Transition Summit', held at the sidelines of COP27 , saw various countries give impetus to hydrogen. To begin with, the EU has entered into agreements with Namibia and Egypt on hydrogen. Formerly, the Union had also signed an agreement with Kazakhstan about renewable hydrogen in Asian country. International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) also signed a pact aimed at augmenting green hydrogen. \</doc>

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has shared its recommendations on migration and mobility with the Czech government. Czechia has assumed the Presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU) in a time of war impacting millions of people and with migration implications in the region and across the globe. Czechia has been a major host country to people fleeing Ukraine, said Ola Henrikson, IOM Regional Director for the European Economic Area, the European Union and NATO. The unprecedented expression of solidarity, reception and support is shifting to a longer-term approach that will need to encompass wider economic and social inclusion. The challenges and opportunities extend beyond the Ukraine crisis. Comprehensive migration governance, including action to mitigate climate change impacts on human mobility, is needed more than ever in todays setting, Henrikson said. First, IOM recommends the Presidency to promote flexible and sustainable inclusion and labour mobility pathways. Migrant and refugee inclusion and access to services as well as attracting skills and talent to the EU through enhanced labour migration can help mitigate economic downturn, contribute to shared prosperity, and promote social cohesion. The recommendations also address the fact that approximately 1 billion people globally live without legal identities and may lack access to basic services and safe movement. IOM, therefore, encourages the Presidency to promote the registration of legal identity and integrated digital tools as enablers of sustainable development and safe, orderly human mobility. Dialogue and partnerships for migrant readmission, effective return, and sustainable reintegration continue to be crucial elements of comprehensive migration governance. In its recommendations, IOM outlines a whole-of-route policy which promotes assisted voluntary return, sustainable reintegration, and readmission cooperation frameworks that ensure return procedures adhere to international standards. Finally, with the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 IOM stands ready to continue its support to the Presidency, the EU, and its Member States to implement balanced, comprehensive policies and programmes across the entire migration spectrum and along migration routes. \</doc>

Varanasi:A 21-year-old youth from Varanasi, Naman Kapoor will attend the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) scheduled in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt from November 6 to 18. He is the youngest and only Indian among the 14 top 'Global Youth Ambassadors' selected to be a part of the 'Youth Delegation' to represent the Global Alliance of Universities on Climate (GAUC) at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The GAUC was formed in January 2019 in Davos, Swit- zerland. The 15 members of GAUC, include the Australian National University, University of California, Berkeley, Univer- sity of Cambridge, Imperial College London, London School of Economics and Political Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Tokyo, Tsinghua University, Stellenbosch University, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Indian Institute of Science, Sciences Po. (France), Columbia University, the University of Oxford and Yale University. Hailing from a family of businessmen, Naman is pursuing his graduation at Sciences Po, France after completing his schooling from Varanasi and Dehradun. Currently, Naman is on a year-long exchange programme at the Reichman University in Israel. During the Covid-19 pandemic, he was involved with various projects to provide basic needs like food, medical supplies and sanitary pads to the people of Varanasi.  I wish to put forward the views of the youth and the developing world, Naman told TOI over phone, adding that only 150 students were selected from GAUC's 15-member universities in nine countries to be a part of this programme. Out of them, 14 were selected to be a part of the 'Youth Delegation' to represent GAUC, he added. His primary focus is in cli- mate finance and governance. As a GAUC's Global Youth Ambassador, he hypothesised a platform that democratises green bonds to connect green projects with a broader base of capital markets and investors to channel capital towards sustainable development. Naman maintains a keen interest in business, science and technology and is a United Nations Millennium Fellow and a holder of the prestigious Emile Boutmy Scholarship. Naman said he was the only non-European youth invited to the Hambach Conference in Germany by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation to discuss European policies and democracy with Members of European Parliament and other high-ranking officials from the EU. Why the youth delegation? According to him, with 1.2 billion young people aged between 15 and 24 years, the youth accounts for 16% of the global population. Yet, the youth remains underrepresented on policy making platforms and are usually categorised homogeneously by age. This overlooks the heterogeneity of youth as a group, by missing its intersection with other factors such as nationality, gender and class.  The Global Youth Ambassadors at GAUC represent a diverse group of students with unique experiences, priorities and needs. The youth delegation can bring forward unique local knowledge to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation, he added. \</doc>

Egypt has put together a long list of some 200-odd elements that are being considered for inclusion in the cover decision, or political agreement, of COP27 , but India's call for a phasedown of all fossil fuels is missing from the list. This omission comes even as tentative alliance supporting the inclusion of a clear call for the phasedown of all fossil fuels in the cover text emerged at the ongoing UN Climate Change Conference."Nobody's suggestions are in there. Those are the elements that we have prepared," said Wael Aboulmagd, Egypt's climate envoy and special representative of the COP27 president, referring to the cover decision elements document released late night on Monday. "The chapter on mitigation will of course address that issue (phasedown of all fossil fuels). We will be providing text after discussions over the next couple days," he added. "India, and any other country that wants to, has every opportunity to put their demands out at the meeting later today." Egyptian presidency is holding a second round of consultations on Tuesday late afternoon.In the meantime, the Indian proposal for inclusion of language to "phasedown fossil fuels" has garnered a modicum of support. It is becoming apparent that there will need to be some finessing of the language to make clear that India's proposal builds on the "phasedown of unabated coal power" agreed to in the Glasgow Climate Pact last year.

An African initiative to increase solar generation capacity to provide 250 million people with electricity access across Africa's Sahel region for socio-economic development continues to attract financial support from around the world. Launched in 2019 by the African Development Bank Group and its partners, the Desert to Power initiative is designed to make Africa a renewable power house. Desert to Power will develop and provide 10 gigawatts of solar energy by 2030 across 11 countries where 64% of the population lives without electricity - with consequences for education, health and business. Key Highlights:  At an event held during the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference in Sharm El Sheikh on Friday, the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, represented by its executive director for Africa, Joseph Nganga, announced $35 million in support of Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA) under the initiative.  Norway's minister for international development, Anne Beathe Tvinnereim, announced a contribution of 300 million Norwegian kroner (around $29 million) from her government to support SEFA.  Adesina referred to the S1 billion US$ Sahel G5 Financing Facility approved by the Bank's Board of Directors earlier this year which includes $150 million in concessional resources from the Green Climate Fund as a key facility to help de-risk private sector solar projects. Original Press Release: Nov. 12 -- African Development Bank issued the following news release: An African initiative to increase solar generation capacity to provide 250 million people with electricity access across Africa's Sahel region for socio-economic development continues to attract financial support from around the world. Launched in 2019 by the African Development Bank Group and its partners, the Desert to Power initiative is designed to make Africa a renewable power house. Desert to Power will develop and provide 10 gigawatts of solar energy by 2030 across 11 countries where 64% of the population lives without electricity - with consequences for education, health and business. The project will positively impact Senegal, Nigeria, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, Sudan, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Eritrea. At an event held during the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference in Sharm El Sheikh on Friday, the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, represented by its executive director for Africa, Joseph Nganga, announced $35 million in support of Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA) under the initiative. SEFA is a multi-dollar special fund created to provide catalytic finance to unlock private sector investments in renewable energy. Norway's minister for international development, Anne Beathe Tvinnereim, announced a contribution of 300 million Norwegian kroner (around $29 million) from her government to support SEFA. The event-organized by the African Development Bank in the Africa Pavilion at COP27 titled Desert to Power - transforming the Sahel from fragility to resilience and prosperity -brought together government ministers, development partners and private sector representatives to discuss how to facilitate private sector investments In the Sahel. The event was an opportunity to present the Desert to Power program to potential partners and to rally investors toward its implementation. Addressing participants, including ministers from the Sahel region, African Development Bank President Dr. Akinwumi Adesina emphasized the importance of electricity in ensuring security and poverty reduction. "Desert to Power is a $20 billion initiative to do 10,000 megawatts of solar power ... This will be the largest solar zone in the world and so we want to turn this into a real economic activity ... one that will generate productive energy to be used by the countries across the Sahel," Adesina said. The African Development Bank head said the initiative had several components, including utility-scale solar generation, decentralized energy solutions, transmission and distribution, utility reform, and an efficient policy and regulatory environment to safeguard investments. Adesina said the program would significantly contribute to climate action by protecting a Great Green Wall against desertification and other climate change impacts. He also referred to the S1 billion US$ Sahel G5 Financing Facility approved by the Bank's Board of Directors earlier this year which includes $150 million in concessional resources from the Green Climate Fund as a key facility to help de-risk private sector solar projects. The bank chief thanked the heads of state and ministers from the various host countries for supporting the initiative. Minister Tvinnereim of Norway highlighted the role of renewable energy in sustainable development. "We need to make sure there is access to renewable energy and prevent old fossil emissions. To tackle the crisis in the region, we need the readiness of the governments of the region. We also need sustained access to renewable energy and the Desert to Power program developed by the African Development Bank responds to these critical issues. President Mohamed Bazoum of Niger addressed the event via video link, reiterating his government's support for the program. The energy ministers of Mauritania and Niger, as well as senior representatives from key Desert to Power partners-including Power Africa, the Swedish International Development Agency, the European Commission, the International Renewable Energy Agency, the Green Climate Fund, ACWA Power and MASEN-underscored their support for the initiative. Nganga from the Global Energy Alliance said the Alliance would also support the de-risking of investment made in the Desert to Power infrastructure as well as innovative solutions that would drive the program to succeed.

India, Sept. 22 -- The annual United Nations (UN) climate change conference (Conference of the Parties-27 or COP27 ) is scheduled to begin in Egypt's Sharm El Sheikh in a month and a half. The two most significant, and intensely debated, issues likely to be on the COP27 agenda are climate finance for adaptation to climate impacts, and reparations for Loss and Damage caused by extreme weather events. These issues are particularly important to India. "In view of extreme weather events, increasing finance for adaptation and a decision on a new collective quantified climate finance goal will be critical for us and we think those will be the major issues at COP," a senior environment ministry official said. "The Loss and Damage initiative will take centre stage in the upcoming COP. The countries which do not have any role in climate change are the worst affected ones," Bhupender Yadav, Union environment minister said on September 20, during a Clean and Green Globe conference organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Loss and Damage refers to compensation for the impacts of extreme climate events and slow onset events such as sea-level rise or glacial retreat, while adaptation refers to adjustments in ecological, social, or economic systems in response to actual or expected climatic impacts, according to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It refers to changes in processes, practices, and structures to moderate potential damages. Denmark on Tuesday pledged over $13 million (100 million Danish crowns) to support developing nations deal with losses caused by extreme weather events, becoming the first country to offer "Loss and Damage" compensation to vulnerable countries, Reuters reported. Antonio Guterres, UN secretary-general, also called on rich nations to pay up for climate devastation in poor countries during his speech at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday. "Polluters must pay. Today, I am calling on all developed economies to tax the windfall profits of fossil fuel companies. Those funds should be re-directed in two ways: to countries suffering Loss and Damage caused by the climate crisis; and to people struggling with rising food and energy prices. As we head to the COP27 UN climate conference in Egypt, I appeal to all leaders to realise the goals of the Paris Agreement. Lift your climate ambition. Listen to your people's calls for change. Invest in solutions that lead to sustainable economic growth," he said. Another reason there will be a strong demand for adaptation finance is because COP27 is being held in Africa, which has been suffering from an acute food and humanitarian crisis due to the climate crisis. The Greater Horn of Africa has already suffered the longest drought in 40 years, and parts of the region are bracing for a fifth consecutive failed rainy season, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said last month. "The important thing that is going to emerge at COP27 is not the further enhancement of NDCs [Nationally Determined Contributions]. A large number of countries, including India, have already updated their NDCs. The issue that may take centre stage at COP27 is not mitigation but adaptation. Mitigation has played its role in the global discourse, but with global supply chains currently under disruption and extreme events with disastrous impact all around us, the appetite for further intense discussion on mitigation will be much less. The performance of various countries on their 2030 NDCs will be assessed in any case in a year or two through the global stock-take," said RR Rashmi, distinguished fellow and programme director, Earth Science and Climate Change, The Energy and Resources Institute, during a webinar on Pathways for India's long-term strategy to achieve Net Zero by 2070 on Wednesday. "The best bet for furthering the ambition is to have more progress on long-term and implementable strategies for growth in as many countries as possible. The focus of COP27 logically therefore should and will be on adaptation. COP is being held in Africa where adaptation is a very important issue. But what kind of outcomes are expected to be seen is hard to judge," Rashmi added. "Unfortunately, Loss and Damage is not even on the formal agenda. On adaptation, there will be discussion on global adaptation goal. There is no agreement on a long-term adaptation finance goal either. At best, what this COP can achieve is to formulate a clear strategy on indicators for global adaptation goals. It is not simply about finance, it is also about adaptation strategy. For example, early warning systems in each country to predict the extreme weather events. In India, you can see the ability to address extreme disasters has gone up because of early warning systems. Similarly, the systems and resources to create resilient infrastructure and address land degradation, or water scarcity. These should be part of the global adaptation goal in addition to higher finance," he added. "The really interesting thing about COP 27 is whether or not, given the fact that the COP is being held in Africa and that we have had these extreme weather events this year which include really serious disruptions in South Asia, in Europe, in US, we get a head of steam on the political agenda for some sort of serious consideration on adaption financing as well as loss and damage. The UN secretary general called for some kind of distributive tax on the fossil fuel industry. More than a decade ago there used to be a lot of discussion on a currency transaction tax which is a good way of generating money for the global system. Those kinds of conversations may be back and about direct payments for compensation. If there was a serious opportunity to discuss finance to ameliorate impacts of climate change then this is that moment," said Navroz Dubash, professor at the Centre for Policy Research, who focuses on climate change policy and governance who addressed the same webinar. The issue of reparations has been contested by developed countries during past COPs. India intervened strongly three times to emphasise Loss and Damage and the finances needed to mitigate the impacts of global warming at the Bonn climate conference in June. "Averting, minimising and addressing Loss and Damage is mandated in the Article 8 of the Paris Agreement," an environment ministry official had said from Bonn. Several country groupings including G77 and China, the Alliance of Small Island States, Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries pressed for a separate agenda on establishing a separate Loss and Damage finance facility at COP26. The view on having a separate financing facility was opposed by the US, Australia, and the European Union, which instead pushed the importance of insurance, catastrophe bonds and bilateral assistance during the dialogue, officials had said. Through climate models and observational data, climate scientists have already established how the climate crisis has made extreme weather events this year several times more likely. These include the the spring heatwave in India and Pakistan during March to May and the monsoonal floods in Pakistan and parts of India. The March-April spring heatwave spell in India and Pakistan was about 30 times more likely to happen because of human-caused climate crisis, the World Weather Attribution (WWA) network, an international team of leading climate scientists, said in May. The results of their rapid analysis showed that the unusually long and early onset heatwave spell in India and Pakistan is very rare, with a chance of occurring only once in 100 years. Pakistan floods that devastated large parts of the country in August, leaving hundreds of thousands of people homeless and killing around 1,500 people was made highly likely due to climate crisis, WWA concluded in a statement on September 15. The 5-day maximum rainfall over the provinces Sindh and Balochistan is now about 75% more intense than it would have been had the climate not warmed by 1.2 degree Celsius, whereas the 60-day rain across the basin is now about 50% more intense, meaning rainfall this heavy is now more likely to happen. There are large uncertainties in these estimates due to the high variability in rainfall in the region, and observed changes can have a variety of drivers, including, but not limited to, climate change," a statement by WWA said. "There are two arguments for Loss and Damage: The Pakistan floods are on top of everyone's minds ahead of COP27 . One that private sector commercial insurance completely breaks down in the case of climate disasters of this magnitude. In the past people have talked about insurance mechanisms with a layer of public finance but in front of such disasters it completely breaks down. Then, where will the additional money for loss and damage come from? The COP26 discussions happened before the Ukraine war broke out. If, at that time, developed countries said don't expect $100 billion per year until 2023, now additional Loss and Damage finance seems beyond what people are willing to discuss. However, there are ideas about innovative new sources of finance such as windfall tax on fossil fuel companies; a fee on voluntary carbon market transactions for buyers; a tax on business class travel; debt for climate swaps. So, there are additional sources of raising finance. More than the finance, it is the sceptre of being held legally liable that stops developed countries from talking about loss and damage at the negotiations," explained Ulka Kelkar, director, climate programme at World Resources Institute, during the briefing on Wednesday.

London, Nov 8 (IANS) UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was allegedly rushed out of a stage at the ongoing UN COP27 climate summit in Egypt's coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh, the media reported. A video of the incident on Monday was captured by Leo Hickman, the director/editor of UK climate change website, Carbon Brief, reports the London World news outlet. Hickman shared the video on Twitter in which he mentioned that "UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has just arrived at launch of the Forests and Climate Leaders' Partnership at COP27 ". There was however, no information on what the aides conveyed to thee Prime Minister. In a keynote address to the summit on Monday, Sunak said that "climate security goes hand in hand with energy security" and that the ongoing war in Ukraine and rising energy prices are reasons to act faster to tackle climate change. This was his first appearance in an international arena since he took office last month. Leaders from 120 countries are meeting in Sharm El-Sheikh to discuss next steps in curbing climate change. ksk/ \</doc>

The hosting of the COP27 conference in Africa signifies a unique opportunity for the continent to assert its needs, challenges and outlooks, and most significantly to drive the African Position on just transition. Historically this conference, focused on climate change and its humanitarian ramifications, has marginalized Africa whose contribution to humanitys carbon footprint is minimal but whose people are suffering disproportionately from its effects. But with this years gathering of world leaders occurring in Egypts Sharm El Sheikh, it is vital that Africas authentic voice is heard this is the overriding purpose of Afreximbanks mission at COP27 . By inserting and asserting our perspective in the global climate change debate, we want to promote a mainstream African position, as a key stakeholder region. Africas situation, and therefore the position articulated by Afreximbank, diverges from those of many other regional blocs, particularly in the more prosperous Global North. This continents long-term sustainable development agenda, which relies on traditional energy sources, is impeded by the ongoing campaign towards zero-carbon emissions, and the short-term livelihoods of millions of Africans are imperiled by a headlong rush towards net-zero. With this in mind, Afreximbanks participation in COP27 revolves around three core elements: an accelerated implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement AfCFTA, which can reduce the continents reliance on carbon-intensive imports; the fostering of partnerships to promote an energy transition model that is more globally inclusive; and the maintenance of a pan-African position which achieves a balanced, environmentally sustainable economic development strategy. So, in partnership with likeminded organisations, Afreximbanks participation at COP27 has been marshalled to articulate the following outcomes: Calling for the full Implementation of the AfCFTA towards the localization of industries to transition towards net zero emissions: Afreximbank believes that the AfCFTA offers an opportunity for Africa to produce and consume goods within the continent, thereby reducing its carbon footprint. Erasing borders offers an opportunity for Africa to share technology, collaborate on science, and leverage its youthful population to achieve the development the continent warrants. In understanding this, Afreximbank supports the full implementation of the AfCFTA which will help the continent pool resources to accelerate and speed up its development trajectory. At the COP27 Fostering partnerships for an energy transition model that is more globally inclusive: Currently, 600 million Africans have no access to electricity, while another 900 million lack access to clean cooking. However, Africa, a continent endowed with abundant resources, is home to 30 percent of the worlds mineral reserves, eight percent of the worlds natural gas, and 12 percent of the worlds oil reserves. Due to its low levels of development and large green energy sources, Africa emits the least of any region, contributing about 4 percent of total global emissions. Afreximbank believes that Africa must use its vast minerals to tackle the continents energy poverty and achieve its development plans under Agenda 2063. Exploring Africas natural gas reserves can double the continents electricity capacity, while adding less than one percent to global emissions. At Afreximbank, we believe Africa cannot achieve its development plans without access to energy. Hence Africa has the right to develop its resources, including fossil fuels, and we, as a Bank, are prepared to finance the continents energy just transition. At the conference, Afreximbank has confirmed its intention and willingness to continue to partner with petroleum producers to promote adaptation, support energy value chains and mitigate the costs of transition. With a well-articulated African position, we believe the continents economic development will be well positioned to grow while ensuring the continents energy transition progress is compatible with, and complementary to, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) as well as the continents long-term social and environmental objectives, as set out in African Unions Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want. Supporting the common pan-African position around a balanced, environmentally sustainable, and responsible economic development strategy: If our continent is to achieve sustainable development goals, we must take charge of its trajectory. Africa is blessed with rich mineral resources enough to finance its development, but the continent has failed to benefit from the exploitation of these resources. Afro-centric institutions are key to driving Africas economic agenda and building Africas resilience against climate change. Afreximbank has committed to supporting the African positioning for the continents benefit. At this critical time of global economic uncertainty, it is imperative that Africa coordinates and supports the common African position on economic development amidst global climate change. \</doc>

The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) is bringing northern voices to the United Nations 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ). COP27 is the latest gathering of the annual global climate change summit. Leaders whose countries are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change meet to assess progress in dealing with climate change, share knowledge on GHG reduction and climate change adaptation, and negotiate protocols and agreements. COP27s agenda outlines climate change adaptations, climate resilience in developing nations, efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and building on commitments and discussions from COP26. For the Northwest Territories (NWT), the priority at this years event will be bringing northern voices to the global discussion, advocating for climate change adaptation, taking home information on reducing greenhouse gases, and building more resilient communities. The GNWT delegation will co-host an event with the Yukon Government at the Canada Pavilion, spotlighting northern climate issues in both a global forum and with Canada, as part of the Pan-Territorial Adaptation Partnership. COP provides a high-profile opportunity to advocate for Northern climate change issues to national and international audiences. This conference also provides the GNWT with the ability to influence the development of the plans and policies accompanying federal programming, particularly those being developed under the National Adaptation Strategy. With parts of the NWT warming four times faster than the rest of Canada, participating in global forums like COP27 helps shine a light on critical climate change issues which require immediate action. \</doc>

UN Secretary General Antonio\~Guterres\~accidentally read the\~wrong speech\~at the COP27 climate conference and when he realised it, he laughed it off, along with the audience. Speaking in the main plenary hall of the Sharm el-Sheikh conference on Wednesday, Guterres was due to give the opening address at a session with former US Vice President Al Gore on tracking carbon emissions. However, a few words into his speech, the UN chief grew visibly confused and paused. Realising his gaffe after flipping through the notes before him, the UN chief chuckled and said, "I think that I was given the wrong speech."

With a sheepish smile on his face, Guterres told the audience, "I'm going to speak to the group of young people afterwards and there was a small confusion. I apologise." He started over again with a different opening line, presumably from the correct speech this time.

On Sunday, November 20, 2022, in the early morning hours, the UNFCCC COP27 climate conference ended in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The Polish delegation actively participated in agreeing on the results of the summit until the last moment. Representatives of all countries of the world agreed on the content of 60 decisions implementing the provisions of the Climate Convention, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. For many countries, the most important outcome was the creation of a new fund to finance losses and damage caused by climate change in the most vulnerable developing countries. The sources of financing for this fund will only be determined in the coming years, but they should include, in addition to traditional donors from the world's richest countries, also innovative financing, eg from international development banks and even private funds. For Poland, the most important was the package of solutions stimulating actions aimed at limiting climate change, such as the call for updating reduction targets by those countries that - unlike the European Union - have not done so so far, or the program of work on mitigation, devoted to the search for and dissemination of climate solutions . Poland also supported taking into account the role of forests and the preservation of biodiversity in the fight against climate change. This year's conference was held in the shadow of the war in Ukraine and the resulting energy and food crisis. For the first time, the final results included calls to accelerate the energy transition using both renewable energy sources and other non-carbon technologies. In addition, recognizing the need to take into account the social dimension of climate policy, COP27 established a work program on just transition, along with an annual ministerial round table devoted to this issue. It was Poland that initiated the global reflection on just transition during COP24 in Katowice, where the Silesian Declaration for Solidarity and Just Transition was adopted. \</doc>

Sharm el-Sheikh: Seeking to minimise devastating impacts of climate change, the COP27 presidency has launched the Sharm-elSheikh Adaptation Agenda outlining 30 goals to enhance resilience for four billion people living in the most climate vulnerable communities by 2030. India having vast coastlines and other vulnerable areas will also be benefited from this move. The presidency sought to mobilise $140 billion to $300 billion through both public and private sources annually to pursue these goals which include transitioning to climate resilient, sustainable agriculture that can increase yields by 17% and reduce farm level greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 21%, without expanding agricul- tural frontiers, and while improving livelihoods of farmers. Collectively, these outcomes represent the first comprehensive global plan to rally both State and nonState actors behind a shared set of adaptation actions that are required by the end of this decade. These actions will be taken across five impact systems: food and agriculture; water and nature; coastal and oceans; human settlements, and infrastructure. The actions will include enabling solutions for planning and finance across these sectors. "The Sharm el-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda is a critical step at COP27 ...We are determined to develop a governance arrangement that secures continuity in scope, priorities, and reporting, while increasing action on the ground that accelerates system interventions, and the adaptation and resilience outcome targets identified by the High-Level Champions, said COP27 president and Egypt's minister of foreign affairs, Sameh Shoukry, while launching the Agenda on Tuesday. The 30 adaptation outcomes under the agenda also include bringing 2,000 of the world's largest companies on board to integrate physical climate risk and develop actionable adaptation plans, and investing $4 billion to secure the future of 15 million hectares of mangroves through collective action to halt loss, restore, double protection and ensure sustainable finance for all existing mangroves. Spread over India and Bangladesh, the Sundarban region, home to 7.2 million of the world's most vulnerable people and the single largest mangrove forest in the world, will benefit from the adaptation efforts. \</doc>

India, Nov. 10 -- In Fossil Free, chairman and managing director of ReNew Power Sumant Sinha points out that the world has seen three energy transitions. The first two coincided with the industrial revolutions, which used abundant coal-fired power and the internal combustion engine (ICE), leading to a rapid increase in wealth and prosperity. But it also left deep footprints on the world: The climate crisis and environmental pollution. However, Sinha writes, the world can achieve a third energy transition, characterised by green, renewable energy. But to succeed, this transition must be led by Asia, which houses two-thirds of the global population, is responsible for half of the global GDP, and has growing energy needs. More particularly, India and China must lead this transition. The good news is that this is happening. According to a new report released by the energy think tank Ember, the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis on Thursday, solar power is already contributing to meeting electricity demand in Asia and enhancing energy security. It found that five of the top 10 economies with solar capacity are now within Asia, including China, Japan, India, South Korea, and Vietnam. After analysing the growth of solar power over the last decade, the researchers found seven Asian countries, including China, India, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Thailand, avoided potential fossil fuel costs of approximately $34 billion from January to June 2022, which is equivalent to 9% of total fossil fuel costs during this period. "Asian countries have shown that rapid solar deployment is possible, setting a remarkable example and providing valuable lessons learned for their peers in the region. As the prices of solar and storage plummet, and the potential cost savings have started to materialise, solar dominance in Asia now looks to come much sooner than previously expected," said Ember's Asia electricity analyst, Achmed Shahram Edianto. Meeting the current targets for solar capacity in 2030 could enable the seven countries to avoid at least $44 billion in fuel costs - $10 billion more than the first half of this year. But realising these goals, the researchers said, will require grid stabilisation, innovative policy reforms to unlock investments and collaboration with the private sector. The India story In 2010, India ranked 21st in the world for solar capacity; India is now ranked 5th. However, the country has established a good track record on solar capacity additions and is well positioned to sprint towards its target of 280 GW by 2030, a six-fold increase on current levels. If achieved, this would make India home to one of the world's largest solar fleets by the end of the decade. In India, solar generation avoided $4.2 billion in fuel costs in the year's first half. It also avoided the need for 19.4 million tonnes of coal that would have further stressed an already strained domestic supply. Remove the roadblocks However, India looks set to miss its distributed and rooftop solar target for 2022, by up to 25 GW, or 63%. The country's efforts to encourage large-scale solar projects have included feed-in-tariff programmes, improved land availability, streamlined grid access and access to standardised 25-year power purchase agreements (PPAs). By contrast, the report indicates that India's rooftop and distributed solar investment have been inhibited by national and subnational policy conflicts, inconsistent net metering options and a lack of financing. Moreover, India seems to be very bullish on solar power growth in the next 10 years too, as evident from the new draft National Electricity Plan. So, it's looking very likely that the 2020s is when solar power is going to finally ramp up in India and begin India's coal phasedown journey, says Aditya Lolla, Senior Electricity Policy Analyst, EMBER. Accelerating energy transition The report shows that better financing can accelerate the energy transition. And at COP27 , this is a crucial issue. In the run-up to COP27 , International Solar Alliance (ISA) co-President and Union minister for power and new & renewable energy RK Singh said that the Alliance would raise the issue of climate finance for energy transition and energy access in developing countries. He added that the money is needed for more than just capital investment. "Capital investment will come but what will be necessary is to put in place funds for insurance and payment security. So, ISA will be floating two funds, one for payment security which is a must for generating private investments in our projects. The second is a fund for project insurance". Climate action is often perceived as a cost or a trade-off with other priorities. However, it must be seen as an opportunity for businesses, countries and individuals to build a more sustainable and habitable world.

India is on track to achieve its target of generating 50 per cent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the G20 summit in Indonesia on Tuesday as he ruled out "any restrictions" on energy supply and stability. The leaders of the 20 largest economies are meeting in Bali for two days at what has been described to be one of the most divisive and challenging G20 summits ever. Modi, who was speaking at the summit's first session on food and energy security, said that while India has provided food grain to other nations, the latest global shortage should be met with a G20 agreement on secure supply chains. "India is committed to clean energy and environment. By 2030, half of our electricity will be generated from renewable sources," he said, indicating the country's climate change mitigation goals remain on track. United Nations Climate Change conference ( COP27 Modi said India's energy security is important as it is the world's fastest growing economy. "We must not promote any restrictions on the supply of energy and stability in the energy market should be ensured."

All these together have caused havoc in the world. Global supply chains are in ruins." "Today's fertiliser shortage is tomorrow's food crisis, for which the world will not have a solution," he said. He also stressed multilateral institutions have failed to address these challenges and therefore the world has greater expectations from the G20. "We should also not hesitate to acknowledge that multilateral institutions such as the UN have been unsuccessful on these issues. And we have all failed to make suitable reforms in them," he said. He added that will work for global consensus on all these issues during its G20 presidency. Ukraine war Modi reiterated his call for diplomacy and disengagement on the Ukraine issue, calling for concrete and collective resolve to ensure peace, harmony and security in the world. "I have repeatedly said that we have to find a way to return to the path of ceasefire and diplomacy in Ukraine. Over the past century, the Second World War wreaked havoc in the world. After that, the leaders of that time made a serious effort to take the path of peace. Now it's our turn," he said. The Prime Minister hinted that India is willing to act as a mediator. "I am confident that next year when the G20 meets in the holy land of Buddha and Gandhi, we will all agree to convey a strong message of peace to the world," he said. A call to denounce Russia has reportedly split the G20 in opposite camps. Russian President Vladimir Putin skipped the summit, instead deputing Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to attend. The G20 is a forum for international economic cooperation representing around 85 per cent of the global GDP, over 75 per cent of the global trade, and about two-thirds of the world population. \</doc>

Negotiations at the 27th Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) ended today, with the agreement of countries to develop new forms of financing, including a fund dedicated to helping the most vulnerable countries cope with the adverse impacts of climate change and reaffirm the need to not exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming. At the same time, negotiators could not agree on text for a global phase-out of oil and gas use, which science agrees is essential to keeping climate change under manageable limits. That text was based on the COP26 agreement to accelerate the elimination of the use of coal globally. In addition, the United States made notable commitments and announcements at COP27 , including the following: The Environmental Protection Agency announced the long-awaited supplemental methane regulation, which seeks to establish strong, common-sense protections against this fossil gas and other forms of oil and gas pollution. The Biden administration announced a new federal government contractor emissions rule, which requires them to publicly disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and set reduction targets under the 2015 Paris Agreement. COP27 , to double US contributions to the Adaptation Fund, launching an initiative to support Egypt to deploy 10 gigawatts of clean energy and phase out five gigawatts of methane-fired power generation, the Climate Fund for Gender Equity and an Access to Finance Facility for Indigenous Peoples. The announcement by the United States, Japan and other countries of a $20 billion package of public and private financing to help Indonesia phase out coal-fired power plants and cap emissions by 2030. In response, Sierra Club International Policy and Climate Campaign Director Cherelle Blazer issued the following statement: The progress made in Sharm El-Sheikh in creating Loss and Damage funding is historic. When the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was agreed 30 years ago, rich countries first committed to helping vulnerable nations cope with the impacts of climate change. That promise, however, has been unfulfilled during all this time. This COP27 agreement is the most significant step forward on Loss and Damage that we have ever seen as it will offer desperately needed assistance to countries that need it most. But the work is still hard. The countries failed again to reach an agreement to eliminate the use of oil and gas, something absolutely critical to not exceed the limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. We are at a point in the climate crisis where we have to do what is necessary to preserve a livable planet for all, and failing to make progress on all climate goals is unacceptable. (English) COP27 : Sierra Club Statement On End Of Negotiations SHARM EL-SHEIKH -- Today, the 27th UN Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) climate negotiations ended, with countries agreeing to develop new funding arrangements, including a dedicated fund to help the most vulnerable countries cope with the adverse impacts of climate change and reaffirming the need to stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. At the same time, negotiators could not agree on language to phase down oil and gas use globally, which scientists agree is essential to keeping climate change within manageable limits. That language would have built on the agreement at COP26 to accelerate the phase-down of coal use globally. Additionally, the US made notable commitments and announcements at COP27 , including: The EPA announced the long-awaited supplemental methane rule, which aims to establish strong, commonsense protections against methane and other harmful pollution from the oil and gas industry. The Biden Administration announced a new federal contractor emissions rule requiring major federal contractors to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions publicly and set targets for their reduction in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement. During his speech at COP27 , President Biden also committed to doubling the US pledge to the Adaptation Fund, launching a new initiative to support Egypt in deploying 10 gigawatts of clean energy and retiring five gigawatts of methane gas generation and launching a Climate Gender Equity Fund and an Indigenous Peoples Finance Access Facility. The United States announced with Japan and others a $20 billion package of public and private funding to help Indonesia retire coal plants and peak their emissions by the end of the decade. In response, Sierra Club Senior International Climate and Policy Campaign Director Cherelle Blazer issued the following statement: The progress made in Sharm El-Sheikh on creating funding arrangements for Loss and Damage is a landmark achievement. When the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was first agreed to 30 years ago, rich countries committed to helping climate-vulnerable nations cope with the adverse impacts of climate change. That promise, however, has gone almost entirely unfulfilled in the decades since. This agreement from COP27 is the most significant step forward on Loss and Damage that we have ever seen, and it will provide desperately-needed assistance for the countries who need it most. Yet the work is still far from complete. Countries could not even agree on the need to phase down oil and gas use, which is absolutely critical to meeting the 1.5-degree limit. We are at a point in the climate crisis where we must do what is necessary to secure a livable planet for all, and failing to make progress toward all of our climate goals is unacceptable. \</doc>

Among the other top agenda items is a discussion about compensating the poor or developing countries for "loss and damage" caused by climate change which may exceed the developed world's commitment of USD 100 billion to low-income countries Leaders from around the world are gathering in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, for the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties, also known as COP27 . After a brief delay, the summit began on Sunday, with negotiators agreeing to discuss the establishment of a mechanism to compensate poor countries for damage caused by climate change. Several issues are likely to be discussed as the session progresses, including climate finance, adaptation and a follow-up to COP26's Glasgow pact. What is COP27 ? Every year, the United Nations (UN) organises climate summits, with the main goal of limiting global temperature rises. These meetings are known as the Conference of Parties (COP). The participants are from the 197 countries that signed the United Nations Climate Agreement in 1992. Its goal is to "stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere in order to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system." It was signed in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro. Every year since 1994, COPs have been held. This year marks the 27th such summit, known as COP27 . Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, one year was lost. The 1992 pact has occasionally been supplemented with new agreements. The 2015 Paris Agreement was one such agreement, in which all countries agreed to limit temperature rise to 1.5-degree Celsius. What can we expect from COP27 ? "We must coordinate our global efforts. Words must be translated into action if we are to meet our pledges and commitments," according to Egypt's President Abdel Fattah El-Presidential Sisi's Vision Statement. COP27 . Among the other top agenda items is a discussion about compensating the poor or developing countries for "loss and damage" caused by climate change. This will exceed the developed world's commitment of USD 100 billion to low-income countries. "The negotiations will also include technical discussions, for example, to specify how nations should practically measure their emissions so that everyone has a level playing field," according to the UN website. "The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is clear that in order to respond to current and future climate risks, the scale of adaptation finance must be significantly increased from all sources, both public and private. Governments, financial institutions and the private sector must all participate," according to the UN. What happened at COP27 yet? During the opening press conference on Sunday, Egypt's foreign minister and COP27 president, Sameh Shoukry said that he was pleased to see the Parties agree to include loss and damage funding as an agenda item, adding that the world needs a "qualitative leap to confront climate change's challenges." In UN climate negotiations, the term "loss and damage" refers to expenses already incurred as a result of climate change impacts such as rising sea levels or extreme heat waves. While current climate funding focuses on reducing carbon emissions to prevent future climate change, establishing a "loss and damage" fund means compensating countries that are unable to avoid or "adapt" to existing changes. The Egyptian diplomat also said that the current global geopolitical environment has created numerous burdens and crises, which must be addressed so that progress in combating climate change is not hampered. According to Shoukry, African countries are among those experiencing problems and issues related to climate change. "The African continent's countries have demonstrated their willingness to confront climate change, but they require assistance," he said. Meanwhile, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi said that COP27 is taking place at a critical juncture in history when the world is facing "existential dangers." "There is no doubt that these dangers and challenges necessitate immediate action by all countries to lay out a rescue roadmap that protects the world from the effects of climate change," Sisi said in an official statement posted to his Facebook page. The president went on to say that his country hopes that the climate conference will turn promises into actions. \</doc>

The 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - or COP27 - ended in the early hours of the morning in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Egypt, which presided over COP27 this year, had announced for several months that this would be the African COP, i.e. a COP primarily aimed at implementing commitments already made and with an emphasis on adaptation to climate change. From the very beginning of the conference, the European Union strove to raise ambitions also in the field of climate change mitigation and that the negotiations and umbrella decisions would be equally focused on adaptation and mitigation of climate change, in order to keep the 1.5C goal within reach. COP27 , where members of the negotiating team, consisting of chief climate negotiators Tina Kobilek, Luka Vombek and Ana Klemen, as well as climate envoy Eva Tomi?, were present at all times, achieved some important breakthroughs. For the first time in history, a fund was created to help developing countries, which are particularly vulnerable in the context of the negative effects of climate change, to address the losses and damages related to the negative and often irreversible consequences of anthropogenic climate change on human communities and nature. Losses and damage result from both extreme weather events and submerging, longer-term processes such as sea-level rise and melting glaciers. The new fund, aimed at the most vulnerable, will mobilize new and additional financial resources that will complement existing resources, funds, The parties also managed to reach an agreement on the basis for the implementation of the work program on mitigation, which aims to urgently increase ambition and implementation in the field of mitigation in this critical decade. Its implementation will begin immediately after the conclusion of COP27 and will take place through focused exchanges of views, information and ideas, with at least two dialogues and other events each year focused on identifying financial flows for the implementation of mitigation commitments. The program will operate at least until 2026, when the parties can agree to extend its operation. Unfortunately, the program has certain limitations, such as the prohibition of setting new goals or commitments in the field of mitigation beyond those already adopted by the Parties at the national level. The conference ended with the adoption of overarching resolutions, which include key political messages. It also includes a reference to the energy sector, where countries have advocated and recognized the importance of the global energy crisis to accelerate the energy transition to clean and renewable energy sources in this critical decade. They reaffirmed the commitment to reduce the use of coal in plants without carbon capture and storage technologies and to eliminate inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels, which was first included in the climate negotiation process at last years climate conference in Glasgow. The preamble of the umbrella resolution also included a reference to the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, which was proclaimed this summer within the framework of the United Nations at the initiative of a group of countries, including Slovenia. During the climate negotiations, Slovenia actively strove for its inclusion in the COP27 final document. The Santia Network for Losses and Damages was also operationalized, namely with the decision to establish a secretariat, an advisory committee and the functions of the network. The network can thus, in the shortest possible time, begin to connect the most vulnerable communities to the impacts of climate change with those who provide assistance when exposed to losses and damages due to the impacts of climate change. Developed countries are asked to provide financial resources for the operation of the secretariat and members of the network. The parties also agreed to develop a framework for a global adaptation goal, which will be implemented in a structured approach within the Glasgow-Sharm el-Sheikh work program next year. The Framework will be adopted at COP28 and will aim to guide the achievement of the global adaptation goal and review overall progress towards it, with the aim of reducing the increasing adverse impacts, risks and vulnerabilities associated with climate change, and strengthening adaptation activities and support for these activities. In the field of climate financing, the contracting states emphasized that in order to achieve the goal of climate neutrality by 2050 and the transition to a low-emission economy, it will be necessary to adapt the financial system and involve the private sector more. They also called for the reform of the operation of international development banks and other financial institutions, so that their financing is aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Regarding the new collective financial goal, the countries have agreed on enhanced work, which will be based on the experience gained in the process of preparation and implementation of the previous financial goal of 100 billion annually. Thus, at the beginning of next year, this roadmap (Roadmap) for 2023 will be prepared, in which the next steps will be moved, including the organization of technical dialogues at the expert level. All stakeholders, both state and non-state, especially financial institutions, are invited to convey their views on the development of the new financial goal. As part of the first Global Review of the State of Implementation of the Paris Agreement ( Global Stocktake ), a second technical dialogue was held at the meeting, which focused on the question of the state of implementation in the field of mitigation and adaptation to climate change and the issue of climate financing. \</doc>

Times at CLIMATE MEET Sharm el-Sheikh: Amid growing demand to end use of coal, India at the UN climate talks ( COP27 ) on Saturday made a strong point saying making any one fuel the villain is not right as natural gas and oil also lead to emissions. Making its intervention during presidency consultation on the cover decisions of COP27 , India also suggested certain points to be included in the decision text, saying the long-term goal of the Paris Agreement requires phasing down of all fossil fuels. Sources familiar with the proceedings said India urged the acceleration of the global clean energy transition as per national circumstances and acknowledging that  all fossil fuels contribute to GHG emissions . India also invited other countries to consider the sustainable development goal 12 (SDG 12) on sustainable con- sumption and production, and promote a global mass movement for climate-friendly lifestyles. The US is happy for India to continue buying Russian oil, including at prices above a G7-imposed price cap mechanism, if it steers clear of Western insurance, finance and maritime services bound by the cap, US treasury secretary Janet Yellen said on Friday. The cap will still drive global oil prices lower while curbing Russia's revenues, Yellen told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference on US-Indian economic ties. \</doc>

As of Friday evening India time, three and a half hours ahead of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, members were still deliberating on a draft agreement that was uploaded to the official COP27 website on Friday afternoon (IST). The 10-page document reaffirmed a commitment to the Paris Agreement of 2015, to ensure that the rise in temperatures does not exceed 2 degree Celsius, and as far as possible, stayed within a 1.5 degree Celsius increase. Achieving this, the document said, required "immediate, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions" as well as "accelerated financial support for developing countries from developed countries." Also Read | COP27 The draft text calls on countries to accelerate clean energy transitions, phase down "unabated" coal use, and phase out "inefficient fuel subsidies." In 2021, India fought to ensure that the text adopted at the last COP in Glasgow altered 'phase out' to 'phase down' with regard to the use of coal. At the beginning of the conference earlier this month, the President of\~\~ COP27 , Sameh Shoukry, had said that this COP would be an "implementation COP", striving to put into action a host of previous commitments, such as getting developed countries to finalise a pathway to deliver on climate finance as well as set up a facility to pay for 'loss and damage'. ALSO READ Distinct attempt being made to forget rich nations' historical contribution: India at COP27 The draft also calls for a "roadmap" to double adaptation finance by 2025 to $40 billion.\~This refers to money made available to developing countries and those most vulnerable to climate vagaries to build defences against future climate threats.\~ Also Read | India's long-term strategy to transition to a 'low emissions' pathway involves more nuclear power, more ethanol A major ask from India and other developing countries is for the developed countries to make good on a 2009 commitment to allot $100 billion in climate finance every year from 2020. Costs have now increased and so developed countries must come up with a "New Collective Quantified Goal" by 2025, Indian officials have stated. "A lot of issues including mitigation work program, the global goal on adaptation, loss and damage and climate finance are being negotiated as they remain contentious," said Mr. Yadav. COP27 was expected to clear this sticking point. The draft documents also expressed "serious concern" that despite all the nationally determined contributions by countries - that lays out steps to curb emissions in the years ahead - net emissions are expected to be only 0.3% below the 2019 levels, which was "not in line" with the need to keeping global temperature rise within 1.5 to 2\'b0C.

Today, fourteen of the world's largest agricultural commodity and trading companies released a plan to address deforestation associated with palm, beef and soy production in biomes around the world. This plan is in response to a joint Corporate Statement of Purpose made at COP26, in which they agreed to lay out a plan by COP27 to set agricultural production and trade on a 1.5C pathway to help meet global climate goals. While the plan released today represents progress for some commodities, it represents a step back for others and ultimately falls short of the 1.5C pathway that was promised. In response, World Wildlife Fund-US released the following statement from Carter Roberts, President and CEO: "A year ago, the world's largest agricultural commodity traders stood up in Glasgow and committed to do their part to deliver on the stable climate and intact nature we all need. Today those companies issued a roadmap that demonstrates progress on palm oil and steps forward on beef but falls well short of what is needed on soy and falls short on expectations that the roadmap delivers what's needed for a 1.5-degree future. "We commend the palm oil sector for strong commitments that cover supply from all origins. This builds on leadership from governments, supply chain actors and civil society, as well as strong progress in key landscapes, particularly Indonesia in recent years. The cattle sector commitments also demonstrate progress, with a clear commitment to end all deforestation in the Amazon by 2025, legal and illegal, for direct and indirect suppliers. However, the language regarding cattle commitments in the Cerrado is contradictory and may not cover the critical issue of habitat conversion beyond deforestation. Importantly, the cattle sector made no commitments to address issues of deforestation and land conversion in other biomes. While this is a good start, more must be done. "For soy, the roadmap includes deforestation but not habitat conversion. In so doing, it cherry picks which lands it will cover, leaving out significant parts of the most important landscapes, including 74% of the Cerrado in Brazil where 250 million tons of greenhouse gases are emitted on a yearly basis. Finally, the absence of a meaningful cutoff date will surely spark a race-to-the-bottom since producers will be paid to accelerate habitat destruction in advance of a commitment date 3 years away. "These companies hold the key to agricultural production practices and Scope III emissions for food manufacturers and retailers around the world. They've made progress in some parts of their business but we know they can do more in others, and if agricultural commodity traders don't do more, particularly with soy in places like the Cerrado, then neither can thousands of companies around the world that buy from them. "There's a clear path for agricultural companies to shift food production to degraded land. It begins with making commitments that match the expectations made a year ago in Glasgow. The financial world, governments, and WWF stand ready to help." Mauricio Voivodic, Executive Director of WWF-Brazil, added: "This roadmap presents some advances as companies are finally recognizing that they need to eliminate the destruction of ecosystems from supply chains. However, it's still frustrating that ecosystems like Cerrado are not yet fully and consistently considered in the presented commitments of the soy and cattle sectors. "The absence of a clear cut-off date and of targets to eliminate conversion from the soy supply chain locks the sector in a trajectory of high carbon emissions and continuing loss of carbon emissions. Science demonstrates that deforestation and conversion must be urgently eliminated from the commodities supply chains to decrease global GHG emissions sufficiently and reach the 1.5- target." # # # Additional Information about the Need to Address Deforestation and Conversion in Global Agriculture Supply Chains {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par At COP26, major global agriculture companies signed a joint Corporate Statement of Purpose that said they "h ave a shared commitment to halting forest loss associated with agricultural commodity production and trade " and agreed to "l ay out a shared roadmap for enhanced supply chain action consistent with a 1.5 degrees Celsius pathway" by COP27 .

What's Next: This roadmap is a step forward in some respects, but it still falls far short of putting the agri-commodities sector, and therefore our planet, on a 1.5C pathway. It is critical that the full sector takes meaningful, joint action to address both deforestation and conversion so global climate goals, and a livable future, can be achieved. We will continue to engage stakeholders, allies, and the agri-commodity community, as we have for years, to find ways to reach an agreement and credible implementation process to address the twin crises of climate change and biodiversity loss.

At COP27 , the annual UN Climate Change Conference, Alfa Laval will once again be part of the Swedish delegation and together with 25 other companies be joining the global effort to accelerate the transition towards net zero by 2050. COP27 takes place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, between 6-18 November 2022. The Swedish delegation includes Alfa Laval together with 25 other companies, as well as representatives from the Swedish government, research institutes and expert organisations. One of Alfa Lavals roles at the conference will be to moderate and host discussions regarding energy efficiency, long duration energy storage and the Swedish industrys transition towards the use of fossil-free steel in products and processes. The programme will be livestreamed and recorded by several organisations including Business Sweden, McKinsey and We Dont Have Time. For me, summits are about action, says Anna Celsing, Chief Sustainability Officer, Alfa Laval. We need to start executing and implementing and we need to do it now. We have?the technologies, and we are committed?to being front runners, to take the lead in the race towards net zero. We encourage partnerships, as we believe that teaming up with other experts and technology providers will speed up the pace, and COP27 is an excellent opportunity to meet other companies that share our vision for a fair and just transition. To reach the Paris Agreement we must work across sectors to speed up the transition. It is a two-folded approach, implementing existing technologies and accelerating deployment and commercialisation of innovation towards net zero, says Madeleine Gilborne, Head of Clean Technologies and VP Energy Division, Alfa Laval. We have technologies today that can contribute to reaching the Paris Agreement and we want to make these solutions visible to policy makers.

Sharm El-Sheikh (Egypt) Nov 10 (IANS) With the world requiring between $4 trillion and $7 trillion per year to shift towards sustainable development, the pressing issue of climate finance kicked off the UN Climate Change Conference's ( COP27 ) Thematic Days Agenda by reiterating it as a cornerstone for implementing climate action to save lives and livelihoods around the world. In the first of 11 themed days at COP27 , Finance Day addressed several aspects of the climate finance ecosystem, including innovative and blended finance and financial instruments, tools and policies that have the potential to enhance access, scale up finance and contribute to the transition envisaged and needed, including those related to debt for environment swaps. "Financing underpins the development of an energy transition pathway for Africa, but the unsustainable levels of public debt countries are managing acts as a block on advancing necessary climate initiatives," COP27 President Sameh Shoukry, who is also the Egyptian Foreign Minister, said on Wednesday. Finance Day featured a robust program of 26 events, including a Ministerial roundtable and saw the launch of the Reducing the Cost of Sustainable Borrowing initiative. The Rockefeller Foundation announced more than $11 million in grants to 10 organisations scaling Indigenous and regenerative agriculture practices around the world. Evidence makes clear the central role food systems can play in mitigating climate change. The funding will help scale the development, data analysis, financing, and education around regenerative agricultural practices, which can improve global food systems and mitigate the global food crisis. It is estimated that the world will require between $4 trillion and $7 trillion per year, to shift towards sustainable development and meet agreed Paris Agreement targets, and Wednesday's events enabled further cooperation to help close that gap. The sessions aimed to bring together all stakeholders involved in the climate agenda -- from the public and private sectors to philanthropic entities, Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) and the UN bodies, with the view to crafting an inclusive and just financing roadmap that supports the global South in implementing their adaptation and mitigation plans and renewing the commitment of developed nations to provide the necessary funding to "Leave No One Behind". At the opening ceremony, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly spoke to the significance of Finance Day, featuring an intensive program that included the discussion of topics that encourage the finance sector to assist the transformation to a sustainable economy and expressed hope that the conversations would be translated into serious commitments for finance adaptation. During the panel discussion, Climate Finance in a Polycrisis Era, key themes including innovative finance, financing just transition, sovereign debt for sustainability and climate change, and the role of the private sector in mobilising resources were addressed. Private finance was highlighted as essential to deliver trillions of dollars needed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees and ambition, action and accountability identified as critical to unlocking finance. During the day, several panels took place including: Mobilising Finance for Climate Action, wherein the key takeaway was a call for the doubling of finance compared to 2019 levels in 2025 by making the commitment for developed countries to step up financing so that developing countries to be reassured that no one will be left behind. Some 50 activists, including representatives of the youth and persons with disabilities, plus a Pikachu, the fictional Pokemon creature, and a T-Rex lookalike -- characters that we remember well from COP26 in Glasgow -- demanded an end to the financing of fossil fuels. "While the wealthiest governments are claiming climate leadership, they are actually funnelling billions of dollars towards new gas, oil, and coal projects, this will worsen the climate crisis," one of them told the massive group of journalists and delegates who paused their busy schedules to listen. The activists' t-shirts read 'Stop funding fossil fuels', a message directed at those attending the first of the thematic days of COP27 , on finance. The day concluded with COP27 facilitating a meeting of the heads of the African sovereign wealth funds, helping to mobilise investments and public private partnerships for increasing climate action. --IANS vg/ksk/ \</doc>

Sharm El-Sheikh (Egypt), Nov 9 (IANS) With the adoption of the loss and damage funding formally in the COP27 agenda in Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt, a platform has been created to explore the financing options to find possible ways to address climate change risks. A slew of financial pledges were announced by the developed nations in the backdrop of a year when extreme climate events demonstrated again the urgency to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Also climate envoy calling on rich countries to support poor nations at most risk from the environmental damage. At the opening of the two-day Climate Implementation Summit at COP27 , UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for a historic pact between the developed and developing countries to combine capacities, and pivot the world towards reducing carbon emissions, transforming energy systems and avoiding a climate catastrophe. Joining the issue, Britain Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said, "Instead of developing countries being unfairly burdened with the carbon debt of richer nations and somehow expected to forgo that same path to growth, we are helping those countries deliver their own fast track to clean growth. "The UK is making further commitments to support this today by investing 65 million pounds in a range of green investment projects in Kenya and in Egypt." With delegates discussing finance issues on Wednesday at COP27 , the first African COP for six years, the new report lays out the grim economic future some of the poorest countries in the world will face. The analysis in the report, titled 'The cost to Africa: drastic economic damage from climate change', was led by Marina Andrijevic, an economist at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Vienna. Estimates based on peer-reviewed methodology by Burke et al show that based on current climate policies, where global temperature rise reaches 2.7C by the end of the century, African countries can expect to suffer an average GDP hit of minus 20 per cent by 2050 and of minus 64 per cent Aby 2100. Even if countries keep global temperature rise to 1.5C as set out in the Paris Agreement, African countries face an average GDP reduction of minus 14 per cent by 2050 and minus 34 per cent by 2100. This underlines the fact that a robust loss and damage mechanism will be needed, even if countries succeed in keeping global heating to under 1.5C. First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon said, "In virtually everything we do on loss and damage, Scotland is trying to ensure that we listen to international perspectives, especially the perspectives of the Global South. "With loss and damage now on the formal agenda for the first time, this COP can mark a turning point in ensuring the views, experiences and perspectives of the Global South assume a far more central role. If that does happen it will lead to greater progress on loss and damage and will also. I hope lead to quicker action on other aspects of climate change. I encourage all parties to make space for serious, open and honest discussion over the next two weeks.a "The funding Scotland has announced is a small sum in terms of the overall scale of the loss and damage that developing countries face, but I hope that it sends an important message," Sturgeon said. Harjeet Singh, Head of Global Political Strategy, Climate Action Network International, said: "The new financial pledges from some rich countries to address loss and damage are welcome. It shows that they are finally acknowledging the lack of finance to meet the needs of people affected by climate disasters. "But this drip-feed of assorted pledges cannot detract from the demand of setting up a Loss and Damage Finance Facility at COP27 to fill the gap in the financial architecture under the UN system. What we need is institutionalised support that can be scaled up drastically to respond to multiplying economic impacts due to extreme weather events, and deal with the new challenges, such as sea level rise and melting of glaciers." The fact that developed countries did not block the agenda item on finance for Loss and Damage in COP27 "As well as promises of funds by countries like Denmark. But we need them to agree to establish the Sharm El-Sheikh Finance Facility for Loss and Damage at the end of COP27 ." COP27 are an outcome of the persistence of climate vulnerable countries and civil society voices. "An idea that was seen as marginal and radical just a year ago now has political will. Scotland's announcement is particularly laudable because it aims to help communities deal with climate impacts that cannot be simply measured in money terms, such as gender inequity and cultural heritage loss." COP27 The agenda outlines "30 Adaptation Outcomes to enhance resilience for 4 billion people living in the most climate-vulnerable communities by 2030. Each outcome presents global solutions that can be adopted at a local level to respond to local climate contexts, needs and risks and deliver the systems transformation required to protect vulnerable communities to the rising climate hazards, such as extreme heat, drought, flooding, or extreme weather." The 30 Adaptation Outcomes include urgent global 2030 targets related to: Transitioning to climate resilient, sustainable agriculture that can increase yields by 17 per cent and reduce farm level greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 21 per cent, without expanding agricultural frontiers, and while improving livelihoods including of smallholder farmers. Also protecting and restoring an estimated 400 million hectares in critical areas (land and freshwater ecosystems) supporting indigenous and local communities with use of nature-based solutions to improve water security and livelihoods and to transform 2 billion hectares of land into sustainable management. Mahmoud Mohieldin, UN Climate Change High-Level Champion for COP27 , said: "The outcomes were identified jointly with a broad range of active stakeholders, reflecting existing and new global targets based on science along with local knowledge and initiatives. The outcome targets will continue to be refined and expanded by the High-Level Champions with inputs from state and non-state actors to support their operationalization." This agenda will accelerate the Race to Resilience's global goal of making 4 billion vulnerable people more resilient by 2030. Of particular importance is the role of key enablers like finance and planning to accelerate adaptation in the near-term. A sum of $140 to $300 billion needs to be mobilised across both public and private sources annually with a minimum target of 50 per cent for adaptation, as called by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Of particular concern and focus is Africa, where the private finance share in the total financing of climate adaptation efforts is not more than 3 per cent ($11.4 billion). "Seven times that amount will be needed annually until 2030," added Mohieldin. --IANS vg/dpb \</doc>

New Delhi (PTI) The UN climate talks in Egypt dragged on into overtime on Saturday, with no sign of parties arriving at a consensus on several key issues, including loss and damage, mitigation work programme and adaptation. COP27 president Sameh Shoukry said deliberations continued through the night, but did not result in a clear direction towards a consensus. The success of the talks hinges on a fund to address loss and damage, which refers to the consequences of climate change that go beyond what people can adapt to or when options exist, but a community doesn't have the resources to access or utilise them. Financing or a new fund for addressing loss and damage -- for example money needed for relocating people displaced by floods -- has been a long-pending demand of poor and developing countries, including India. Developed nations, particularly the US, have opposed this new fund over fears that it would hold them legally liable for massive damages caused by climate change. "Need more time to agree on loss and damage, mitigation work programme and global goal on adaptation," Shoukry said in a media briefing. "After hearing the various perspectives, I, as president, developed (a) text on all of the three issues that are balanced (and) that I believe constitute a basis for moving forward," he said. The COP27 president said none of the groups could say all interests were reflected, but a vast majority thought that the text was balanced, could be a breakthrough and lead to consensus. He said parties want to explore the text further and would be provided an opportunity to do so. "It rests now with parties to find consensus and move forward," Shoukry added. EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans, who had proposed a plan on Friday to break the deadlock on the controversial issue of loss and damage, urged other parties to reciprocate the bloc's efforts to find a deal. He also reportedly said the EU was prepared to walk away from climate negotiations if a satisfactory outcome could not be reached. " COP27 is in overtime. The EU is united in our ambition to move forward and build on what we agreed in Glasgow. Our message to partners is clear: we cannot accept that 1.5C dies here and today," Timmermans tweeted. In exchange for the loss-and-damage fund, the EU's proposal tied it with emission cuts, asking countries to peak emissions before 2025 and phase down all fossil fuels and not just coal. Another important aspect of the proposal is that big developing countries like China and India -- though Timmermans did not mention India by name -- would need to pay into this fund as it would have a 'broad funder base'. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change had published a formal draft of the deal on Friday morning, but it made no mention of India's call for phase down of all fossil fuels. Experts said it was surprising that the call for phasing down all fossil fuels, the COP's second-most discussed new element, didn't find a place in the draft text despite most developing countries and some developed nations, including the US and the EU, supporting it. Some also said it seemed more like a statement from India -- a tactical move to deflect criticism over the use of coal -- and not its stand. The draft showed little progress on key issues like adaptation fund replenishment and a new collective quantified goal on climate finance. It also omits references to the need for rich nations to attain "net-negative carbon emissions by 2030" and their disproportionate consumption of the global carbon budget, something that India and other poor and developing countries have stressed throughout the summit in Egypt. \</doc>

New Delhi, Nov. 6 -- Leaders and officials from 200 nations will convene for the UN Climate Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt's Sharm El Sheikh on Sunday, coming together after a year when war and economic turmoil is feared to have weakened the climate agenda, even though the crisis continued to trigger devastating floods and forest fires. On the agenda for the November 6-18 summit will be discussions on implementation of various pledges on climate change mitigation and finance, most of which have not been put into action. It is also expected to discuss critical and highly debated issues like loss and damage and adaptation as part of the formal agenda. Mitigation refers to measures that will reduce carbon emission, adaptation deals with measures to minimise the impact felt from the climate crisis and loss and damage mostly concerns how to support developing countries, which are historically lowest of the emitters and are particularly vulnerable to the harms of a warming climate. First up on Sunday will be the formal adoption of agenda for the next two weeks. P4 Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Jammu&Kashmir.

November 14 -- More than 100 health systems, payers, drug manufacturers, associations and other industry organizations have signed on to the Biden administration's greenhouse gas and climate resilience pledge, according to a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announcement timed with the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ). \~ "The organizations that signed the pledge are demonstrating to the health sector that climate smart investments are not only possible but are becoming standard for the industry," HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement. HHS joined the United Nations' health program last year, which included commitments to supporting climate resilience and reduced carbon emissions. On Earth Day this year, the department partnered with the White House to launch its Health Sector Climate Pledge, a voluntary commitment that includes a 50% greenhouse gas emission reduction by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. Signees of the pledge are also committed to designating an executive-level lead for emission reduction by 2023, releasing a climate resilience plan for continuous operations by the end of 2023 and conducting an inventory of supply chain emissions by the end of 2024. HHS said 102 healthcare organizations have signed onto the pledge. The group includes entities representing 837 hospitals, HHS said, though adding federal systems like the Veterans Health Administration bumps that tally to over 1,080 hospitals, more than 15% of the country's total hospitals. Standout names on the full list of signatories included Kaiser Permanente, Elevance Health, DaVita, CommonSpirit Health, Pfizer, University of California Health, the Joint Commission and the National Academy of Medicine. \~HHS' announcement also noted a new joint plan with England's National Health Service to devise a proposal addressing healthcare supply chain emissions. The healthcare sector represents nearly a fifth of the nation's gross domestic product and was responsible for 10% of the nation's smog formation, 12% of acid rain, 9% of criteria air pollutants, 1% of stratospheric ozone depletion and 1% to 2% of carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic air toxins, according to 2016 study data cited in a recent congressional report. U.S. greenhouse gas emission increases between 2010 and 2018 were estimated to result in the loss of 388,000 disability-adjusted life years, per the same report, while provider groups faced an average 4.2 climate change-fueled extreme weather events within the past five years. Environmental resiliency efforts among provider organizations solicited by Congress for its report broadly differed, with about half saying they used at least one tool to measure emissions while fewer said they would be in a good position to meet the White House's 50% greenhouse gas emission reduction goal for 2030. \</doc>

Kolkata, Nov. 17 -- Kolkata-based companies Vikram Solar and SnapE Cabs signed the UK-supported Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV) Declaration and became part of the Accelerating to Zero Coalition platform. The platform with the names of new signatories will be launched on Thursday at COP27 in Sharm El Shaikh. The signing took place in the presence of British High Commissioner to India, Alex Ellis. The High Commissioner marked the COP27 Solutions Day in Kolkata. The event provided a platform for companies and businesses who have signed the ZEV Declaration to share and exchange best practices on their journey to 100 per centzero emission vehicles. During the interaction, the business leaders got an opportunity to network and explore collaborative opportunities with the UK. British High Commissioner to India, Alex Ellis said, "I am delighted to be in Kolkata, one of the world's most innovative cities in the fight against climate change. Be it on electrification of public transport system or the new Electric Vehicle policy, the UK is a partner of Kolkata and India on this journey. Congratulations to the two companies for joining the Accelerating to Zero Coalition platform, which will provide greater access to finance, technology and innovations." British Deputy High Commissioner to East and Northeast India, Nick Low said, "I am delighted to see companies like Vikram Solar from the east expand into the UK. Our office has also partnered with Snap-E Cabs to promote electric mobility. We are happy to support Kolkata's climate ambitions. Regional tie-ups such as this will help bolster the UK-supported Accelerating to Zero Coalition at the COP27 ." Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from United News of India.

Times atCLIMATE MEET Sharm el-Sheikh:Unable to find consensus over a new draft text of the COP27 outcome released on Friday morning, countries continue to be in a huddle beyond the scheduled wrap-up time of the climate conference to find some landing zones on crunch issues of loss and damage, climate finance and higher mitigation goal. The new draft text, a condensed version of the informal document (non-paper) released a day before, calls for deep and rapid emission cuts to keep the 1.5celsius goal alive, accelerate clean energy transition this decade and phase down unabated coal power and phase out and rationalise inefficient fossil fuel subsidies (reiteration of COP26 outcome). Reference to India's pitch on phasing down all fossil fuels continues to be missing in the new draft text despite many countries, including EU nations seeing rationale behind it. The Glasgow climate pact (COP26) wordings of  providing targeted support to the poorest and most vulnerable in the context of coal and fossil fuel subsidies is also missing. India had got the wordings added in the pact during final hours of negotiations in Glasgow last year. The fresh text may appear soon once the differences are sorted out. The success of this round of climate talks will be judged on the parameters of what the countries actually did for the loss and damage issue to help countries who suffered from climate change-induced disasters. Different proposals from different groups of countries are still being negotiated over who will provide money for such loss, whether a separate fund needs to be created at this conference or next year, and also on who would be the actual beneficiaries all developing countries or just the most vulnerable ones, such as island nations and least developed nations. As rich nations and many least developed ones want both India and China to also contribute to any such fund, the situation has become tricky. Both have categorically rejected this, arguing that the responsibility falls on developed nations whose historical emissions contributed the most to global warming. The EU proposal talks about immediately setting up a new fund with details to be worked out next year, aligning financial flows to the 1.5C goal, peaking global emission by 2025 and phasing down all fossil fuels. But creation of the fund is contingent on expanding the donor base, and the point that the fund will go to only the most vulnerable remains a sticking point. On the other hand, the G77 group (developing countries), including India, sought for the establishment of a fund at COP27 without deviating from principles of equity and CBDR-RC of the UN convention, and also without conditions put forward by the EU. The third proposal, from Germany and Chile, has three options first one proposes establishing a fund as well as other sources of funding at COP27 , second one foresees a fund next year, while the third one does not establish a fund but proposes other sources of funding, including outside of the UN climate convention. As the new draft text initially used  phase out in the context of coal power, India had to intervene and get it replaced by  phase down , like it did at COP26 in Glasgow. Para 28 initially spoke about  accelerating efforts towards the phase out of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies . Objecting to "phase out", the Indian negotiator requested the chair to use  phase down . Four new initiatives, including LOTUS (Low Carbon Transport for Urban Sustainability) and SURGe (Sustainable Urban Resilience for the Next Generation) were launched on Friday.  With over half of the world's population in cities, transport makes up 37% of CO2 emissions, said COP27 president Sameh Shoukry. Two others green investment and urban waste are primarily meant for African countries. \</doc>

Source: The Conversation (Au and NZ) - By Matt McDonald, Associate Professor of International Relations, The University of Queensland For 30 years, developing nations have fought to establish an international fund to pay for the "loss and damage" they suffer as a result of climate change. As the COP27 climate summit in Egypt wrapped up over the weekend, they finally succeeded. While it's a historic moment, the agreement of loss and damage financing left many details yet to be sorted out. What's more, many critics have lamented the overall outcome of COP27 , saying it falls well short of a sufficient response to the climate crisis. As Alok Sharma, president of COP26 in Glasgow, noted: Friends, I said in Glasgow that the pulse of 1.5 degrees was weak. Unfortunately it remains on life support. But annual conferences aren't the only way to pursue meaningful action on climate change. Mobilisation from activists, market forces and other sources of momentum mean hope isn't lost. One big breakthrough: loss and damage There were hopes COP27 would lead to new commitments on emissions reduction, renewed commitments for the transfer of resources to the developing world, strong signals for a transition away from fossil fuels, and the establishment of a loss and damage fund. By any estimation, the big breakthrough of COP27 was the agreement to establish a fund for loss and damage. This would involve wealthy nations compensating developing states for the effects of climate change, especially droughts, floods, cyclones and other disasters. We should also acknowledge the potential gaps between promises and money on the table, given the failure of developed states to deliver on US$100 billion per year of climate finance for developing states by 2020. This was committed to in Copenghagen in 2009. But it was a significant fight to get the issue of loss and damage on the agenda in Egypt at all. So the agreement to establish this fund is clearly a monumental outcome for developing countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change - and least responsible for it. It was also a win for the Egyptian hosts, who were keen to flag their sensitivity to issues confronting the developing world. The fund comes 30 years after the measure was first suggested by Vanuatu back in 1991. Not-so-good news The loss and damage fund will almost certainly be remembered as the marquee outcome of COP27 , but other developments were less promising. Among these were various fights to retain commitments made in Paris in 2015 and Glasgow last year. In Paris, nations agreed to limit global warming to well below 2, and preferably to 1.5 this century, compared to pre-industrial levels. So far, the planet has warmed by 1.09, and emissions are at record levels. Read more: Global carbon emissions at record levels with no signs of shrinking, new data shows. Humanity has a monumental task ahead Temperature trajectories make it increasingly challenging for the world to limit temperature rises to 1.5. And the fact keeping this commitment in Egypt was a hard-won fight casts some doubt on the global commitment to mitigation. China in particular had questioned whether the 1.5 target was worth retaining, and this became a key contest in the talks. New Zealand Climate Change Minister James Shaw said a group of countries were undermining decisions made in previous conferences. He added this: really came to the fore at this COP, and I'm afraid there was just a massive battle which ultimately neither side won. Perhaps even more worrying was the absence of a renewed commitment to phase out fossil fuels, which had been flagged in Glasgow. Oil-producing countries in particular fought this. Instead, the final text noted only the need for a "phase down of unabated coal power", which many viewed as inadequate for the urgency of the challenge. Likewise, hoped-for rules to stop greenwashing and new restrictions on carbon markets weren't forthcoming. Both this outcome, and the failure to develop new commitments to phase out fossil fuels, arguably reflect the power of fossil fuel interests and lobbyists. COP26 President Alok Sharma captured the frustration of countries in the high-ambition coalition, saying: We joined with many parties to propose a number of measures that would have contributed to [raising ambition]. Emissions peaking before 2025 as the science tells us is necessary. Not in this text. Clear follow through on the phase down of coal. Not in this text. Clear commitments to phase out all fossil fuels. Not in this text. And the energy text weakened in the final minutes. And as United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres lamented: "Our planet is still in the emergency room". Read more: 'Toxic cover-up': 6 lessons Australia can draw from the UN's scathing report on greenwashing Beyond COP27 In the end, exhausted delegates signed off on an inadequate agreement, but largely avoided the backsliding that looked possible over fraught days of negotiations. The establishment of a fund for loss and damage is clearly an important outcome of COP27 , even with details yet to be fleshed out. But otherwise, the negotiations can't be seen as an unambiguously positive outcome for action on the climate crisis - especially with very little progress on mitigating emissions. And while the world dithers, the window of opportunity to respond effectively to the climate crisis continues to close. It's important to note, however, that while COPs are clearly significant in the international response to the climate crisis, they're not the only game in town. Public mobilisation and activism, market forces, aid and development programs, and legislation at local, state and national levels are all important sites of climate politics - and potentially, significant change. Read more: How young climate activists are making their voices heard at COP27 over Egypt's protest suppression There are myriad examples. Take the international phenomenon of school climate strikes, or climate activist Mike Cannon-Brookes' takeover of AGL Energy. They point to the possibility of action on climate change outside formal international climate negotiations. So if you're despairing at the limited progress at COP27 , remember this: nations and communities determined to wean themselves off fossil fuels will do more to blunt the power of the sector than most international agreements could realistically hope to achieve.

As the UN climate summit in Egypt on Sunday created history by deciding to establish a fund to address loss and damage, experts in India welcomed it is a testament to the tenacity of climate vulnerable countries and a warning shot to polluters that they can no longer go scot-free with their climate destruction. India engaged constructively and actively on the subject of loss and damage, which refers to destruction caused by climate change-induced disasters, during the course of discussions at COP27 . The decision was approved at the COP27 closing plenary that started around 7:45 am (India time) after negotiators debated the updated drafts of the deal throughout the night. The success of the talks hinged on a fund to address loss and damage fund, which was proposed by the G77 and China (India is part of this group), least developed countries and small island states. Vulnerable countries had said that they would not leave COP27 without a loss and damage finance facility. Financing or a new fund to deal with loss and damage - for example money needed for relocating people displaced by floods - was a long-pending demand of poor and developing countries, including India. Developed nations, particularly the US, had opposed this new fund over fears that it would hold them legally liable for massive damages caused by climate change. "History was made today at # COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh as parties agreed to the establishment of a long-awaited loss and damage fund for assisting developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change," the official twitter handle of the UN climate summit in Egypt posted. UN Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres said\~ COP27 has taken an important step towards justice. "I welcome the decision to establish a loss and damage fund and to operationalise it in the coming period. Clearly this will not be enough, but it is a much-needed political signal to rebuild broken trust," he tweeted. Vaibhav Chaturvedi, Fellow, Council on Energy Environment and Water, said:\~"The hope that was raised on the first day of COP with inclusion of loss and damage in the agenda without any resistance from the developed world delivered at least partial success by the end of COP. While the new funding arrangement for supporting developing countries on the issue of loss and damage is welcome, who will pay for it is drowned into the choppy water of definitions, mechanisms, and most importantly; developed countries versus major economies." Ulka Kelkar, Director, Climate Program, WRI India, said the new loss and damage fund is a testament to the perseverance and tenacity of climate vulnerable countries and civil society groups. Tarun Gopalakrishnan, Junior Research Fellow, Fletcher School, Tufts University, said: "India rightly showed solidarity with the clear ask for a loss and damage fund coming into COP, even if India is unlikely to be the primary beneficiary of that." "This COP will be remembered for the agreement to create a loss and damage fund; which speaks to the scale of the climate crisis we are in," said\~Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends. "With the creation of a new #LossAndDamage Fund, COP27 has sent a warning shot to polluters that they can no longer go scot-free with their climate destruction," Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International, tweeted. "From now on, they will have to pay up for the damages they cause and are accountable to the people who are facing supercharged storms, devastating floods and rising seas," he said. \</doc>

At the COP26 in Glasgow last year, India made two significant commitments: It promised to meet 50 per cent of its energy needs from renewable fuels by 2030 and transition to a net zero carbon economy by 2070. By all accounts, the country is well on course to achieve its short-term target. Accomplishing the decarbonisation target will, however, require tackling much stiffer challenges. India will need "trillions of dollars" to become carbon neutral, according to a report that lays down the country's strategy to meet its 2070 goal. The document, released at the ongoing COP27 at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt, also notes that adapting to climate change could cost India more than Rs 85 trillion by 2030. In the past, funding has been a deal breaker in climate negotiations. That's why the world's third-highest emitter could have its task cut out. But there's another takeaway from the document which the negotiators at Sharm El-Sheikh, especially those from the rich countries, would do well to not miss out on: A business-as-usual scenario in funding would seriously imperil the Paris Pact's goal of keeping temperature rise down to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The strategy document does not specify mid-term targets or goals. However, the government's other policies do offer insights into the net-zero pathway. The National Hydrogen Mission launched in 2021, for instance, aims to make India a green hydrogen hub. The country also has clean energy plans such as 20 per cent ethanol blending with petrol to burn less fossil fuel by 2025 and an electric vehicle project has been on the government's anvil for at least five years. Using several of these technologies will require industries to make large-scale changes. Electricity's share in industrial energy will have to multiply three-fold by 2070. Electricity-driven four-wheelers should constitute 70-80 per cent of the road traffic. The recent impetus on renewables could mean that such electricity is from a clean source. However, China dominates the market of most essentials in the EV supply chain. That's perhaps one reason the strategy document is alive to scenarios in which fossil fuels continue to constitute a significant part of the energy mix. It talks of using methods such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) to remove GHGs before they enter the atmosphere. These technologies are currently expensive and of uncertain utility. That said, in recent times, CCS has become a key constituent of decarbonisation strategies of countries such as the UK. India should find ways to make knowledge transfers in these emerging technologies part of its trade pacts with rich countries. Releasing the strategy document, Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav underlined India's energy security concerns. India's per capita energy consumption is barely a tenth of that of the USA - the world's highest emitter. The country cannot afford to forgo its developmental imperatives, especially since that involves lifting a large section of its population above poverty levels. That's why addressing the climate problem can no longer be postponed: The solution to the crisis must be found without the poor having to do the heavy lifting. \</doc>

Bengaluru, Nov. 9 -- KKR & Co. Inc. will invest $400 million (about Rs.3,266 crore) in billionaire Anil Agarwal-backed Serentica Renewables, underscoring the US private equity firm's growing bets on the clean energy sector in India. The investment will be made as part of KKR's Asia Pacific Infrastructure strategy, the companies said in a joint statement on Tuesday. Both didn't disclose the size of stake KKR will buy. Serentica is a decarbonization company that seeks to provide complex clean energy solutions for energy-intensive industries. Established in 2022, Serentica is wholly-owned by Twinstar Overseas Ltd, which is owned by Agarwal's Volcan Investments Cyprus Ltd. Twinstar Overseas also owns controlling stakes in Sterlite Power Transmission Ltd and Sterlite Technologies Ltd. Gurugram-based Serentica is focused on industrial decarbonization, by making renewables the main source of energy for commercial and industrial users who use over half of the electricity generated in India. Serentica aims to provide assured renewable energy through a mix of solar, wind, energy storage and balancing solutions. "Our investment in Serentica reflects KKR's confidence in India's renewables sector and our commitment to advancing the energy transition in India. Energy-intensive, heavy-industry companies play an important role in society but have traditionally faced more challenges in meeting energy needs sustainably. With Serentica, we look to support these companies in their decarbonization objectives..," said Hardik Shah, partner at KKR. Since 2011, KKR has deployed over $15 billion globally to invest in renewable assets such as solar and wind with an operational power generation capacity of 23 GW as of 31 December 2021. In Asia Pacific, KKR sees renewables as core to its infrastructure strategy. In 2020, it set up Virescent Infrastructure, a renewable energy platform to own and operate renewable assets in India. KKR's most recent deal in India's renewable sector was a $450 million investment in Hero Future Energies, the renewable energy arm of New Delhi-based Hero Group. Standard Chartered Bank acted as the sole financial advisor to Serentica for the transaction. Serentica recently started its renewable energy platform in India to deliver continuous clean energy solutions to large-scale, energy-intensive industrial customers. The company has so far entered into three long-term power purchase agreements and is in the process of developing over 1,500 megawatts (MW) of solar and wind power projects in several states including Karnataka, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra. "This investment will allow us to leap ahead in our vision of decarbonizing large energy intensive industries and help in reversing climate change. This transaction is amongst the largest industrial decarbonization investments in India to date and carries forward the global decarbonization agenda which is centre stage at COP27 (2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference )," said Pratik Agarwal, director of Serentica. Serentica has set a medium-term goal of installing 5,000 MW of carbon-free generation capacity with various storage technologies and supplying over 16 billion units of clean energy annually and displacing 20 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.

November 17 -- The UN climate agency published a first draft on Thursday of a hoped-for final agreement from the\~ COP27 climate summit, repeating many of last year's goals while leaving contentious issues still to be resolved. The 20-page document is labelled a "non-paper", indicating it is far from a final version and there are still hours if not days left in the negotiations between delegates from nearly 200 countries. \~ It does not call for a phase down of all fossil fuels, as India and the European Union\~had requested. Delegates\~have worried\~that the key sticking point around launching a loss and damage fund for financing for countries being ravaged by climate impacts would stymie agreement at the COP27 summit in Egypt. The text does not include details for launching such a fund - a key demand from the most climate vulnerable countries, such as island nations. Rather, it welcomes the fact that the topic was taken up as part of this year's official agenda. It gives no timeline for deciding on whether a separate fund should be created or what it should look like, giving time for negotiators to continue to work on the contentious topic. On limiting the global temperature rise, the document mirrors language included in last year's COP26 agreement, stressing the importance of exerting all efforts at all levels to achieve the Paris Agreement temperature goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. Other unresolved issues include calls for boosting a global goal for finance to help developing countries adapt to the impacts of a warmer world, and plans for ratcheting up targets for cutting climate-warming emissions. Climate policy experts said there was deep concern about the talks reaching consensus on many key issues. "I think the problem is that there's a lot in here, and lots of it will be shot down by parties on all sides," said Tom Evans, a climate policy analyst at the E3G nonprofit think-tank. The document is based on requests that delegates from nearly 200 countries have sought to be included in the final deal. It will provide a basis for negotiations over the coming days that are likely to substantially flesh out and rework the text. \</doc>

November 07 -- The number of reported disease outbreaks and climate-related health emergencies in the Greater Horn of Africa region has reached its highest-ever level this century, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). Climate-related emergencies in the region\~increased by 30 per cent between 2011 and 2021, noted the WHO analysis released November 3, 2022.\~The Horn of Africa refers to the northeastern part of the African continent. \~ \~ \~ \~ The outbreaks of anthrax, measles, cholera, yellow fever, chikungunya, meningitis and other infectious diseases accounted for more than 80 per cent of the acute public health events reported in the region.\~Droughts, floods and other disasters accounted for 18 per cent Droughts, floods and disease outbreaksThe disease outbreaks have exacerbated the crisis faced by the region. The Horn of Africa is facing the worst\~drought\~in at least 40 years. At the same time, some parts of the region are shattered by floods and conflicts. At least 47 million people are already facing acute food shortages.\~"Food security is also a health crisis," said Dr Egmond Evers, acting incident manager of WHO greater Horn of Africa response.\~ Malnourishment impacts health. There is evidence linking cholera and measles with malnutrition, he told at a press conference.\~Food insecurity due to extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods has forced people to migrate.The Horn of Africa is home to 4.5 million refugees as well as 12.7 million internally displaced people.\~The poor state of overcrowded temporary shelters with poor water and sanitation can contribute to an increased risk of outbreaks, he warned.\~ Vaccination coverage in the region is far below the necessary threshold. Measles vaccination coverage is too low to prevent cases and most countries in the region - including Somalia and Ethiopia - had to deal with\~measles outbreaks\~in 2022. "We must step up critical actions like vaccinations and improve surveillance to prevent outbreaks from getting out of hand. We cannot delay any longer. We must act now," said Evers. Ebola outbreakA total of 132 confirmed Ebola cases, with 53 confirmed deaths, were reported in Uganda November 5, 2022, according to the country's health ministry. There has been a rise in the number of Ebola outbreaks since 2000, said Dr Patrick Otim, WHO Africa's incident manager for the Ebola outbreak in Uganda. \~ At least 19 of the 32 Ebola outbreaks were recorded in the past decade. This amounts to nearly 50 per cent increase over 10 cases recorded in the previous decade. The increasing outbreaks of Ebola, a zoonotic disease, have a link with climate change,he told Africa is the least responsible for global warming, but it is among the first to experience its tragic impact, said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa. So, world leaders must reach an agreement on stemming the rise in temperatures at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), which is very appropriately taking place in Africa, she said in her statement.\~ \</doc>

BATHINDA: Ahead of the upcoming United Nations Climate Change conference , COP 27 , the Carbon Brief, a website specialising in Science and policy of Climate Change and Oxford climate journalism network (OCJN), a programme at the Reuters institute for study of journalism (RISJ) at University of Oxford has prepared a database, Global South climate database. It is publicly available, searchable database of scientists and experts in the fields of climate science, policy and energy, to end disparity for journalists from Global South covering climate change to get easy access to climate scientists and experts ready to provide insights and quotes.It is being said that journalists in Global South comprising Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Pacific not get easy access to experts from their own regions but have to depend on experts from Global North, comprising developed countries. The goal of the project is to ensure that journalists from all over the world can contact scientists, experts from their own regions.The database was launched on Monday late evening and details of 412 experts from 81 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, Caribbean and the Pacific in the fields of climate science, policy and energy have already added. The experts converse in 51 languages and Hindi is at the 3rd spot with 38 experts speaking the language after 119 in Spanish, 47 into Portuguese. Even 18 experts speak in UrduAround 60% of respondents to the database use he/him pronouns, while over 33% use she/her.The database lists each person's area of expertise, institutional affiliation, contact details and other relevant information.Aruna Chandrasekhar from Carbon Brief moderating the launch shed light on the project, having been prepared by climate journalist Ayesha Tandon and Diego Arguedas Ortiz, network manager at OCJN.Ayesha and Diego said that they found that many journalists from Global South were facing issues of language and access to various experts. Found that 9 out of 10 experts available to contact were from Global North leaving only 10 percent experts who are available from Global South and Africa got only dismally low at 1 percent despite the region more prone to impacts of climate change with 16 percent population of the world. This database will go a long way in facilitating the journalists in having access to experts as more experts are being added to it.It was found that journalists have to spend hours in making contacts experts from own regions though these are available from developed countries, said Lagipoiva Jackson from the Pacific.It was found that many a time journos have to depend on Westernised system or culture in covering climate change, said Pakistan based journalist Waqas Ejaz.

New York: For many years the climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis have been treated as separate issues, but the reality - as highlighted on Wednesday at COP27 - is that there is no viable route to limiting global warming to 1.5C without urgently protecting and restoring nature. "The two need to be looked at as being on the same wavelength, and not one higher than the other," Elizabeth Mrema, Executive Secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the international legal instrument to protect biodiversity ratified by 196 nations, told UN News. 'Biodiversity Day' at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh comes just two weeks ahead of a high-level gathering of CBD States Parties in Montreal, aimed at reversing biodiversity loss. Four of the key architects of the Paris Agreement, including former UN climate change chief Christiana Figueres, have officially asked world leaders to deliver an £mbitious and transformative' global biodiversity agreement in the upcoming COP15 on biodiversity. "The climate and nature agendas are entwinedOnly by taking urgent action to halt and reverse the loss of nature this decade, while continuing to step up efforts to rapidly decarbonize our economies, can we hope to achieve the promise of the Paris Agreement," they said in a statement. The connection, explained The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) explains that the loss of biodiversity is already significantly affecting regional and global changes in climate. While natural ecosystems play an important role in regulating climate and can help to sequester and store carbon, the loss of forests, the draining of wetlands and other environmental degradation has contributed significantly to climate change. According to the agency, efforts to reduce deforestation and forest degradation and restore ecosystems, for example, could contribute to lowering annual greenhouse gas emissions. "If we invest in nature and natures infrastructure, forests, coral reefs, mangroves, coastal forests, well, it protects us from high storms. It provides habitat for species, but it also stores carbon. So, it has both a mitigation and an adaptation dimension," Inger Andersen, UNEP Executive Director, told UN News. Coral reefs get a new defender at COP27 At the same time, biodiversity is affected by extreme weather events and temperatures, especially in developing countries, due to limited resources to protect them. This is worrying, since 15 of the 17 countries with the largest biodiversity are in the global South. The effects of climate change on biodiversity are already visible, especially with many animal species already forced to change migration patterns, plants struggling to adapt to changes in temperature, and of course seriously vulnerable polar bears - the 'poster animals' of global warming - starving at the North Pole due to the lack of sea ice in a warming world. In the ocean, biologists are witnessing another tragedy as coral reefs, which provide food and shelter for over 7,000 other species, are dying because of the warming and acidification of the ocean. UNEP Goodwill Ambassador, Ellie Goulding launched a new initiative at COP27 aimed to protect these colonial animals. Last week, she led an expedition in the Red Sea, off the coast of Sharm el-Sheikh. "There's this sheer visual beauty. When you pass through with your mask and witness this brilliant cornucopia of marine life, you feel as if all life is swimming in front of your eyes. And it reminded me that coral covers just a tiny percentage of the sea floor, but it supports a quarter of all known marine species," she told a panel on Wednesday. Ms. Goulding reminded participants that even at 1.5C degrees of warming, 70 to 90 pe cent of all reefs will be lost; this number jumps to a worrying 99 per cent if our planet warms by 2.0 degrees C. "This is one of the most climate tolerant reefs in the world, and it just happens to be right here at your feet in Sharm el-Sheikh. And this is no ordinary reef. It's one of nature's great survivors and it could be the key to regenerating other reefs in the future," she explained. The singer-songwriter said it was "insulting" that less than 0.01 per cent of climate finance is devoted to protecting coral reefs. "I ask the global community of leaders to acknowledge that coral reefs are one of our greatest collective assets and to get seriously, seriously ambitious and competitive about funding, restoration and protection," she said. Forests, the Amazon and promises Important pledges aimed at protecting forests were made last year at COP26 in Glasgow. "Some of them are beginning to roll off the belt onto reality. But there's a reason why Egypt framed this as the 'implementation COP'; because those pledges and promises have to see real action," stated UNEP chief Andersen. Last week, the European Union also announced a new cooperation framework on reversing deforestation in Guyana, Mongolia, the Republic of Congo, Uganda and Zambia. On Wednesday, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, President-Elect of Brazil, drew a huge crowd at the pavilions and a meeting room in the afternoon as he stressed that his country would put up a very strong fight against illegal deforestation in the Amazon. He also announced that Brazil aims to host COP30 in 2025. Mr. Lula da Silva also announced the creation of an indigenous ministry in his new administration. "He will place a major emphasis on the Amazon and on tropical forests. And that is, of course, a massive gain for climate, for biodiversity and for the people of the Amazon," Ms. Andersen said, reacting to the Brazilian leader's announcements. The Egyptian COP27 'We need action now' Indigenous activists, who have made a strong showing since the start of COP27 , were especially vocal today, as they are the guardians of our planet's biodiversity. "My community was hit by two cyclones in just one year and our [entire] city was completely destroyed. We don't want to live like this anymore. We need a safe space; we need a safe planet," Adriana da Silva Maffioletti, a young activist from Brazil told UN News. She added that she hoped world leaders would listen to the indigenous leadership instead of exploiting them. "Indigenous people have the most sustainable way to live. So, we must learn from them and not put them aside in this fight. We protect over 80 per cent of the planet's biodiversity," she explained. Ms. Da Silva Maffioletti underscored that her people - their voices, experience and ideas - should be the number one priority in the fight against climate change. "This is not something for tomorrow. This is not something for 10 years [from now]. This is something for us to do right now. The climate crisis is affecting and killing people right now. So, we must act now," she declared. "We are not going to give up on this fight. Extractive companies, and even some wind energy projects that wear ae not being consulted [on] are affecting Mother Earth, our sources, our medicine," Yenilin Aurielen Lubo Bonivento, from the Guayu community in Colombia, also told UN News. She comes from the Guajira department in the north of the South American nation, an area among the most affected by climate change. She is also a biologist and is currently teaching young girls in her community about science. "We need to raise our voices, and [draw on the] science, combined with our ancestral knowledge. This is the key to fighting climate change." Updates on negotiations Regarding negotiations, the Egyptian COP27 Presidency reported on Wednesday that unfortunately, many delegations are "holding back" a number of negotiation rooms. "We would have hoped under the current circumstances to see more willingness to cooperate and accommodate than we are seeing in the reports that we receive from the various negotiating tracks. I [will] reserve the verdict: perhaps some countries and delegations will show more openness and accommodation as the last minute comes," Ambassador Wael Aboulgmagd, Special Representative for the COP27 President, told journalists. He added that, when negotiators were adopting the agenda, which includes for the first time a 'loss and damage' item, they only had "a breakthrough" at the last hour. UN News spoke with Ruanna Hayes, negotiator from the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), who confirmed that the discussions are not especially hopeful at the moment. "There's real concern about how things are progressing across the board. Of course, loss and damage is a key issue, the key outcome that the Alliance is looking for from this COP, and things are still not coming together," she said. Special Representative Aboulgmagd sent a message to negotiators, reminding them that although every delegation must consider its national interests, the situation [of climate change] is dire, as the science reports show. "I hope delegations in the negotiation rooms take this to heart and realize that they need to show progress, not in words but in action and implementation," he said. \</doc>

November 18 -- The COP 27 Presidency produced a\~non-paperto develop text for a Cover Decision November 17. The non-paper has references to equity and the phase-down of unabated coal power. It, however, does not have extensive details on the\~loss and damage facility demanded by the Group of 77 or the need to phase out fossil fuel use.\~ \~ \~ \~ \~ ............................................................................................................................................................. The draft text on the\~mitigation work programme\~(MWP) was produced, but disagreements persist in the form of bracketed text.\~ Options are provided on whether the MWP should be non-prescriptive, whether its timeline should be two years or till 2030 and whether or not developing countries should undertake enhanced mitigation efforts.\~ Draft text produced on the\~loss and damage finance\~agenda item fails to capture the one concrete demand from the G77 - a loss and damage finance facility under the UNFCCC.\~ It also brings in the language of "particularly vulnerable" to sow divisions among developing countries and shift attention to the most vulnerable rather than direct funding to all developing countries in need.\~ A draft text on\~Article 6.2\~was released early November 18. According to it, Parties are allowed to keep information on carbon credits confidential as long as they can justify it.\~ The draft text also invited parties to contribute to the trust fund to support work operationalisation under this decision's mandates.\~ Article 6.2 allows countries to trade greenhouse gas emission outcomes. A country that has earned credits by reducing greenhouse gas emissions can sell them to another country to help it meet its climate targets.\~ \~ It is being looked at as a tool to help nations meet their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC).\~ ............................................................................................................................................................. A draft text on\~Article 6.4, a carbon market under the United Nations, was released November 17, 2022. In the early days of CoP27 ,\~carbon removals\~- where carbon is taken out of the atmosphere - were recommended under Article 6.4 - a move that civil society groups have criticised. The draft text said there would be discussions with parties and observers on removals. It has also asked the supervisory body - which frames these recommendations - to consider the views of Parties and observers in elaborating and further develop recommendations on activities involving removals. ............................................................................................................................................................. In a new draft text on the\~Glasgow Sharm El-Sheikh Work Programme\~(GlaSS) on the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA), parties decided to initiate the development of a framework for GGA that would have a structured approach and will be considered and adopted in 2023.\~ It was also decided that the framework will have two functions - enhancing action and support for achieving the GGA and reviewing progress on GGA as part of the global stocktake (GST) in 2023.\~ The Parties also decided on four steps of an iterative adaptation cycle under the structured approach: Risk and impact assessment; planning; implementation; and monitoring, evaluation and learning.\~ Parties further decided on the various elements, approaches and sources of information to be considered under the structured approach. The framework would be reviewed before the GST.\~ ............................................................................................................................................................. The immediate establishment of a loss and damage finance facilitywas called for by minister from the G77 plus China, Association of Small Island States (AOSIS), Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Independent Association of Latin American and Caribbean countries (AILAC) at a press meet.\~ They wanted the\~developed countries not to feel cornered and politically agree on establishing a loss and damage finance facility, the details of which, including various funding options, can be discussed subsequently.\~ A proposal that would see the European Union agree to establish a loss and damage fund at COP27 with clear conditions was announced by Frans Timmermans, the executive vice president of the EU, at a late-night informal stocktake plenary event.\~ Timmermans had hinted at the same during a press conference earlier in the day. The fund would be targeted to support the countries most vulnerable to\~climate change impacts with a broad financial donor base. There would be a mosaic of financial solutions that would include the reform of multilateral development banks as part of the fund.\~ The EU wants countries to be more ambitious in bringing down greenhouse gas emissions along with this as a package deal. This would include stronger provisions on updated NDCs in line with the 1.5-degree Paris Agreement target.\~ ............................................................................................................................................................. The creation of a loss and damage funding facility\~at this COP was stressed up by Nabeel Munir, the ambassador of Pakistan to South Korea and lead negotiator for the G77 and China group at a press Climate Action Network Press briefing.\~ "Modalities and operationalisation can be done later," he added. Loss and damage is not a charity, but climate justice, he highlighted, adding that this COP will be unsuccessful if such a facility is not established. ............................................................................................................................................................. The Global Methane Pledge, which was established last year in Glasgow, now has 150 countries as members. The pledge aims to cut methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030 compared to 2020 levels, said US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry.\~ This could reduce global temperatures by 0.2 degrees Celsius between 2040 and 2070. About 95 per cent of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) now include methane or will include it with revision.\~ As many as 50 countries have developed national methane action plans, he added. "We challenge every country to return to COP28 with a national methane action plan, methane in their NDC and reduction projects underway," he stated.\~ China and India have not joined the pledge. Methane levels in the atmosphere reached a record high in 2021. But the silver lining is that methane is the cheapest and fastest way to slow down global warming in the years ahead, said Timmermans. CoP27 President Sameh Shoukry called for the need to provide technical and financial support to developing countries willing to reduce their methane emissions. Egypt has joined the pledge.\~ China is not a part of the pledge but has developed a draft action plan, which is going through legislative processes, said the country's Special Envoy for Climate Change Xie Zhenhua. China needs cooperation to better exchange experiences and best practices and develop capacity, including technology, he added.\~\~ \~ Canada announced that it was providing four million dollars to help Small Island Developing States in the Caribbean and Guyana to reduce methane emissions and help them achieve their Paris Agreement targets. \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH: India along with Australia will co-lead ministerial consultations on key outstanding issues of climate finance here at UN climate talks ( COP27 ). Both the countries will together coordinate with other countries and groups to find a definite points and commitments on the critical issue that may go to the final decision text of COP27 .The COP27 President on Monday announced setting up ministerial consultations on all key outstanding political issues, beginning Wednesday. While South Africa and Canada will look after the mitigation issue, Chile and Germany will jointly lead the consultation on 'loss and damage' which found place for the first time in the agenda of the COP.The issue of adaptation will be taken care of by Maldives and Spain whereas carbon market issues will be dealt with during consultation by Singapore and Norway.Meanwhile, the group of G77+China brought out a joint proposal on 'loss and damage' finance, proposing to establish a transitional committee to develop the objectives, principles and operational modalities of the fund by next year's climate talks (COP28). India is part of the G77+China group.The groups suggested that funds to assist vulnerable countries must be based on the principles of equity, and common but differentiated responsibilities & respective capabilities (CBDR-RC) -- it means the contributors to the fund would mainly be the rich nations who are responsible for climate change due to their massive cumulative emissions.In a related development on support to countries facing the worst effects of climate change, seven countries on Tuesday pledged new funding for the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) and Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF). Several other countries backed the funds' ambitious goals for meeting the most urgent adaptation needs.Announcing a total of $105.6 million in new funding, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Walloon Region of Belgium, stressed the need for even more support for the Global Environment Facility funds targeting the immediate climate adaptation needs of low-lying and low-income states.Additionally, countries including Belgium, Canada, France, and the United States, as well the European Commission, signaled political support for the two funds, and some expressed an intention to contribute further in the coming months.

The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP27 , is dubbed African COP as the impact of climate change on African countries will be a key theme of discussions. Agriculture and food systems will also be a critical focus of COP27 , with Saturday, 12 November, dedicated to both themes, in addition to adaptation. Also high on the climate agenda is the role of the youth, as 10 November is dedicated to their participation. Ahead of COP27 and in line with their commitment to this youth agenda, the African Development Bank and the Global Center on Adaptation hosted a webinar to examine ways to make agriculture attractive to the youth. The webinar titled, Are Climate-Smart and Digital Agriculture Solutions the Silver Bullet to Attract Youth, highlighted the potential of climate-smart and digital agriculture in attracting young people and thereby rejuvenating an aging global agricultural sector. Dr. Kevin Kariuki, African Development Banks Vice President for Power Energy, Climate and Green Growth, pointed out the challenges the agriculture sector faces due to the changing climate change. Agriculture across most of sub-Saharan Africa is still predominantly rain-fed and therefore extremely vulnerable to both short-term fluctuations and long-term changes in climate conditions. It is the most exposed sector with estimates indicating that climate change will cause a decrease in yields of 8 22% for Africas rain-fed staple crops over the next 20 years, Kariuki said. Dr. Beth Dunford, African Development Banks Vice President for Agriculture, Human and Social Development, noted that while agriculture holds tremendous potential for job creation in Africa, its current traditional form is not attractive to young people for various reasons, including negative perceptions. Who wants to wear overalls, dig the field with a hoe or drive a tractor when we can do it in a suit and dust coat, right? However, technology makes agriculture cool enough to motivate them to use tech-enabled enterprises to be part of agricultural value chains, Dunford said. Prof. Anthony Nyong, Senior Director for Africa at the Global Centre on Adaptation, said: There is a gap in the agriculture sector in Africa, and that is in the use of digital solutions. AAAPs Climate Smart Digital Technologies for Agriculture and Food Security Pillar is scaling up access to digital technologies and associated data-driven agricultural and financial services for at least 30 million African farmers. In the African Development Banks Program to Build Resilience for Food and Nutrition Security in the Horn of Africa (BREFONS), currently ongoing in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan, the AAAP is facilitating the integration of climate-smart digital technologies for adaptation and resilience. The project will increase the productivity of crops and livestock by 30%, reaching about 1.3 million farmers and pastoralists using climate services such as index insurance. About 55,000 additional jobs will be created for youth and women, said Oluyede Ajayi, Africa Program Lead, Food Security and Rural Well Being, Global Centre on Adaptation. Panelists said the youth must utilize their digital skills to accelerate the transformation of the agricultural sector, which forms the central pillar of Africas economy. They urged participants to contribute to solutions that enhance market linkages to promote agribusiness. Africas significant youth population faces rising unemployment with myriad negative consequences. These challenges are further exacerbated by climate shocks, skill gaps limited preparedness to address the effects of climate change, said Andre-Marie Taptue, Principal Economist at the African Development Banks Jobs for Youth program. AAAPs YouthAdapt program promotes sustainable job creation through entrepreneurship in climate adaptation and resilience in Africa by unlocking $3 billion in credit for adaptation action. Last year, the first set of ten young African entrepreneurs and Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises offering innovative solutions and business ideas that can drive climate change adaptation and resilience were awarded at COP26 in Glasgow. This year the Africa Youth Adaptation Competition 20 enterprises across Africa will each receive up to $100,000 in addition to mentorship and coaching to support their climate change adaptation innovation. Panelists included Claude Migisha from the African Development Bank, Dr. Fleur Wouterse, and Aramide Abe from the Global Center of Adaptation. They shared their views on how AAAP was shaping and adding value to the Bank Digital Agriculture Flagship program, ways to accelerate investor engagement in agriculture adaptation, and how the YouthADAPT was moving the needle on entrepreneurship, unlocking finance and job creation. Gislaine Matiedje Nkenmayi from Mumita Holdings, a recipient of the 2021 YouthADAPT Challenge award, shared her experience on how the $100,000 grant transformed her enterprise. With the grant, we were able to reach out to more than 10 cooperatives with a total of 257 smallholder farmers, to whom we offer free advisory services, low-cost greenhouses and solar-powered irrigation systems. We have been able to expand production from 100kg to 1000kg of fresh vegetables weekly, Nkenmayi said. In her concluding remarks, Edith Ofwona Adera, Principal Regional Climate Change Officer and AAAP coordinator at the Bank stressed the need to strengthen adaptation and resilience measures and expedite mainstreaming climate adaptation for transformation at scale. She called for the engagement of the private sector, given the role they can play in adapting to climate change, financing adaptation, and supporting others through products and services for resilience. \</doc>

Today, Finance Day at COP27 , Secretary John Kerry, special presidential envoy on climate, announced a new carbon credit initiativethe Energy Transition Acceleratorto encourage private companies to help developing countries to finance the transition from fossil fuels to clean and renewable energy. The program will take advantage of voluntary carbon markets used by companies to meet their zero emissions commitments and supplement public financing from governments and public banks. Its start date will be at COP28 in 2023. In response, Sierra Club International Policy and Climate Campaign Range Director Cherelle Blazer issued the following statement: While innovative and creative solutions to the greatest crisis of our time are always welcome, carbon markets have, at best, a dubious track record of delivering true carbon reductions, and there are a number of ways this program can fail. It remains to be seen whether the Energy Transition Accelerator can generate the money needed to achieve decarbonization to the extent that science prescribes. It also remains to be seen whether it actually supplements existing commitments or allows corporations to avoid decarbonizing their own operations or supply chains. Sierra Club Delegation at COP27 : Ramn Cruz, President of the Sierra Club Cherelle Blazer, Range Director of the Sierra Club Climate and International Policy Campaign Leslie Fields, National Director of Policy, Advocacy and Legal Affairs Steve Hertz, International Climate Advisor Cindy Carr, Press Secretary for the Climate and International Policy Campaign (English) Sierra Club Statement On US Carbon Credit Announcement At COP27 SHARM EL-SHEIKH -- Today on Finance Day at COP27 , Secretary John Kerry, US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, announced a new US carbon credit initiative -- the Energy Transition Accelerator -- to encourage private companies to help finance the transition of developing countries from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy. The program would tap the voluntary carbon markets that companies use to meet their Net Zero pledges to supplement the public finance from governments and public banks and has been announced to be up and running by COP28. In response, Cherelle Blazer, Sierra Club International Climate and Policy Campaign Director, released the following statement: While creative and innovative solutions to the biggest crisis of our time are always welcome, carbon markets have, at best, a fraught record of delivering real carbon reductions, and there are a number of ways that this program could go wrong. It remains to be seen whether the Energy Transition Accelerator can generate the money needed to decarbonize at the scale science demands and if it actually supplements existing commitments or allows corporations to avoid decarbonizing their own operations and supply chains.

India, Oct. 31 -- With barely a few days to go before the 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, two things have happened. First, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched Mission LiFE (Lifestyle For Environment) on October 20 in the presence of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. It is a global action plan, listing potential lifestyle changes for climate-friendly behaviour. Second, in contrast, there was a debate on "climate change and security" in the UN Security Council (UNSC). A draft resolution on the same subject in UNSC in December 2021 was fortunately defeated through a Russian veto, with India voting against the draft. The 2022 debate was yet another attempt by developed countries to go outside the comprehensive UNFCCC architecture to evade its principles and commitments and disrupt the balance, among other things, between mitigation, adaptation and financing to the detriment of developing countries. Last year, India's explanation of the vote called them out. "Ironically, many of the UNSC members are the main contributors to climate change due to historical emissions. If the Security Council indeed takes over the responsibility on this issue, a few States will then have a free-hand in deciding on all climate-related issues." But the reasons for trying to "cannibalise" UNFCCC are clear if one looks at the status of implementation of climate pledges by developed countries. COP27 comes at a time when both developed and developing countries are desperately searching for energy security in the face of unilateral sanctions, the coronavirus pandemic, escalating new and old conflicts, and burgeoning humanitarian needs draining donor funds. For once, the West is also feeling the pinch. Many European Union (EU) countries, such as Germany, Austria, France, Italy and the Netherlands are returning to coal plants. The export of coal to Europe is surging. Bank lending to fossil fuel companies increased by 15% this year. The EU decided that even natural gas is green energy for its "green" taxonomy. Fossil fuel producing countries such as Norway and the United States (US) are raking in money. The EU is on the verge of a recession. The US is faring better by pumping out oil from its strategic reserves, passing the Inflation Reduction Act and urging the Gulf to meet the significant shortfall in the world supply. However, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries-plus (OPEC+) cut down on production, defying the US. China, too, seems to be losing the appetite to "lead" climate action. The IEA Coal Market Update 2022 predicts that coal demand will likely increase next year to a new all-time high. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s Fourth Assessment Report points out that to limit the global temperature rise below 2degC, Annex I parties must reduce emissions by 25%-40% in 2020, but did a mere 12.6%. Developed countries seem sure to miss their Paris 2030 targets. An outcome of the 2021 Glasgow COP26 was the Mitigation Work Programme (MWP) agreement. But with the developed world struggling, they will shift the burden of mitigation on to the Global South, non-State actors, multilateral financing institutions and "market forces." The $100 billion per year by 2020 pledged at COP15 by developed countries is far from being reached. The Green Climate Fund has few resources left. We are witnessing innovative accounting rather than innovative financing. The best-case scenario claimed is $80 billion. But if one takes out double accounting, inflated calculation due to the inclusion of the project cost rather than climate-related only and the cost of mere "developmental" projects, the figure is less than $40 billion. Still, COP27 can agree to urgent rechanneling of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to developing countries. But it shouldn't end up repeating what happened during Covid-19 in August 2021, when $650 billion SDRs allocated by the IMF, the largest in its history, went mainly to developed countries based on a country quota within the IMF. The gap is even more stark when it comes to equal funding for adaptation vis-a-vis mitigation. IPCC AR6 2022 points out that "less than 20% has been for adaptation", and hardly half has been disbursed, undercutting the main ask of the Global South. IPCC also says that "loss and damage," which refers to losses that developing countries cannot adapt to, is not addressed. Can COP27 operationalise the Santiago Network on Loss and Damage or at least the financing facility in the face of procrastination by developed countries? It shouldn't become a "Lost and Damaged" COP! The last thing developing countries want is to be left at the mercy of market forces. While the world is pinning its hopes on renewable technologies coming good, both on technological and affordability fronts, there is little to enthuse them so far. The corporate world ought to ensure the viability of renewables to run large economies. India stands as a beacon of hope by adopting robust, upgraded Nationally Determined Contributions, driving down prices of renewables, launching Mission LiFE and spearheading both the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. With floods and extreme climate events in the Indian subcontinent and Small Island Developing States, Egypt has called COP27 "Implementation COP". It's the last chance before the "global stock take" in 2023 to assess progress on climate action. Developed nations must not backtrack on their Paris pledges but commit to "Global Net-Zero", which means "Net-Negative" by 2050, and set pathways for climate financing. The Global South should not fall, yet again, for the "divide and rule" policy of the North. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Lucknow.

India, Nov. 10 -- Civil society members calling for balance between funds that go to mitigation & adaptation World leaders and policymakers are meeting in Egypt for the 27th Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The fact that the summit is taking place on African soil has given residents of the continent, the worst-hit victims of climate vagaries, high hopes that urgent issues like climate financing will be at the centre of discussions. The conference comes at a time when Africa is facing prolonged droughts, food insecurity, high energy cost and disasters like floods. The residents are happy that, in these circumstances, the climate agenda will be highlighted comprehensively at COP27 . Agriculture, especially crop farming, was never a trial and error affair due to failing rains. As droughts ravage some places, unusually high rainfall overrun others. "This meeting should provide tangible solutions and compensation for the losses," added Osundwa, who has abandoned crop farming and switched to beekeeping. The latest United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Adaptation Gap Report highlighted the sad state of affairs and the impending danger that the continent faces. Africa has contributed negligibly to the changing climate, with just about two to three per cent of global emissions, the report noted. "But it stands out disproportionately as the most vulnerable region in the world." "The figure is expected to hit $50 billion a year by 2030 if no appropriate mitigation efforts are put in place," the bank said in a statement. A section of experts and climate activists from Africa, however, are optimistic and hopeful that this year's conference, which some described as "Africa's COP", will be a game-changer because it's a mega opportunity to highlight the continent's unique needs and dire circumstances. Amid unmet climate commitments, energy and food supply chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the current chair of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN) on climate change, Ephraim Mwepya Shitima of Zambia is happy that the continent's priorities are already taking centre stage at the summit. "The Russia-Ukraine conflict is a setback to Africa's climate agenda. It diverts the continent's attention from climate obligations to food supply chain resilience. But we will not allow a geopolitical situation to lower our expectations," said Mwepya, the lead negotiator, in a statement to the press. COP27 could also advance the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) implementation, including adaptation and mitigation efforts and delivering necessary finance to enhance implementation, he added. "Besides new agenda like push for a dedicated loss and damage facility, some of our agenda items are from previous summits and we plan to reiterate them," he said, adding: For example, we will push for delivery of the $100 billion a year by 2020 promise that was not met by developed nations. Africa has high hopes from COP27 , partly because it is the fifth to be held on African soil, said the executive director of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), Mithika Mwenda from Kenya. PACJA is a powerful consortium of over 1,000 organisations from 48 African countries and is very vocal in the fight against climate change. "Despite the summit being christened 'the African COP', the African civil society wants to qualify it to be the ordinary Africans' COP. This is because we want the issues that are pertinent to Africa to be abundantly articulated throughout the 11 themed days," he says. The activists and members of civil society are calling for a balance between funds that go to mitigation and adaptation, especially after a statement released by the Global Center on Adaptation showed that only 7 per cent of the funds go towards climate adaptation. Climate change is likely to cost $579 billion by 2030, with a big chunk of the global finance skewed toward mitigation, according to the report. "Only 7.2 per cent of global climate finance goes to adaptation efforts." COP27 One challenge African parties face in the negotiations is the inability to quantify intangible loss and damage such as deaths, loss of livelihoods or cultures due to displacements for financial compensation.

Cairo, Sep 30 (IANS) Egypt has set out a vision for the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which aims to make it an "implementation COP" by pushing for actions across prior agreements through all areas of climate change needs, according to a press release by Egypt's COP27 Presidency. "We must accelerate climate action on all fronts including mitigation, adaptation and finance in addition to adopting more ambitious mitigation measures to keep the 1.5 degrees Celsius within reach," Egyptian Foreign Minister and COP27 President-Designate Sameh Shoukry was quoted as saying in the Wednesday press release. Egypt will host COP27 from November 7 to 18 in its Red Sea resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh, Xinhua news agency reported. There is "no room for delay in the fulfillment of climate pledges or backtracking on hard earned gains in the global fight against climate change", Shoukry was quoted as saying. "We must work together for implementation. We need to act, and act now, to save lives and livelihoods," Shoukry added. Wael Aboulmagd, special representative of the COP27 president, told a COP27 press briefing that 5 million people die every year because of temperature extremes and 4 per cent of global economic output could be lost by 2050 because of climate change, according to the press release. Over the past few years, Egypt has been focusing on green economy by building solar energy plants, promoting eco-friendly industries such as waste recycling, boosting use of natural gas-powered vehicles, working to plant 100 million trees nationwide, and raising popular awareness of protecting the environment. --IANS int/shs \</doc>

New Delhi, Oct. 28 -- Last year at the United Nations climate conference (COP26), India used its might to intervene. Along with China, India took issue with the draft deal's suggestion to "phase out" coal, preferring the wording, "phase down." After much back and forth and hurried discussions between leaders, Bhupendra Yadav, minister for environment, forests, and climate change, read out the final version. It said that nations should work toward a "phase down" of coal power. The intervention was, for India's government, a success. Now the country is expected to exercise its influence yet again to look out for its own interests at the upcoming U.N. climate conference in Egypt, known as COP27 . A key issue for India at COP27 will be how to finance both adapting to climate change and limiting fossil fuel emissions, according to a senior Indian government official who will be involved in the negotiations. Leading up to COP27 , India announced its new climate plan saying the country will aim to achieve half of its energy requirements from non-fossil fuel-based energy sources by the year 2030. Currently, 42 percent of the country's installed electricity capacity is from non-fossil fuel sources. "India has always played a key role in climate negotiations and I think Egypt will be the same," said Navroz Dubash, a lead author of various U.N. climate reports and a long-time observer of climate policy and governance. About 80 percent of India's population lives in regions highly vulnerable to extreme disasters like severe flooding or heat waves, according to a 2021 study by the climate think-tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water based in New Delhi. Meanwhile, the nation is currently the world's third biggest emitter of carbon dioxide behind China and the U.S., according to the latest estimates. No other country will see a bigger increase in energy demand than India in the coming years, and it is estimated that the nation will need $223 billion to meet its 2030 clean energy targets. India wants the $100 billion-a-year pledge of climate funds for developing countries, a promise made in 2009 that hasn't yet been fulfilled despite being two years past its deadline, to be assessed, according to the official. Other questions around financing, such as what happens to climate funding in the long term, what contributions rich countries will make to poorer ones, and how to make finance flows consistent with global temperature limit goals, also need to be addressed, they added.

India, Nov. 11 -- The world has gathered at Sharm el-Sheikh to reassess and reiterate actions required to limit global warming and adapt to its consequences. Setting an ambitious pace and scale of climate action at this year's Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) is imperative. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report (Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability) painted a disturbing picture. Around 3.6 billion people live in countries vulnerable to climate impacts; with the majority in the global South. Inequity, lack of capacity, development challenges, and limited resources constrain their ability to mitigate or adapt to changes. However, COP27 is taking place against the backdrop of the world slowly recovering from the pandemic, high energy prices, and the ongoing Ukraine crisis. In this context, what are the actions that COP27 must prioritise? A focus on the developing world and poorer nations is key, and a three-pronged approach can be considered by the emerging grouping of global South nations in the talks. First, they must push COP27 to implement the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCC) principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC). The developed countries' narrative in the run-up to COP27 has been that all nations (not just historical emitters) must make efforts towards emission reductions. However, the per capita emissions of developing economies have been historically low. Given the stark per capita emission inequality, it is unjust, for example, to demand that India - which has less than 1.9 metric tonnes (Mt) CO2 emission per capita - to undertake costs similar to nations such as the United States (US) whose per capita emission stands at over 15.52 Mt CO2. There are early signs that developed nations are again pushing this agenda, but the global South caucus must ask for adequate time, financial and technological assistance and policy space to transition to a low-carbon future. Moreover, there is a policy gap in climate mitigation efforts from developed countries. A 2022 study published by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) pointed out that developed members of the G20 - responsible for around 75% of global GHG emissions - are not on course to meet their climate targets. Ironically, India, a developing country, is the only G20 member that is not just on course, but has also been significantly enhancing its contributions towards mitigation. Developed nations must be held accountable to the world by poorer countries. Second, they must prompt COP27 to make the urgently required progress towards assisting the most-vulnerable countries in enhancing their climate resilience and adaptation. The IPCC report highlights that between 2010 and 2020, climate-induced extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and storms killed 15 times as many people in highly vulnerable developing countries compared to developed nations. UNEP estimates that the cost of adaptation will vary from $140 billion to $300 billion per year by 2030. The current provision of $100 billion annually for mitigation and adaptation is grossly insufficient to assist developing countries. Further, developed countries still need to meet their annual $100 billion climate finance commitment in 2020 and 2021. Confronting these challenges requires a concerted response to ensure high-vulnerability populations have the financial, new technological and institutional resources they need. Third, despite pushback, developing countries should ask for loss and damage to be established as a permanent agenda at future COPs. The IPCC report stressed that even the most effective adaptation measures will not prevent all losses and damages in vulnerable regions. Therefore, it will be critical to expediting urgent progress on the operationalisation and funding of the Santiago Network on Loss and Damage (SNLD), which can assist developing countries with technical assistance in averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage. This conversation has come back into the negotiation mainstream after several years and developing countries must not allow it to go to the back-burner again. Any further delay in implementing action will lead to great costs that will hurt developing countries disproportionately. Failing to support these nations adapting to the worsening climate impact today will influence the scale of devastation tomorrow. The international community must stand in solidarity.

November 14 -- India wants countries to agree to phase down all fossil fuels at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt, rather than a narrower deal to phase down coal as was agreed last year, Reuters news report said. Countries agreed at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, last November to a final statement which, for the first time, committed parties to the U.N. climate summit to speed up efforts towards a phasedown of unabated coal power - taking aim at the most polluting fossil fuel. India wants to expand that pledge to include all fossil fuels. Asked to confirm that was its position, a spokesperson for the Indian COP27 delegation said: "We did not mention coal at all." The push would put oil and gas consumer and producers in the spotlight as well as those countries that rely on coal. India generates around three quarters of its electricity by burning coal, according to the Indian Ministry of Coal. The proposal would have to be agreed by consensus during the next week if it were to go into a final COP27 deal. The spokesperson said India had referred to a report by the U.N. climate science panel, which said countries must halve emissions by 2030 to meet climate goals and that this would require a substantial reduction in fossil fuel use. "We mentioned the IPCC AR6 report that has come since Glasgow that recognizes the need for phase down for all fossil fuels. This was stated in the context of a clean energy transition only," the spokesperson said. \</doc>

MUMBAI: India doesn't have the luxury of time for climate action, even as the goals set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the UN climate change conference in Glasgow (COP26) are doable, Maharashtra's former environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, who represented the state at the COP26, has said ahead of the COP 27 .India had promised the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to cut its emissions to net zero by 2070 and announced enhanced targets for renewable energy use and reduction in carbon emissions at the Conference of Parties (COP26). Ahead of the COP 27 , Thackeray also said that cities would have to lead the way to implement the climate action goals. He stressed on having sustainability in development and economics, to make this work, saying that politics should be kept away from climate action. "The biggest issue today for all countries is climate, especially for a country like ours, which has a high population density. We are a very special mix of urban and rural, agrarian and industrialised. We will be impacted the most by climate change due to our crop patterns, settlement locations, irrespective of socio- economic strata. We need to realise that we don't have the luxury of time for climate action. COP26 was where policymakers from around the world came together. The good part is it also had regional governments and cities, corporates and NGOs. It's this collective work that will make an impact," Thackeray said. Green activists and environmentalists said that from COP27 , it was expected that stakeholders review the progress made so far and also encourage data, innovative climate technologies and support entrepreneurs. 'PM Modi's 'LIFE' movement will be theme of India pavilion at COP27 'The Union environment ministry recently announced that LIFE (Lifestyle for the Environment), a global initiative launched by PM Modi, will be the theme of the India pavilion at the upcoming COP27 at Sharm-El-Sheikh in Egypt. Modi had proposed the one-word mass movement 'LIFE' at COP26 last November.Subsequently, he launched 'Lifestyle for the Environment - LIFE Movement' in June this year. This will bring into focus the unsustainable lifestyle of rich nations whose 'mindless' consumption of resources is said to be one of the key reasons for high cumulative historical emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which led to climate change. Data show India is the fourth biggest emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the world after China, the United States and the European Union. But due to its massive population, India's emissions per capita are much lower than big economies. India emitted only 1.9 tonnes of CO2 per person in 2019. On the other hand, the US had per capita emissions of 15.5 tonnes and Russia had 12.5 tonnes. Last year, Maharashtra had bagged the Inspiring Regional Leadership Award from Under2 Coalition for Climate Action and became the only Indian state to win one of the three awards by U2 in Scotland. Maharashtra's efforts for climate action at a sub-national level were feted by the Under2 Coalition, the largest global network of states and regions committed to climate action.'Development versus conservation debate' While Mumbai released its first Climate Action Plan (MCAP), a policy document to adopt an evidence-based planning approach and mobilise resources to move from action planning to strategic projects, in March this year, issues like the hacking of trees for construction of the Metro 3 car shed are still a bone of contention between the successive governments. With the new Shinde-Fadnavis government deciding to go ahead with the construction of the car shed at the Aarey Colony forest, protests have started once again. "The new government's stance on Aarey forest and the car shed has made it amply clear that this dispensation is not serious about the environment and the high benchmarks we've set in climate action. I hope they realise what they're leaving for the current generation," Thackeray said. 'Working in silos for climate action no longer feasible' Thackeray also pointed out that working in silos for climate action was no longer feasible. "We constituted the Maharashtra Council of Climate Change, headed by the chief minister. It has targets for various departments like energy, transport, urban development, finance and planning, and industry, as I strongly believe that climate action is no longer just the work of the environment ministry. We can't work in silos now, we need collective action that is meaningful, tangible and reviewed. I have also urged the government of India to constitute the Indian Council of Climate Change with environment ministers from all states, just like the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council," he said. 'Some Indian states can achieve net zero target by 2050'While PM Modi's net zero pledge was seen as a significant step, activists pointed out that India still generates more than 50 per cent of electricity from coal. However, Thackeray said that some Indian states could actually achieve the target by 2050. "It's the state governments who can lead the way. India has set a target for 2070, which is a collective target for all the states in our country. But it is possible and necessary for states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Gujarat, West Bengal, Bihar and Delhi to hit this much earlier. These are states which have begun their pathway towards climate action and can achieve the goal as soon as 2050," he said. Thackeray added that COP26 was where policymakers from around the world came together and the good part was it also had regional governments and cities, corporates and NGOs.In 2021, the Maharashtra government had announced its new electric vehicle (EV) policy with an aim of making such vehicles achieve 10 per cent share of total registrations by 2025. Another target laid down in the new policy was to establish one gigawatt of battery manufacturing capability in the state."Our EV Policy 2021 gave a huge boost to EVs in Maharashtra, and thus India. BEST's double decker electric bus is what we pushed for, making it India's first double decker electric bus. Our mandate for all public transport fleets to be electric or alternate clean fuel has also helped local bodies save on their high spendings on fossil fuel. Pune has been shortlisted for a C40 award in Buenos Aires, later this year, as a result of our policy. We had also begun to look at hydrogen-run buses for Mumbai as an alternative. I hope this continues as it helps the local bodies in pollution mitigation and has huge savings," Aaditya said. India has been setting up its pavilions at COPs since 2015 to showcase its achievements in climate actions. Several think tanks, civil society organisations, industry bodies and private-sector firms organise side events at the India pavilion. Egypt will host COP27 from November 7 to 18.

Sharm el-Sheikh: Countries, including India  representing more than 50% of global GDP  on Friday jointly launched a package of 25 new collaborative actions at the UN climate talks ( COP27 ) to be delivered by the next year's conference to speed up decarbonisation of five key sectors: power, road transport, steel, hydrogen and agriculture. These sectors collectively account for more than 50% of global emission. Working out a common target date to phase out polluting cars and vehicles is one of the collaborative actions under the plan. Though preliminary discussion backed such target dates of 2040 globally and 2035 in leading markets, the countries will take an individual call on their respective target dates consid- ering their domestic circumstances. The actions under each sector will be delivered through coalitions of committed countries  from the G7, European Commission, India, Egypt, Morocco and others, supported by leading international organiza- tions and initiatives, and spearheaded by a core group of leading governments. These efforts will be reinforced with private finance and leading industry initiatives. More countries will be encouraged to join the action plan to decarbonise the five sectors. \</doc>

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has launched the EBRD Climate Adaptation Action Plan (CAAP) at COP27 , the global climate summit taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The EBRD Climate Adaptation Action Plan brings together a number of elements to strengthen the Bank's adaptation work: integrating adaptation into project and policy design, building partnerships, developing business and mobilising private finance. "We don't have one single answer on adaptation; our response is a combination of a number of different tools and approaches," said Harry Boyd-Carpenter, EBRD Managing Director, Climate Strategy and Delivery. Key Highlights:  At last year's climate summit, COP26, the Glasgow Climate Pact included a commitment from developed countries to at least double - from the 2019 levels of US$ 20 billion - the collective adaptation finance to developing countries by 2025.  Between 2008 and 2018, insured losses to extreme weather events in EBRD economies totalled US$ 25 billion.  In line with the Bank's conviction that Africa has strong potential as a global leader in climate adaptation, it also endorsed the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Programme (AAAP), which aims to mobilise US$ 25 billion over five years to scale climate adaptation action.  Over the past decade, the EBRD has financed over 350 climate resilience investments with a business volume of more than (EURO)10 billion and adaptation finance exceeding (EURO)2.8 billion. Original Press Release: Nov. 12 -- European Bank for Reconstruction and Development issued the following news release: - At COP27 , the EBRD launches its Climate Adaptation Action Plan to boost adaptation finance - Plan involves integrating climate resilience into project design, building new and enhanced partnerships, and mobilising private finance - Adaptation finance is crucial to address climate vulnerability of EBRD regions Download Climate Adaptation Action Plan: HYPERLINK https://www.ebrd.com/climate-adaptation-action-plan.pdf As it moves to increase its climate adaptation finance, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has launched the EBRD Climate Adaptation Action Plan (CAAP) at COP27 , the global climate summit taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Climate adaptation - adapting to already existing climate change and anticipating future changes in long-term planning - has been an increasing focus of attention in recent years as the current level of global warming is already causing extreme weather events to multiply and intensify. It is one of the core themes of COP27 . "We don't have one single answer on adaptation; our response is a combination of a number of different tools and approaches," said Harry Boyd-Carpenter, EBRD Managing Director, Climate Strategy and Delivery. "We increasingly see adaptation not as a cost but rather as an investment that protect economic development and preserve the competitiveness of our clients." At last year's climate summit, COP26, the Glasgow Climate Pact included a commitment from developed countries to at least double - from the 2019 levels of US$ 20 billion - the collective adaptation finance to developing countries by 2025. Increased adaptation finance is particularly important to address the climate vulnerability of EBRD regions. Several EBRD countries - especially those in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean (SEMED) and Central Asia - are extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Between 2008 and 2018, insured losses to extreme weather events in EBRD economies totalled US$ 25 billion. Chronic water stress has already changed the landscape, and warming in the region is expected to exceed the global average. In the face of these risks, the EBRD is building new partnerships to identify and support opportunities for investing in greater resilience. During COP27 COP27 World Leaders event, Accelerating Adaptation in Africa, and discussed adaptation with the African Development Bank's President Akinwumi Adesina. Over the past decade, the EBRD has financed over 350 climate resilience investments with a business volume of more than (EURO)10 billion and adaptation finance exceeding (EURO)2.8 billion. Since issuing the world's first dedicated climate resilience bond in 2019, the EBRD has also prepared the Guide for Issuers on Green Bonds for Climate Resilience, together with the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) and the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI), to provide practical guidance to sovereigns, sub-sovereigns, financial institutions and corporates on raising capital in the green bond market to invest in climate adaptation and resilience. At the forefront of climate finance, the EBRD has committed to make more than half of its investment green by 2025 and to align all its operations with the goals of the Paris Agreement by 1 January 2023. In preparation, the Bank now screens every project for its climate resilience and systematically identify adaptation opportunities.

September 13 -- United Nations Secretary-General has urged the rich countries to step up their climate adaptation financing and sought urgent discussions on loss and damage due to the climate crisis. Antonio Guterres was visiting Karachi, Pakistan, which was devastated by floods recently.\~ The condition in Pakistan is "an epic human tragedy", Guterres said in a statement. "Climate change is not a problem of the future. It is a problem today," he said. "And that is why I said in my intervention, and I repeat now, the questions of loss and damage need to be seriously discussed." The discussion will hopefully take place in Cairo at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , more commonly referred to as COP27 , the secretary-general said. It "hopefully will be translated by effective support from the developed world to the most impacted developing countries to build resilience and to adapt to the circumstances that were created by others," Guterres told the media.\~ \~ \~ \~ "That is why this is not a matter of generosity; it is a matter of justice," he added. \~\~ Guterres placed the blame on developed countries, particularly the G20 countries, which are historically responsible for 80 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. He also requested the G20 nations to boost national emissions reduction targets yearly till the world achieves the warming limit of 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. The UN secretary-general said: Here from Pakistan, I want to reinforce a clear point: Wealthier countries are morally responsible for helping developing countries like Pakistan to recover from disasters like these, and to adapt, to build resilience to climate impacts that, unfortunately, will be repeated in the future. "People living in high climate vulnerability conditions, including in South Asia, are 15 times more likely to die from climate impacts. Nearly half of humanity is now in this category, the overwhelming majority in the developing world," he added.Debt relief for countries struggling to cope with disasters Developing a programme of debt relief was floated by Guterres that currently only applies to the least developed countries according to a "so-called framework declared" by the G20. It does not apply to middle-income countries like Pakistan.\~ "So we need new mechanisms of debt relief," Guterres said. \~\~ He strongly advocated the concept of "debt swaps" and explained: "A country, instead of paying the debt to the creditors, uses that money to invest in climate resilience, investments in sustainable infrastructure, and in the green transition of their economies, and this is exactly what Pakistan is. Instead of paying the debt, being able to invest that money in what the country requires." The United Nations will be strongly advocating for these solutions at meetings soon at the IMF and the World Bank, along with the G20 summit before the end of the year,\~Guterres added. \</doc>

In partnership with the African Development Bank Group, the Swiss Confederation through the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) and Spain today at COP 27 announced additional financial support to African countries and cities bearing the brunt of climate change. Switzerland and Spain confirmed they will each donate approximately 5 Million euros to the African Development Bank Groups Urban and Municipal Development Fund (UMDF), a thematic trust fund that helps African vulnerable countries to spur equitable green and climate resilient urbanization. Africa is projected to face the fastest urban growth rate in the world at around 3.2 per cent per annum. By 2050 it is expected that around 1.5 billion people will live in Africas towns and cities - an additional urban population of 900 million people. At the same time, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, African countries remain the most vulnerable to climate change, and are the least prepared to deal with its impacts. Commenting on the announcement, Ambassador Dominique Paravicini, the SECOs Head of Economic Cooperation and Development and the Swiss governor for the African Development Bank affirmed Switzerlands recognition of the importance of cities for economic development, and their impact on and vulnerability to climate change. After successfully establishing its African Cities Program, the Urban and Municipal Development Fund should now be enabled to scale-up its valuable support to more cities throughout the African continent. SECO consequently increases its contribution by CHF 4.9 million. A part is intended for cities in emerging economies such as Egypt, Ghana and South Africa. Switzerland expects its contribution to have a catalytic effect on other potential donors to raise contributions to the Fund, he said. Senior Advisor in Climate Finance in Spains Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation, Ramn Lpez Prez, said: Spain recognizes the significant role the African Development Bank Group plays in fostering the economic and social progress in Africa. In times of uncertainty and despite the current generalized budgetary constraints following the extraordinary expenses due to the response to COVID-19 pandemic, this new contribution reaffirms the strong support of Spain to the AfDB. Thanking the partners, for the support, Mike Salawou, director of the Infrastructure & Urban Development Department at the African Development Bank Group said: The support from the governments of Switzerland and Spain is precious. This additional budget will boost the UMDF activities, allowing us to support better urban governance and planning, and ensure that partner cities develop sustainably in a climate-optimized manner. \</doc>

Sharm El-Sheikh (Egypt): The annual UN climate change conference will begin at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt today in the backdrop of the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war and the three scary reports that in the past 10 days noted how the combined pledge for action by over 190 countries is not enough to save the world from the disastrous consequences of global warming. While two reports from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) highlighted huge gap in existing climate action of countries, the third one by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) flagged that the atmospheric levels of the three main greenhouse gases (GHG)  carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide  reached new record highs in 2021. It means that earth will continue to warm due to these heattrapping gases. Representatives of over 190 countries including many heads of government, ministers and senior officials will in the next 12 days brainstorm over these gaps in order to look for solutions at the COP27 , which is being taken up as a COP for implementation of all those promises made in the past. India will be represented at the 27th session of the UN climate conference ( COP27 ), being held at Sharm ElSheikh in Egypt from Novemver 6 to 18, by the country's environment minister Bhupender Yadav who is leading a team of officials and experts from different ministries. The country will also showcase Mission LiFE  Lifestyle for Environment  as a theme of India's pavilion here at Sharm El-Sheikh during the conference.

October 25 -- The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP27 , is dubbed 'African COP' as the impact of climate change on African countries will be a key theme of discussions. Agriculture and food systems will also be a critical focus of COP27 , with Saturday, 12 November, dedicated to both themes, in addition to adaptation. Also high on the climate agenda is the role of the youth, as 10 November is dedicated to their participation. Ahead of COP27 The webinar titled, Are Climate-Smart and Digital Agriculture Solutions the Silver Bullet to Attract Youth, highlighted the potential of climate-smart and digital agriculture in attracting young people and thereby rejuvenating an aging global agricultural sector. Dr. Kevin Kariuki, African Development Bank's Vice President for Power Energy, Climate and Green Growth, pointed out the challenges the agriculture sector faces due to the changing climate change. "Agriculture across most of sub-Saharan Africa is still predominantly rain-fed and therefore extremely vulnerable to both short-term fluctuations and long-term changes in climate conditions. It is the most exposed sector with estimates indicating that climate change will cause a decrease in yields of 8 - 22% for Africa's rain-fed staple crops over the next 20 years," Kariuki said. Dr. Beth Dunford, African Development Bank's Vice President for Agriculture, Human and Social Development, noted that while agriculture holds tremendous potential for job creation in Africa, its current traditional form is not attractive to young people for various reasons, including negative perceptions. "Who wants to wear overalls, dig the field with a hoe or drive a tractor when we can do it in a suit and dust coat, right? However, technology makes agriculture cool enough to motivate them to use tech-enabled enterprises to be part of agricultural value chains," Dunford said. Prof. Anthony Nyong, Senior Director for Africa at the Global Centre on Adaptation, said: "There is a gap in the agriculture sector in Africa, and that is in the use of digital solutions." AAAP's Climate Smart Digital Technologies for Agriculture and Food Security Pillar is scaling up access to digital technologies and associated data-driven agricultural and financial services for at least 30 million African farmers. In the African Development Bank's Program to Build Resilience for Food and Nutrition Security in the Horn of Africa (BREFONS), currently ongoing in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan, the AAAP is facilitating the integration of climate-smart digital technologies for adaptation and resilience. "The project will increase the productivity of crops and livestock by 30%, reaching about 1.3 million farmers and pastoralists using climate services such as index insurance. About 55,000 additional jobs will be created for youth and women," said Oluyede Ajayi, Africa Program Lead, Food Security and Rural Well Being, Global Centre on Adaptation. Panelists said the youth must utilize their digital skills to accelerate the transformation of the agricultural sector, which forms the central pillar of Africa's economy. They urged participants to contribute to solutions that enhance market linkages to promote agribusiness. "Africa's significant youth population faces rising unemployment with myriad negative consequences. These challenges are further exacerbated by climate shocks, skill gaps & limited preparedness to address the effects of climate change," said Andre-Marie Taptue, Principal Economist at the African Development Bank's Jobs for Youth program. AAAP's YouthAdapt program promotes sustainable job creation through entrepreneurship in climate adaptation and resilience in Africa by unlocking $3 billion in credit for adaptation action. Last year, the first set of ten young African entrepreneurs and Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises offering innovative solutions and business ideas that can drive climate change adaptation and resilience were awarded at COP26 in Glasgow. This year the Africa Youth Adaptation Competition 20 enterprises across Africa will each receive up to $100,000 in addition to mentorship and coaching to support their climate change adaptation innovation. Panelists included Claude Migisha from the African Development Bank, Dr. Fleur Wouterse, and Aramide Abe from the Global Center of Adaptation. They shared their views on how AAAP was shaping and adding value to the Bank Digital Agriculture Flagship program, ways to accelerate investor engagement in agriculture adaptation, and how the YouthADAPT was moving the needle on entrepreneurship, unlocking finance and job creation. Gislaine Matiedje Nkenmayi from Mumita Holdings, a recipient of the 2021 YouthADAPT Challenge award, shared her experience on how the $100,000 grant transformed her enterprise. "With the grant, we were able to reach out to more than 10 cooperatives with a total of 257 smallholder farmers, to whom we offer free advisory services, low-cost greenhouses and solar-powered irrigation systems. We have been able to expand production from 100kg to 1000kg of fresh vegetables weekly," Nkenmayi said. In her concluding remarks, Edith Ofwona Adera, Principal Regional Climate Change Officer and AAAP coordinator at the Bank stressed the need to strengthen adaptation and resilience measures and expedite mainstreaming climate adaptation for transformation at scale. She called for the engagement of the private sector, given the role they can play in adapting to climate change, financing adaptation, and supporting others through products and services for resilience. \</doc>

India, Nov. 11 -- Global South is spending five times more on debt repayments than on addressing the climate crisis's impacts Developed countries committed to mobilise US $100 billion in climate finance annually jointly in 2009 at the 15th Conference of Parties (COP15) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The funding could be drawn from public, private and alternative sources of financing. But these wealthy nations have repeatedly failed to meet this target. Oxfam has estimated that climate assistance provided to developing countries ($21-24.5 billion) was one-third of the estimates provided by the intergovernmental finance group Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The disparity in estimates from OECD and Oxfam stems from the fact that the world has yet to agree on a definition of climate finance consensually. This year, along with climate finance, a New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) will be on the table for deliberations at COP27 . The NCQG is expected to be finalised by 2024. Developing nations want the new goal to secure funds in trillions, given the need to implement the Paris Agreement, while wealthy countries want to expand the donor base. The call for ramping up climate finance is getting louder. The COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war have pushed as many as 54 countries into a severe debt crisis. The combined onslaught of debt and climate change is also putting the future of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in peril. Overall, these nations have spent 18 times more in debt repayments than they received in climate finance. African governments owe three times more debt to western banks, asset managers and oil traders than to China. Asia received 25% of global climate finance despite being home to 60% of the world's population. The Global South is spending five times more on debt repayments than on addressing the climate crisis's impacts. Against this backdrop, nations are looking beyond conventional financing tools such as grants and loans. Deliberations at COP27 would clarify whether the NCQG will deal with financial flows from developed to developing countries or include all flows. There is also a need to define whether NCQG will focus on a single global goal or multiple sub-goals, such as adaptation and mitigation. However, with little time left, stakeholders must ensure that mistakes made while framing climate finances are not repeated.

Source: MakeLemonade.nz Cairo, Egypt - COP27 , the global climate change meeting, has been urged to get serious about water as an imperative climate change action by the water and climate leaders, an eminent panel of 18 high-level decision and policy makers. They urged countries to take more integrated water and climate action to replace the existing fragmented approach to achieve the Paris agreement goals. The challenge is urgent because the impacts of climate change are often felt through water. As the atmosphere passes one degree of warming above pre-industrial levels, sea levels rise and the cryosphere melts, the effects of climate change are being felt as never before. Flooding, heatwaves, droughts, storms and sea level rise worldwide will progressively worsen as warming continues towards 1.5 degrees and beyond. Currently, 3.6 billion people face inadequate access to water at least a month per year and this is expected to increase to more than five billion by 2050. Even Christchurch, the supposed garden city, is in a messy process of beginning to charge its people for using water, something quite inconceivable 20 years ago when the city was proud of its abundantly clean water supply. Globally between 2001 and 2018, 74 percent of all natural disasters are water-related (i.e. flood and droughts. Water-related hazards are therefore an important part of the new initiative to achieve early warnings for all in the next five years. More than 1000 of the country's 14,000 glaciers have completely melted. The total volume of Tajikistan's glaciers, which make up more than 60 percent of the water resources in the central Asian region, has decreased by almost a third. The leaders at COP27 stressed that improved management of water resources is vital and would have numerous benefits: Reducing climate-induced disaster risks. Hydrometeorological monitoring and forecasting systems provide early warning of floods, droughts and other hazards.

India, Nov. 25 -- The fight against climate change is not developing nations vs. developed ones. It's against the fatal fallout of climate change vs the existence of humanity. The global mean temperature of the planet is 1.15 degree Celsius above the pre-industrial average and we have been having the conference of parties (COP) every year since 1995, wherein world leaders come together to think of solutions to fight the looming dangers of climate change. This year the summit at Sharm El-Sheikh was attended by world leaders arriving in their respective private jets, close to 400 of them, contributing significantly to greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. One would think what a great way to kickstart the discourse around climate change. Over the last decade or so, green washing has become a norm and we all have assumed that someone else would take care of the problem of climate change. The corporations have used the issue of climate change to fill in their coffers and the global leaders have done little to help either. Lip service has been the norm as far as climate change is concerned. Every year, these conferences signal hope. Eminent leaders from different parts of the world make pledges, talk of achieving net zero emissions by so and so year, promise aid to emerging economies and so on. But when it comes to progress on ground, the results are invariably dismal. They paint a sorry picture of our fight towards climate change. It is demoralizing and one can't help but give in to the gnawing cynicism around these summits. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, "A third of Pakistan got flooded. We have seen Europe's hottest summer in 500 years. The Philippines got hammered. The whole of Cuba was in blackout. And ... in the United States, Hurricane Ian has delivered a brutal reminder that no country and no economy is immune from the climate crisis." All these events serve as a brutal reminder for entire humanity to get its act together. The COP27 COP27 has been loss and damage. It is only this year that the developed nations agreed to put the subject into the formal agenda. An important issue for the group of developing nations, called G77, their leaders underscored how they needed aid from the wealthy nations to mitigate the causes of climate change and prepare against the fallouts of it in future. A positive headway has been made at the summit in this direction with respect to the creation of a 'loss and damage' fund. The fund may help the emerging economies to address the harmful effects of natural disasters like droughts, floods and cyclones etc. However, the details of how it will be used to stop climate change and who the list of donors would be is still unclear. Back in 2009, the developed nations had made a pledge to supply $100 billion every year by 2020 to less wealthy nations to help bring down further rises in temperature. But what happened to that? Wealthy nations have clearly not delivered on the promise to date. The $100 billion won't even make the cut, as developing nations have clearly outlined that they would need $6 trillion to $11 trillion to meet climate targets. It is crucial for aid to come through to developing nations, without which they won't be able to make much progress on reducing greenhouse emissions. Speaking at a press conference at COP27 , John Kerry, the U.S. presidential envoy on climate, asserted that the negotiations won't end with rich countries signing up for open-ended liabilities. The emerging nations rallied against making a 'loss and damage fund', but the wealthy nations shrugged off the idea by saying they favoured existing financial channels. This year's COP was called the COP for implementation, because pledges alone don't make the cut. One needs a detailed road map and more transparency with respect to climate finance. A case in point: The US president, Joe Biden, gave an assurance at the summit that the US would hit its climate targets by 2030 and apologized for pulling out of the Paris agreement. However, he and other world leaders hardly explained why the promises made earlier were not met to date. Biden rightly said that the world faced a 'pivotal moment' in the fight against the climate crisis. But failed to lay out the steps that humanity should take. With the COP27 Hope is clearly not a good strategy to adopt in view of climate change. Therefore, one must strive to surpass all hurdles, shun inhibition, deliberate and make a sincere endeavour to avert the global catastrophe awaiting us. We owe this to our collective future generations. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Pioneer.

Brussels, Nov. 20 -- European Commission issued the following statement: COP27 marks a small step towards climate justice but much more is needed for the planet. We have treated some of the symptoms but not cured the patient from its fever. I am pleased that COP27 has opened a new chapter on financing loss and damage, and laid the foundations for a new method for solidarity between those in need and those in a position to help. We are rebuilding trust. This is crucial moving forward because there can be no lasting action against climate change without climate justice. The European Union is already the world's leading contributor of international climate finance, and I am satisfied that we confirmed our commitment to support the most vulnerable on our planet through a first contribution on loss and damage. COP27 has kept alive the goal of 1.5C. Unfortunately however, it has not delivered on a commitment by the world's major emitters to phase down fossil fuels, nor new commitments on climate mitigation. But the EU will stay the course, notably through the European Green Deal and REPowerEU, because it is essential to keep the ambition of the Paris Agreement within reach. I extend my heartfelt thanks to the EU's negotiating team in Sharm El Sheikh for their determination and hard work throughout the conference.

And ... in the United States, Hurricane Ian has delivered a brutal reminder that no country and no economy is immune from the climate crisis." All these events serve as a brutal reminder for the entire humanity to get its act together. The COP27 summit did set its agenda right with focus on mainly four focus aspects of mitigation, adaptation, finance and collaboration. What needs to be seen is how many countries significantly contribute to the said areas in all earnestness. One of the major themes of COP27 has been loss and damage. It is only this year that the developed nations agreed to put the subject into the formal agenda. An important issue for the group of developing nations, called G77, their leaders underscored how they needed aid from the wealthy nations to mitigate the causes of climate change and prepare against the fallouts of it in future.

With COP27 has come to an end, some inspiration has been rekindled. What global leaders do in the coming years will be watched carefully, but at the same time, the citizenry all across the world must also do what they can at the individual level. We need more people actively raising clamour around this subject. Young climate warriors need to come about and for that, introducing climate change as a subject in school curriculum will prove to be a step in the right direction. Hope is clearly not a good strategy to adopt in view of climate change. Therefore, one must strive to surpass all hurdles, shun inhibition, deliberate and make a sincere endeavor to avert the global catastrophe awaiting us. We owe this to our collective future generations. (The author writes on news pertaining to women's rights, and social and environmental issues. Views expressed are personal.) \</doc>

Shortly before the start of the UN Climate Change Conference COP27 in Egypt, Germany has described containing global warming as a top priority. Humanity is heading towards an abyss, towards warming of more than 2.5 degrees, with devastating effects on our lives on the only planet we have, announced German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, adding that the world had all the necessary instruments in its hands to limit the climate crisis and get on the 1.5 degree path. 40,000 people are expected to attend the conference, which begins today. At COP27 , representatives from almost 200 countries will spend two weeks negotiating how to boost the fight against global warming. Despite the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine, 2022 should not be a lost year in terms of climate protection. For many states, the survival of their people and their culture is at stake, Baerbock said in a statement issued jointly with the German ministries for economic affairs, development and environment. For them, the climate crisis remains in any case the most important security issue, not Russias war in Europe. She stressed that these states were expecting more solidarity from the rich countries. From Monday, around 100 heads of state and government are expected to attend, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and US President Joe Biden. \</doc>

As world leaders gathered for this year's COP27 climate summit in Egypt, the sister of jailed British-Egyptian activist AlaaAbd el-Fattah addressed the following words to the international media: At this conference, the most vulnerable are supposed to negotiate with the most powerful. I want to say that whatever chance my brother has at surviving will come from people who are vulnerable. It will come from those paying the price for others' luxury; from those locked into a system they did not choose. Alaa had begun a hunger strike in protest of the refusal of the Egyptian authorities to allow a visit by UK government representatives. His plight symbolized that of the approximately sixty thousand political prisoners in this year's host country. This quiet battle unmasked the cynical and dangerous alliance of world leaders with authoritarian regimes and oil powers like next year's host, the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The COP26 summit in Glasgow last year had already set a new benchmark for exclusivity due to pandemic restrictions and the high price of travel and accommodation in the UK. Yet the country hosting this year's event has taken things much further by banning public demonstrations, arresting dissidents, and blocking the participation of more than six hundred news agencies and human rights organizations. The criminalization of climate justice activism is not restricted to Egypt. From Britain to Germany, conservatives are calling for stronger repression of protest actions by the "last generation" or "generation Z." While the German government has failed on its climate action promises, conservative politicians denounce expressions of civil disobedience, comparing protesters to the Baader-Meinhof urban guerrillas of the 1970s. Meanwhile figures like World Bank chief David Malpass, an appointee of Donald Trump, still engage in blatant denial of the climate crisis. COP27 had been branded the "Africa COP." Since Africans are suffering and will suffer most from the effects of climate change, the summit promised a heightened focus on "loss and damage." While all continents have seen extreme weather events in 2022, those in Africa are chronically underreported. This year alone, Nigeria's worst flood in a decade killed over six hundred people, and wildfires battered Algeria while drought and famine put millions in East Africa at risk of starvation. Africa causes only 4 percent of global emissions. Yet almost half of the continent's young people as surveyed in a UNICEF poll said they had reconsidered the idea of having children because of the climate crisis. The South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, emphasized a familiar theme at these summits: the failure of rich countries to deliver on previous commitments, which undermines trust in the whole process. Every year, negotiators and activists from the Global South fight to keep the key original principles of the climate summits on the agenda: polluters should pay for the damage they have caused and there should be common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) for the climate crisis. They press for the payment of reparations along with adequate compensation and support for the regions that will carry the burden of climate chaos generated by carbon emissions in the Northern states. Half of all global emissions are caused by the world's richest 10 percent. Those emissions must fall by 45 percent by 2030 if we are to have any chance of achieving the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting warming to 1.5C. But the Emissions Gap Report at COP27 from the UN Environmental Programme reported "inadequate progress" since the Glasgow summit: current trends and policies suggest we are likely to see as much as a 2.8C hike in global temperature. There is a familiar pattern to these summits, and COP27 was no exception. In the first week, high-level political leaders from the Global North will usually deliver speeches at a safe distance from any protesters, showcasing the ambitious commitments of their countries while lamenting past delays and shirking responsibility. German chancellor Olaf Scholz emphasized his government's plans to reach net zero by 2045 and end the use of fossil fuels, while environmental groups at home condemn the inadequacy of those plans. The US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry, talked a lot about progressive climate policy but said nothing about his country's failure to provide financial support for the Global South. When politicians like Scholz and Kerry fly home, they leave their delegates to block or weaken most demands for binding North- South transfers. Technical debates allow Northern representatives to hide their unwillingness to take responsibility and relinquish control. The negotiations around loss and damage were the key battle of the Africa COP. China and the 134 countries joined together in the Group of 77 have for decades called for a stand-alone facility dedicated specifically to loss and damage, which could be financed, for example, by a global carbon tax on fossil-fuel companies. In opposition to this proposal, the European Union and the United States, along with countries like New Zealand and Canada, proposed using existing funds like the World Bank-controlled Green Climate Fund or the Global Environment Facility. They also raised the idea of completely private mechanisms such as risk-insurance facilities and bilateral support, which would leave them in control. There is also a stalemate over demands for the cancelation of the unjust historic debt with which poor countries are burdened. Such relief would provide those countries with the fiscal space needed for climate action. The least developed countries (LDCs) in particular have little access to finance for the implementation of national adaptation plans (NAPs). In addition, summit participants have called for reform of the Bretton Woods system of international financial institutions to ensure that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund support climate action instead of helping to make things worse. Since the 2015 Paris Agreement, the World Bank has spent approximately $15 billion on fossil-fuel projects. When it comes to mitigation, negotiators at COP27 discussed further how carbon markets would function as a "cooperative" mechanism under Article 6.4 of the Paris agreement. This procedure allows polluting companies such as airlines and car manufacturers to buy carbon credits from forest conservation and proclaim themselves to be "net-zero" while carrying on with business as usual. It will probably turn Global South countries into exporters of carbon and prevent them from reaching their own targets, to the benefit of luxury consumption in the North. Corporate greenwashing has been a central pattern of recent COPs: the only question is what major polluter is going to take its turn this year. Unilever sponsored COP26 in Glasgow, but this year's summit was "brought to you by Coca-Cola." As well as being a major plastic polluter, Coca-Cola has deprived local communities in countries like India of access to clean water and dodged paying taxes to the tune of several billion US dollars. There were 25 percent more fossil-fuel lobbyists registered at COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh than at its predecessor, with a total of 636 representing some of the world's biggest polluters. There were more representatives of fossil-fuel interests than there were delegates from the ten countries most impacted by climate change - Puerto Rico, Myanmar, Haiti, Philippines, Mozambique, the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Thailand, and Nepal - and their bloc was twice as large as the UN constituency for indigenous peoples. This lobbying presence allows these corporate interests to shape the response to the climate crisis. Earlier this year, the European Parliament controversially decided to categorize nuclear and gas power as environmentally sustainable economic activities. Fossil-fuel companies are using the energy crisis to maintain their power while peddling false solutions that will permit the existing system to continue. COP27 did not even end with the weakest commitment from leaders to "phase down" (not phase out) fossil fuels. Energy companies promote "blue hydrogen" or fossil fuel hydrogen, which emits only water, not climate-wrecking CO2. This is being presented as one way of solving the climate emergency, along with the carbon capture and storage (CCS) environmental fix that would bury CO2 in the ground. But CCS technology is much too undeveloped and expensive as an alternative to what environmentalists, scientists, and others have long been calling for: an end to the use of fossil fuels. Overall, the global complex of major tech, energy, pharmaceutical, and agricultural firms all used COP27 At COP27 He also offered to host 2025's COP30 in the Brazilian Amazon: too often, questions about development in the Amazon have been decided upon far away from the region. Although Lula did not defend climate activists in his COP27 speech, but rather thanked the Egyptian host government, international leadership from Brazil and others in the Global South will be important in promoting multilateralism and peace, the fight against hunger, environmental integrity, and equality. Domestically, however, Lula's administration faces a strong agribusiness bloc and a weak environmental faction in the federal parliament. The new president referred to agribusiness as a strategic ally and came to the summit with Helder Barbalho, governor of the Amazon state Par. Barbalho advocates a pro-market "bioeconomy" approach that does not put restraints on agribusiness. It will require domestic and international mobilization to make Lula's pledges of a more just and humane world into a reality. Neither this COP summit nor the one due to be held next year in the UAE will break the power of fossil-fuel interests. As the only multilateral space where global climate action can be negotiated, the COP summits should expel polluters and put those most affected by the climate crisis at the center. Until that happens, the willingness of activists like AlaaAbd el-Fattah to put their lives on their line is the real source of hope in the struggle for climate justice. Courtesy: Jacobin \</doc>

India, Nov. 1 -- The time has arrived for the annual climate tamasha, Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to be held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. With a quarter-century of COPs behind us, one can forgive the public for feeling a bit jaded as COP27 rolls around. Solutions to the climate crisis appear as far away as they were a decade or even two decades ago. Just this week, the UN Environment Programme noted that we could expect a warming of 2.8 degrees Celsius based on current national policies in place, and pledges for enhanced policies might reduce this to 2.4-2.6 degrees Celsius, still well above the UNFCCC enshrined upper limit of 2 degrees Celsius with an aspiration of 1.5 degrees Celsius warming. Yet, there are also signs that the super-tanker, the world's energy system, is turning around. The cost of solar power and battery storage for electricity is down 85% over the last decade. As a result, more money is now being invested in renewable energy than fossil fuel energy. But there is a long way to go to overcome the current dependence on coal for electricity, and oil for transport, around the world. The annual COP serves as an annual health check, as Rachel Kyte of Tufts Fletcher School told me in a podcast. It is a focal point for technical assessments of progress and a place where technical rules that translate political agreements into action are made. However, COPs also have an explicitly political side, and COP27 in Egypt is likely to be dominated by the political conversation for at least two reasons. First, COP27 Second, COP27 Between these two pressures, this COP will likely see a resurgence of North-South tensions. Europe enters COP27 on the back foot after reopening coal-fired plants and expanding gas subsidies to see their populations through the winter. African fossil fuel producers are particularly exercised at this rollback because developed countries lobby to cut off development finance for African gas fields. Vulnerable countries that have done little to contribute to the climate crisis have demanded that the climate crisis be linked to debt relief. Two political issues are likely to dominate COP, both of which are important for the developing world, and on which little progress has been made. The first is "loss and damage". This refers to the fact that despite efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to a warming world, there are residual damages that countries increasingly face. How are these to be ameliorated? Developed countries are anxious to avoid the language of compensation or reparation, fearing that they would be signing a blank cheque. Yet, the manifestly unfair nature of climate consequences demands redress. In the procedure-heavy metric of COPs, winning an agreement to start negotiating a facility for loss and damage, something that the Glasgow COP failed to achieve, would in itself be a victory. The second, finance, is even more complex. If capital-scarce developing countries are to pivot to low-carbon economies and invest in greater adaptive measures, they require external financial support. So far, developed countries have failed to deliver on even the relatively limited pledge of $100 billion a year. Discussions on finance have increasingly shifted away from COPs to forums such as the annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). And, part of the debate is whether these institutions can play a growing role in mobilising finance. While open to these changes, and even encouraging them, many developing countries also insist that the finance debate cannot only be about mobilising private capital, it must also include public funds in the form of grants and, perhaps, highly concessional loans. The Sharm el-Sheikh COP will be watched closely for progress on these two issues, even as the usual conversation on mitigation, adaptation goals, carbon market rules and other agenda items continue in the background. Both issues are important for India, which has historically been a standard bearer on the issue of finance, but has been less clear in its stance on loss and damage. At a time of global churn, and the potential for greater North-South jostling, the political messages that emerge from Sharm el-Sheikh may shape future COPs, and the climate agenda for some time to come.

New Delhi, Nov. 6 -- The world's biggest climate conference is set to begin today in Egypt--the COP27 on Sunday. Deadly extreme weather events have struck almost every corner of the planet in recent months, reminding leaders and citizens of the need to act fast. Nearly 200 countries gathering for the UN climate conference in Egypt are expected to lock horns over whether rich nations should pay compensation to vulnerable nations hit by climate-fuelled disasters. Some past COP meetings have resulted in landmark agreements that shaped humanity's fight against climate change. In 1997, signatories of the Kyoto Protocol acknowledged that the planet was warming because of manmade greenhouse gas emissions and committed to reducing them. In 2015, global leaders agreed under the Paris Agreement to make the necessary emissions cuts to keep global temperatures below a 2C increase by the end of the century, and ideally close to 1.5C. However, COP27 Developing countries and emerging economies have proposed putting loss and damage on the summit agenda, which must be adopted unanimously before the talks get underway. In the United Nations, the phrase "Loss and Damage" refers to costs already being incurred from climate-fuelled weather extremes or impacts, like rising sea levels. A June report by 55 vulnerable countries estimated their combined climate-linked losses over the last two decades totalled about $525 billion, or about 20% of their collective GDP. Some research suggests that by 2030 such losses could reach $580 billion per year. Frustrated by difficulties and delays in securing climate finance, developing and emerging economies are now united in demanding that a loss and damage fund be established at COP27 . Among them are island states like the Maldives and Jamaica, and China. Countries have made different proposals for what the fund should look like. Even if COP27 yields a deal to form a fund, it could still take a couple of years before it is ready to disperse money. The European Union has suggested harnessing existing international funds to tackle loss and damage, rather than launching a new one, but some experts say issues like long delays make those funds unsuitable for addressing loss and damage. Over 100 heads of state and government will descend into Sharm el-Sheikh for the conference. Day 1 is expected to be dominated by an agenda fight over a key bit of climate jargon: loss and damage. Rich countries have repeatedly failed to live up to a pledge to provide $100 billion of climate finance annually - a goal that is already seen as woefully insufficient to cover poorer countries' needs. UN climate summits have tended to focus on the responsibilities the richest owe to the poorest, often leaving out one key demographic that will be crucial to transition: coal-reliant middle-income countries. Indonesia could announce its own Just Energy Transition Partnership alongside donors like the US and the EU at the Group of 20 meeting in Bali, which runs during the second week of COP27 . Similar deals with Vietnam and Senegal are in the pipeline before the end of the year, while one with India is slated for 2023. One COP after delegations agreed on rules or a global carbon market under the Paris Agreement, negotiators at COP27 will need to establish strict guidelines to ensure the credits used in the global carbon market represent real emissions reductions. The current agreement allows for the trading of old carbon credits that don't necessarily reduce emissions. Countries can update their climate commitments any time under the Paris Agreement, and many committed to doing so at COP26 in Glasgow. Last year, India unexpectedly set a net-zero emissions target for 2070. Since its unveiling last year, the Global Methane Pledge - a commitment to cut emissions of one of the most potent greenhouse gases by 30% by the end of the decade - has garnered more than 120 signatures. China and India are the main absentees, but there is hope that the former may still announce its methane-cutting plan during COP27 . COP27 Traditionally, mass protests by climate activists have brought the voice of global citizens to an otherwise dull and secluded gathering. This time might be different, with activists reporting unprecedented difficulties and unaffordable costs to arrive in Sharm el-Sheikh. Prominent Egyptian-British activist Alaa Abd El-Fattah, who is currently in jail and started a hunger strike last April, is most likely to lead the protest. Abd El-Fattah has vowed to stop drinking water on the first day of COP27 . Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

To pursue low-carbon development strategies, India will require significant investments, the pace of which will largely hinge on the easy availability of climate finance The conference of the parties or COP27 in Eygpt concluded with an agreement to provide 'loss and damage' funding for the vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters, however, missed breakthroughs on emission reduction and climate finance, said Kotak Mahindra Bank in a report. The report said that even as the details about donor base, quantum, timelines, etc. remain to be finalised and are expected to be decided over the next year. Issues such as delayed climate finance of USD 100 billion per year jointly by developed countries and phasing down of all fossil fuels (and not just coal), did not witness a common ground despite the broad coalition of countries. As per the report, the climate finance provided by the developed countries has increased over the years to USD 83.3 billion in 2020, yet remains short of the USD 100 billion per year (by 2020) goal agreed upon at COP16. Set up against a difficult geopolitical backdrop, the countries at COP27 reaffirmed their commitment to keeping the Paris agreement intact. "Limiting global warming to 1.5 C requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions of 43 per cent by 2030 relative to the 2019 level," the report stated. The climate commitments have continued to rise in the past year (October 2021-September 2022); however, they lagged enough ambition. A total of 39 new nationally determined contributions (NDCs) were filed under the Paris agreement, taking the overall count of the updated NDCs to 142. The full implementation of the latest available 166 NDCs will lead to GHG emissions in 2030 being 0.3 per cent below the 2019 level, it added. Talking about India, the report mentioned that India unveiled its long-term low-carbon development strategy at COP27 , balancing its climate ambition while pursuing economic growth. India has set up several medium-term targets and formulated policies to achieve the same. The bank believes a focus on increasing the share of renewable energy, faster rollout of EVs and implementing carbon pricing will remain the key to fulfilling the climate goals in the near term. "India is promoting the manufacture of clean energy technologies at scale. Existing production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes have been rolled out that support solar PV manufacturing, energy storage systems and electric vehicle technologies," it said. Meanwhile, pursuing these low-carbon development strategies for India will require significant investments, the pace of which will largely hinge on the easy availability of climate finance. \</doc>

New Delhi (PTI): While the UN climate summit in Egypt concluded with a landmark decision to establish a fund to address loss and damage, the outcome on other crucial issues such as India's call for phasedown of all fossil fuels reflected little progress when compared to the deal struck a year ago in Scotland. India termed COP27 "historic" for securing an agreement on establishing a fund to address loss and damage due to climate change-induced disasters, saying "the world has waited far too long for this". On the establishment of a work program on climate action in agriculture and food security, Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav said the responsibilities to reduce emissions should not be shifted to smallholder farmers. The summit was scheduled to conclude on Friday but went into overtime as negotiators pushed for an agreement on issues such as including mitigation, loss and damage (L&D) fund and adaptation. Loss and damage refers to destruction caused by climate change-induced disasters. At one point in time, the talks veered close to a collapse but gained momentum in the final hours after progress on a new finance facility to address loss and damage, a long-pending demand of poor and developing countries, including India, and the key element at this year's UN climate summit. The success of the talks hinged on progress on this track. Developed nations, particularly the US, had opposed this new fund over fears that it would hold them legally liable for massive damages caused by climate change. The proposal for a loss and damage finance facility was put forward by the G77 and China (India is part of this group), least developed countries and small island states. Vulnerable countries had said that they would not leave COP27 without it. The hope at COP27 was to include a "phasedown of all fossil fuels, including oil and gas, as proposed by India and backed by many developed and developing countries including the EU and the US, but the final agreement did not essentially build on what was agreed upon in COP26. A number of parties rued the agreement leaving out the call for peaking of emissions before 2025 and the weakening of language on the transition to green energy. "Emissions peaking before 2025 as the science tells us is necessary. Not in this text. Clear follow through on the phase down of coal. Not in this text. Clear commitments to phase put all fossil fuels. Not in this text. And the energy text weakened in the final minutes," the UK's lead climate negotiator Alok Sharma said at the closing plenary. However, when compared to COP26, COP27 has brought in stronger language on renewables and included the just transition principles while bringing up energy transition, experts said. The Sharm-El Sheikh Implementation Plan called upon "parties to accelerate the development, deployment and dissemination of technologies, and adoption of policies, to transition towards low-emission energy systems, including by rapidly scaling up deployment of clean power generation and energy efficiency measures, including accelerating efforts towards phase down of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, while providing targeted support to the poorest and most vulnerable in line with national circumstances and recognising the need for support towards a just transition." The plan reaffirmed the Paris Agreement goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels, recognising that this would "significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change". Shruti Sharma, Senior Policy Advisor, International Institute for Sustainable Development said it is disappointing that COP27 did not build on the COP26 statement to deliver a stronger message on phaseout of fossil fuels. "COP26 asked parties to, among other things, transition to low energy systems through the phasedown of unabated coal phase down. The hope at COP27 , through India's proposal, was to include a phaseout of all fossil fuels, including coal oil and gas. Perhaps the most significant milestone for this COP has been the creation of a loss and damage fund," she said. " COP27 has been a tough pill to swallow but in the end there has been more progress than was anticipated. The negotiators have debated on language but in the big picture the world has saved one year from being wasted by not compromising on the language on 1.5 degrees temperature rise," said Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends. This COP will be remembered for the agreement to create a loss and damage fund. The COP has demonstrated how the geopolitics is shifting and each country has acted in its interests. There is also notable progress in including a scale of renewables, she said. "The countries fell short of agreeing to a phasedown of all fossil fuels, which speaks to the energy crisis and the hold of the oil and gas lobby at this COP, Khosla said. Mohamed Adow, Executive Director, Power Shift Africa, said it's sad to see countries just "copying and pasting the outcome from last year's COP26 in Glasgow". "It's deeply saddening that countries couldn't agree to commit to a phase down of all fossil fuels, not just coal, as contained in the Glasgow Pact. The science is clear, the impacts are getting worse and we know that renewables are the future. Polluting countries need to leave coal, oil and gas in the ground if we're going to keep global heating from running out of control, he said. \</doc>

NEW DELHI, Nov. 7 -- The UN's COP27 climate summit in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh comes as nations worldwide are facing increasingly intense natural disasters that have taken thousands of lives this year alone and cost billions of dollars.At the opening ceremony on Sunday, COP27 officials urged governments to keep up efforts to combat climate change despite soaring inflation, the energy crunch linked to Russia's war on Ukraine and the persistent Covid-19 pandemic."The fear is other priorities take precedence," top United Nations climate change official Simon Stiell told a news conference.The "fear is that we lose another day, another week, another month, another year -- because we can't", he said. The world must slash greenhouse emissions by 45 percent by 2030 to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above late-19th-century levels.But current trends would see carbon pollution increase 10 percent by the end of the decade and Earth's surface heat up 2.8C, according to findings unveiled in recent days.Only 29 of 194 countries have presented improved climate plans, as called for at the UN talks in Glasgow last year, Stiell noted.Nearly 100 heads of state and government began to arrive for two days of talks, with the notable absence of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, whose country is the world's top emitter of greenhouse gases.US President Joe Biden, whose country ranks second on the top-polluters list, will join COP27 later this week after midterm elections on Tuesday that could put Republicans hostile to international action on climate change in charge of Congress.

The Union government on Wednesday published a list of 75 lifestyle practices that can be taken up as climate-friendly behaviour under the Mission LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment). Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav in a tweet shared the list of 75 actions under the seven categories - energy, water saving, single-use plastic, sustainable food systems, waste reduction (swachhata actions), healthy lifestyle, and e-waste. "In 2022-23, Mission LiFE will focus on 'Change in Demand' by nudging individuals, communities, and institutions to practise simple environment-friendly actions in their daily lives," Yadav tweeded. Nineteen actions have been published under the energy saving agenda, ranging from preference for CNG/EV vehicles to installing earthen pots for cooling water. For water saving, 15 actions can be taken from adaptation of cultivation of less water-intensive crops to creating rainwater harvesting infrastructure in home, schools/offices. For reducing plastic use, 11 actions were highlighted, from using recycled plastic to use of steel lunch boxes. For sustainable food seven actions can be taken, from creating a kitchen garden to preferring locally available and seasonal food. Under the waste reduction (swachhata actions), healthy lifestyle adaptation and e-waste reaction, 11, 9 and 4 actions respectively were highlighted from feeding unused and uncooked vegetables leftover to cattle to preferring cloud storage over a pen drive/hard drive. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on October 20 launched Mission LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment) - a global plan of action aimed at saving the planet from the disastrous consequences of climate change. The LiFE Mission was introduced by PM Modi during the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow last year. It is also a part of India's updated list of nationally determined contributions (NDC), which was officially submitted to the UNFCC this August this year. Mission LiFE aims to promote an environment-conscious lifestyle that focuses on 'mindful and deliberate utilisation' instead of 'mindless and destructive consumption'. It also envisages a circular economy through people's participation. It also plans to nurture a global network of individuals, namely "pro-planet people" or P3, who will have a shared commitment to adopt and promote environment-friendly lifestyles. The first of India's eight point-NDC is aimed 'to put forward and further propagate a healthy and sustainable way of living based on traditions and values of conservation and moderation, including through a mass movement for 'LiFE' as a key to combating climate change'. It is for the first time now that the tenets of the LiFE mission are known. LiFE will look at following a three-pronged strategy at demand, supply and policy levels for changing our collective approach towards sustainability. First is by nudging individuals to practice simple yet effective environment-friendly actions in their daily lives (demand).\~ Second is by enabling industries and markets to respond swiftly to the changing demand (supply). Third is to influence government and industrial policy to support both sustainable consumption and production (policy). Mission LiFE will be India's signature initiative at the UN and other international platforms for showcasing climate action and early achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, including upcoming COP27 in November. During India's presidency of the G20, sustaining and promoting LiFE will be among key focus areas for deliberations. \</doc>

India, Nov. 19 -- The COP27 president proposed that the details of the funding will be finalised during COP28, which will be held in November-December 2023 Finally, there is some hope at the end of the tunnel for COP27 negotiations. The COP27 Presidency released a draft text November 19, 2022, in which it proposed to create a loss and damage finance facility at Sharm El-Sheikh, with the details to be worked out later. The latest development is broadly in tune with developing country groups' demand. The onus is now on developed countries either to accept or reject the proposal. The draft of the overall cover text is also out, consisting of 100 points. But the loss and damage funding faculty is being left out for negotiations which are to take place on the separate draft text circulated. The urgent and immediate need for new, additional, predictable and adequate financial resources to assist developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in responding to economic and non-economic loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including extreme weather events and slow onset events, especially in the context of ongoing and ex post (including rehabilitation, recovery). The Presidency pointed out that the proposed new funding arrangements were for assisting developing countries in responding to loss and damage. This includes a focus on addressing loss and damage by providing and assisting in mobilising new and additional resources. It added that these new arrangements complement the existing arrangements for financial support from other sources, funds, processes and initiatives, including outside the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. They thus open up the possibilities for German initiatives like the Global Shield. The Presidency draft also talks about establishing "a transitional committee on the operationalisation of the new funding arrangements for responding to loss and damage and the fund established". The president proposed that the details of the funding will be finalised during COP28, which will be held in November-December 2023, with a view to operationalising the funding arrangements. His draft pointed out the setting up of "institutional arrangements, modalities, structure, governance and terms of reference of the fund". The draft talks about "the current landscape of institutions, including global, regional and national, that are funding activities related to addressing loss and damage". It also notes the "ways in which coherence, coordination and synergies among them can be enhanced". It says "the gaps within that current landscape, including the types of gap, such as relating to speed, eligibility, adequacy and access to finance ." will be addressed. Solutions will be explored for priority gaps and also how these gaps may be addressed in the most effective ways while considering vulnerable populations and the ecosystems on which they depend. The draft has also requested the Secretariat to prepare a synthesis report on existing funding arrangements and innovative sources relevant to addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change. It has invited Parties and relevant organisations to submit views on topics for and the structure of the Second Glasgow Dialogue and the workshops via the submission portal by February 15, 2023. "The draft decision on loss and damage finance offers hope to vulnerable people that they will get help to recover from climate disasters and rebuild their lives," Harjeet Singh, head of Global Political Strategy, Climate Action Network International, said.

The 27thConference of Parties ( COP 27 is a meeting of197 countries that have ratified the UNFCCC) (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change)thatbegins in Egypt from 07 November 2022 will witness deliberations by several heads of states or their representatives, businessmen, scientists, indigenous community members and activists on how to keep the commitment to the 2015 Paris Agreement intact. The attainment of the assurances could be gauged through the implementation of recommendations of the earlier COPs and honouring the nationally determined contributions (NDC) towards achieving the goals of curtailing carbon emissions. One area that will attract the focus of the developing countries, especially India, would be the definition of climate finance and the extent of its flows for climate action. Brazil, endowed with the Amazon Rainforest and dubbed as the 'lungs of the earth', is one of the countries from the Global South whose stand has often been under scrutiny by the world. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's during his two previous Presidential stints had put Brazil on a firm economic footing while ensuring a responsible environmental policy, the latter being hailed as being among the most progressive in the world. Lula's success in declaringbold targets for the reduction of greenhouse gasemissionsand reducing the rates of deforestation in the Amazon had put him at or near the top of the list when it came to eco-conscious world leaders. Dilma Rousseff, though a protg of Lula, during her Presidency digressed and gavesweeping amnesty for those who had illegally deforested, outraging environmentalists and scientists. On analyzing her programmes, there were two kinds of outcomes - the skeptics' views revolved around the key assertion that Dilma had continued to consider the environment "an obstacle to development" as she had said during the Copenhagen climate change summit while the believers opined she had emerged as a more consensus-oriented politician being convinced by arguments from the environmentalists and had continued Brazil's positive trend of curbing deforestation. Nevertheless, the rate and extent of deforestation have always remained a debatable issue in Brazil under successive governments. Even before taking over as President, Jair Bolsonaro had decided to back out of Brazil's offer to host the COP 25. On assumption of Presidential office, two departments of the Ministry of Environment that dealt with climate change and mitigation policies were nixed, the decision to end the environmental fine was firmed up and the selection of Cabinet members hostile to the fight against global warming was made. But then, after two years of downplaying the Amazon crisis and dismissing calls for action, the Bolsonaro administration changed the tone of its public statements in 2021 at the climate summit, where he pledged for the first time to curb deforestation and increase resources for environmental law enforcement. Lula, a pro-environmentalist, in his first and second stints had chosen to surround himself with a Cabinet made up of equally fervent Ministers- Dilma as the Minister of Energy and Marina Silva who is a staunch environmentalist, as the Minister of Environment. Despite these efforts, at the end of his term, Lula rode a great wave of popularity for his measured yet progressive approach towards development while he netted disappointment among the environmentalists for not making the preservation of nature his highest priority. Leaving aside the criticisms, Lula's success lay in declaring bold targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases and reducing the rates of deforestation in the Amazon. In the present context, the President-elect will participate as the head of his political party and not as the President since he takes over only in January, in the COP 27 at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt. The environmentalists have immense expectations from Lula as the major plank of his campaign were the promises to protect the Amazon rainforest and restore Brazilian leadership on climate change. Lula's attending the conference of parties is more of a signal to the world that Brazil is ready to take a proactive position towards halting climate change.Theexpectations of the world can be fathomed from several news items- theTimespublished under the headline: "Lungs of the Earth breathe sigh of relief at Lula's election victory" and theNew York Times' write up quoted Lula'svictory speech -"Let's fight for zero deforestation". For Lula it would be a mammoth challenge, given the adverse impact of the policies under Bolsonaro on the environment and the blockade his efforts may receive due to a right-wing dominated Congress. Delving deeper into the Brazilian context, it is apparent that there are certain areas that have continued to evoke concerns regardless of the ideology of the incumbent government: deforestation as asource of greenhouse gas emissions; the role of the farmers and indigenous people; changing weather patterns; and implementation of national policies and international agreements and regime. Even thoughLula's selection shows he evinces measurable popularity among Brazilians for his positions on environmental policies, the dilemma remains- should the priority be development or the environment? Clearly, development remains important as is corroborated by the fact that Brazil needs to maintain its ranking as the twelfth largest economy in the world (World Bank 2021), yet the clout that it has acquired at the multilateral environmental fora necessitates that it must tread the path of sustainable development carefully.

India, Nov. 3 -- Manjeet Dhakal, advisor to the LDC chair, talks about challenges faced by disadvantaged countries & their agenda for CoP27 As many as 46 nations are part of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) group, which are highly vulnerable to climate change and least-equipped to reduce emissions and adapt. These countries will demand action from wealthier countries at the 26th Conference of Parties ( CoP27 In the run-up to CoP27 , Down To Earth caught up with Manjeet Dhakal, advisor to the LDC chair and head of the LDC Support Team at the non-profit Climate Analytics (CA), to understand the challenges faced by the disadvantaged nations and their agenda. Rohini Krishnamurthy: What kind of challenges are the LDCs facing? Manjeet Dhakal: LDCs are categorised as a special group of countries based on their economies. The COVID-19 pandemic and debt crisis have exposed how vulnerable we are. The Russia-Ukraine war has affected food security all around. Many countries realised for the first time how vulnerable we were in importing food and how the economy has changed. Undoubtedly, LDCs are the hardest hit by any kind of shock - natural or human-induced climate shocks. RK: What is the priority for LDCs to address these challenges? MD: We have a set of expectations that we want delivered right away. In terms of the broader thematic areas, we expect progress on the global goal on adaptation (a system to assess countries' progress on adaptation actions and ramp up adaptation funding). It was established under the Paris Agreement in 2015. This involves working out funds needed for adaptation if we don't limit the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius and get the finance necessary for implementing adaptation action. We are mandated to have an outcome on this goal by next year at CoP28. But this year, we hope to have an interim decision. Last year, a mitigation work programme was designed in Glasgow as the world is not on the right track to limit temperature rise to 1.5degC. Scientists called for a reduction of 45 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions compared to 2010 by the end of this decade. Emissions are set to rise by 10 per cent even if all the nationally determined contributions ( NDC) are implemented. So, this mitigation work programme has to be designed in a way that can help limit temperature rise to 1.5degC. And for LDCs, this is key because we cannot adapt beyond that. The need for funding beyond 1.5degC will be much higher than what has been discussed and delegated. So, this CoP should be a milestone in delivering a clear key roadmap to take us towards 1.5degC within this decade. And still, in 2020, it was around $83 billion, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). And there was a decision made in Glasgow (CoP26) to double the adaptation finance compared to 2019. So, we are expecting that this CoP will help operationalise how the doubling will be done. The final one is on loss and damage. The institutional arrangement to fund loss and damage has to be established at this CoP. Loss and damage have been discussed in the last 20-plus years. We hope to discuss how the funding for loss and damage can be done and design the financing structure for loss and damages. RK: You have been a part of these negotiations since 2009. Have you seen any changes in how CoP operates? MD: We have made some progress, but it is nowhere near where it should be. But there is a silver lining. In 2016, when all the countries submitted their NDCs, assessments showed that the emission would rise by about 20-23 per cent. In 2022, it will increase by only 10 per cent with revised NDCs. So for the first time, we are starting to see the curve going downward. So for me personally, I think this gives a little bit of hope that this process is delivering. And it's also that there is no other alternative option. As this is a global problem, we need a global solution. RK: How will you urge the developed countries to honour their commitments and ramp up climate action? MD: L DC will work closely with the Group of 77 (G77, a coalition of 134 developing countries). We are a subgroup of G77. Developing countries will be coming together and building momentum. We are discussing strategies. So this is the whole agenda of the meetings we are having this week before CoP27 begins on November 6, 2022. RK: CoP 27 MD: Targets made by countries to reduce emissions are not enough. So, we will also have to raise ambition. If you look at the mitigation and even finance, whatever has been provided now is not enough. So, keep implementing but also raise ambition. RK: Given that as many as 54 nations are facing a severe debt crisis. What should be done to reduce the burden on the developing world? MD: We were clear from the beginning that finance should be public finance and grant-based. Much of finance currently is through loans, which increases the financial difficulty in developing countries. Another challenge is access to funds. It is difficult for us to go through all the bureaucratic processes in the multilateral fund (a channel that provides climate finance). Consider the loss and damage situation. When a country faces extreme disasters such as floods, landslides or glacier lake outbursts, we need ground support to be implemented immediately. The first 12 hours will be so crucial to save lives. To get financial support, we will have to write a proposal, submit it to the board and go through all the technical processes. This takes years. And also, considering that LDCs have the least capacity, it is challenging to work on all those technical details. For example, our countries were asked to explain the climate rationale for getting financial support from the Green Climate Fund. We will need data for the last 30 years to justify whether an event was caused due to climate change or not. Many of these countries may not have had the facilities to make such measurements in the past. The process needs to be simplified. RK: There is a new climate finance goal being discussed. What lessons should stakeholders learn from the past? MD: The new finance goal will be called New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG). The current climate finance goal of 100 million dollars a year was decided in 2009. This was not based on any scientific assessment. It was not based on the needs of the developing countries. It was a political number. NCQG should be based on the needs of the developing country and climate science. It should consider not only the current impacts but also future ones. Loss and damage is instrumental. As of now, the whole finance discussion is about mitigation and adaptation. We see the NCQG as an opportunity to establish the third pillar, loss and damage.

Sharm El Sheikh, Nov. 18 -- The first draft of a deal being hashed out at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt appeared to repel efforts by developed nations to shift onus of action and funding to some developing countries like India and China, setting up what appeared to be hard red lines that meant consensus was elusive less than 24 hours before a Friday deadline. Released as a "non-paper", or an unofficial draft, by Egypt's COP27 president, the 20-page text retains the distinction between rich and poor nations and highlights the Paris Agreement principles of "equity" and "common but differentiated responsibilities", which relates to the fundamental understanding that countries will act as per their national circumstances and respective capabilities. "Time is not on our side, let us come together now and deliver by Friday," COP27 President Sameh Shoukry said in a letter to delegates published on Thursday. Key among the issues discussed was the 1.5degC goal. COP27 countries, the document said, "stresses the importance of exerting all efforts at all levels to achieve the Paris Agreement temperature goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2degC above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degC above pre-industrial levels,". It goes on to point out that developed countries have failed to mitigate emissions based on their fair share and historical responsibility, a portion that is likely to be of particular contention. "Expresses deep regret that developed countries who have the most capabilities financially and technologically to lead in reducing their emissions continue to fall short in doing so, and are taking inadequate and unambitious goals to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, while they continue to emit and disproportionately consume the global carbon budget," the draft said. Another issue, key from India's perspective and that of several other developing nations that rely on cheaper coal for energy, was on how to stress on efforts to phase it out. The early draft did a balancing act by calling for phasing down of coal and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, but cushioned it by stating that the efforts will be based on national circumstances and just transition. "Stressing the importance of enhancing the share of renewable energy in the energy mix at all level as part of diversifying energy mixes and systems, and encourages the continued efforts to accelerate measures towards the phase down of unabated coal power and phase out and rationalise inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, in line with national circumstances and recognizing the need for support towards just transitions." There was, however, no mention of gas and oil - fuels that rich countries use and the ones India wanted included - in the text. On climate finance, the draft text hit out at the "lack of ambition" in raising adequate climate finance by developed parties. "Notes with concern the growing gap between the needs of developing country parties, in particular due to the increasing impacts of climate change and increased indebtedness, and the support provided and mobilised to complement their efforts to implement their nationally determined contributions, highlighting that current estimates of such needs are in the scale of 5.6 trillion USD up to 2030, while the global annual flows to developing countries", it notes, is 31-32% of the annual investment needed. The text also expresses grave concern that the goal of developed country parties to mobilise jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020 has not yet been met and urged them to meet the goal and address the shortfall to USD 100 billion since 2020. In one of the contentious domains, Loss and Damage funding, which involves a financing mechanism to aid countries suffering climate crisis impact like flooding and droughts, there was no text. HT reported on Wednesday that rich nations are attempting to cast the funding net on India and China, classifying them as "emerging economies" and major polluters who need to do more. Overall, the cover decision encourages wealthy countries to increase support and align funding flows with the 1.5degC goal. This is not the final text and it may change significantly. Egypt being a developing country itself has been trying to reflect the concerns of developing country groups. "The Paris Agreement says in black and white. Under Article 2, it states that the entire Paris Agreement should be guided by based on equity and common but differentiated responsibilities. This is a conversation that takes place every year. We are patrons at this time and we are trying to find a common ground. We will have to find the right language to accommodate differentiation. We are aware of the various positions and we are working now to accommodate the parties' views but also the legal agreement that we ratified together," Egypt's COP27 ambassador Wael Aboulmagd said. Negotiators said the task to find consensus will be difficult. "It's going to be quite a long and difficult journey to the end of this process," European Union climate policy chief Frans Timmermans told a news conference. "Today, I'm afraid I'm not sure yet where these talks will land." "If this COP fails, we all lose." Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Patna.

November 10 -- World leaders and policymakers are meeting in Egypt for the 27th Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The fact that the summit is taking place on African soil has given residents of the continent, the worst-hit victims of climate vagaries, high hopes that urgent issues like climate financing will be at the centre of discussions. The conference comes at a time when Africa is facing prolonged droughts, food insecurity, high energy cost and disasters like floods. The residents are happy that, in these circumstances, the climate agenda will be highlighted comprehensively at COP27 .\~ Agriculture, especially crop farming, was never a trial and error affair due to failing rains. As droughts ravage some places, unusually high rainfall overrun others.\~ \~ \~ \~ The latest United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Adaptation Gap Report highlighted the sad state of affairs and the impending danger that the continent faces. Africa has contributed negligibly to the changing climate, with just about two to three per cent of global emissions, the report noted. "But it stands out disproportionately as the most vulnerable region in the world." The African Development Bank, one of the biggest funders of climate mitigation efforts across Africa and headquartered in Ivory Coast / West Africa, detailed how the continent loses up to an average of $15 billion annually to climate crises. "The figure is expected to hit $50 billion a year by 2030 if no appropriate mitigation efforts are put in place," the bank said in a statement. A section of experts and climate activists from Africa, however, are optimistic and hopeful that this year's conference, which some described as "Africa's COP", will be a game-changer because it's a mega opportunity to highlight the continent's unique needs and dire circumstances. Amid unmet climate commitments, energy and food supply chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the current chair of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN) on climate change, Ephraim Mwepya Shitima of Zambia is happy that the continent's priorities are already taking centre stage at the summit.\~ "The Russia-Ukraine conflict is a setback to Africa's climate agenda. It diverts the continent's attention from climate obligations to food supply chain resilience. But we will not allow a geopolitical situation to lower our expectations," said Mwepya, the lead negotiator, in a statement to the press. COP27 could also advance the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) implementation, including adaptation and mitigation efforts and delivering necessary finance to enhance implementation, he added. "Besides new agenda like push for a dedicated loss and damage facility, some of our agenda items are from previous summits and we plan to reiterate them," he said, adding:\~ For example, we will push for delivery of the $100 billion a year by 2020 promise that was not met by developed nations. \~ Africa has high hopes from COP27 , partly because it is the fifth to be held on African soil, said the executive director of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), Mithika Mwenda from Kenya. PACJA is a powerful consortium of over 1,000 organisations from 48 African countries and is very vocal in the fight against climate change. "Despite the summit being christened 'the African COP', the African civil society wants to qualify it to be the ordinary Africans' COP. This is because we want the issues that are pertinent to Africa to be abundantly articulated throughout the 11 themed days," he says. The activists and members of civil society are calling for a balance between funds that go to mitigation and adaptation, especially after a statement released by the Global Center on Adaptation showed that only 7 per cent of the funds go towards climate adaptation. Climate change is likely to cost $579 billion by 2030, with a big chunk of the global finance skewed toward mitigation, according to the report. "Only 7.2 per cent of global climate finance goes to adaptation efforts." COP27 One challenge African parties face in the negotiations is the inability to quantify intangible loss and damage such as deaths, loss of livelihoods or cultures due to displacements for financial compensation. \</doc>

India, Nov. 18 -- Parties have decided to initiate the development of a framework for GGA that will be considered and adopted in 2023 The African Group of Negotiators (AGN) is not happy with the way negotiations on the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) are going at the 27th Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Ephraim Mwepya Shitima, the chair of the AGN bloc, made a statement at the informal stocktaking plenary on November 18, 2022: COP27 is referred to as the implementation COP, the adaptation COP; therefore, we need to deliver on adaptation. We have to advance the work on substantive elements of the GGA, including agreeing on a framework for the goal. Also, we must reach a decision that guides the work on the GGA. This comes after a new draft text on GGA was released by the COP presidency late on the night of November 17, which looked almost final. In the text, parties have already decided to initiate the development of a framework for GGA that would have a structured approach and will be considered and adopted in 2023. This could be one of the points of contention for AGN as it wants an agreement on the framework at COP27 "Unfortunately, when the African Group stressed the urgency to engage on substance and work on a textual proposal and draft decision text that works for all as usual practice, some partners chose to only display text without any concrete input to be provided to the co-facilitators," Mariam Allam, advisor to the AGN chair on adaptation and loss and damage, said. Shitima had been calling for a concrete decision on the GGA even before the COP. "We will continue calling for global goal for adaptation to be operationalised and guide the adaptation efforts of countries at COP27 ," he had said in an article on the United Nations website. It was also decided as part of the text that the framework will have two functions - enhancing action and support for achieving the GGA and reviewing progress on GGA as part of the Global Stocktake (GST) in 2023. Parties further decided on the various elements, approaches and sources of information to be considered under the structured approach. The framework would be reviewed before the GST. References to a special report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the GGA, which had been considered under one of the options in the text earlier, have been removed. AGN had been pushing for the invitation of the IPCC special report on GGA as part of the text which would help in updating the impacts and adaptation guidelines from 1994. Sandeep Chamlin Rai, senior advisor, Global Climate Adaptation Policy, World Wide Fund for Nature told Down To Earth that "this could be because IPCC would take at least five to six years to come up with the report". That would mean a further stalling on agreement on GGA which countries would not want. "IPCC was also asked to refine the methodology and give the global targets and indicators. But this is now part of one of the workshops for next year under the Glasgow Sharm El-Sheikh Work Programme on GGA. Therefore, they may not have wanted to pre-judge the outcome of the workshops," Rai added. Instead, the outcome of that particular workshop could be to make a recommendation to the IPCC to come up with guidelines to establish global targets and indicators.

Masdar, one of the world's fastest-growing clean energy companies, and its global Women in Sustainability, Environment and Renewable Energy (WiSER) initiative, this week held a series of high-level discussions to raise global awareness and support for women as powerful catalysts of sustainable change on the sidelines of the 2022 United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ). Sheikha Shamma bint Sultan bin Khalifa Al Nahyan said: "It was an honor to collaborate with WiSER this week to amplify the voices of women and girls at COP27 . As the UAE looks forward to hosting COP28 next year, I am encouraged by WiSER's efforts to raise global awareness and support for women and girls at the forefront of the net-zero transition." Key Highlights:  Across Africa, Masdar and its partners are also helping to accelerate sustainable socioeconomic development with over 1 gigawatt (GW) of clean energy projects capable of delivering electricity to over 845,000 homes in Egypt, Morocco, Mauritania, and the Seychelles.  Globally, Masdar's clean energy projects displace close to 20 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. Original Press Release: Nov. 18 -- Masdar issued the following news release: - Masdar's Women in Sustainability, Environment and Renewable Energy (WiSER) initiative hosts series of COP27 events to amplify voices of women and girls in global climate debate - UAE's Sheikha Shamma Al Nahyan joins global industry leaders and policymakers for WiSER Wisdom Series dialogue on intersection of gender and climate - Masdar has invested 1 GW of clean energy in Africa, which could power over 845,000 homes Masdar, one of the world's fastest-growing clean energy companies, and its global Women in Sustainability, Environment and Renewable Energy (WiSER) initiative, this week held a series of high-level discussions to raise global awareness and support for women as powerful catalysts of sustainable change on the sidelines of the 2022 United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ). Sheikha Shamma bint Sultan bin Khalifa Al Nahyan said: "It was an honor to collaborate with WiSER this week to amplify the voices of women and girls at COP27 . As the UAE looks forward to hosting COP28 next year, I am encouraged by WiSER's efforts to raise global awareness and support for women and girls at the forefront of the net-zero transition. The UAE and UICCA are committed to continuing this important work with WiSER and our partners in Africa and around the world to help secure an inclusive and sustainable future for all." Throughout COP27 Global policymakers and industry leaders have taken the #IAmWiSER pledge, including the UAE's Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology, Special Envoy for Climate Change, and Chairman of Masdar, H.E. Dr Sultan Al Jaber; UAE Minister of Climate Change and Environment, H.E. Mariam Almheiri; Permanent UAE Representative to the UN, H.E. Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh; and Co-Chair of UN-Energy, CEO of Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), and Special UN Secretary-General SEforALL Representative, Ms. Damilola Ogunbiyi of Nigeria. UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology, Special UAE Envoy for Climate Change, and Chairman of Masdar, Dr Sultan Al Jaber, said: "The UAE has long recognized that women represent an equal share of the global population and is committed to ensuring that they have an equal voice in the dialogue on climate action. This is especially important in areas such as Africa and the global south, where women are bearing the brunt of climate change. Through our global clean energy powerhouse Masdar and its WiSER initiative, we are working constantly to empower women to generate more equitable and effective climate solutions, and COP27 has provided the ideal platform to amplify their voices to the world. I look forward to building on this success at Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week next year, and to seeing this positive momentum carry through to COP28 in the UAE." Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) is a global initiative, established by Masdar in 2008, to accelerate sustainable development and advance economic, social, and environmental progress, in line with the UAE's long-term vision and commitments. Taking place 14-21 January, ADSW 2023 will be next year's first major sustainability gathering, bridging the gap between COP27 and COP28 by convening global stakeholders to take stock of progress on commitments and continue to engage on bold climate action and practical innovation. Elsewhere on the sidelines of COP27 this week, a WiSER Wisdom Series panel, "Gender Challenges to Climate Change," featured The Gambia's Honorable Minister of Gender, Children and Social Welfare, Fatou Kinteh; Director of Decarbonization and Sustainable Energy at the UN's Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), Mr. Tareq Emtairah; Head of Institutional, Strategic, Private & Gulf Partnerships at Plan International, Mr. Mohamed Kamal; CEO of Siraj Power, a UAE-based provider of solar power solutions across the Middle East and Africa, Mr. Laurent Longuet. Honorable Minister Fatou Kinteh of The Gambia said: "The WiSER Wisdom Series COP27 panel was an important opportunity to engage in collaborative, frank conversation about challenges to building an equitable, sustainable future in communities across The Gambia, specifically, and Africa more broadly. It is critical that we continue to work together with organizations like WiSER to facilitate a global dialogue that meaningfully considers the unique challenges and opportunities facing women in diverse communities across Africa." Another WiSER Wisdom Series panel, "Design and Implementation of Inclusive, Community Energy Systems," featured young women who shared insights from their experience participating in WiSER's first field-based course in Rwanda, completed in August as part of the platform's new WiSER Cares initiative to equip young women in rural off-grid communities with the knowledge and skills to harness the potential of practical clean energy technologies. Masdar Executive Director of Brand and Strategic Initiatives, and WiSER Program Director, Dr Lamya Fawwaz, said: "Across the world, women are starting new companies and innovating new technologies that are catalyzing meaningful sustainable change for their families, communities, and countries. At COP27 , it was my privilege to shine a spotlight on these women while also working with our partners in Africa to inspire more to join them in advancing positive climate action. From now, through to ADSW, COP28, and beyond, WiSER will continue to sow these seeds of empowerment so more women can unleash their full potential." In line with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 5 and 7) concerning gender equality and clean energy access, respectively, WiSER also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in September with Plan International Spain (SPNO), an independent development and humanitarian organization working in more than 75 countries, including in Africa, to advance children's rights and equality for girls. In the MoU, WiSER and SPNO agreed to pilot programs worldwide to accelerate sustainable development by empowering women and girls through educational, skills-training, mentorship, and internship opportunities, with a special focus on the global south. SPNO Chief Executive Officer, Concha Lopez, said: "We urge all states to raise responsible and active citizens through ambitious transformative education that enables children, especially child girls and adolescents, to be prepared, to adapt and to mitigate the impacts of this crisis, as well as to participate in climate action and in the green economy. We share this vision with WiSER, an internationally reputed platform which also works towards a world wherein all girls are empowered to maximize their potential as innovators and leaders of sustainable change." Across Africa, Masdar and its partners are also helping to accelerate sustainable socioeconomic development with over 1 gigawatt (GW) of clean energy projects capable of delivering electricity to over 845,000 homes in Egypt, Morocco, Mauritania, and the Seychelles. Globally, Masdar's clean energy projects displace close to 20 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. Source: Masdar [Category: Energy, New Renewable Energy, Events, ESG] \</doc>

Fiji has highlighted the need to establish a cohesive financial mechanism to address financing for loss and damage,- a major focus at this years COP 27 currently underway in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. In his statement at the COP27 High-Level Plenary, Fijis Permanent Representative at the United Nations and Head of the Fijian Delegation at COP27 , Ambassador Satyendra Prasad, spoke on the support that Small Island Development States (SIDS), require to build resilience from the impacts of the climate crisis. He said it is also in the interest of the principles of the convention of security and of global stability - whereby Fiji implores all parties to realize where we are, and the necessary action we need to progress under the Paris Agreement in order to maintain the 1.5-degree temperature target. Ambassador Prasad reiterated the importance of upholding the decisions enshrined in the Glasgow Climate Pact - that nations need to keep their discussions focused on the substance and priorities. He said while Fiji welcomed the commitments made to reduce emissions by 2030, these commitments need to be locked into domestic regulations, just as Fiji has done through its Climate Change Act. In voicing the plight of the Small Island Developing States (SIDS), Ambassador Prasad said there should be an urgency to mobilise greater support for the SIDS as their livelihoods, cultural and traditional assets are most affected by the climate crisis. \</doc>

Tortuous negotiations at COP27 yielded an important breakthrough \- the agreement to set up a loss and damage fund, often referred to as climate compensation fund. A compensation fund at climate talks is not new \- the 2015 landmark Paris Agreement mentions it. However, acting upon it is a big step forward because it had to clear two hurdles. One, the largest emitters historically had to accept responsibility for irretrievable damage as warming above pre-industrial levels is already having an effect. Second, as COP27 works on consensus, everybody had to come on board. Clearing these two hurdles represents a breakthrough in a year when heat waves or floods have ravaged countries such as Pakistan, which lack resources to cope. But this is where a bigger challenge awaits the world. A transitional committee to operationalise the compensation fund will now have to get down to coming up with an acceptable solution. So far, important promises on financing have not been kept, notably the $100 billion per year developed countries agreed to jointly mobilise in 2010. Financing in its entirety represents the biggest challenge. The other significant deal is that, guided by pragmatic suggestions from India, COP27 agreed to transition out of fossil fuels. Three aspects stand out. There will be both a  phase down of coal and a  phase out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies while providing targeted support for the economically vulnerable. This global transformation to a low carbon economy is doable only if there are investments of $4-6 trillion a year, according to the COP27 statement. For perspective, keep in mind Japan's GDP last year was $4.9 trillion. Given the current economic hardship on account of a slowing global economic momentum, creating a workable financing mechanism is unlikely to be easy. Notwithstanding these challenges, the silver lining is that COP27 showed that there is now a greater sense of urgency than before. The high incidence of extreme climatic events this year have instilled a greater sense of purpose among countries. India has set itself a target of reducing emissions intensity by 45% in 2030 while using 2005 as the baseline. Even as India contributes to the solution of coming up with a workable global financing mechanism, it must move ahead on its plan of pivoting towards green hydrogen and a higher use of nuclear power. These are perhaps the most practical responses. \</doc>

India, Nov. 20 -- Against the backdrop of intensifying climate change that promises not to spare anyone from its catastrophic consequences, global leaders are discussing what actions can be taken to prevent or at least minimise the damage to the ozone layer, at COP27 , hosted in Egypt's picturesque island of Sharm el-Sheikh. The UNFCC and the IPCC have been sending constant warning signals to the world community regarding some irreversible process of climate change. Unless the world, particularly the big industrialised nations, realise the gravity of the situation aggravated by their deviant behaviour, there is no point talking about climate solutions in global meets like the COP27 and may be again in the COP28. Therefore, COP27 Why is climate finance so important? A climate solution corpus is very crucial for the developing nations to further stop the depletion of the ozone layer and mitigate the worst effects of climate change. The rich nations have been promising that they will offer an aid of $100 billion each year towards this cause. But so far it has remained a lip service. If the rich nations continue to dawdle on the promised climate fund, they leave the planet and its inhabitants in lurch. The big polluters like the US, China, the Russian Federation and the EU must understand that they are pushing the world towards a dangerous future. Unless they offer this financial aid, the less-developed nations, the Vulnerable-20 group and the island nations belonging to the Pacific Vuvale would be in permanent danger of destruction. Of course, they all will be the permanent victims of the developed nations and the emerging economies. Rubbing salt into the post-Covid world's wounds is the devastating war in Ukraine. And on top of that China's rising aggression in and around Asia is threatening both the global power calculus and peace around the globe, thus jeopardising the efforts to give an undivided attention to climate solutions. And therefore, climate activists have been left disappointed at COP27 also. Staring at the dark future, activists from Africa have accused rich countries of trying to bribe the African leaders to invest in planet warming fossil fuels. To them, it is yet another hypocrisy that the developed nations have employed to make Africa unwitting partners in their climate crimes. Therefore it seems global climate diplomacy is failing the world. Whether it is at the UN or at any other global forums like the G-7, G-20, the OECD, EU or any platforms, all are making a mockery of the developing nations. Their meetings and numerous conferences are making no breakthrough to save this planet. Amid all these, the big power rivalry is spoiling the current debates and dialogues. The New Cold War between the US and China is ruining all the chances of the revival of the health of the planet earth. Both the nations are fighting at different levels to bolster their influences and domination at global institutions. In fact, China is desperately trying to push back the US to occupy the top slot in global governance. Chinese President Xi Jinping is widening his wings everywhere. He is a megalomaniac. His ambitions have no end. He wants to grab the whole world and resurrect the old Chinese Empire. He has forgotten that the world is now in the 21st century and no one is living under the illusion of Mao Zedong's great Communist Era. The world today is well connected by the massive changes of globalisation accompanied by the advancements of information and communication technologies. China needs to reset its own house before venturing out to derail the western liberal order that has been dominating the globe since the end of the Second World War in 1945. It is better for China and the US to compete healthily instead of turning it into a major conflict. And this will unnecessarily delay the mitigation efforts to save the atmosphere. Hope the latest meetings of Xi and Biden against the backdrop of the climate talks and the G-20 would spearhead a new beginning in their relations though major differences would continue for now and even for a longer duration. The current climate crisis is affecting global health. A recent report by the Lancet journal says that there is a direct link between the changing weather conditions and their impact on the health of the people around the world. This report clearly says that our dependence on fossil fuels increases the risk of disease, food insecurity and other sickness related to extreme heat. These incrementals are too dangerous for all of us. The point here is that there is no place to hide now. All are affected, from Iceland to Madagascar and from China to the US. It is clear that the advanced countries are holding back the future of the developing nations. It is not that people in these countries can wait for the tall promises made by the developed nations. However the hope is that strong and sustained reductions in emissions of the CO2 and other GHGs could rapidly make air quality better. And if it happens, then another 20-30 years, the global temperatures could stabilise. There is no point of discussing who is responsible for the current chaos. Blaming the developed nations will not work. The point is to make the amends. All governments, local, national and the global, must work together to reduce the use of fossil fuels. The blame game won't help the vulnerable nations and the people on the fringe. We have come to such a point that now the Pacific Vuvale group is approaching the UN General Assembly to pass a proposal and can go to the International Court of Justice to seek immediate intervention in the global crisis. This climate justice case will be historic once it goes to the ICJ. Because of these nations, climate change is increasingly violating universal human rights. It's time now to act. Not to make sermons. World leaders and global governance institutions should not make hollow promises. Because the inhabitants of this planet are in grave danger, slanging matches will not help anyone. It's time to take responsibility and to save the earth. The current ecological imbalance must be repaired, else, we all will be in peril.

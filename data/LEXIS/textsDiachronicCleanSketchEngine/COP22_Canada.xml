Canada is present and accounted-for at this year's United Nations climate change conference with aprovisional participant list of 225 individuals( HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2016/cop22/eng/misc02p01.pdf http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2016/ HYPERLINK cop22 /eng/misc02p01.pdf ) led by Environment Minister Catherine McKenna and which includes Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard, several provincial environment ministers and a handful of members of provincial legislatures. They've all travelled to Marrakech, Morocco for COP22 to build on work undertaken in COP21 last fall in Paris. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and many other heads of government were present last year in Paris to sign what has been dubbed the Paris Agreement. It was a big deal. In fact, it was such a big deal that the newly minted Trudeau government spent just under $1 million on Canada's delegation including $130,000 on meals and about $350,000 on hotels. The size of the Paris delegation was around 335 people versus the 225 listed as Canadian participants for Marrakech. (The conference has been under way for a week now but really kicks into gear Tuesday with what are called "high-level" events, i.e. events where you can expect the participation of ministers,( HYPERLINK http://cop22.ma/en#programmes/category/undefined http:// cop22 .ma/en#programmes/category/undefined Trudeau will not be there this year - his presence would have accounted for a big chunk of the Paris Government of Canada delegation - but some opposition MPs will (just as they were last year) including Conservative Ed Fast. There had been some earlier sniping between Fast's office and McKenna's office over the conditions of his participation( HYPERLINK http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/mckenna-unmuzzles-opposition-critic-for-cop22-but-fast-still-isnt-going-to-climate-change-confab-in-marrakech http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/mckenna-unmuzzles-opposition-critic-for- http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/mckenna-unmuzzles-opposition-critic-for-cop22-but-fast-still-isnt-going-to-climate-change-confab-in-marrakech cop22 -but-fast-still-isnt-going-to-climate-change-confab-in-marrakech ) but that has appeared to have been sorted out. In addition to Fast, NDP Linda Duncan and BQ MP Monique Pauz\'e9 are on the official delegation list. Green Party leader Elizabeth May has said earlier she'll have to miss this COP( \~ HYPERLINK http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/mckenna-and-her-critics-now-haggling-over-the-bill-to-attend-marrakech-climate-conference http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/mckenna-and-her-critics-now-haggling-over-the-bill-to-attend-marrakech-climate-conference ) - she's been to almost all the others - as a result of some demanding travel she's already done this fall with the House of Commons special committee on electoral reform. Now, not all of those who are are on this list of Canadian participants( HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2016/cop22/eng/misc02p01.pdf http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2016/ HYPERLINK cop22 /eng/misc02p01.pdf ) were able to attend. David McLaughlin, an advisor to Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister, for example, stayed home to finish up work on that province climate change policy ahead of this fall's First Ministers' Meeting on the issue. Nor are all those on the list( \~ HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2016/cop22/eng/misc02p01.pdf http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2016/ HYPERLINK cop22 /eng/misc02p01.pdf ) members of the official Canadian delegation. The representatives of the Assembly of First Nations, for example, are there independent of official Government of Canada delegation. One would assume the large number of Quebec government politicians and Quebec government bureaucrats are also independent of the official Canadian delegation. That said, the largest group of participants are federal and provincial government employees, deputy ministers, scientists and other bureaucrats who work on environmental issues. Some are over in Marrakech on the federal government's dime; many others paid their own way. Here are some notes on participants: Environment Ministers Shannon Phillips (Alberta), Scott Moe (Saskatchewan), Cathy Cox (Manitoba), Glen Murray (Ontario), David Heurtel (Quebec), Perry Trimper (Newfoundland and Labrador) About 17 representatives of indigenous groups including from the Assembly of First Nations, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the Manitoba Metis Federation, the Metis National Council, the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, and the Native Women's Association. A youth delegation of five people. Environmental advocates from Climate Action Network Canada, Pembina Institute, Ecojustice Canada, Equiterre, and Environmental Defence.

Regina: The Government of Saskatchewan has issued the following news release: Environment Minister Scott Moe will represent the Government of Saskatchewan at the 22nd session of the Conference of Parties on Climate Change ( COP22 ) in Marrakesh, Morocco. Moe will attend from November 14-18 and take part in sessions on agriculture carbon offsets and carbon capture and storage, advancing the themes of climate mitigation, adaptation and technology.  The conference will allow us to promote how Saskatchewan\' s approach can deliver real global results in addressing climate change, Moe said.  We will share success stories showing how environmental stewardship can be achieved while protecting economic prosperity, such as our commitment to zero tillage, which has transformed our agricultural lands into tremendous soil sinks, absorbing millions of tonnes of carbon every year. Our commitment to carbon capture and storage technology and our aggressive move toward renewable electrical generation technologies are two other key planks in our strategy. With an estimated 2,400 coal plants in development around the world, Saskatchewan maintains that carbon capture and storage technology has the potential to be a global climate change solution. As well, Saskatchewan continues to move toward 50 per cent renewable capacity in its electricity generation mix by 2030, through the addition of wind and solar power, amongst other sources. Moe will also be meeting with Moroccan pulse importers and a durum wheat processor. Morocco is a key market for these Saskatchewan crops, with more than $190 million worth of durum and $5 million worth of lentils exported in 2015. Saskatchewan accounted for 66 per cent of Canada\' s total exports to Morocco in 2015.

As this blog noted Friday, Environment Minister Catherine McKenna was forced to overrule her bureaucrats who seemed to be trying to put a muzzle on any MPs( HYPERLINK http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/bureaucrats-wanted-to-muzzle-mps-first-nations-leaders-and-others-bound-for-climate-change-conference http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/bureaucrats-wanted-to-muzzle-mps-first-nations-leaders-and-others-bound-for-climate-change-conference ), First Nations leaders, NGO representatives or others who wished to be part of the official Canadian delegation to the annual United Nations climate change conference to be held nearly next month in Marrakech, Morocco. This one will be known as COP22 ( HYPERLINK http://www.cop22.ma/en http://www. cop22 HYPERLINK http://www.cop22.ma/en .ma/en ) and it is the followup to the bigger-deal COP21 held last fall in Paris. Now an update on that story: McKenna sent a new invitation to potential delegates including to Ed Fast, the former international trade minister and Conservative MP, who is now the Official Opposition Critic to McKenna. You can read it below but in it, McKenna notes that there was never any intention to prevent Fast or other delegates from speaking to the media. "I understand that the media plays an important role in communicating to Canadians on such important issues as climate change," McKenna writes. Nonetheless, she tells Fast that he will be receiving an amended version of a "Canadian Delegation Agreement" - a new set of terms he will have to agree to if he chooses to accept the invitation to join McKenna's delegation. (The government will cover up to $4,500 in travel and accommodation costs for those in the official delegation) Fast, in an e-mailed response sent to McKenna's office late Friday afternoon, notes that he did not sign any such agreement as a condition of his being part of the delegation to last year's COP21 conference and "I have absolutely no intention of signing any document that governs my participation at COP22 ."

Catherine McKenna, P.C., M.P. Minister of Environment and Climate Change Dear Minister, Thank you for your letter of response dated Oct. 28. Unfortunately, you have misunderstood my letter of Oct. 27. I have absolutely no intention of signing any document that governs my participation at COP22 . You may recall that last year you also invited me to COP21, for which I was grateful. I don't believe anything in my behaviour or that of other Canadian delegates at that event would have led anyone to believe that we weren't conducting ourselves in a manner that reflected well upon our country. Indeed, my interactions with the media highlighted our Conservative Party's support of your government concluding the Paris Agreement. That is why I find it puzzling that you are still requiring delegates to sign a Canadian Delegation Participant Agreement, albeit revised. Certainly no MP should be required to submit to the authority of the Head of Delegation or have their discretion fettered, especially since you have confirmed that our engagement will be limited to general (public) events hosted by the COP22 organizers. May I respectfully make a suggestion? Drop it. A Participant Agreement is unnecessary. Sincerely yours, The Hon. Ed Fast, P.C., Q.C.

Environment Minister Catherine McKenna was forced to step in late last night and overrule bureaucrats in her department who wanted to take the unprecedented step of muzzling MPs, First Nations leaders and others invited to accompany her to next month's United Nations climate change conference . The twenty-second session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 )( HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/meetings/marrakech_nov_2016/meeting/9567.php http://unfccc.int/meetings/marrakech_nov_2016/meeting/9567.php ) will be held Nov. 7-18 in Marrakech, Morocco and invitations were sent out over McKenna's name to, among others, her official opposition critics, including Conservative Ed Fast. The invitation, dated Oct. 24, offers to reimburse Fast for his travel and accommodation to a maximum of $4,500 but only if he'll sign an agreement promising not to give any media interviews and that he would "respect the authority of the Head of the Delegation (McKenna) on all matters regarding your conduct as a member of the delegation." Fast, who served in the Harper government as Canada's minister of international trade, was part of the Canadian delegation to COP21, held last fall in Paris, and travelled there at the government's expense with no strings attached. Fast replied to McKenna's invitation on Oct. 27, telling McKenna that he would not attend COP22 on those conditions. "Canadians elected me to promote Canada's national interests wherever and whenever I have the opportunity to do so," Fast wrote to McKenna. "This effort to muzzle my ability to communicate with Canadians on issues they deeply care about is highly objectionable and contrary to the democratic principles we are both entrusted to uphold. "As your (Official Opposition) Critic, it is my constitutional responsibility to challenge the Government of Canada and to offer Canadians alternative policy and legal perspectives when and where appropriate. I do not intend to shirk that responsibility," Fast wrote.

"The COP 22 Delegate Agreements provided to opposition MPs, indigenous groups, provincial, territorial and municipal representatives, NGOS, youth and business included an error made by [Environment and Climate Change Canada] officials that suggested limits on interactions with media," McKenna's press secretary Caitlin Workman wrote in an e-mail. "We have asked [department] officials that all invited delegates be contacted immediately to rectify this error." THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean KilpatrickConservative MP Ed Fast rejected the conditions request by McKenna's department and declined her invitation to join her at COP22 . The Canadian delegation to COP22 will be much smaller than last year's massive delegation which included Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, almost all the premiers, and more than a hundred others. While the size of this year's delegation has yet to be set, McKenna hopes it will include MPs as well as representatives of provinces, municipalities, indigenous groups, advocacy and environmental organizations, youth and business. "Minister McKenna's office made it clear starting last year that Canadian delegates at COP 21 were not required to submit to any conditions on interactions with media," Workman said. "We look forward to Mr. Fast or any of our critics joining us at COP22 , just as they did at COP 21 to build on the important work underway." Workman also noted that the Trudeau government's policy of inviting opposition MPs to international conferences "is in stark contrast to the previous Conservative Government which routinely failed to invite opposition representatives to international events in which Canada was a participant."

MARRAKECH, Morocco - Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard has closed the door that Minister of Natural Resources Pierre Arcand had opened: it is not the government, but citizens who will block shale gas projects in the St. Lawrence Valley. The premier was reacting to comments Arcand made on Tuesday. Arcand ruled out, for the short term, any shale gas extraction in the St. Lawrence Lowlands. But he also talked about potential technologies that might allow it in the future. However, Couillard not only asserted that this scenario would not be consistent with the government's action on climate change, he does not see the day when the population will accept the exploitation of hydrocarbons. COP22 in Marrakech, the United Nations Climate Change Conference . Couillard is there on a mission. As to whether future governments will benefit from a more conciliatory public opinion, the premier sounded doubtful. "I do not think any other government will be able to dismiss the issue of social acceptability and eliminate the fight against climate change," he said. "Two fundamental elements that will be the same in 10, 15 or 20 years." !@COPYRIGHT=\Â£9 2016 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved. \</doc>

We continued working with our partners in the States and Regions Alliance and the Under 2 MOU, reinforcing the essential role subnational jurisdictions like Ontario have in helping national governments meet the goals of the agreement. Ontario also joined the 2050 Pathway Platform yesterday, which facilitates sharing resources, knowledge and experience among subnational and national governments to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. I held a trilateral meeting with leaders from Quebec and California to discuss linking our cap and trade programs to further efforts to reduce emissions while boosting economic growth. I also met with representatives from Vermont and the State of Washington on further expanding the North American carbon market. I look forward to continuing this important work with our partner jurisdictions. I also want to thank the federal Minister of Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna for her efforts at COP22 . Ontario is pleased to have an active partner at the national level to develop a pan-Canadian framework for climate change and work together to meet Canada's international commitments. Our government is committed to fighting climate change. Our Climate Change Action Plan and cap and trade program will help us cut greenhouse gas pollution to 15 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020, all the way to 80 per cent by 2050. The work we are doing here in Ontario, and through our partnerships across Canada and around the world, will help make it easier and more affordable for people and businesses to do their part in the fight against climate change.

Ottawa: The Government of Canada has issued the following news release: Clean, innovative technologies are central to addressing climate change. They also present incredible opportunities for Canadian innovators as they enter these new international markets. Clean technology growth and development will enable Canadian companies to create more jobs that pay well. According to the International Finance Corporation, the Paris Agreement will help open up nearly $23 trillion in new opportunities for climate-smart investments in emerging markets, between now and 2030. Canada is positioning itself to engage in this global clean economy. Following a town-hall open discussion with Canadian businesses, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, released the following photo and quote on the role of carbon markets and Canadian business engagement, at COP22 : Quote  Global demand for clean technology is on the rise. Canada is home to more than 750 clean-technology companies, and our businesses are world leaders in collaborative research and development, particularly in the renewable energy sector. Canada\' s innovators have a unique chance to turn the challenge of climate change into an opportunity to expand, export, and invest internationally. Our government is committed to helping Canadian businesses thrive and create good, sustainable middle-class jobs across the country. \- Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: HYPERLINK mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com editorial@plusmediasolutions.com \</doc>

MARRAKECH, Morocco - The U.N. weather agency says 2016 is set to break the record for the hottest year since measurements began in the 19th century. The World Meteorological Organization said Monday that preliminary data through October shows global average temperatures this year are 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. That's getting close to the limit set by the global climate agreement adopted in Paris last year.

Greenpeace Canada says Ottawa will set a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent below 2005 levels by 2050, A spokesperson for the environmental organization told The Canadian Press on Wednesday that members of the Canadian delegation at the United Nations climate change conference indicated the 80 per cent number during a meeting. That would mean Canada would follow the lead of the United States, which has also set an 80 per cent goal. Members of the Canadian delegation at the United Nations climate change conference in Marrakech, Morocco, did not confirm the information. Caitlin Workman, a spokeswoman for Environment Minister Catherine McKenna, did not respond to a request for comment. Canada's strategy for reaching its target is expected to include doubling production of clean energy and increasing energy produced from biomass. The plan will also favour integrating electrical transport networks between the provinces as well as U.S. states. The conference is aimed at implementing the Paris agreement on climate change that entered into effect Nov. 4. Countries have been meeting to discuss tools for meeting their commitments as well as ways of measuring accountability. Up until now, the Trudeau government has adopted the previous Conservative government's 2030 target of reducing emissions 30 per cent below 2005 levels. So far more than 100 countries have ratified the Paris agreement, which aims to limit the average global temperature increase by a maximum of two degrees Celsius by 2050. \</doc>

When last we left Environment Minister Catherine McKenna and her official opposition critic, Conservative MP Ed Fast, they were at odds over McKenna's insistence that Fast sign a "Delegate Participation Agreement" if Fast wished to join the Canadian delegation to the next week's United Nations climate change conference to be held in Marrakech, Morocco.( HYPERLINK http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/mckenna-unmuzzles-opposition-critic-for-cop22-but-fast-still-isnt-going-to-climate-change-confab-in-marrakech http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/mckenna-unmuzzles-opposition-critic-for- http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/mckenna-unmuzzles-opposition-critic-for-cop22-but-fast-still-isnt-going-to-climate-change-confab-in-marrakech cop22 -but-fast-still-isnt-going-to-climate-change-confab-in-marrakech ) But on Tuesday in the House of Commons, during an exchange between the two in Question Period (which you can watch in the video below), McKenna announced that Fast had indeed accepted her invitation to join her at the climate change change conference, known as COP22 . There may yet be some more haggling. The offer of invitation extended by McKenna to Fast indicated that the government of Canada would pick up Fast's travel and accommodation tab to a maximum of $4,500 but that Fast would be responsible for making his own travel arrangements. So Fast began making those travel arrangements but his office says they are having some difficulty at this late date - the conference runs Nov 7-18 - being able to get a flight and hotel package and stay under that $4,500 cap. [youtube= HYPERLINK http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaWyhHz8xT8&;w=640&;h=390 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaWyhHz8xT8&;w=640&;h=390 ] Meanwhile, NDP MP Linda Duncan, who is her party's environment critic, avoided some of this by booking her travel to Marrakech ages ago - though she, too, is not so pleased with the way McKenna is handling this. But did Duncan not have the same objections that Fast did about the original "Delegate Participation Agreement" that would have forbid her from giving any media interviews( HYPERLINK http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/bureaucrats-wanted-to-muzzle-mps-first-nations-leaders-and-others-bound-for-climate-change-conference )? "I signed the ridiculous and insulting undertaking simply to expedite being able to finally confirm arrangements to attend." McKenna was travelling overnight - she has an announcement Calgary today - and was not immediately available for comment but she has said that, unlike her Conservative predecessors, at least she's inviting members of the opposition to join her delegation. Well, some of those Conservative environment ministers did not take opposition MPs along to these international climate change conference but one did: The late Jim Prentice. Duncan remembers asking Prentice to include opposition critics along with representatives of indigenous organizations and civil society as part of his official delegation. "He did so and booked flights and hotel for me for all COP and pre COP and [Canadian Council for Ministers of the Environment] meetings I attended with him . As members of delegations we were provided advance briefings on key issues at the meetings. I was also welcomed into daily briefings at the COPs. I travelled on same flights with him. I was not required to sign any undertakings." The Canadidan Press/Chad HipolitoGreen Party Leader Elizabeth May says Canada paid all expenses for MPs attending international climate conferences -- prior to the Harper government. Elizabeth May, the Green Party leader and MP, has been to oodles of international climate change conference as an MP, as a representative of an NGO and, way back in the late 80s, as a ministerial staffer. She's just finished an extended cross-country tour with the Commons Electoral Reform committee and, because of that, will have to miss next week's COP22 . But she says it was routine prior to the Harper government taking office for governments to do what Prentice did: Invite opposition critics and others and make all the travel arrangements. In the meantime, so far as the current squabble involving McKenna and her critics goes, May said that MPs had to work with the same $4,500 expense cap at last year's COP21 summit in Paris. (May, Fast and Thomas Mulcair were among the MPs that joined the Canadian delegation at that summit) Despite those expense caps for MPs, it cost the federal treasury more than $1 million for the travel, hotel and food bill for the 155-member Canadian delegation at COP21 last year. That included a meal tab rung up over two weeks by three Environment Canada bureaucrats of $12,000( HYPERLINK http://www.torontosun.com/2016/08/23/politicians-racked-up-whopping-1-million-bill-in-paris http://www.torontosun.com/2016/08/23/politicians-racked-up-whopping-1-million-bill-in-paris ) - some of which was paid back after it was reported( \~ HYPERLINK http://www.torontosun.com/2016/08/25/sun-gets-results-bureaucrats-to-pay-back-part-of-paris-meal-tab ). The Canadian delegation this year will be smaller though its size has yet to be firmed up. Not only that, but those "Delegate Participation Agreements" have been, in May's experience, pretty much standard operating procedure. "Pre-2006 (when the Harper government took office) the confidentiality was more carefully explained as respecting the confidentiality of the negotiating position of the Government of Canada," May told me. "I sometimes would choose not to go [as part of the official Canadian delegation] to be free to really criticize as I did in Rio in 92. On a del[egation], I would still talk to media, but be very careful not to reveal anytjing I only knew because I was on the del[egation]." .

Earlier this month, leaders from around the world gathered in Marrakech, Morocco at the 22nd annual United Nations climate change Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ), a followup to last year's meeting in Paris. The conference focused on how to achieve continued reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and how to solidify structures to fund adaptation. Yet, given the U.S. election outcome, there was also much informal discussion about how goals could be achieved with less U.S. participation. In this period of uncertainty, it would be easy to lose sight of what climate change means to communities in Canada. This country has experienced some of the most dramatic environmental shifts from climate change globally, particularly in Arctic regions where temperatures are warming more than twice the global average and there are unprecedented rates of summer sea ice loss. It is essential that we take stock of our knowledge, experience and values, and advance with a common vision. Consideration should especially be given to how to ensure that voices of historically underrepresented communities continue to be heard within Canada and beyond. Indigenous organizations, communities and scientists have widely concluded that environmental changes are increasingly affecting health of northern communities, including impacts to food security, mental health, housing and cultural activities. Specifically, travel has become more dangerous with greater unpredictability of hazards, housing overcrowding is being exacerbated by permafrost change and there is mounting pressure on ecological systems and traditional food sources. Environmental changes, however, have been met by initiatives intended to reduce vulnerabilities and build on community strengths. Communities are adapting to environmental shifts aided in part by increasing cooperation and funding from government bodies. Examples of adaptation include community initiatives to monitor for diseases like gastrointestinal illness and policies to fund housing resilient to permafrost changes. Knowledge gained from work in the rapidly changing Arctic has also helped define how climate change is likely to affect communities elsewhere in Canada and around the world. It is expected that, as in the North, climate change will hit marginalized communities hardest. With fewer resources to adapt to environmental changes, health and economic disparities may be exacerbated. Even under hopeful climate scenarios where warming is limited to 1.5 degrees C, it is estimated that temperatures over the Arctic will rise by two to three times the rate of southern Canada. Over the coming century, Canada will increasingly observe impacts of climate change from north to south. Much consideration is already being given to how climate change exacerbates or changes risks of disasters, includingat the annual symposium of the Canadian Risks and Hazards Network( HYPERLINK http://www.crhnet.ca/symposium http://www.crhnet.ca/symposium It is crucial that the international community continues working toward goals of limiting average global temperature rise to well below 2.0 degrees C and building adaptive capacities to climate change. Within Canada, we must continue to listen to indigenous communities, minority groups and marginalized populations, ensuring that mitigation policies do not restrict but empower, and that policies enhance community resiliency to future changes. Few countries have experienced the magnitude of environmental changes that Canada has to date. Knowledge developed from successful adaptation programs, Indigenous knowledge and scientific experience researching vulnerability and resilience should be shared. Further, as highlighted in the Truth and Reconciliation report, it is important that we continue to remember and remind others of past failures. We have a shared responsibility to continue to address climate change impacts within and outside our borders, advocating for the underrepresented voices within our country and around the world. Canada is defined not be its neighbours, but by the voices and policies that come from within. James D. Ford is a Canadian Institutes for Health Research Applied Public Health Chair, editor-in-chief of Regional Environmental Change and associate professor at McGill University.

Toronto: Toronto Money Exchange has issued the following press release: Canada is moving to take serious action on climate change, and Canadians will benefit from new opportunities in the emerging clean-growth economy. The Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, co-chaired the Climate and Clean Air Coalition's (CCAC's) High-Level Assembly and issued the following quotes and photo at the event: Quotes "We have seen great things happen this year in the effort to reduce short-lived climate pollutants. Canada and its North American partners agreed to drive down black carbon or soot emissions that come from burning fossil fuels and to reduce potent methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, by up to 45 percent by 2025 a reduction equivalent to 3.8- to 4.2-million passenger vehicles not being driven in a given year. More recently, we joined the world in agreeing to phase down climate-warming hydrofluorocarbons, such as those used as refrigerants. Today, we took another important step in reducing methane emissions from oil and gas operations and promoting cleaner fuels and vehicles internationally. "Taking action on these harmful pollutants will benefit Canadians and communities. Finding solutions to reduce short-lived climate pollutants will also foster innovation and create good jobs in a modern, clean, global economy." \- Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change "I am proud to announce investments with Chile and Mexico to help reduce short-lived climate pollutants. In Canada and around the world, we are adding up wins for the climate and cleaner air." \- Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Quick facts Scientists agree that short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) such as black carbon, methane, ozone, and some hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are responsible for an important portion of the current rate of global warming. Sustained reductions of SLCPs are critical to meeting the Paris Agreement goal of holding global temperature increase to well below 2 \'b0C and of pursuing efforts towards 1.5 \'b0C. Canada, Bangladesh, Mexico, Ghana, the United States, Sweden, and the United Nations Environment Programme established the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, in February 2012. Canada is currently serving as the Coalition co-chair with Chile, and it is the largest contributor to the Coalition's Trust Fund, with a contribution of Can$23 million to date.

In a gratuitously spectacular display of counterproductive hypocrisy, an anticipated 225 Canadians will jet to Morocco to denounce the use of fossil fuels. Canada's catalogue of participants is so large it takes up the better part of eight pages in the United Nations list( http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2016/cop22/eng/misc02p01.pdf http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2016/ HYPERLINK cop22 /eng/misc02p01.pdf ) of attendees. Australia's delegation can fit on two pages, as can China's, which has 38 times Canada's population and immensely greater emissions issues to deal with. France, which hosted last year's conference, has five pages of names. While some Canadian delegates are footing their own bills, federal, provincial and municipal governments will pay the lion's share of costs. The bloated size of the crowd extends a tradition started last year, when 335 Canadians attended the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is not attending the follow-up event in Marrakech. It may be that that gathering was worth attending, as it supposedly set out a bold new direction for combating man-made climate change and signalled a global commitment to take decisive action. Optics aside, they weren't there to do serious work. The details of a major international agreement, on climate change or anything else, are too complex to be solved in 10 days. The hard work is done well ahead of time, to avoid embarrassing national leaders in front of the cameras, either by problems that have not been resolved or because in the warm glow of the moment they make promises that contradict official policy or ignore the limits of the politically or physically possible. The real issues are best solved by small gatherings of major players and senior aides. In the globalized era of the Internet, expertise can quickly be obtained by phone, email or live chat, a consideration that should have been front and centre given delegates' professed concern about mankind's "carbon footprint". The Marrakech summit is intended as a follow-up to last year's meeting, to begin to "operationalize" the Paris accord. Does that really require the presence of a small army of bureaucrats, activists, provincial and municipal representatives and security personnel, not to mention labour bosses from Unifor, the Canadian Labour Congress, the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers? If these people are seized by the crucial matter of climate change, why are they not doing the hard unglamorous work of implementation, drinking bad coffee under depressing fluorescent lights in offices back in Canada? To be sure, the $1 million Canada's government spent on Paris, including $130,000 for meals and $350,000 for hotels, is a drop in the $300 billion bucket of federal spending, even if it's a worrying reminder of the disconnect between the public and private sectors, and the gap separating the privileged class from the rest of us, who lack the opportunity to blow thousands of dollars of someone else's cash on a jaunt to Morocco. But the hypocrisy cuts deeper here. Nobody, except, oddly, the participants, could overlook the damage to the planet caused by hordes of hangers-on jetting across oceans and continents to preach restraint. It is just too easy for critics to jeer at this hypocrisy as proof that the alarmists don't really take global warming seriously. Why would any working Canadian leave their car at home and crowd onto a bus for the bleak commute through a wintery morning, knowing environmental evangelists think it's fine to fly 255 Canadians to Morocco for a week in the sun? Donald Trump was elected president because of disgust at displays like this. Next time, send 20 people. Practise what you preach. National Post !@COPYRIGHT=\Â£9 2016 Postmedia Network Inc.

WASHINGTON, DC--(Marketwired - November 17, 2016) - Calling the Marrakesh Conference "a decisive turning point in the implementation" of the Paris Agreement, this week King Mohammed VI urged participants at the COP22 meeting to move beyond promises to "tangible initiatives and practical steps" -- initiatives that, most importantly, respect and support the priorities and resources of developing countries. The King noted that Morocco's commitment began in 1992 -- when, as Crown Prince, he headed his country's delegation to the Rio Earth Summit -- and continues today: "Morocco, which was among the first countries to announce their intended Nationally Determined Contributions, has pledged recently to reduce the rate of emissions. In addition, it has taken concrete steps to ensure that 52% of the national energy supply comes from clean sources by the year 2030. By the same token, we have proposed a set of initiatives as part of implementing the Paris Agreement, especially with respect to adaptation and financing. These include the initiative for the Adaptation of African Agriculture." "Holding this conference in Africa," he said, "is an incentive for us to give priority to tackling the adverse repercussions of climate change, which are growing worse and worse in the countries of the South and in insular states whose very existence is in jeopardy." "The environmental issue is a critical problem which must be tackled in the most serious and responsible way," he told the assembled world leaders. He continued, "What is at stake is the very existence of man. It is therefore our joint duty to work hand in hand to protect him. Accordingly, countries must not be pressed from the start into accepting decisions they will be unable to comply with. This is not to say that they reject them. It only means that they do not have the necessary means to implement them." The King urged "all parties to work on translating our commitment to the values of justice and solidarity into actions, by: "The time has come to redress the situation," the King concluded. "We have no alternative but to work to make up for lost time, through continued, comprehensive mobilization and positive harmonization, so that the coming generations may lead an enjoyable and dignified life together." At a press conference earlier this week, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon expressed his gratitude to King Mohammed VI for convening the Marrakesh conference -- and for Morocco's ongoing leadership. "I am grateful for His Majesty convening this very important COP meeting, immediately after the Paris Agreement," he said. ". . . Morocco is a very important country, Member State of the United Nations, not only on the African continent or in the Middle East but as a whole, providing many young men and women to keep peace and security around the world. And Morocco has been showing a great example based on democratic institutions, making sustainable development and championing climate change actions. Now I sincerely hope that here in Marrakech, we will set another very important commitment, a passionate commitment, to make this world better for all -- and I count on His Majesty's continuing leadership and guidance on this matter." The Moroccan Amercan Center for Polcy (MACP) is a non-profit organization whose principal mission is to inform opinion makers, government officials, and interested publics in the United States about political and social developments in Morocco and the role being played by the Kingdom of Morocco in broader strategic developments in North Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East.

WASHINGTON, DC--(Marketwired - July 28, 2016) - US Special Envoy for Climate Change Dr. Jonathan Pershing traveled to Rabat, Morocco Wednesday and Thursday to discuss plans for the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 22 ), which will be held in Marrakesh this November. Meetings and roundtable discussions with Moroccan officials and members of the COP 22 commission and steering committee, who are responsible for planning and hosting the event, prioritized the "rapid entry-into-force of the Paris Agreement, implementation of countries' Nationally Determined Contributions, mobilizing private sector finance for low-carbon climate resilient solutions and clean energy, and climate adaptation and resilience," according to a State Department release. In statements to the press following meetings with Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Salaheddine Mezouar, Moroccan Minister of Agriculture and Marine Fisheries Aziz Akhannouch, and other dignitaries, Mr. Pershing praised the "effective" partnership between the two countries in planning the November conference, and stated, "Morocco is a world leader in clean energy and many countries are looking to be inspired, especially in the implementation of renewable energy projects on a large scale, like the NOOR project." Noor 1, the first phase of what will become the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world, was inaugurated in Morocco earlier this year, and is just one of many environmental initiatives helping Morocco reach its goal of generating 42% of the country's energy needs from renewable sources by 2020 and 52% by 2030. In 2016, the Climate Change Performance Index> ranked Morocco alongside Denmark, Sweden, and Belgium in the top ten most climate-conscious countries and number one in the newly industrialized world based on criteria including CO2 emissions, renewable energy development, efficiency, and climate policy. King Mohammed VI has been an outspoken advocate for climate change action, noting in a speech at COP 21 in Paris last November, "The climate change predicament is the ultimate injustice suffered by the most vulnerable." "The consequences of climate change are affecting developing nations as much as -- if not more than -- developed countries, especially the least advanced African and Latin American States and small island States."

Justin Trudeau's Liberal government has revealed that the cost of food and beverages supplied aboard a government Airbus used for the PM's first two international trips amounted to just over $1,300 ... per person! The admission was a response to awritten question by the Conservatives. The Liberal government has been plagued for weeks by the disclosure of generous expenses claimed by political staffers, including the prime minister's top two aides, for relocating to Ottawa and by ministers for limousine and photographers' services. This latest damning disclosure shows $72,040 was spent on food and beverages for 55 passengers aboard the prime ministerial plane during a trip to Turkey and the Philippines last November for a G20 summit and an APEC leaders' summit. Another $81,383 was spent on food and drink for 62 passengers later the same month who travelled with the PM to London, Malta, and Paris, where he participated in a United Nations climate change conference . ConservativeMP Blaine Calkins calls the price tag "outrageous." Given the number of legs in each of the lengthy trips and the number of meals served, the Prime Minister's Office said the cost actually works out to $54 per person for each meal. !@COPYRIGHT=\Â£9 2016 Sun Media Corporation.

The ramifications of Donald Trumps upset victory in Tuesdays U.S. presidential race are being felt at the United Nations sanctioned Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) in Marrakech, Morocco. As the first large-scale UN talks on climate change since last years COP 21 in Paris, which was highlighted by the ratification of the Paris Climate Accord, the Marrakech event was expected to focus on growing the Paris agreement from the foundation that was set last year. And while that is still the goal, the Trump effect has thrown a wrench into the proceedings. Last year in Paris, the U.S. delegation, under marching orders from President Barack Obama and his administration, was instrumental in getting the Paris accord done. This year, the American delegates are essentially a lame duck offering, as Trump has said he would consider withdrawing U.S. support of the deal Obama signed off on last fall. And that has changed the tone and tenor emanating from COP 22 , which began on Nov. 7 and runs until Nov. 18. It has been really a topic of almost every meeting and discussion since the results of the election came out. Yesterday morning was the first session after the results were known and there was a meeting put on by one group that had three panelists talking about the affect of the change of government in the U.S. on climate policy and on COP 22 , McMillan said during a phone interview this morning. There were a lot of unknowns but everybody acknowledged that [Trumps presidency] was going to be very important. The U.S., under the Obama administration, had played a crucial role in having the Paris agreement come together. They had taken a leadership role and really rallied other countries, he added. With the new administration, would that change? No one knows for sure, but its something people are talking about at almost every meeting. Although hes not in Marrakech, Peter Tertzakian, managing director of ARC Financial Corp., wishes he were, especially given the Trump factor thats now in play on the global climate change policy stage. Id love to be there to listen to what people have to say because Trump has plainly come out and said hes going to tear up that [Paris] agreement, Tertzakian said. So the Morocco meeting is supposed to start talking about how to cut cheques from wealthy countries for other countries to lower the globes carbon footprint. I dont know what the American representatives at the conference are saying, but they have no mandate to do anything now. So I dont think its going to be a very effective meeting, all of a sudden. The uncertainty that Trumps win has placed on the proceeding at COP 22 are indicative of why Tertzakian says Canada needs to have increased sovereignty and influence over its own energy supply and supply routes. Thats because we dont want to be held hostage by the U.S. policy. We dont know what Trumps going to do with free trade, environmental policy and so on, he said. We need to have sovereignty over our energy supply, meaning pipelines and other modes of transportation. The election of Trump is a bit of a wakeup call that we need to think about our energy supplies not just economically and environmentally, but also from a sovereignty and energy security perspective. We dont know what the future holds, but we need to have more insurance policies by taking control. Carbon tax and competitiveness With both the Alberta and Canadian federal governments beginning to go full bore on their respective climate change action plans, which include a carbon tax, and with Trump highly unlikely to follow suit, the issue of competiveness is again front and centre. CAPPs McMillan said its too early to directly comment on what Trump may or may not do and how the competitive balance between the Canadian oil and gas industry burdened with a carbon tax will fare compared to their American counterparts operating in Trumps world. I dont want to get into speculation about what a new president or what a new administration will do, he said. In a general sense, that is something we certainly bring to any discussion we have about climate policy  that Canada can and should be the supplier of choice. We position ourselves to be producing oil and gas with less greenhouse gas emissions, with lower water usage and always trying to improve upon our technology, McMillan added. So be it if were competing against Saudi Arabia, Nigeria or the United States, we want to be leaders, we want to be improving upon our own production practices but we will always do it for a competitiveness balance. In an interview yesterday ( HYPERLINK http://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2016/11/9/canadian-oilpatch-beginning-digest-what-trumps-vic/ DOB, Nov. 9, 2016 ), he said he would not be surprised to see the U.S. withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord, which changes the global landscape as China and other major emitters reassess their commitments. Leach added that EPAC will be pressing for our governments to hit the pause button on their aggressive war on carbon until the implications of the Trump victory are clearer. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley told reporters in Edmonton yesterday that the provincial government has no plans or desire to change course. There are strong, strong, compelling reasons for moving forward on our climate leadership plan, and decisions on the voters south of the border are not things that should appropriately factor into that, she said during a press conference. Our climate change leadership plan was designed and modelled on the basis of Alberta acting alone, with amendments and considerations built into the plan for a more trade-exposed industry, and I think that remains the case now. Canada at COP 22 While Trump has been the focus of discussion at COP 22 , Canada hasnt been top-of-mind. He added that will likely pick up as the environment minister from Canadian provinces such as Alberta and Saskatchewan, as well as federal Environment Minister and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, join the COP 22 fray later this week. But to this point Canada has not been a focal point in any sense. Even the oil and gas industry hasnt had as much discussion as say agriculture, McMillan said. Maybe in the week ahead there will be more of an emphasis on energy and oil and gas in Canada, but to this point it hasnt been a real focal point. In general, McMillan said COP 22 has had a much lower profile than the Paris conference as the focus at COP 21 was getting an agreement in place and for countries to make a commitment. This year, the focus is really taking what was put forward last year and try, I guess, to put some understanding around it. Theres a lot of discussion about transparency and about consistency in accounting. Each country put forward different commitments last year but using different metrics and different calculating numbers, he said. This year its been a lot about the heavy lifting and figuring out what people are putting forward because if people arent using the same accounting systems, its really tough to know what people are putting forward, McMillan added. Some countries like Canada are well out in front in how we account, how we measure, because weve been doing it for years. Many other countries are really at the front end of that and just learning and trying to figure out how to measure in a meaningful way. \</doc>

OTTAWA - The Liberal government's twin pursuits of expanded foreign markets for Canadian fossil fuels and global action on climate change are getting some unfavourable notice at an international climate summit in Morocco. The newly elected Trudeau government made a big splash at last December's United Nations-sponsored COP21 in Paris by helping push aggressive global ambition in the battle against a warming planet. But while negotiating a national plan with the provinces and territories to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the Liberals have also approved a major liquefied natural gas project in British Columbia this fall and signalled their openness to new oil pipeline proposals. Environmental advocates attending this year's COP22 in Marrakech, Morocco, issued a release Wednesday calling out Canada's competing policy priorities. "It is a serious concern when we see the international community not honouring their commitments and we are concerned Canada is still pursuing their fossil fuel projects," Benson Ireri of Christian Aid Africa said in the release. "Developed countries have a moral obligation to honour the Paris Agreement." The Philippines-based Global Campaign to Demand Climate Justice also waded in, calling on Canada "to do the utmost that it can in domestic emissions reduction, to stop all expansion of fossil fuels, to do an immediate transition to renewable energy and deliver the finance necessary to keep the world from breaching 1.5 (degrees) Celsius," said spokeswoman Lidy Nacpil. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is set to meet his provincial and territorial counterparts in early December to finalize a pan-Canadian plan for cutting emissions 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Trudeau has already laid down a marker with the imposition of an escalating $10 per tonne floor price on carbon emissions starting in 2018 and topping out at $50 in 2022. But in September, the Liberal cabinet approved Malaysian-based Petronas's massive LNG project for northern B.C., which has clearance to pump 4.3 million tonnes of equivalent carbon dioxide annually into the atmosphere for decades. Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr has also said the Liberal cabinet will make a decision by mid-December on the proposed expansion of Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain oil pipeline from Alberta to Burnaby, B.C. Carr signalled this week that even if Trump greenlights Keystone XL, the Liberals still want new Canadian pipeline capacity. "Well, it doesn't get oil to export markets in Asia," Carr told reporters asking about KXL's revival, "and it's a goal of the government of Canada to expand its export markets." "So there are a set of conditions that we will look at very carefully, but I think that if you listen to what the prime minister has said about moving our resources sustainably, the importance of responding to the demands within other export markets and not to rely solely on one major market, that that's a sensible approach to take and nothing has changed." According to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, the additional 590,000 barrels of oil per day carried by a bigger Trans Mountain pipeline would add upstream GHG emissions of between 14-17 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year. To put those emissions in perspective, a report this week estimated the national floor price on carbon proposed by the prime minister will cut Canada's emissions by about 18 million tonnes a year when fully implemented in 2022. "Canada is on a pathway to reduce domestic emissions and meet the 2030 targets domestically while also increasing the amount of fossil fuels it exports," Catherine Abreu of Climate Action Network Canada said in a release from Marrakech. "This contradiction is not lost on the countries that are experiencing sea level rise, drought, increased storms and other climate impacts." - Follow @BCheadle on Twitter \</doc>

Two top government bureaucrats will repay part of their tabs for food and other incidentals while at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris. The about face is a result of a Postmedia investigation into the $1-million spent by the Justin Trudeau government to send 155 delegates to the conference known as COP21. The Postmedia probe has also forced bureaucrats to revise figures in documents previously released under federal access-to-information laws and those tabled in the House of Commons. Providing inaccurate information to Parliament is a big deal and the opposition is likely to give Environment Minister Catherine McKenna a tough time when the House of Commons returns Sept. 19. "It's looking mlo more and more like government officials are trying in th to whitewash the expenses for this Paris trip," th sa said Conservative environment critic MP Ed Fast. Max Guenette, who was a director general for communications with Environment Canada during the conference and is now an assist- ant commissioner for Canada Revenue Agency, filed a claim for meals and incidentals of $4,599.40 for the 16 days he was in Paris. After Postmedia published those numbers, the department took a second look at his claim and now Guenette will repay $1,340.88. Additionally, David Grimes, the assistant deputy minister in charge of Canada's weather service, will repay $951.41. He had claimed $3,266.55 for meals and incidentals during his 14-day stay. Bureaucrats at the conference were entitled to claim about $230 a day for food and $50 a day for "incidentals" and they needed no receipts to do so. \</doc>

Christa Croos arrived in Marrakech, Morroco last week as part of a Canadian youth delegation to the United Nations Climate Change Conference . A student at University of Toronto Scarborough campus (UTSC) and an environmental activist, Croos was there to help the world move forward on a climate change treaty reached a year ago in Paris, France. Then came news Donald Trump, who calls climate change a hoax, had been elected president of the United States. "There were a lot of tears and a lot of people, including myself, were not mentally or otherwise prepared to deal with a Trump win," Croos wrote before returning from the conference, which ended on Nov. 14. The conference was "a difficult space to navigate" after the election result, but a strengthened "resolve to do more and do better" rose out of the shock and pain, she said. "We are not going to allow one country to derail all the necessary and crucial work that has gone into the Paris Agreement." Croos, recently involved in a campaign calling for U of T to divest its financial holdings from fossil fuels, was doing "climate justice work" before she visited her birthplace of Sri Lanka last summer. There, she said, she witnessed harm climate change is already doing: subsistence farmers struggling to cope with droughts and extreme heat, and wild elephants finding what was left in a water hole too muddy to drink. She became convinced the industrial nations of the north, in particular, are content to stand by when it comes to climate change. Trump has said withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, which the U.S. and Canada signed, is one of his priorities, but Croos said work toward action on climate will continue, "with increased urgency." For "indigenous folks and people from the global south," there is no choice; this is a struggle for their survival, said Croos. "There is definitely still hope but there is a hard road ahead." \</doc>

Attracting the attention of investors is top of mind for Alberta Environment Minister Shannon Phillips in Morocco this week at the United Nations climate change conference . Speaking by phone Monday from Marrakech, Phillips said she has met with international financial institutions, the World Bank and investors from the private sector to lay the groundwork for what she expects to be a "tremendous amount of inves tment " flowing into Alberta as a result of the province's climate leadership plan. Phillips pointed to energy efficiency as an example. At a dinner Sunday night, she said United States Secretary of Energy Ernest Monizspoke about the estimated $23 trillion in private investment potential around energy efficiency in the developing world. Phillips called the mood in that room "optimistic," as the global business community moves further toward a consensus on renewables, energy efficiency and action on man-made climate change. "As soon as you price carbon, you open up investment opportunities that were not there previously," she said. Alberta, she said, is positioning itself to attract some of those investment dollars. The NDP government's climate leadership plan banks on a minimum $10-billion investment from the private sector. That means innovation, entrepreneurial activity and foreign investment around retrofits and technology, Phillips said, which in turn creates well-paying construction jobs throughout the economy. "The business case is very much there," she said. "Despite some speed bumps, I think that's what's going to carry a commitment to climate action through - it does have practical benefits, it does put people to work, it does allow for growth in a carbon-constrained world." In Alberta, the Wildrose Party has renewed calls to fire the province's Oil Sands Advisory Group co-chair Tzeporah Berman and fellow group member Karen Mahon, national director of STAND, formerly known as ForestEthics Advocacy, after what it calls active campaigning against Alberta's energy sector.

Long before the media caught on to just how much money the Liberals threw around in Paris at the climate change conference last fall, government bureaucrats had already set up a deflection for their new Liberal bosses: tell everyone Stephen Harper spent more. Briefing notes for Foreign Affairs Minister Stephane Dion, obtained by Postmedia Network, show the Liberals dug up Harper's bills when he attended his only UN climate change conference in 2009 in Copenhagen and planned to use them to excuse their own spending. Harper headed to that conference with a 38-member delegation and spent a total of $408,806.31 in travel, meals, and hotel bills, Dion's bureaucrats wrote for him in a briefing note he could read in Parliament. The same briefing note says the interim bill as of last January, for the full 155-person Canadian delegation, including Trudeau's team, was going to cost nearly $1 million. Dion's department was asked two weeks ago to provide final numbers for the Paris delegation as well as comparable numbers for any other prime ministerial delegations to these annual United Nations climate change conference but the department has not, so far, been able to respond. The Liberals have been on the hot seat all week for questionable expenses, including Environment Minister Catherine McKenna's $6,000 bill for a hired photographer to take pictures of her during her Parisian stay. Postmedia also found a trio of Environment Canada bureaucrats spent more than $12,000 on food during the trip. And this was days after Health Minister Jane Philpott said she would repay $3,700 in high-end car rides after it was revealed she billed for $1,700 on one day and more than $1,900 on another day for visits to the Toronto area. \</doc>

It was an inspiring weekend in Bracebridge. The 2016 Muskoka Summit on the Environment took place at the Rene M. Caisse Memorial Theatre. That this weekend gets the attention it does from people in the fields of science, politics and media is a feather in our cap. The summit shouts out loud and clear that Muskoka takes its environmental stewardship seriously. The speakers were all top-notch but it was Green party leader Elizabeth May who really got our attention. When she said Canada still has an opportunity to save itself from climate change but it will need to take a brave leadership role, the audience sat up and took notice. The best part of her speech and the summit was its optimism. May brought information from her role as part of the Canadian delegation at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December. She said the deal got stronger and better each day and as a result, world leaders are legally bound to work to curb emissions in a meaningful way. And she delivered a four-point plan for our country to meet its targets that includes working outside of the political box, putting a price on carbon, transitioning to a fossil fuel-free energy grid by 2025 and getting information about climate change and environmental policies in front of Canadians. The charismatic leader advocated for peer pressure, global shaming and telling stories of environmental successes. Countries, including our own, will meet their targets only if their feet are held to the fire by a public that cares. And Muskoka has deeply passionate environmentalists who are willing to make some noise. May suggested the media is in a large part to blame for misinformation about the environment and she urged folks to write letters to the editor whenever they read something that is inaccurate or misleading about climate change. Of course, that's always our best advice. We exist to serve and we count on you to read what we print carefully, and if you see something that doesn't wash, let us know about it. \</doc>

The PCHS Advance Placement (AP) Environmental Science Class has been running for five years. The class is for academically gifted students. Students are selected by staff, but they can also apply to become part of the program. Senior students in the program will write their AP Environmental Science exam in May as many postsecondary institutions accept the course for college or university credit. Students have performed very well on the exam in the past as seven out of 10 students that wrote the test last year were eligible for university credit. In the past, students in the program have travelled to developing countries to examine environmental issues and help with service projects. In 2014, students sponsored the construction of 10 biofuel gas plants in Nepal. The group travelled to Nepal in the spring break of 2015. Parkland students in the program have also presented to the Alberta government on Oil Sands Development and they have travelled to Ottawa to present on Energy Resource Development in Canada. In 2012, the program sent a student to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Doha Qatar. Forty-two students are signed up for the course this year. Ms. Terri Blacker and Mr. Corey Reynolds held their first weekend seminar on Nov. 24 to 26. The students and three teachers were bussed to the Nordegg Goldeye Conference Centre where they did three and a half days of intense lectures, labs and presentations. The environmental science course is offered after school and on weekends. "This course represents a considerable commitment toward academics," says teacher Terri Blacker. "We work on leadership, presentation skills and the environmental science curriculum. Senior students mentor younger students with the more difficult concepts. In turn, the younger students help the seniors to develop their leadership skills." The next scheduled weekend that the group will meet will be Feb. 23 to 26. Students at PCHS have challenged other AP exams including English, Physics, and Chemistry. Several students will be challenging AP Biology 30 at PCHS this year by studying the curricula on their own time even though a team of teachers at PCHS still help to mentor them. If there is interest, AP Social Studies may be added as a challenge option in the future. \</doc>

WASHINGTON, DC--(Marketwired - July 21, 2016) - US Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Morocco Wednesday and Thursday to meet with government officials as well as university students, entrepreneurs, and NGOs to discuss the fight against violent extremism and the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 22 ), which is scheduled to take place in Marrakesh in November. "The US-Moroccan partnership is key, not only to address common challenges, including security and climate, but also to benefit from available opportunities," said Mr. Blinken at a joint press briefing on Wednesday with Morocco's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Salaheddine Mezouar. "We greatly appreciate the leadership of the Kingdom, host country of the 22nd Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, on a large number of issues related to environment and climate," he noted. Minister Mezouar stressed that "the US commitment to the climate issue is crucial to accelerating the implementation of the Paris Agreement, the fight against climate change, capacity building, mobilization of funding and technology transfer." On security, the two officials reviewed "several issues of common interest, particularly the threat of Daesh, the issue of terrorism, religious leadership and the importance of promoting the value of tolerance advocated by Islam," according to Moroccan press reports. Minister Mezouar "noted a convergence of views in relation to the Middle East and Libya," and that the fight against Daesh in Libya, Iraq and Syria "is beginning to bear fruit." Mr. Blinken praised the role played by Morocco in the fight against extremism and terrorism, which includes participating in the US's anti-ISIS coalition, co-chairing with the Netherlands the Global Counterterrorism Forum, and an oft-lauded strategy of promoting religious tolerance and moderation throughout the region. In addition to his meetings with government officials, Mr. Blinken also met with international relations and political science students from the International University of Rabat as well as with green entrepreneurs and innovators. Tweeting on these encounters, Mr. Blinken said he was "inspired> by [meetings] today highlighting Morocco's bright future" and "bowled over> by eco-entrepreneurs," whose "Innovative ideas/solutions [are especially] critical ahead of #OurOcean & @ COP22 this fall." Mr. Blinken will next travel to Tunisia and Algeria. The Moroccan Amercan Center for Polcy (MACP) is a non-profit organization whose principal mission is to inform opinion makers, government officials, and interested publics in the United States about political and social developments in Morocco and the role being played by the Kingdom of Morocco in broader strategic developments in North Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East.

The United Nations has bowed to pressure from Environment Minister Catherine McKenna and three Canadian journalist advocacy groups, offering The Rebel - the right-wing news and opinion platform published by political commentator Ezra Levant - media accreditation at next week's Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) in Morocco. Earlier this month, the UNFCCC rejected an application by The Rebel to send three journalists to cover the conference, which takes place from November 7 to 18, on the grounds that "advocacy media outlets do not qualify for accreditation." In an e-mail sent Monday, a representative of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) secretariat informed the media outlet that it could offer two slots to cover COP22 . The UNFCC explicitly cited letters it received from Environment Canada, Canadian Journalists for Free Expression (CFJE), PEN Canada and the Canadian Association of Journalists (CAJ) as motivation for the reversal of its decision. Related Ottawa willing to intervene on behalf of The Rebel after journalists banned from UN climate conference( http://business.financialpost.com/news/ottawa-willing-to-intervene-on-behalf-of-the-rebel-after-journalists-banned-from-un-climate-conference http://business.financialpost.com/news/ottawa-willing-to-intervene-on-behalf-of-the-rebel-after-journalists-banned-from-un-climate-conference ) Ezra Levant seeks Trudeau's intervention after UN bars The Rebel from climate conference( HYPERLINK http://business.financialpost.com/news/united-nations-bars-ezra-levants-the-rebel-from-climate-conference http://business.financialpost.com/news/united-nations-bars-ezra-levants-the-rebel-from-climate-conference ) CJFE, PEN and CAJ raised concerns with the UNFCC, arguing it used the term "advocacy" - which was not mentioned anywhere in the media accreditation application - in a broad and arbitrary manner which was potentially harmful to speech and press freedoms. "Opinion pages, special reports, indeed advocacy journalism appears in many of the world's great news sources, including The Guardian and The New York Times," wrote Grace Westcott, executive director of PEN Canada, in an Oct. 5 letter to the UNFCCC. Environment Minister McKenna first expressed her willingness to intervene last week, after the accreditation ban became a media controversy earlier this month. Levant suggested that the The Rebel - which publishes coverage of environment issues that often exhibits or promotes climate change skepticism - had been rejected by the UNFCCC because of its specific editorial outlook, not because it was an advocacy outlet. "We're not being excluded because we have an opinion," he said in interview. "We're being excluded because we have the wrong opinion." But despite the UNFCC's willingness to grant The Rebel two spots at the conference, the organization is demanding it be granted the three spots it initially applied for. "In order to do its job, Rebel Media requires a reporter, a cameraman and a producer," reads a Monday letter to the UNFCCC from lawyer Stuart M. Robertson, acting on behalf of the company. "Any lateness in making this decision is entirely caused by delays you underwent in the process... It is false to say this matter has just been brought to your attention and that it is too late to accept all those who applied for accreditation. The decisions to deny accreditation were made on the false premise that Rebel Media is an Â£dvocacy media outlet.'" !@COPYRIGHT=\Â£9 2016 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved. \</doc>

Environment Minister Catherine McKenna says she is willing to intervene after a United Nations department rejected an application for media accreditation from a Canadian news company on the grounds that it is an "advocacy media outlet." The Rebel, the right-wing news and opinion platform published by political commentator Ezra Levant, received the rejection notice earlier this month from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) secretariat after it applied to send three journalists to cover next month's Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) in Morocco. A spokesperson for McKenna told the Financial Post that the minister supports freedom of speech, and that she is happy to intervene on behalf of any media outlets accredited by the parliamentary press gallery. COP22 takes place November 7 to 18. On Tuesday, lawyers acting on behalf of the Rebel sent a letter to McKenna, Foreign Minister St\'e9phane Dion and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau requesting the government provide assistance so that it "can gain access to the UNFCCC in the same manner as other accredited media." Included with that letter were copies of messages to the UNFCC from three of the country's leading journalism advocacy groups, all in support of The Rebel. PEN Canada, Canadian Journalists for Free Expression and the Canadian Association of Journalists previously raised concerns with the UNFCC, arguing its application of the term "advocacy" - which was not mentioned anywhere in the media accreditation process - was broad, arbitrary and potentially harmful to speech and press freedoms. "Opinion pages, special reports, indeed advocacy journalism appears in many of the world's great news sources, including The Guardian and The New York Times," wrote Grace Westcott, executive director of PEN Canada, in an Oct. 5 letter to the UNFCCC. Levant believes The Rebel was rejected not because it could be perceived as advocacy media - much of its coverage of environment issues exhibits climate change skepticism - but because of its editorial stance. "We're not being excluded because we have an opinion," said Levant in an interview. "We're being excluded because we have the wrong opinion." Last week, the UN's Nick Nuttal told CBC Radio's As It Happens that the decision to decline the Rebel's application was because "there didn't seem to be much balance in the reporting." "It seemed to be more kind of anti-refugee, anti-climate, anti-this, anti-that," he added. "And I just didn't feel that it was maybe appropriate in terms of better understanding climate change issues and giving balanced reporting to a general public." Nuttal's remarks led As It Happens host Carol Off to reply, "So it does seem that what Mr. Levant is saying is true - that you didn't like his point of view." Levant says that, despite The Rebel sending three letters to the UNFCC requesting clarification of its decision in addition to the three letters from PEN Canada, CJFE and CAJ, he still hasn't heard back. !@COPYRIGHT=\Â£9 2016 Postmedia Network Inc.

The federal Liberals apparently need a lot of green to be green. Documents obtained by Postmedia Network show the government's massive delegation to last fall's global climate change conference in Paris racked up a bill just shy of $1 million. That included about $130,000 on food alone for the 155 members, each of whom spent anywhere from a few days to a two weeks in Paris at the United Nations Climate Change Conference that ran from Nov. 30 to Dec. 12. One government delegate alone racked up $4,600 for meals. That's about $330 a day - just for food. It's unknown if the big eater was even a politician - identified in documents only as "Delegate 13." Environment Minister Catherine McKenna spent more than $6,000 for a French freelance photographer to follow her around and take pictures. McKenna, in Ottawa Tuesday, defended the use of the photographer and said previous governments had done the same thing. Nonetheless, she said she asked her department's officials to review the practice. "Pictures are an important part of how we transmit our message, but we need to do it in a way that is mindful of taxpayers," McKenna told reporters. "Previous governments used photographers as well but we can do better, and that's something I'm committed to personally. I think there are ways that we can reduce costs." A briefing note prepared earlier for Foreign Affairs Minister Stephane Dion, however, was far less apologetic about the total $1-million bill. "This government will not apologize for its position on climate change. COP21 (the climate conference) was a critical demonstration of Canada's collaborative commitment to strengthening its leadership globally in addressing climate change," Dion is advised to say by the bureaucrats who prepared the briefing note, obtained by Postmedia through a federal Access to Information request. "The size of the Canadian delegation points to the priority placed on the issue of climate change." The conference produced the Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to keep the change in global temperature below 1.5 C, though has been roundly criticized for coming away little planned action to make it happen. This is the intermediate tally prepared by Global Affairs Canada as of late January. It warned that more invoices might push some of those figures higher. \</doc>

There's a global momentum for carbon pricing, says the European Commission, with the number of schemes more than tripling since 2012 and with China, Ontario and Mexico set to launch their cap-and-trade systems in upcoming months. But more than a decade of emissions trading in Europe paints a complex, problem-ridden picture of politics and market failure. The European Union's 11-year-old emissions trading system (ETS), the world's first and largest international cap-and-trade scheme, has served as an exemplary tale of both successes and failures for all new systems, including the one in China set to launch in early 2017. "The EU and China have been working together and sharing experience on market measures for the past five years," says Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, a spokeswoman for the European Commission. "China is keen \'e2\â¬ \Â£6 to learn from what the EU has got right and wrong." Learning from Europe Cap and trade, also known as emissions trading, incentivizes reductions by making businesses pay for their emissions \'e2\â¬  the more they emit, the more they pay. The "cap," lowered periodically, places a maximum limit on all emissions, and pollution allowances that allow businesses to emit various amounts are then "traded" on the carbon market. Experts say the EU's ETS suffers from unambitious reduction targets, an over-allocation of pollution allowances, low carbon prices and a lack of political will to substantially amend the system despite ongoing revisions following COP 21. The power and industry sectors are supposed to decarbonize by 2040 to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5 C, or by 2050 to keep it below 2 C, but at the current rate that won't happen until 2058, according to Femke de Jong, of Brussels-based Carbon Market Watch. "That's too late," says de Jong. "These are symptoms of the failings of the ETS. The revisions aren't enough. It's a very clear sign that the way emissions trading is working now, it's not bringing emissions reductions." Carbon prices, currently between four to five euros per ton, are supposed to be around 30-40 euros per ton to really incentivize a low-carbon transition, according to de Jong and University College London professor Michael Grubb. "The caps we set were a hell of a lot easier to meet than we thought," says Grubb, who teaches international energy and climate change policy. "As a result, it cost very little to meet them, so those who'd been hoping this carbon price would be a significant driver of change and a good guide to low-carbon investment \'e2\â¬  it didn't work." Last year, the EU met its 2020 emissions targets, but many experts including Grubb and de Jong say other policies have likely helped cut emissions, meaning the ETS has not been the "cornerstone" of European climate policy, as termed by the Commission \'e2\â¬  but could still be. "It's been a steep learning curve, and Europe has been making huge strides," says Misato Sato, assistant professorial research fellow at the London School of Economics. "In terms of capping emissions, it's been a success, and the EU's 'learning by doing' approach means it's a work-in-progress that has allowed other countries to improve their own systems." As a market-based approach, cap and trade is seen as easier and cheaper to implement than carbon tax \'e2\â¬  imposed on the carbon content of fuels such as coal, petroleum and natural gas \'e2\â¬  which has been politically controversial in the EU as well as in Canada. Meanwhile command-and-control, which typically makes emitters take specific actions or install specific technologies to reduce emissions, has been seen as too rigid. Jeff Swartz, director at the International Emissions Trading Association, says more than 38 million tons of greenhouse gases are permanently removed annually thanks to the EU's ETS, and that politics is to blame for failures rather than the cap-and-trade approach to climate policy. "Emissions trading is not a bad concept, it's not flawed, it's just a reflection of how much political ambition our leaders are putting on the table," says Swartz. "The more they put on, the stronger the policy will be. The system has the real potential to be the future driver of emissions reductions, not just in Europe but internationally.' Emissions trading internationally COP 21 saw emissions trading put back on the global agenda after being discredited due to the ETS's failures and the collapse of COP 15 negotiations in Copenhagen, according to Grubb. The Paris climate change conference emphasized market-based approaches to emissions reductions, which includes cap and trade, says the European Policy Centre's senior policy analyst Annika Hedberg. "Article 6 in the agreement gave more of a push and bigger momentum for market-based mechanisms," Hedberg says. "It was a step forward in co-ordinating emissions-trading systems worldwide, and this is a good time to look into and try to further develop these systems." The world's largest polluter, China, which ratified the Paris climate accord alongside the United States last month, is expected to launch its national cap-and-trade system in early 2017 with a three-year first phase. The Chinese ETS is expected to cover about 70 per cent of emissions, compared to the EU's 45 per cent, but will include similar businesses to those covered in Europe, such as electricity generation and heavy industry. Future of cap and trade Ontario's cap-and-trade scheme came into effect on July 1, 2016, with the first compliance period beginning on January 1, 2017. The province plans to link with Quebec and California in 2018. Gary Wheeler, a spokesman for the Ontario's Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change, says the province studied the European carbon market closely before finalizing its ETS rules. "We learned from the EU and incorporated additional measures to address price volatility, including the establishment of a minimum price for allowances sold at auction and the establishment of an allowance reserve to provide additional allowances to capped emitters if needed during periods of high demand for allowances." Turkey, Ukraine and Washington state are also currently designing cap-and-trade schemes, among many other regions and cities around the world. The COP 22 conference in Marrakesh, Morocco, in November will build on the commitments made in the Paris agreement. "We're entering a new phase in carbon pricing and emissions trading," says Grubb. \</doc>

Calgary Turkish-Canadian held The wife of a Calgary imam jailed in Turkey says he is being held in solitary confinement and she's worried about his well-being. Davud Hanci, who has Canadian and Turkish citizenship, was arrested in July shortly after a failed coup attempt. Rumeysa Hanci says she has not been able to speak to her husband in more than three months and says it's been like torture for her and their two young sons. She adds Canadian government officials have not had access to him and he has only been able to see his lawyer twice.

The temperature next Tuesday is forecast to dip just below 30C for the first time in days, but it's still perfect weather for Peel residents to get out to a town hall on climate change. The federal government is conducting public consultations to gather citizen input for a national strategy. Mississauga MPs Omar Alghabra, Sven Spengemann, Peter Fonseca, Navdeep Bains, Gagan Sikand and Iqra Khalid have organized the town hall to raise awareness about the issues and get local residents to help formulate the country's plan to address climate change. The event is scheduled for July 26 at 6:30 p.m. on Sheridan College's Hazel McCallion Campus, 4180 Duke of York Blvd., room A145. Matt Hunter is a local spokesperson with People's Climate Plan, a national organization encouraging Canadians to take an active role in consultations and shaping the national strategy. The 36-year-old father of three daughters under the age of seven has a personal stake in this plan to address global warming. "I'm concerned about the future for my daughters," he said. "It's really important for everyone to come out and tell their own unique stories because in every community the local impacts of climate change are going to be different," Hunter said. The organization wants to see a strategy based on science, a move to 100 per cent renewable economy and justice for indigenous peoples and workers who would have to transition to a new clean economy. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberal government have made a concrete commitment to map out an action plan to combat climate change, put carbon pricing policies in place, and lower greenhouse gas emissions. The Liberals have pledged to work with provincial and global partners to move towards clean economic growth and transition the country and world to a low carbon economy. That transition would be bolstered by government investment in public transit, green infrastructure and clean technologies to create new jobs, the Liberals have promised. "The world gathered in Paris to fight climate change and its devastating impacts on our earth, our health, our economy, and our very way of life," Trudeau said in a statement after last year's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. "We also gathered with a common vision to leave a sustainable planet for our children and grand children." Canada and 194 other countries agreed to a long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to "well below" 2 C and aim to limit the increase to 1.5 C. \</doc>

Senior Saskatchewan officials selling the merits of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology at climate change conferences in North Africa and Europe this month aren't panicked by the victory of climate-change denier Donald Trump, the U.S. President-elect. In fact, they see demand for CCS technology continuing, even increasing, despite Trump's stated belief that climate change is a "hoax" and his campaign promise to pull out of the COP21 agreement signed in Paris last December. The agreement commits about 195 countries, including the U.S. and China, which are responsible for nearly 40 per cent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, to limit global temperature increase to within 2 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. "There's been some discussion (about Trump's election), but it hasn't changed dramatically the discussions here," said Environment Minister Scott Moe, who was attending the Conference of Parties on Climate Change ( COP22 ) in Marrakesh, Morocco. "There may even be an opportunity, with our CCS plant at Boundary Dam," Moe said, referring to the SaskPower's CCS project at Estevan, the world's first commercial scale, post-combustion CCS plant at a coal-fired generating station. With 2,400 coal plants in development around the world, Saskatchewan maintains CCS technology has the potential to be a global climate change solution. CCS can also be used to reduce GHG emissions from fertilizer, petrochemical and other industrial plants. "We'll see when there's an actual transfer (of power) and what direction (the U.S.) will take with the new president. But I can tell you we had great discussions about the opportunities for using CCS, not just in coal-fired power plants, but in a number of (GHG) emissions-intense operations," said Moe.' Mike Monea, former president of carbon capture initiatives with SaskPower and president of the International Carbon Capture and Storage Knowledge Centre, also attended the COP22 climate change conference in Marrakech. At COP22 , Monea discussed the centre's mandate to advance the understanding and use of CCS as a means of reducing GHG emissions and increasing deployment of CCS worldwide. "What we're doing in Marrakech is trying to help developing countries, especially in Africa, understand what the potential for CCS is and they could talk to us because we're actually doing it." "We're talking about the plant's operations ... how it has a storage side, and an enhanced oil (recovery) side. It's the full spectrum (of CCS technology) and nobody has that except us." Monea was also a keynote speaker at an International Energy Agency conference - Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies-13 - in Lausanne, Switzerland this week. But Monea said Trump's election didn't have much impact on the discussions at Marrakech or Lausanne. "It's business as usual," Monea said, adding "it's going to take a while to figure out where Trump is going to go with CCS." Ken From, president and CEO of the Petroleum Technology Research Centre in Regina, said PTRC's Aquistore project, which is studying the long-term impact of deep geological storage of CO2 produced at the Boundary Dam CCS plant, also attracted considerable interest from delegates at the GHGT-13 conference. "There's a lot of research and lab studies, but what's really needed to deploy this (CCS technology) is real-world experience. Boundary Dam and Aquistore are ... providing data that's real life." While Trump's election may be disconcerting to climate change scientists, it doesn't change the science of climate change and the need to take action to reduce its effects, From added. "We're so far behind on (CCS) deployment. That's why one speaker (at GHGT-13) said: 'Time's up.'

Passengers who accompanied Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on his first two international trips were apparently well fed. The government has revealed, in response to a written question by the Conservatives, that the cost of food and beverages supplied aboard a government Airbus used for the trips amounted to just over $1,300 per person. Conservative MP Blaine Calkins calls the price tag "outrageous." But a spokesman for National Defence, which is responsible for the government's fleet of air craft, says the total includes the actual cost of catering and delivering multiple meals on each round trip, as well as related costs such as disposable cutlery, napkins, dish washing, airport administrative fees and security charges and local taxes. Daniel Lebouthillier said the defence department "tries to keep costs to a minimum" when choosing items from a catering company's menu. But the department's options are "sometimes quite limited" when dealing with caterers at overseas airports. The total also includes the cost of feeding and watering journalists who covered the trip, which would have been wholly or partially recovered since media outlets pay hefty fees for a seat on the prime minister's plane. Calkins was not mollified by the explanation. More than $1,000 for food and beverages per passenger per trip "is more than the average Canadian earns in two weeks," he said. "Again, I'm just not sure anybody's minding the store when it comes to remembering that it's taxpayers who are on the hook for all these things." Calkins said the meal tab is part of a "pattern" of excessive spending by the Trudeau government, which has been plagued for weeks by the disclosure of generous expenses claimed by political staffers, including the prime minister's top two aides, for relocating to Ottawa and by ministers for limousine and photographers' services. The latest disclosure shows that $72,040 was spent on food and beverages for 55 passengers aboard the prime ministerial plane during a trip to Turkey and the Philippines last November for a G20 summit and an APEC leaders' summit. Another $81,383 was spent on food and drink for 62 passengers - including more than a dozen journalists -aboard the prime minister's plane for a trip later the same month to London, where Trudeau met the Queen, Malta, where he attended a Commonwealth summit, and Paris, where he participated in a United Nations climate change conference \</doc>

DON MARTIN: Well, we're on the eve of the annual United Nations climate change conference , this one in Marrakesh, but many climate change activists are far more worried about what's happening in Washington as their advocate for environmentalism prepares to leave the White House. Well to put both developments in perspective, Green Party leader Elizabeth May joins us from Victoria. Elizabeth May, there's the promise to cancel the Paris climate change agreement has vanished from Donald Trump's website. Is that an encouraging sign for you? ELIZABETH MAY (Green Party Leader): It may indicate that someone has advised him that he doesn't have the power to do that. So the good news is for people who are concerned about the Paris agreement, there is an exit provision that's legally is binding on the United States, and that will stop Donald Trump from getting the US out of the Paris agreement for a minimum of four years from now. And perhaps some of the people who are advising him are telling him that the US should stay in and play a constructive role, but the good news is even if he wanted to leave, the US, thanks to Barack Obama's quick action in legally acceding to the Paris agreement, the US can't get out, nor can any other country for a minimum of four years from now. MARTIN: All right. Well let's preview the next four years. What do you believe Donald Trump's election has, the impact it has on America's climate change fight? MAY: Well, you know, it's, the realist in me would say he's going to cancel everything that Barack Obama put forward, which was by executive order. People who follow US politics on climate closely will know that the US congress, the house, and senate were not cooperative with President Obama, and so in order to do things to reduce pollution from fossil fuels, he used executive orders that he could do through the US Environmental Protection Agency. That issue actually ended up in the Supreme Court. Judge Scalia was the vote that broke the tie against the EPA, so it's very relevant to climate action that president-elect Trump will get to appoint the next person on the Supreme Court. Not likely to be a vote that would differ from where Judge Scalia had been against climate action, so we've got the Supreme Court to look to, we've got the question of executive orders for things like air quality. But it's not, again, being a realist, it's not game over for US action on climate because so much was being done at the state level by various governors, a lot was being done at municipal levels, and of course there's still the possibility that once briefed on climate science by people who are knowledgeable, a President Trump will realize that he doesn't want to be the only leader of any country on earth that doesn't understand the importance of the issue. MARTIN: Right. But he does seem to be, I don't know if it's campaign rhetoric or not, he says this climate change is a hoax, and he's talking about getting coal mines reopened and fired up again as power a source. Is he one of the horsemen of the apocalypse, in your view? MAY: I'm hoping not. This issue is too important to assume that. I mean I do remember when President Ronald Reagan used to say that acid rain was caused by ducks, and other congressmen and senators from the Ohio valley thought that acid rain was a plot invented by Canadians so we could sell hydro power into the US, that's all true, and yet former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney somehow convinced Ronald Reagan to take real action on acid rain. So we mustn't assume that the Canadian-US relationship on issues doesn't make a difference if Prime Minister Trudeau is able to create a good working relationship with a future President Trump. I know it's hard to get those words out without cringing, but it could happen, and we could play a positive role in making sure he understands the issue. Otherwise, we do know that he'll reopen pressure for the Keystone pipeline. Traditionally the Liberal party and Trudeau favoured the Keystone pipeline. This is very bad news for climate, because when the price of oil is below $80 a barrel, the US environmental impact statement on this issue said, look, when the price of oil is over $80 a barrel, Keystone pipeline won't encourage new oil sands developments, they would happen anyway. But when the price of oil is below $80 a barrel, building Keystone will drive up emissions in Canada, which is something that Prime Minister Trudeau says he doesn't want increasing emissions, so the Keystone pipeline politics are going to get back I predict front burner very soon. MARTIN: I think you're probably right. Quickly help us preview this UN Cop 22 that starts this week, I guess. What are your expectations from that? Is this one of those not such a big deal conferences between some of the big deal conferences you've seen in the past? MAY: Well, the working first week of the conference that's already started, the high level where the ministerial participation starts on Monday, it's a very important COP because the Paris agreement which was negotiated less than a year ago in December of last year has already come into legal effect. It came into legal effect last week. This is extraordinary when you consider that the Kyoto protocol took eight years to come into legal binding effect. Paris agreement has come into legal binding effect. So this meeting is both setting up the working mechanisms under the Paris agreement and continuing the work under the UN framework convention on climate change. They have on the agenda as always questions of financing, questions of making sure there's going to be a what's called global stock taking to look at whether the commitments governments have made are enough to meet the Paris agreement's goals. Newsflash, nowhere close, we're nowhere close to where we need to be. I mean that's just the science, that's just crunching the numbers. But it is an important COP, and I'm looking forward to seeing Canada again, under Catherine McKenna as minister, playing a leading role there in Marrakesh. MARTIN: Okay. Well, Elizabeth May, it's always a pleasure chatting with you. Thanks very much. MAY: Thanks, Don. MARTIN: Coming up, we discuss some much hyped exodus from Trump's America, and ask a leading expert if there's an actual chance of these refugees fleeing from the south. Please stay with us.

The impact of the U. S. presidential election on Alberta's climate leadership plan is unknown, according to Alberta's Minister of Environment and Parks Shannon Phillips. "Mr. Trump has said a lot of things and there are a lot of hypotheticals right now ," said Phillips in a telephone press conference from the United Nations climate change meetings in Marrakech, Morocco. "From our perspective there's been a lot of unknowns ... what is known is that we have already written our climate plan (and) we did not write it around an ambitious American climate agenda, we wrote it around business as usual." According to Phillips, the international community is moving towards focusing on renewable energy. "There is so much momentum around global action on climate ," said Phillips. Phillips gave the example of attending a meeting where the U. S. secretary of energy, Ernest Moniz, spoke, and he said there is $23 trillion in private investment potential for energy efficiency in the developing world alone. "So many of these things are moving forward in terms of the business consensus ," said Phillips. "What that means for us in Alberta, is that we have an enormous amount of opportunity, as soon as we price carbon we open up investment opportunities that were not there previously." Phillips has spent her time during the international climate change meetings engaging with the World Bank and other investors aboard. "We've really focused on using this time to meet with investors (and) folks from international financial institutions to lay that groundwork for the tremendous amount of investment that we know will flow into Alberta ," she said. According to Philips, even subnational governments in the U. S. are moving towards renewable energy technology and investment. "What you see in the United States is similar to what you are now seeing in Canada, which is sub-national jurisdictions really (seeing) the value of moving towards renewable ," she said. "The world is much larger than one election in one country (and) the opportunities are significant throughout the globe ... we need to make sure that we are positioning ourselves for those investments." However, at home, the Wildrose Party has called on the Alberta Government to have two members of the Oil Sands Advisory Group (OSAG) fired, because they believe they are campaigning against the province's energy sector. OSAG co-chair Tzeporah Berman tweeted on Nov. 13 that "Decarbonization means managed decline ," in response to a tweet about how pipelines can increase production capacity. OSAG member Karen Mahon, sent a fundraising email to supporters on Nov. 12 titled, "Stopping pipelines is now more important than ever." "At a time when Albertans are hurting so badly, this parade of attacks on our province's energy industry is unhelpful, hurtful and downright wrong ," said Don Mac-Intyre, Wildrose shadow minister for electricity and renewables. "I'm calling on the premier to show some leadership and direct these folks to the exit." ymayne @postmedia. com Twitter: @YasminMayne \</doc>

Halfway through the title track of A Common Truth, the haunting second album from cellist Rebecca Foon's Saltland project, a seismic drone tears through the sombre meditation. As the roar cycles back and intensifies, it sounds as if the Earth is shuddering to its core. It's a sound that transcends Foon's artistic life. A mainstay of the communal avant-garde scene aligned with Montreal's Constellation Records, Foon has brought majestic melancholy and hope to groups including elegant chamber collective Esmerine and social-justice firebrands Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra. She has also brought her passion for environmental activism to initiatives such as Pathway to Paris, a collective fighting for solutions to climate change, which she cofounded with Jesse Paris Smith (Patti's daughter). Saltland's exploratory 2013 debut, I Thought it Was Us But it Was All of Us, had an open heart and a green mind, with a village of guests nourishing gentle compositions inspired by climate change and urban environmentalism. The tone and discourse are more urgent on A Common Truth, whose complex darkness is almost entirely derived from Foon's cello. "On the first Saltland record, the themes were similar, but the energy was lighter," Foon said recently. "I'm in a different space on this record. Now when I think about climate change, I think: Are we facing the end of the world? Are we facing extinction? We can change the course, but we are in the time right now to change the course. "It's a bit more black and white for me, where we're at now. I definitely feel the state of emergency we're in, and wanted to express that." The alarm bells sounded on A Common Truth are intensified at a time when progress on environmental issues is under threat by the new White House administration, but the gravitas owes as much to Foon's growing confidence as it does to current affairs. "I made that first Saltland album almost as a challenge to see if I could," Foon said. "It was a challenge just to write songs and sing and write lyrics.... I didn't think of myself as a singer at all. I don't know if I even do now. But before, I felt like I didn't even know what my voice sounded like. Now I know. It's like if you've never looked in the mirror." On A Common Truth, Foon's mesmeric planetary prayers drift on slowly cresting waves of natural and processed cello, whose kaleidoscopic sounds were heightened by Jace Lasek of neo-psychedelic wizards the Besnard Lakes. Foon's other main collaborator on A Common Truth is less expected, unless you happened to be at La Sala Rossa in 2005 for a one-off show in which the Suoni Per Il Popolo experimental-music festival partnered Foon's Mile End Ladies String Auxiliary with rebel violinist Warren Ellis (Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Grinderman, Dirty Three). The inspired pairing led to an enduring friendship. Foon and Ellis were among the performers at the flagship Pathway to Paris concerts in December 2015, held at Paris's Le Trianon during the United Nations Climate Change Conference and also featuring the likes of Thom Yorke and Patti Smith. "A lot of this album was written in the lead-up to that conference, and (dealt with) my worries that the nations weren't going to come together to create the Paris Agreement," Foon said. "(Ellis) was aware of my work and the themes on this album, and was very committed to them as well." Foon and Ellis built up A Common Truth's four instrumentals with an ocean separating them, but they may as well have been in the same room. There's a rare telepathy between the weeping violin and cello, made possible by artists more concerned with emotion than technical precision. "When we were playing at the Sala, we were talking about intonation and he said, 'You know, intonation is just relative.' I was blown away that he said that as a string player, because I was always so worried about playing in tune and so obsessed about intonation. "He totally twisted my anxieties and put them flat on their head. That's why I love collaborating with Warren in a nutshell: all my angst and anxiety with music, he'll just flip it around and be like, 'But look at this!' "His way of seeing things is extremely refreshing ... and he has an ability to tap into an emotional depth with music that's unbelievable. There aren't many people who can do that." Foon said Saltland concerts featuring Ellis are a possibility, although Cave's main creative foil has a calendar year full of commitments with the Bad Seeds (including a sold-out Metropolis show on May 29). Foon is prepared to perform her new material solo, although her own calendar is hardly blank. Among her other activism projects - including the Sustainability Solutions Group and the conservation organization Junglekeepers - Pathway to Paris is an ongoing concern, with Foon promising a major initiative for 2017. After all, the Paris Agreement may be signed, but results aren't a given. "I'm very fearful (for the agreement's future) but, coming back to the intonation idea, you have to flip things on their head. I don't think we can rely on national governments - I think we need to inspire cities to have the power," Foon said. "If cities make plans to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to the Paris targets or beyond, it's extremely powerful. And then you're actually seeing the world change. "Imagine a city that is not reliant on fossil fuels - so cool. Now imagine a lot of cities that are not reliant on fossil fuels. "The climate change problem offers an enormous opportunity to flip things on their head - to stimulate the green economy, to make resilient, beautiful, creative cities. If we can move quickly, I think we could create a really cool world."

Thursday's forecast calls for sunny skies and a high of 25 C. It should be a splendid day indeed. Not here in Edmonton, silly - in Marrakech, Morocco. That's where a select group of just 225 of Canada's top climate change thinkers - led by federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna - are gathered this week, along with a cosy crowd of 25,000 other politicians, bureaucrats and activists from around the globe, for COP22 . COP22 may tell us the planet is frying, but for these jet-hopping climate change campaigners, it seems there is nothing more abhorrent than staying home and participating via video conference. The latest United Nations climate change extravaganza, to be documented in excruciating detail by more than 1,000 observer organizations and an army of 700 journalists, aims to build on the work done at COP21 in Paris, in December 2015. That's where 195 nations agreed to sign on to a long-term plan to curb carbon emissions in hopes of limiting any rise in global temperatures this century to no more than two degrees Celsius. If COP22 bears any resemblance to its predecessors, there will be grand speeches, urgent warnings, angry calls to action and the usual sanctimonious lectures directed at perceived climate change knuckle draggers. Canada used to be one of the biggest bad boys in this regard, but with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowing to impose a national carbon tax, we're offthe hook this time. China, the world's biggest emitter by far, continues to build new coal-fired power plants at a rapid clip and has not agreed to cap its emissions until 2030. But western eco-activists are reluctant to criticize China since it is also rolling out renewables at a faster pace than any other country. As for the U.S., it's heading straight to the penalty box this time, after leading the global climate change campaign for years. With president-elect Donald Trump (who dubs climate change a "hoax") set to assume office in January, and promising to roll back President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan, many fear the world's second-biggest emitter will ditch its Paris commitments. French President Francois Hollande voiced those fears Tuesday, urging the U.S. to honour the "irreversible" Paris agreement, while lavishing praise on Obama's past climate change policies. Whether Hollande's admonitions have any impact on Trump remains to be seen. But in truth, the much-ballyhooed Paris accord was never more than an aspirational document. Although McKenna and others claim it is "legally binding," there are no enforceable penalties for countries that fail to meet their emissions reductions targets. Nor will there be. That's because the world runs on fossil fuels and will for decades to come. Renewable energy advocates don't want to admit that, of course. Hence the constant cheerleading around heavily subsidized wind and solar power. In its annual World Energy Outlook released Wednesday, the Paris-based agency says it expects global oil consumption to peak no sooner than 2040, almost a quarter century from now. Natural gas consumption is expected to jump 50 per cent. While demand for oil to power the world's one billion vehicles may eventually start to slow, the IEA, which provides energy data and research for 29 member countries, says other sources of energy demand are likely to more than offset any drop in gasoline consumption. "The difficulty of finding alternatives to oil in road freight, aviation and petrochemicals means that, up to 2040, the growth in these three sectors alone is greater than the growth in global oil demand," the IEA says. On the investment side, the IEA also expects the traditional fossil fuel sectors to attract the biggest share of capital spending globally. "A cumulative $44 trillion US in investment is needed in global energy supply in our main scenario, 60 per cent of which goes to oil, gas and coal extraction and supply, including power plants using these fuels," it says, "and nearly 20 per cent to renewable energies. An extra $23 trillion is required for improvements in energy efficiency." Compared to the 2000-2015 period, when close to 70 per cent of total energy investment was focused on fossil fuels, this represents a marked decline. But once again, the IEA notes, that decline is gradual and fossil fuels will continue to attract the lion's share of investment. The bottom line: yes, the global energy system is changing. But change is likely to be slower than many expect and it may even stall once Trump is in office. HYPERLINK mailto:glamphier@postmedia.com glamphier@postmedia.com \</doc>

NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - June 22, 2016) - On November 29th, the U.S. Fund for UNICEF will host its annual UNICEF Snowflake Ball. The event will commemorate UNICEF's 70th anniversary and honor UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Katy Perry and Philanthropist Moll Anderson for their extraordinary commitment to put children first. Global superstar Katy Perry will receive the Audrey Hepburn Humanitarian Award for her work as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in support of the world's most vulnerable children. She has served in this role since 2013, with a special focus on engaging young people in UNICEF's work, traveling to some of the poorest and most remote regions in Madagascar and Vietnam to bring awareness to UNICEF's child protection, education and health programs. In December 2015, at the time of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, she recorded a unique weather report to call for action on climate change and bring attention to the devastating effects of the phenomenon on children. In October 2013, she joined in UNICEF's celebration of the International Day of the Girl Child, lending her hit song "Roar" to the soundtrack of a new PSA to inspire girls and help them become tomorrow's champions. Through her continued work with UNICEF, Perry is a tireless champion for children, working to improve the lives of children and adolescents around the world. Award-winning television personality, author, and philanthropist Moll Anderson will receive the Spirit of Compassion Award for her enduring commitment to make the world a better place for children.

BRACEBRIDGE - Elizabeth May gave her Muskoka audience a reality check. The last 10 years under Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government has severely damaged Canada's environmental policy and approach to tackling climate change, she said. "As a country we've punched above our weight only when fighting for the fossil fuels lobby," said May. The Green Party of Canada leader and MP spoke at the 2016 Muskoka Summit on the Environment on Saturday, May 28 at the Rene M. Caisse Theatre in Bracebridge. Canada still has "an opportunity to save itself from climate change," but it will need to take a brave leadership role, May said. As part of the Canadian delegation, May attended the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December. She left feeling optimistic. Holding up drafts of the Paris agreement to the full auditorium, May said the deal got stronger and better each day. The final product is legally binding and countries can only change their targets if they set higher standards, she said. "Peer pressure and global shaming are the ways to assure countries meet their targets," May said. Canada still has a lot of work to do if it wants to meet its goals, but May thinks it's possible with cooperation and determination: 1. Don't let politics get in the way "Canada can do much, much more than what's being considered (from the Paris Agreement)," said May. "We shouldn't limit our hopes or expectations to what we think (Prime Minister) Justin Trudeau can do politically. It's time to start doing what's necessary." 2. Put a price on carbon The Green Party is in support of a fee and dividend carbon system, where companies pay for emissions and the money is distributed to Canadians. There are other options too, like cap and trade or carbon tax, but at the end of the day, May just wants a system that works for the environment. "What matters is we stop subsidizing fossil fuels and put a price on carbon that's meaningful," she said. 3. Transition to a fossil fuel-free energy grid by 2025 Better distribution of hydro-electrical power between provinces is one place to start, said May. Opportunities exist between hydro-rich British Columbia and coal-dependent Alberta, for example. "Then we can focus our efforts on transitioning to electric vehicle-based transportation and move further away from a fossil fuel economy," said May. 4. Get information about climate change and environmental policies in front of Canadians "Mainstream media has to catch up with the game-changing movements all around the world," said May, suggesting the public send letters to the editor as often as possible, in response to news stories. She also said to send in suggestions and ideas to Environment Canada. When it comes to convincing others to be more environmentally responsible, May said, "Create a narrative and tell a story. Explain how we fought acid rain, for example. Tell them how many new jobs the green energy sector can supply." \</doc>

Albertas Minister of Economic Development and Trade defended his governments climate plan on Wednesday as people in industry voiced fears that the carbon emissions reduction strategy would hurt the provinces competitiveness. Deron Bilous, who is also deputy government house leader, was responding to questions after his speech to a joint Society of Petroleum Engineers Calgary Section and Economic Society of Calgary lunch. Economic Development Minister Deron Bilous. One questioner expressed concern about the plan to phase out coal-fired power, which is cheap, and dramatically increase reliance on costly renewable power sources: So how can you say that youre concerned with competitiveness when you are doing things that will radically increase one of the input costs for a lot of industries? According to Alberta Utilities Commission data for 2015, 51 per cent of Albertas power came from coal, 39 per cent from natural gas, five per cent from wind, three per cent from biomass and two per cent from hydroelectric projects. Contributions from wind and solar power were negligible. Bilous said 12 of Albertas 18 coal-fired power plants were set to phase out by 2030 because of federal regulations, and the province fast-tracked the phase-out of the remaining six. He said the province hired Terry Boston, a retired U.S. power industry executive who has helped several U.S. states transition off coal-fired power, to ensure consumers arent gouged. He transitioned 26,000 megawatts off of coal to renewables, and did it successfully, and did it in a way that consumers and industry werent gouged, the minister said. Gas to grow I appreciate that coal is the cheapest form of energy.... But I do think we are not only in Canada but worldwide seeing a trend away from coal-fired electricity, Bilous said. And the cost of renewables has over the past 10 years come down significantly. I think they're going to continue to come down. In an interview with the Bulletin afterwards, Bilous made it clear that gas will be a big winner in the provinces climate plan. He pointed out the share of the provinces electricity generated from gas is to grow to 70 per cent by 2030 from 39 per cent in 2015. The remaining 30 per cent of Alberta power is to come from renewables by 2030. Natural gas is absolutely a critical part of our phasing out coal, he said. Natural gas will remain a priority industry for us, not only within Alberta to heat our homes, to turn on the lights, but [were] also looking at opportunities to get our natural gas to other markets. He added: Natural gas is a key component to our climate leadership plan. And frankly, it is absolutely a key component to us meeting our electricity needs. Trump the exception? U.S. President Donald Trump has indicated Washington will abandon its commitments under the international agreement reached at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. Bilous replied the Trump administrations plans are in contrast with the direction of some U.S. states, Canadas federal government and many other countries, including China. He said Ottawa isnt only sticking to its pledge under the Paris agreement, but is also pressing on with its internal carbon strategy. The federal government has made it clear it will impose its own carbon mitigation rules on provinces that dont come up with their own plan. In fact, Bilous said the threat of having a federal plan imposed on the province was one reason Alberta adopted its own plan: We very much wanted a plan to be created here in Alberta that was Alberta specific. HYPERLINK http://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2016/11/11/trump-win-opens-way-china-take-climate-leadership-/ DOB, Nov. 11, 2016 ). Long synonymous with coal-fired power, China is the worlds biggest greenhouse gas emitter. Interestingly, a year ago I was speaking at another conference. And of course people said:  Why are we phasing out coal? Why are we imposing an emissions cap and doing all of these things when of course China has all these coal-fired facilities? Bilous recalled. And at that point I said China has already flagged to us that climate and the environment is a priority for them. The difference between a country like China and [a] country like Canada, is that when they decide they are changing direction, they can pivot on the dime, he said of the Communist dictatorship. He noted China plans HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/world/asia/china-renewable-energy-investment.html?_r=0 to spend about $360 billion HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/world/asia/china-coal-power-plants-pollution.html cancelled plans for And so I think what we're seeing is that the world is looking at doing their part, Bilous told his Calgary business audience. He noted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acknowledged Albertas climate plan is part of the reason the federal government recently approved two Canadian oil export pipelines the Trans Mountain expansion and the Line 3 replacement project. Similarly, he believes adopting the climate plan will help the province curry favour in greenish jurisdictions south of the border: There are many states in the U.S. where climate is still a priority. \Â£6 There are a number of key states that we do the bulk of our trading with, that we have been engaging with, and will continue to engage with, who are very interested in what we are doing on climate, and want to trade with us knowing that we are taking action. Finally, industry said yes, this is something we can live with, and that will make us globally more competitive, he said. Producer reaction to the plan was generally positive ( HYPERLINK http://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2015/11/23/industry-shows-strong-initial-support-new-provinci/ DOB, Nov. 23, 2015 ). One questioner argued that Ontario will gain a huge competitive advantage over Alberta due to the latters future electricity costs and carbon costs. Bilous said that even with its carbon levy, Alberta still is the lowest tax jurisdiction in Canada with no provincial sales tax, no payroll tax and no health care premiums. \</doc>

Canada's overall greenhouse gas emissions will likely peak before 2020, says a new report, but achieving the country's 2030 targets is going to require much more work. The independent analysis from Decarbonization Pathways Canada comes as federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna joins an international climate summit in Marrakech, Morocco, where the mechanics of last year's Paris climate accord are being negotiated. Delegates at this year's UN-sponsored COP22 heard Monday that global CO2 emissions have flattened out over the past three years, even as the planet appears poised to record another heat record in 2016. The World Meteorological Organization released preliminary data through October that showed global temperatures are 1.2 C above pre-industrial levels. The good-news, bad-news story applies to Canada as well, where emissions are projected to top out at about 720 million tonnes by the end of this decade. But they won't easily be clawed down to Canada's international 2030 commitment of 522 million tonnes, given the lack of further policy measures and a growing economy. "As current policy flatlines past 2020 and GHGs rise with the economy, the NDC (target) gap widens," economists Dave Sawyer and Chris Bataille write in the policy paper commissioned by four major environmental organizations. The escalating national floor price on carbon announced by the Trudeau government last month knocks only 18 million tonnes off Canada's 170-million tonne gap in 2030, according to their analysis. But that gap potentially could be cut in half - by another 68 million tonnes - if Canada can realize emissions trading credits under the Paris Accord. Delegates in Marrakech say Canada's negotiators over the past week have been heavily focused on Article 6 of the Paris agreement, which addresses emissions trading between countries. Quebec and Ontario have joined a cap-and-trade market with California, and the policy paper says GHG "imports" by Canada's two largest provinces could account for 68 million tonnes of reduced emissions in Canada's ledger by 2030. However "the modalities to allow such transfers to be fully recognized have yet to be worked out," says a footnote in the analysis - which is what Canadian negotiators are addressing at COP22 . A spokesperson for McKenna noted Monday from Marrakech that the minister "played a leadership role" in pushing the Article 6 chapter in Paris last December. "Market-based solutions are certainly part of the equation to grow a cleaner global economy," McKenna said in an emailed statement. \</doc>

As politicians across the country worry about the consequences of a national carbon tax on family incomes, many experts say the much-touted carbon market in Quebec has so far had little effect on changing citizens' habits. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently announced all provinces will need to set a baseline price for carbon by 2018, either with a tax or through a carbon-market system similar to the one Quebec has adopted. Ontario is set to join Quebec's carbon market - which is tied to California's - but so far the program has not had the desired outcome, say prominent experts. "The carbon market, to this day, has had zero effect on the habits of Quebecers - I am quite ready to say that," said Pierre-Olivier Pineau, chair in energy sector management at HEC Montreal. Jean-Thomas Bernard, invited professor in economics and social sciences at the University of Ottawa, agrees. The market "doesn't seem to be restrictive enough," Bernard said. "We're not talking about significant price changes (of carbon credits)." However, Quebec Environment Minister David Heurtel said the money collected thus far from the carbon market is allowing the province to make investments that are making a difference. He gave the example of recent electric vehicle sales in Quebec. "There is a transformation, a modernization of Quebec's economy, a changing of our attitudes," he said. "People are more aware." Companies in Quebec must buy the right to produce more than 25,000 tonnes of CO2 a year, in the form of carbon credits. The provincial government offers businesses a certain percentage of credits free, while the remaining ones are purchased at auctions held four times a year. During the last auction, the price of carbon was $16.45 a tonne, which translates to an increase of slightly more than three cents a litre at the pump for consumers. With the recent drop in oil prices, however, the hike has gone relatively unnoticed. Moreover, companies have in large part deserted the market altogether in 2016. The number of credits purchased on the market fell from 11 million at the beginning of the year, to one million in May, only to increase slightly to 3.5 million last August. "That shows there is a surplus of credits right now," said Bernard. Pineau said buyers think the system will fail or that it's worth waiting. The California Chamber of Commerce has challenged the market in court, arguing it is an illegal tax. Additionally, Gov. Jerry Brown hasn't yet been able to convince state politicians to renew the market beyond 2020. Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne maintains her province will participate in its first carbon credit auction in January. She estimated the impact of Ontario joining the market will be an increase in citizens' heating bills by about $5 a month and a jump of about four cents a litre at the pump. Pineau said he believes companies will regain confidence in the market and that the eventual scarcity of credits will increase their price. He added the government should be honest with Quebecers and tell them that even though the market isn't technically a "tax," it will still increase the cost of products rich in carbon. Citizens will have to adjust their behaviour accordingly, he said. "If we say to Quebecers they will have a new cost tied to the price of carbon, which is permanent and will increase over the years, then that sends a different message to people," he said. "It says the (price increase) is structural and that therefore we need to adjust." \</doc>

As if we needed more proof of the breathtaking media double standard at play in covering Justin trudeau compared to Stephen Harper, the overwhelming underreaction to news trudeau has adopted Harper's greenhouse gas reduction targets proves the point beyond all doubt. Where is the media/activist outrage, considering how hot and bothered so many have been for so long about Harper's so-called unambitious emission targets, which are now, officially, trudeau's targets? If I had a $1 for every time I've read some pundit screeching about Harper's unambitious targets over the past few years, I could afford to eat at the fine French restaurants senior environment Canada officials gorged their way through last december in paris at the united Nations ' climate change conference . Where are they now? The news the trudeau liberals, having previously attacked Harper's targets as inadequate, have now adopted them, came out Sunday on CtV's Question period. this was huge news to anyone following the climate file. more so because the next day trudeau was in New york hosting a uN meeting, prior to his speech to the uN General assembly tuesday. this would be the same uN that is the global arbiter of international climate change negotiations, including the climate treaty talks in paris last december to which trudeau dragged a Canadian delegation that was twice the size of the american one and three times that of the uK's. proclaiming "Canada is back", we now know trudeau really meant to say, "Canada is back ... to Harper's targets." So, where's the outrage? Where are the thundering editorials and columns? Why aren't environmental activists who regularly went nutso over the alleged inadequacy of Harper's targets not demonstrating in the streets at this shameless, cynical climbdown by trudeau? Where are the Fossil Fool awards for trudeau that were mockingly awarded to Harper? Cue the crickets. unlike others now revealing themselves to be in the bag for trudeau, Green party leader elizabeth may, at least, has condemned the liberal flip-flop, in a strong statement headlined: "liberals cave on climate -leaving weak Conservative targets in place." "this news is nothing short of a disaster for the climate," may said. "minister mcKenna always said the Harper-era target for greenhouse gas emissions -among the weakest in the industrialized world -would be 'the floor,' and prime minister trudeau claimed we would 'meet or exceed' those previous targets. It is clear that the Harper target is incompatible with the paris agreement -to avoid going above 2 degrees Celsius and strive to hold global average temperature to no more than ... 1.5 degrees Celsius, above what they were before the Industrial revolution. yet today, minister mcKenna abandoned any real commitment to avoid 1.5 degrees or even 2 degrees, even though her leadership in paris helped get the treaty to embrace this necessary long-term goal." even david Suzuki, who once called for jailing Harper for inter-generational climate crimes against humanity, noted in a Huffington post column last month before trudeau made the liberal adoption of Harper's targets official, that, for all his rhetoric, trudeau hadn't changed Harper's numbers. but since the current media narrative is that, unlike Harper, trudeau is no climate denier, it's like a tree falling in the forest that no one hears. We're supposed to believe the tree never fell. !@COPYRIGHT=\Â£9 2016 Osprey Media Group Inc. All rights reserved. \</doc>

Saturday marked the first anniversary of Pope Francis's encyclical on the environment, Laudato Si', on Care for our Common Home. The Holy See released the encyclical as world leaders prepared for the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21). It took place in Paris last December. The encyclical had a significant impact on the discussions there. COP21 drew attention to our moral duty to hear both the "cry of the earth and the cry of the poor." The conference received like-minded statements from the heads of other religious traditions. For the first time, world leaders agreed to limit carbon emissions to safe levels and to help poor nations affected by climate change. We must confront climate change for what it is - an environmental crisis requiring urgent action. We must alter our behaviour. As Pope Francis stated in the encyclical, "As often occurs in periods of deep crisis which require bold decisions, we are tempted to think that what is happening is not entirely clear ... things do not look that serious and the planet could continue as it is for some time." "Such evasiveness serves as a licence to carrying on with our present lifestyles and models of production and consumption." Our national and provincial governments must take bold action. We must build an economy that addresses our moral duty to care for the poor. Future generations need a habitable planet. In the encyclical, Pope Francis affirms those who are committed to caring for God's creation in our homes and in our parishes. For the past 10 years, John Dorner has served as the volunteer co-ordinator of Creation Care Ministry within the Archdiocese of Ottawa. He promotes awareness of today's ecological crisis and the means by which parishes and individuals may heal the earth and build hope for the future. Since the release of Laudato Si', the Archdiocese of Ottawa has posted on its website a resource entitled Care for God's Creation - A Guide for Parishes. It provides many ideas for prayer, education, action and advocacy, which parishes, families and individuals can apply to help build a new culture consistent with the call to care for our common home. Many of our parishes in the Ottawa archdiocese are committed to building the new culture called for by Pope Francis in his encyclical. Most parishes have reduced their carbon emissions by changing to lowenergy lighting. Several parishes have implemented changes based on energy efficiency audits and "green audits" provided by the interfaith group Faith and the Common Good. This year, Sheng Shen (Holy Spirit) Chinese Parish and Paroisse Sainte-Genevi\'e8ve together with St. Luke's Anglican Church received the Greening Sacred Space Award. The award recognizes the inspiring work of faith communities that show care for God's creation. Ottawa's St. Joseph and Orleans' Divine Infant parishes were among recipients of the award in previous years. So much is possible. For example, last year Holy Cross Parish started a sustainable organic garden initiative that provides food to those in need. This intergenerational project involves seniors from the parish and students from nearby Holy Cross Elementary School and St. Patrick High School. As archbishop, I encourage Ottawa parishes to find ways to develop a new culture that looks after the poorest and most vulnerable peoples on earth. We are interconnected with all life. Our lifestyles matter. What we purchase; how we travel; how we manage our energy, our air, our water, our soil and our waste have an impact on creation. Laudato Si' - On Care for our Common Home is an exceptional, easy-toread document. I invite you to read it and to live out its message. - Terrence Prendergast is the Archbishop of the Catholic Archdiocese of Ottawa !@COPYRIGHT=\Â£9 2016 Sun Media Corporation.

Richard Cannings had just left a rather heated question period in Ottawa when the Trail Times talked with him on Wednesday. The day's talking point, Bill C-4, was up for a vote that afternoon. That was all quite fitting, considering the South Okanagan-West Kootenay MP was first welcomed to Trail as a federal-hopeful during a dinner at the Local 480 hall last fall. On that occasion, the Canadian and American labour leader, Leo Gerard, (President of United Steelworkers) introduced the NDP candidate to local constituents. Now, one year into his federal term, the MP was voting to repeal Bill C-4, which Cannings says was union bashing legislation passed by the former government. "The Liberal government is very popular and was elected with a lot of promises," Cannings began. "We are the progressive opposition so my role and the rest of our caucus is really to remind them of those promises. In some cases, we've been quite happy, today we are voting on Bill C-4, which is some really regressive anti-labour laws the Conservatives passed ... that made it more difficult for people to form a union and easier for companies to disband unions," he added. "Basically it was harassing unions to do so much paperwork they wouldn't have time for anything else, paperwork for things above what any other group or public organization has to do. The Liberals and NDP were very keen on getting rid of it, and so I am happy about that." After winning the SOWK riding with 37 per cent of the vote last Oct. 19, Cannings' ensuing first year has been a bit of a roller coaster ride with long and challenging days. But he wouldn't have it any other way. "On a personal level it's a very steep learning curve, a series of learning curves, really," he shared. "Whether it's working in the riding, the House of Commons, or on committees - there is a big manual for all of it, but you really have to learn by doing," he continued. "That's been very interesting for me, I've enjoyed every minute of it ... every hour is different and there is never a dull moment." Some days are more stressful than others, but at the end of each day, the job is a privilege, said Cannings. "It's challenging and a long work day but I really have enjoyed the year." And with the highs, like the Wednesday repealing of a bill, he says there are some low points as well. Lack of progress on climate change and climate action is a concern Cannings hears day after day in the SOWK riding. "I've been disappointed in the government's response to that," he explained. "How slow it's taking and that they are actually moving forward on the old Conservative Action Plan - we aren't going to meet our Paris targets, which is really unacceptable." Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rode a wave of popularity to France last winter for the 21st United Nations Climate Change Conference . There was plenty of fanfare and selfies mixed in with promises on Canada's future gas emission targets. Since then, Cannings says the matter has fizzled. "There was a surge of optimism early on, I was happy to see Canada go to Paris in such a positive way," he said. "But very disappointed how slow things are going and how really mediocre the Liberals' goals and aspirations are - we are disappointed but still holding out hope that things will pick up." Another pressing topic especially looking into next year, is softwood lumber. "This is a very big issue in the forestry industry in our riding and across the country," he said. "Again the Liberals had a full year to do something. As time goes on it gets harder to get a deal with this crazy election in the States." \~ \</doc>

A United Nations department has barred a Canadian online news outlet from attending next month's Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) in Morocco. Earlier this month, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) secretariat informed The Rebel, the right wing news and opinion platform published by political commentator Ezra Levant, it was rejecting the outlet's application to send a producer and a reporter to COP22 on the grounds that "advocacy media outlets do not qualify for accreditation." The Rebel had made arrangements for its Alberta bureau chief Sheila Gunn Reid and producer Meaghan MacSween to be in Marrakesh when the conference takes place November 7 to 18. Their applications for media accreditation to UNFCCC were denied and an application for a cameraman is yet to receive a response. "The UN can't stand having three skeptical journalists out of 3,000 journalists they're accrediting - most of whom love the UN's global warming agenda," Levant said in an interview. "What a perfect symbol of the UN and the global warming debate: intolerant of dissent, arrogant and undemocratic. And sad proof that the journalists who will be attending Marrakech are all UN-approved." In an October 6 letter requesting the UNFCCC reconsider its decision, a lawyer acting for The Rebel argues the publication is a bona fide news organization. "The Rebel brings to the Canadian community an intelligent and informed approach to everyday issues with a conservative focus," said Stuart Robertson of O'Donnell, Robertson and Sanfilippo. "It has a staff of 25 persons ... A member of the staff is accredited with the National Press Gallery at the Parliament of Canada." Robertson, who also works with Postmedia and the National Post, adds that The Rebel has an editorial policy that requires that subjects of its coverage be given an opportunity to provide a response in advance, and that it practises other editorial and legal protocols typical of a news organization. He also notes that Article 19 of the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights includes the right of all people to "receive and impart information and ideas through any media." The UNFCCC requires online media that apply for accreditation to have a street address and phone number, publish at least 60 per cent original news content or commentary and analysis, operate a website that is updated at least three times a week, and provide two sample articles from the month prior to application. The Rebel meets all those qualifications, and there is no mention of "advocacy journalism" on the UNFCCC's website. The UNFCCC did not reply to a request for comment. The international organization's rejection of the media start up has also prompted major concerns about freedom of expression and freedom of the press from three prominent Canadian advocacy groups: PEN Canada, Canadian Journalists for Free Expression (CJFE) and the Canadian Association of Journalists (CAJ). Both organizations have intervened and petitioned the UNFCCC on The Rebel's behalf. "(The Rebel) consistently publishes original news stories that often go otherwise untold," wrote CAJ President Nick Taylor-Vaisey in an October 13 letter to the UNFCCC. Taylor-Vaisey notes that CAJ is particularly concerned that outlet "was denied accreditation on the basis of publishing Â£dvocacy journalism,' a term the UNFCCC website fails to define (which raises a serious concern that the label is provided arbitrarily)." "The vagueness of the term Â£dvocacy media' makes its application highly discretionary in our view, and would encompass much of general news journalism," wrote Grace Westcott, Executive Director of PEN Canada, in an October 5 letter to the UNFCCC. "Opinion pages, special reports, indeed advocacy journalism appears in many of the world's great news sources, including The Guardian and The New York Times." Added Westcott: "We believe that the real or perceived biases of a news agency lie beyond the scope of the secretariat and are irrelevant to the question of whether a legitimately constituted news outlet is properly admitted to the Conference." "For a free press to function, governments and intergovernmental organizations must not deny access to events of public interest based on arbitrary or opaque determinations of a media outlet's size, audience or political leanings," said CJFE Executive Director Tom Henheffer in an October 14 letter to the UNFCCC Levant said he is grateful for the support. "I'm pleased that Canada's leading journalism NGOs have supported our cause," he said. "They know that if we can be blacklisted by the UN today, anyone can be blacklisted tomorrow." It's not the first time outside support has rallied around the conservative news organization when it has been barred from press events. Earlier this year, Alberta's NDP government banned The Rebel from attending media availabilities, but following public and professional uproar a spokesperson later admitted "it's clear we made a mistake" and accreditation was restored. .

What if travel isn't good for you? Or anyone? My mother and I were in the car; she peered upwards and saw a sliver of silver glinting in the sky. "Airplanes really are miracles, aren't they?" she mused. "Well, no. They're machines," I answered flatly. Silence. "You always have to burst my bubble, don't you?" As a boomer, my mum came of age during the mainstreaming of the idea that world travel made you a better person. Backpacking across Europe became a rite of passage in the 60s, leading to, the thinking went, a more cultured, enlightened generation; like so many, before she settled into a career and marriage, she spent a year abroad, visiting places like Italy, Spain, France and England. International air travel has only grown since then, with more than 100,000 flights heaving up from our earth and barrelling back down to it every day. To be "well-travelled" is still high praise, perhaps even more so now, when travel pictures make for valuable social media content: "Here I am sipping caf\'e9 au lait at Deux Maggots, where Hemingway used to write! I'm totes cultured! Au revoir, you Netflix-watching suckas!" Justin Trudeau's vow to bring 25,000 Syrian refugees to Canada has added a whole new layer of esteem to air travel: last month the media did story after story about airport preparations for the refugees' arrivals (including play areas for the kids) and featured Trudeau, bearing gifts of winter coats, welcoming a family right there in an arrival lounge. All of a sudden, airplanes and airports became part of the new (or renewed) story about Canadians as conscientious, benevolent world citizens. Air travel will get another boost (upgrade, if you will) from CBC TV's new program "Hello Goodbye," which features real-life stories about pathos and joy at Pearson International Airport. Long lines, delays, cancellations, missed connections, toddlers treated like suspected terrorists, new fees on everything from baggage to meals .... Never mind all that! Look at these people hugging and crying! I'm being cynical. But unlike my mother, I've come of age during the inconvenient truth and now, frankly, is the time for cynicism. All the pretty stories we've been told about flying - broader horizons! hands across the water! adventures! relaxation! - are obscuring an ugly reality. Here it is: the average Canadian driving a mid-sized car will generate about 6.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide in a year. One return flight from Toronto to London generates about 1.2 tonnes of carbon dioxide per passenger. So, that 16 hours in the sky is equal to the emissions of the 80-odd hours the average Canadian spends driving in a four-month period. That's not all: because of the specific mix of particles and gases planes emit, and the location of the emissions (i.e. the upper troposphere), the warming effect of plane emissions is 2.7 times that of regular carbon dioxide. So really, that return trip to London creates as much damage as you'd create in your car, going about your daily business, over a period of almost 11 months. And yet the air travel and shipping sector was ignored at the UN conference on climate change . As Elizabeth May noted, this was a major omission: if it were a country, this sector would be the 6th biggest polluter in the world, right behind Japan. But year after year, air travel increases, while ticket prices decrease. To reverse this trend, we need to make flying more expensive to curb demand, but we also need to stop investing so much social value in travel. We can be educated about, and compassionate toward, other parts of the world without loving them to death. Does travelling to Cuba to sit on a resort's beach really teach me about Cuban culture? Is it worth the havoc and destruction of climate change? Our economy has survived the loss of video stores, music stores, photo developers ... surely it can survive the loss of some airline jobs, or shift them to a vacation sector that's closer to home. But for that to work, we need to recognize the value of spending our holiday money here. To wit: my doctor told me about her family's summer trip to Ontario's cottage country that took place a year after they'd gone on an tropical island vacation. Her children raced around the tiny, no-frills A-frame cottage (a ladder! a sleeping loft!) and then down to the beach (a trampoline AND a slide IN THE WATER!). They ran breathlessly back to her: "Mom, this place is better than Bermuda!" Out of the mouths of babes. \</doc>

We don't often find ourselves in agreement with the Rebel Media, the online outfit run by right-wing firebrand Ezra Levant. But the decision to bar the outlet from attending a United Nations climate conference next month is seriously out of line. You don't have to agree with anything the Rebel says to be concerned about UN officials discriminating against media organizations on the basis of their political leanings. That's what appears to be happening here. The Rebel applied to have a three-person team accredited to cover a major climate meeting called COP22 to be held in Marrakech, Morocco. It was rejected on the grounds that "advocacy media outlets do not qualify for accreditation," and there's a strong suspicion that the Rebel's skeptical views on climate change have a lot to do with the decision. On the face of it, this makes little sense. Most media organizations practice some form of advocacy journalism and their views on the issues shouldn't disqualify them from attending. PEN Canada, Canadian Journalists for Free Expression and the Canadian Association of Journalists have all spoken out against this ill-judged UN decision. They're right. Excluding the Rebel sets a troubling precedent and the UN should change its mind. \</doc>

Re: A carbon tax isn't enough, Oct. 7. Canada's move to put a price on carbon and the support for this shown in a recent Nanos poll deserve applause. The Canadian government is fully aware of the consequences of climate change and acknowledges that something must be done soon. Like Canada, Taiwan has stepped up efforts in fighting climate change. Although not a member of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Taiwan voluntarily enacted the Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act in July 2015 to cut carbon emissions by 50 per cent below 2005 levels by 2050, making Taiwan one of the few countries to write its GHG reduction target into domestic law. This approach is in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. In her inaugural address in May 2016, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen made it clear that Taiwan will not be absent from the global efforts to mitigate climate change. Climate change is a global issue that knows no borders. It requires not only national, but global, solutions. As the UNFCCC charter states, "the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all countries ..." I sincerely urge the international community to support Taiwan's meaningful participation in the upcoming Marrakech COP22 meeting.

WASHINGTON, DC--(Marketwired - October 31, 2016) - Morocco's King Mohammed VI has concluded a tour of Rwanda and Tanzania, resulting in more than 40 bilateral agreements and marking the eastward expansion of Morocco's diplomatic efforts in Africa. The tour began on October 18 in Kigali, where King Mohammed VI met with Rwandan President Paul Kagame and chaired the signing of some 20 bilateral agreements, covering a broad range of sectors from agriculture to banking, to renewable energy and security cooperation. Among them was an agreement by Attijariwafa Bank, one of Morocco's biggest banks, to buy Rwandan bank Compagnie G\'e9n\'e9rale de Banque Limited (Cogebanque), a deal worth around $41 million. Morocco's Office Cherifien de Phosphate (OCP), the world's leading phosphate exporter, also committed to build a plant in Rwanda to "produce fertilizers adapted to local soils," as reported in Reuters. While in the country, King Mohammed VI also paid his respects to the victims of the Rwanda genocide at Kigali Genocide Memorial. On October 23, King Mohammed VI arrived for a three-day visit to Tanzania, where he and Tanzanian President John Pombe Magufuli chaired the signing ceremony of 22 bilateral agreements in the capital of Dar es Salaam. While the agreements focused on a range of economic and development issues, including infrastructure development and energy policy, the King also launched the building of the King Mohammed VI Mosque in response to a request by Mufti Sheikh Abu-Bakr Ibn Zubayr Benali, President of the National Muslim Council of Tanzania, offering 10,000 copies of the Koran to the Council. The gesture follows the King's commitment to expanding Morocco's tolerant and moderate form of Islam. The East Africa tour comes just a few months after King Mohammed VI announced his intention for Morocco to rejoin the African Union (AU). Some thirty countries have already voiced their support for Morocco's bid, including Benin, Gabon, Liberia, Senegal, Egypt, and Ghana, to name just a few. Another East Africa visit, to include Ethiopia -- the home of AU headquarters -- is scheduled to take place following the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP22 ), which the Kingdom is hosting in Marrakech from November 7-18. Since ascending the throne in 1999, the King has made Africa a foreign policy priority, visiting 35 African countries and signing more than 320 bilateral agreements. Beyond his many trips, in late 2013 the King established a program to train imams from across the continent. In March 2015 in Rabat, he formally opened the Mohammed VI Institute for the Training of Imams, Morchidines, and Morchidates, which has already welcomed students from Mali, Tunisia, and France, among other countries. In April 2015, Morocco signed a memorandum of understanding with the Millennium Challenge Corporation "with the goal of reducing poverty in Africa, including a focus on promoting adoption of new technologies and innovative business models to promote entrepreneurship." The King has also vowed to represent Africa's interests on climate change policy at the COP22 summit. Ambassador Michael Battle at the US Department of State has said of Morocco's diplomatic efforts, "Morocco is setting the pace by showing how African countries which are prosperous can be responsive to African countries which are in the process of becoming prosperous." In a recent article highlighting Morocco's growing role in Africa, J. Peter Pham, Director of the Atlantic Council's Africa Center, wrote, "US policymakers would do well to 'triangulate' -- or, at the very least, better coordinate -- their efforts with those of African allies like Morocco that are already providing home-grown solutions to the challenges faced by the continent, its nations, and their peoples today." "The United States is lucky to have such a close and longstanding friend and ally, Morocco, expanding its influence and relationships in Africa, a continent on the rise and likely to be at the crux of future policy debates," said former US Ambassador to Morocco Edward M. Gabriel. The Moroccan Amercan Center for Polcy (MACP) is a non-profit organization whose principal mission is to inform opinion makers, government officials, and interested publics in the United States about political and social developments in Morocco and the role being played by the Kingdom of Morocco in broader strategic developments in North Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East.

The forestry sector can play a key role in creating a sustainable future that makes better use of leftover material, converting it to alternative fuel sources. Susan Wood-Bohm was the keynote speaker at UNBC's Doug Little Memorial Lecture Thursday night, named BioCleantech: New Opportunities for Canada's Forest Sector. "BioCleantech which is the concept of using biological carbon - so carbon that comes from agriculture or forestry, or municipal waste, organic stream - to help us offset the carbon that comes from fossil fuels in a way that helps us to reduce our net greenhouse gas emissions in the country," Wood-Bohm explained before her presentation. That's one piece of Canada's unique greenhouse gas profile, she said, that can focus on three key areas to meet its emissions targets. "Those things are based on the fact we have a very large landmass so to get goods, services and people from one end of the country to another generates a huge amount of transportation emissions," said Wood-Bohm, as well as distributed heating models and ways to address industry demand for process heat. "We're looking for ways to heat ourselves up and we have very large space heat demands and there's some approaches that we can use some of which Prince George actually leads the country in," she said, pointing to UNBC's distributed heating model that connects its buildings to the wood pellet plant. "That (heating system) works incredibly well, not only in a fairly small application which is what (is) appropriate here, but in other places around the world we have cities that heat 200,000 plus homes using distributed energy," Wood-Bohm said. As a resource-based economy, heavy industry creates large demand for process heat. That's the kind of heat needed to get the oil out of the oil sands, she said, or the heat needed to make cement or in steel manufacturing. "We can address all of those needs with different biomass technology," said Wood-Bohm, executive director of Emissions Reduction Alberta's Biological GHG Management Program, Sustainably sourced biogenic carbon from municipal wastes, agriculture and forestry could play a critical role, she said, while also supporting rural economies. And, linking big data, GIS, drones and other hightech tools to the drive for non-fossil carbons brings both fresh opportunities and potential risks for forest ecosystems, timber communities and traditional pulp and dimensional labour markets, the UNBC press release noted. For her Prince George audience, Wood-Bohm said she was "pretty heavily focused" on residue, like slash piles or mill waste. While she believes the forestry community is ahead of the game and makes efficient use of mill waste for electrical energy generation, some companies have said they're open to other approaches. Locally, she said Canfor has "a really exciting opportunity" through a recent agreement with Licella to manufacture a biocrude and potentially make higher value use of the residue steam. "That would be using waste residue to manufacture something which looks and feels and behaves just like crude oil and can be refined in a conventional refinery to a suite of products including high-value commodity chemicals and fuel," she said. The proposed low-carbon district energy system for Vancouver offers a good example of the discussions that are happening, she said, calling it a neat idea with potential benefits that also presents real challenges. "Financing is really difficult to get when the policy appears to change," she said. "We're seeing the establishment of what should be long term policy signals and that then allows the company to have more financial flexibility to get the investments that they need to make change." She said the talk is timely as countries met in Morocco in this month following up on the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris earlier this year. "We've got this backdrop now of a global community that accepts that climate change is real and we need to do something about it if we don't want to deal with catastrophic impacts," she said, adding she especially thinks a younger generation - like UNBC students at her lecture - need to be part of the discussion. "They come with fresh ideas and a creativity that we sorely need and so I'm always happy to talk about what our work has shown as examples and to get their perspectives on how to move forward." \</doc>

Climate scientists say the Earth is in great danger of warming more than 2 C within two decades. There is increasing evidence of this warming, to the point that it could make living and farming conditions difficult even for the northern hemisphere and impossible for many coastal and low-lying areas. I greatly doubt that hundreds of scientists around the world are running a big climate change hoax, and think that human causes of global temperature increases need to be controlled. I would like to see a workable plan that won't destroy our lives economically while still making changes needed to halt climate change. We live in a market economy, and almost no one is selfsufficient in producing their own food, clothing and other necessities. Our economy is powered largely by using oil products. Most jobs today require oil products for whatever service they provide. The federal government recently announced its intention to impose a carbon tax on all Canadians, without saying how it will use the proceeds to combat climate change. Cap and trade proposals have also been discussed, but these only create a market for trading carbon credits and won't reduce warming. Is there any non-tax proposal to reduce warming? Is there a plan to actually reduce the carbon in the atmosphere? How can we transition to a non-fossil-fuel powered world and still ensure our economy doesn't die as a result? National governments have been discussing the problem for three decades and recently signed the COP22 David Bridger Saskatoon !@COPYRIGHT=\Â£9 2016 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved. \</doc>

The Liberal government will ratify the international Paris climate accord this fall even before it reaches a deal with the provinces and territories on how to meet the country's 2030 emissions target. Senior government sources told The Canadian Press that Canada will deposit its ratification at the United Nations before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau meets the premiers for a promised first ministers meeting on a climate plan that has been under discussion for months. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has been lobbying countries to ratify the Paris agreement before the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election in hopes of locking in the accord's provisions for at least four years. The landmark pact, which calls for limiting global temperature increases this century to well below two degrees Celsius, comes into legal force only after 55 countries representing 55 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions formally ratify. The timing of Trudeau's meeting with premiers is in flux, but it does not appear likely to take place before Canadian representatives are back at a UN climate conference in Marrakech, Morocco, Nov. 7-18, to discuss implementation of the Paris accord. The Marrakech meeting, known as COP22 , is not considered a leader-level summit and Trudeau will not attend, the sources said. Canada has a consistent history under successive Liberal and Conservative governments of making international carbon-cutting promises that it fails to honour, first under the 1997 Kyoto accord and then again under the 2009 Copenhagen agreement. The Liberal government of Jean Chretien ratified the original Kyoto climate accord despite having no idea how to meet emissions-cutting pledges, a fact later acknowledged by Chretien's former chief of staff, Eddie Goldenberg. !@COPYRIGHT=\Â£9 2016 Osprey Media Group Inc.

Environment Minister Catherine McKenna was forced to deal with four oil pipeline protesters who marched onto the stage during her speech to a conference Tuesday and refused to leave. The protesters were part of environmental activist group 350.org and were protesting the government's review of the proposed Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion, which would add a twin pipe to carry crude alongside the existing pipeline which runs between Alberta and British Columbia. The federal government is reviewing the pipeline proposal and a decision about it could be made as early as next month. "In 2015, the Liberal government got elected on promises to take climate action and they are failing on that promise," said Gabriel D'Astous, a spokesperson for 350.org. "We need ambitious leadership that starts with freezing tar sands expansion and committing to building a renewable energy economy that works for people and workers. The first step is to reject Kinder Morgan this December." The protesters peacefully took to the stage at McKenna's planned talk at the COP22 and the Canadian Context conference, held at the International Development Research Centre, with signs urging the government to reject the plans for the expanded pipeline. The conference was held by the Institute for Sustainable Development, a non-profit research organization that specializes in environmental initiatives. The four took to the stage and stood there, holding their placards, while McKenna continued with her planned remarks. McKenna later said that she would be happy to hear the concerns of the protesters. "I welcome the open dialogue," she said. She also said that "each pipeline project is assessed on its own merit" and the government has not yet made a decision about the proposed Kinder Morgan Pipeline yet as the assessments about its viability are still ongoing. !@COPYRIGHT=\Â£9 2016 Postmedia Network Inc.

The Liberal government will hold a debate and a vote in the House of Commons next week on whether Canada should ratify the international Paris climate accord. The debate by MPs is to begin Monday as federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna sits down in Montreal with her provincial and territorial counterparts to begin negotiating a plan to meet Canada's Paris commitments. The outcome of next Wednesday's vote is a foregone conclusion - given the Liberal majority - but the outcome of the federal-provincial negotiations is not. "I think it's really important to have a debate, as does the prime minister," McKenna said Friday of next week's debate. "People want to see action on climate change, and I think it's a really important issue that Canadians see parliamentarians discuss the Paris agreement (and) the Vancouver Declaration. We know we need to move forward." A report this week from the Pembina Institute found that Canada's emissions are currently two per cent below 2005 levels, but have been rising slowly for the last five years. McKenna has said Ottawa will impose a national floor price on carbon for provinces that do not adopt their own carbon tax and cap-and-trade market, a move that is opposed by Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan and territorial leaders. It was following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's meeting with the premiers in March of this year that they issued the so-called "Vancouver Declaration," a broad statement of support for establishing a "pan-Canadian framework for clean growth and climate change." "I've listened to all of the provinces and territories; I've had meetings, both individually and in groups, with all of the provinces and territories," McKenna said. "Everyone understands we need to move forward. Everyone understands, and through the Vancouver Declaration, this was part of it, putting a price on what we don't want - pollution - is something that's important." According to Environment Canada's 2016 emissions report, Canada accounted for 1.6 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2012. Earlier this week, India announced it has ratified the Paris agreement and the European Union indicated it may do so within the next few days. That would mean countries accounting for nearly 65 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions will have approved the accord, which is set to take effect 30 days after 55 countries accounting for 55 per cent of emissions deposit their ratification instruments with the UN. Currently, 61 countries accounting for nearly 48 per cent of emissions have joined the accord. Should the EU ratify before Oct. 7, the next UN conference on climate change in Marrakech would begin on Nov. 7 with the agreement already in force. \</doc>

November 15 (SeeNews) - Mission Innovation, a global initiative to speed up clean energy innovation, on Monday announced seven innovation challenges, including one to discover affordable ways to make "storable solar fuels". Mission Innovation was launched at the COP21 summit in Paris last year. As the Mission Innovation countries gathered at COP22 in Marrakech, Morocco on Monday, they welcomed two new members, Finland and the Netherlands, which increase the country count to 23, including the EU. The governments have pledged to double their clean energy research and development (R&D) funding over five years to around USD 30 billion (EUR 27.9bn) per year in 2021. The seven challenges focus on technologies that could play a significant role in combating climate change. The list is below: 1. Smart Grids Innovation Challenge - to enable future grids powered by affordable, reliable, decentralised renewable electricity systems. 2. Off-Grid Access to Electricity Innovation Challenge - to develop systems that enable off-grid households and communities to access affordable and reliable renewable electricity. 3. Carbon Capture Innovation Challenge - to enable near-zero CO2 emissions from power plants and carbon intensive industries. 4. Sustainable Biofuels Innovation Challenge - to develop ways to produce, at scale, widely affordable, advanced biofuels for transportation and industrial applications. 5. Converting Sunlight Innovation Challenge - to discover affordable ways to convert sunlight into storable solar fuels. 6. Clean Energy Materials Innovation Challenge - to accelerate the exploration, discovery, and use of new high-performance, low-cost clean energy materials. 7. Affordable Heating and Cooling of Buildings Innovation Challenge - to make low-carbon heating and cooling affordable for everyone. "The Innovation Challenges give a clear focus for the collective efforts of public and private researchers, innovators and investors, which will help to accelerate innovation in these areas," commented Nick Hurd, UK Minister of State for Climate Change and Industry. The US Department of Energy (DoE) said the US will co-lead, with Mexico, the energy materials challenge. The US will also launch and lead a challenge focused on realising zero emissions for fossil fuels through the carbon capture innovation challenge. (USD 1.0 = EUR 0.928) \</doc>

It was a pricey Paris photo-op for Premier Christy Clark at the United Nations climate-change conference - and B.C. taxpayers were the ones coughing up the euros. Clark attended the UN summit last November with a 17-member entourage, which included government photographer Kyle Surovy. Clark spent three days in Paris and taxpayers footed the bill for Surovy to follow her around and take pictures and videos. The total cost to taxpayers for the premier's Parisian photo shoot: $5,413.22, which included the photographer's airfare, hotel, meals and three days' salary. The amounts are contained in newly released budget documents. It's not a bill that will break the government's bank, of course. But this is a province where money is so tight, the government says it can't even afford to keep sick elderly couples together in provincial nursing homes. The heartbreaking separation of Surrey's Wolfram and Anita Gottschalk made headlines around the world last week. So is spending more than five grand on photos of the premier in Paris a justifiable expense? As they say in the City of Lights: "C'est ridicule." "This crosses the line," said NDP critic Shane Simpson. "Explain this to people working hard to pay their bills every month. This government has an unrealistic view of the world." But the government defended the expense, saying Surovy is one of two "visual communications officers" who generate valuable content for the government's Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and YouTube accounts. The two photographers travel all around British Columbia, Canada and the world taking pictures and videos of the premier, her cabinet ministers and other government officials. Surovy accompanied Clark to Korea, Japan and the Philippines last May and to Beijing, Hong Kong and other points in China last November, a few weeks before the Paris trip. Surovy has racked up $163,150 in travel expenses since Clark became premier five years ago. Photographer Justin Schneider had $106,838 in travel expenses. Throw in their annual salaries (currently $65,000 and $72,000 respectively) and the total cost to taxpayers over that period has been $923,374. "Nearly a million dollars to create photo opportunities," grumbles the NDP's Simpson. "Why do they have to spend that kind of money when everybody has a camera on their smartphones? Anyone around the premier would happily take her picture for free." Good point. But in a world where politicians obsess over their social-media impact, high-priced photography and video services are taking a bigger bite out of taxpayers' wallets. Just last week, federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna came under fire for spending $6,600 for a photographer to take her picture at the same Paris climate-change conference that Clark attended. Too bad she didn't team up with Clark to share the same cameraman - they could have saved taxpayers a lot of dollars. Instead, McKenna grudgingly suggested the expense was inappropriate. "Pictures are an important part of how we transmit our message, but we need to do it in a way that is mindful of taxpayers," McKenna said. "I think there are ways we can reduce costs." McKenna said she has ordered her ministry to review photography expenses. And Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - a man who loves the camera lens himself - also grovelled a bit. "That's certainly one that we are looking at as perhaps not the best use of public funds," Trudeau said. At least that's something, said Aaron Wudrick of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation. But there's been no similar commitment to review photography and video expenses in B.C., where the Christy Clark government defended its social-media communications blitz. "Video and photos support and highlight government announcements and priorities," the government said in a statement, adding the government has generated more than one million YouTube views and 4.4 million Flickr views. In another jaw-dropper out of Ottawa, Health Minister Jane Philpott is being roasted for spending $3,700 on "luxury sedan" trips supplied by one of her own election-campaign workers and $520 to access Air Canada's executive airport lounges. Philpott paid the money back, but that's not the end of it. Federal ethics watchdog Mary Dawson has launched an investigation. Wudrick said politicians should start posting scans of all their personal-spending receipts online. Then they would think twice about spending money on luxury sedan rides or Paris photographers. "It's a very simple process that's working well in Alberta and the city of Toronto," he said. "Receipts would just be scanned and posted online proactively. Then every politician and their staff would know in advance: 'This is going to be seen. Can I justify it?'" The NDP's Simpson has a different idea. "The premier just released a TV commercial about the need to control government spending," he said. "Maybe the B.C. Liberal Party should pay for this stuff." Watch for the New Democrats to remind voters of this Liberal government spending priority. With voters woozy from repeated whacks to their wallets from B.C. Hydro and ICBC rate hikes, they might not be all that impressed with the government's YouTube view-count.

OTTAWA - The fall of 2016 is shaping up as a period of crucial decisions by the federal government on climate policy and energy infrastructure. Here are some key dates: Sept. 22 - The deadline for the federal government to decide whether it will seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada on a ruling that impacts the Northern Gateway pipeline proposal and the First Nations consultation. The Federal Court of Appeal overturned the conditional approval of the oil pipeline in June, ruling that Ottawa failed to properly consult First Nations affected by the pipeline. Oct. 2 - The final, three-month review period for an environmental assessment of a liquefied natural gas export terminal in Prince Rupert, B.C., concludes, after which the federal government has promised a prompt decision on the Pacific NorthWest LNG project, whose principal investor is Malaysia's state-owned Petronas. Oct. 3 - Federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna meets in Montreal with her provincial and territorial counterparts to begin final negotiations on a pan-Canadian climate plan based on the policy reports of four federal-provincial working groups. Nov. 1 - Report due from the three-person federal review panel doing indigenous consultations on Kinder Morgan's proposed Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. Nov. 7 - 18 - The 22nd Council of the Parties to the UN's international climate negotiations, or COP22 , takes place in Marrakech, Morocco, where national representatives are supposed to present an update on policy changes designed to make last year's landmark Paris climate agreement a reality. November/December - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has promised to sit down with the provincial and territorial premiers to finalize a climate plan that will set Canada on course to cut emissions 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. The Prime Minister's Office says the date of the promised first ministers meeting has not yet been determined. Dec. 19 - Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr has said the federal cabinet will make a decision by this date on whether to approve or reject construction of an expanded Trans Mountain pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific port in Burnaby, B.C. \</doc>

French President Francois Hollande on Tuesday urged the U.S. to respect the "irreversible" Paris Agreement on climate change, and said France will lead a dialogue on the topic with president-elect Donald Trump "on behalf of the 100 countries, including Canada, that have ratified" the deal. Speaking at a UN climate conference in Morocco, Hollande praised U.S. President Barack Obama for his role in getting the landmark pact adopted in the French capital last year. "The United States, the most powerful economy in the world, the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, must respect the commitments that were made," he said. "It's not simply their duty, it's in their interest." Scientists say oil and other fossil fuels are the biggest contributors to man-made warming. Trump, however, has called global warming a "hoax" and pledged during his campaign to "cancel" the Paris deal. "The agreement was historic," Hollande said. "But what we must say here is that this agreement is irreversible." Earlier, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he hopes Trump will shift his course on global warming and "understand the seriousness and urgency" of addressing the problem. "As president of the United States, I'm sure that he will understand this, he will listen and he will evaluate his campaign remarks," Ban told reporters in Marrakech. The Paris Agreement was signed by more than 190 countries and has been formally approved by more than 100 of them, including the U.S. and even oil-rich Saudi Arabia. Ban called international climate action "unstoppable" and said that no country, "however resourceful or powerful," is immune from the impacts of global warming. "We have no right to gamble with the fate of future generations - or imperil the survival of other species that share our planet," Ban told the conference. Trump's election has created uncertainty about the U.S. role in the Paris deal, which calls on all countries to reduce or curb their greenhouse gas emissions and encourages rich countries to help poor ones deal with climate change. King Mohammed of Morocco urged delegates at the conference to translate their commitments into actions. !@COPYRIGHT=\Â£9 2016 Osprey Media Group Inc. All rights reserved. \</doc>

As chair of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities' Big City Mayors' Caucus, I was in Marrakech, Morocco, recently for the COP22 Climate Change Conference. It was an impor tant opportunity to highlight the importance of the federal/provincial/municipal partnership on tackling climate change and to showcase Edmonton's environmental leadership. I often say that the answer to some of our greatest challenges will be found in cities and federal and provincial governments won't get far in meeting their greenhouse gas targets without the deep involvement of local governments. With the Paris Agreement going into force on Nov. 4, tying national governments to even tighter greenhouse gas targets, the municipal sector is being called on to play a larger role than ever before in achieving climate change mitigation objectives. This is refreshing since Canadian municipalities have been talking about the need for action on climate change for more than 20 years. We can be proud that some of the finest examples of how cities are stepping up and answering the call can be found in Edmonton. One way we've demonstrated leadership is through the facilities we build and support in the community. Projects like our new LEED Transit Facility, Edmonton Composting Facility and Solar and Energy Savings Program help set Edmonton apart from other municipalities. Through our Blatchford redevelopment project, we are showcasing how sustainability and quality of life intersect in a community that will one day be home to 30,000 people - one of the largest carbon-neutral communities of its kind in the world. Edmonton's Community Energy Transition Strategy is also one of the most progressive in North America for defining how our city will reduce our carbon emissions - from the fleets of city vehicles on our streets to the kind of power we produce and purchase. Local government s influence around half of Canada's GHG emissions, so local action is critical to meeting Canada's GHG targets - and showing the world a path to sustainability. The technologies Canadians innovate, like Enerkem's waste to biofuel plant at our Waste Management Centre, represent the kind of opportunity for technology and export-based "clean growth" that comes with environmental leadership. Innovation in our oil and gas sector to extract and process resources in more water and carbon efficient ways similarly represent an opportunity for exportable innovation and ground zero could be the Edmonton Metro region. Given the opportunities and the imperatives, it's never been more urgent for all orders of government to work together to meet our climate challenge head-on. \</doc>

Rivalries between and among great powers have been grist to the mill of historians for centuries. In ancient times, it was Greeks versus Persians and Romans versus Carthaginians. In early modern times, the clashing imperial ambitions of Spain, France and Great Britain were at the centre of political events. In the first half of the 20th century, Germany found itself pitted against the United States, Great Britain and France. The second half of the century was dominated by a cold war aligning the United States and its allies against the Soviet Union and its allies, and producing proxy wars in Central America, Southern Africa, Central Asia and Southeast Asia. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 apparently led some to believe that the era of contending great powers had come to an end. This certainly seemed to be the view of the distinguished American writer Francis Fukuyama, who proclaimed "The end of history." It also seemed to be that of the United States government, whose spokespersons began to speak of "a new world order." Unfortunately, they were wrong. Even an event as momentous as the fall of the Soviet Union was insufficient to totally alter the nature of international relations. Yes, the so-called bipolar world came to an end, but nation states continued to pursue their interests with or against each other. And nowhere is this more evident than in the policies and actions of the great powers. The two most significant powers on the world stage today are the United States and China. While they manage to maintain a mutually advantageous economic and commercial relationship, they are clearly at odds on many issues. Some of these are of very long duration. For many years, the United States has been highly critical of China's human rights record, and this is a question that can give rise to tensions in the bilateral relationship as it did at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. The Chinese, for their part, are profoundly hostile to the United States' continuing political and military support for Taiwan, which they regard as a form of totally unacceptable interference in their internal affairs. Other contentious issues have arisen in the China-United States relationship in recent years. Perhaps the most difficult and most dangerous concerns North Korea. That country's regime not only has the worst human rights record in the world, it is also the most threatening nuclear weapons proliferator. Its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile tests, accompanied by boisterous hostile rhetoric, have made it a source of serious security concerns for the United States and its Asian allies. The United States has been at the forefront of efforts (sanctions, boycotts) to cripple the regime of Kim Jong Un and to put an end to its nuclear adventures. China has been far more circumspect in its attitude toward North Korea for two main reasons. First, it fears that a collapse of the Kim regime would result in a vast flow of Korean refugees into China. Second, it is also deeply concerned that an eventual reunification of North and South Korea would bring to its borders a country firmly allied to the United States and host to tens of thousands of American troops. North Korea thus continues to be the subject of often testy diplomatic exchanges between the United States and China. China's maritime boundary claims in the East China Sea and the South China Sea are also sources of friction. While the United States generally tries to stay clear of the issues at stake in these claims, it is aligned with or allied to most of the countries involved in these disputes with China. What is more, the United States is vehement in asserting the right of freedom of navigation through some of the waters claimed by China, and has sent warships to affirm that right. These assertions and activities have been denounced by China as provocations, and China's increasingly aggressive actions in its littoral seas can only lead to more difficulties in the bilateral relationship. More generally, China and the United States are engaged in a competition for preeminence in the Asia-Pacific region. For many decades after the Second World War, the United States was the unrivalled power in the region. Its alliances, its naval deployments, its military bases and its economic penetration of so many countries meant that the United States could regard the Pacific Ocean as a mare nostrum. That total dominance has, however, been somewhat undermined by the rise of China as a political, economic, naval and military power over the past 20 years. The Chinese certainly make no secret of their desire and intention to challenge the position of the United States in the region. That challenge prompted President Obama to decree a "pivot" to Asia in American foreign policy, involving the deployment of more economic, diplomatic and military resources to the area. Both countries have also intensified their economic competition, with the United States spearheading the negotiations of a Trans-Pacific Partnership while China set about creating an Asian infrastructure bank. What is true of relations between China and the United States is also true of their relations with other major powers. China has what can best be described as an acrimonious relationship with Japan. Their disputes range from issues relating to the control of islands in the East China Sea to long-standing but acute differences arising from Japan's invasion and occupation of China during the Second World War. Nationalists on both sides of these divides are ever ready to exploit them to their advantage, to the detriment of regional stability. China also has a major territorial dispute with its neighbour India resulting from their brief war in 1962. India demands the return of territories occupied by China at that time. China refuses and lays claims to the entire Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh on the grounds that it was once part of south Tibet. While economic ties between the two countries have grown exponentially in recent years, their political relations continue to be marred by disputes that have festered for more than 50 years. The United States, for its part, enjoys what can only be described !@COPYRIGHT=\Â£9 2016 Osprey Media Group Inc. All rights reserved. \</doc>

Ezra Levant is hoping Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will go to bat for his conservative online publication The Rebel, after he says it was barred from a United Nations climate conference. Levant says The Rebel applied for credentials for three journalists to attend the UN climate conference known as COP22 in Marrakech, Morocco, in November. The application was made a month ago and he didn't expect a problem, he says, because thousands of credentials are typically issued. But when the response came about two weeks ago, it stated that the application was denied because credentials aren't issued for advocacy media outlets, he says. "We felt for sure we'd be accredited because almost anyone is. They had 3,000 journalists accredited last time, including bloggers, including activists, community organizers," Levant said in an interview Monday. "What we have here is the United Nations, whose own Universal Declaration of (Human) Rights includes freedom of the press, banning the one journalistic group they find offensive." The Rebel got its lawyer to write a letter explaining that the organization has 21 full-time journalists, and also obtained letters of support from the Canadian Association of Journalists and PEN Canada, Levant said. But as of Monday - the deadline for accreditation - they said they received no other response. Levant said he hadn't asked for help from the Canadian government before because he was hoping the issue could be worked out quietly before the deadline. But he said he's now seeking assistance from Trudeau and Environment Minister Catherine McKenna. "I know Justin Trudeau doesn't agree with The Rebel. I know that. But he should stand up for Canadian values like freedom of the press at the UN." Nicholas Nuttall, a spokesperson for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Conference, said the organization tries hard to make sure those who get accreditation are genuine media rather than advocacy groups or non-governmental organizations pretending they're media. "We had never heard of Rebel Media before but we looked at their website and, to be honest, they seemed to be in the bracket of being something of a one-person band espousing an individual's view of the world rather than being a serious media operation," Nuttall said in an email. "Some of the headlines seemed to verge on extremism as well." Levant said The Rebel's three reporters still intend to travel to Morocco to report on the climate conference, and will shout questions at delegates as they enter the meeting if they have to. They'll also ask Canadian delegates how they can participate in a conference that violates Canadian values such as free speech, he said. Finally, they'll ask Canadian journalists what they think. "How do you feel about the fact that you are UN-approved and that's why you're let in? Do you feel independent?" Levant said. It's not the first time The Rebel has been denied accreditation. Attempts by Alberta's NDP government to deny a Rebel reporter the ability to ask questions at the legislature earlier this year prompted the province to request a review of who is a journalist and who isn't. \</doc>

DOMINOVAS ENERGY CORP ("DNRG-0") - Launches New Hydropower Division -- Currentergy Dominovas Energy Corporation, long touted for its standing as an energy solutions company dedicated to delivering clean, efficient, and reliable electricity, announces the launch of its hydroelectric division -- CURRENTERGY. With the addition of the Currentergy Division, Dominovas Energy continues to diversify its portfolio of proven energy solutions into hydropower generation applications to broaden its revenue generating opportunities in the renewable energy sphere. With a focus on deploying commercially available, and the most advanced, proven high performance hydropower technologies, Currentergy seeks to harness both large and small-scale opportunities to electrify developing economies in Africa and Latin America; thus fostering and expanding exponential economic growth within these frontier markets. In so doing, Currentergy has developed its proprietary ORCAS(TM) (Ocean River Current Access Solutions) system, which is platformed upon the most advanced and effective hydropower technologies available today. The ORCAS(TM) system enables both on- and off-grid clean energy and micro-grid flexibility for the generation of electricity from river and ocean-based power generating systems. The ORCAS(TM) system is underpinned by its strategic partner and leading global technology supplier Andritz Hydro. Globally, Andritz Hydro's hydropower solutions comprise over 175 years of experience in the deployment, service, refurbishment and rehabilitation of hydropower energy projects. Dominovas Energy CEO Neal Allen welcomes the new Currentergy Division and the addition of Leeshan Ramasamy as Managing Director and head of the Division. Mr. Ramasamy has considerable operational and systems management experience within the development and cultivation of frontier markets' infrastructure and natural resources, having produced significant returns within the mining industry, including the building and operating of profitable chrome processing plants, which led to securing contracts with major ferrochrome producers, such as Xstrata and Hernic Ferrochrome in South Africa. Prior to joining Currentergy, Mr. Ramasamy directed the civil construction and installations for the fiber optic footprint deployment of telecommunications giant Neotel in South Africa. "As an active member of President Obama's Power Africa Initiative, we continue to enthusiastically support the electrification of Africa and realize that the abundant supply of underutilized natural resources can be responsibly harnessed to create clean sources of electricity. I agree with Andritz that hydropower is the most economical and least environmentally impactful form of renewable energy available." Mr. Ramasamy continues, "The ORCAS(TM) hydro system can empower local communities with micro grid applications, as well as feed utility grids in a green and eco-safe fashion. As the post-Paris Climate Accords world embraces a low carbon energy future, Currentergy is excited to be a leader in electrifying frontier markets." "The world is at a crossroads as a result of the effects of global warming and CO(sub)2(/sub) pollution, as reported at the historic United Nations Climate Change conference in Paris recently. As a company dedicated to delivering clean, efficient, and reliable energy solutions, Dominovas Energy acknowledges the need to diversify its energy solutions portfolio to encompass innovative hydropower technologies," added Kreneshen Moodley, Managing Director Africa. "With the meaningful expansion into hydropower generation, in conjunction with our fuel cell division, Currentergy serves as a force multiplier toward advancing Dominovas Energy's strategic goals to deploy the most technologically advanced, cost effective, and market-based energy solutions available. In turn, Dominovas Energy bolsters its energy solutions platform by providing flexible clean energy solutions that address the need for sustainable energy within rapidly developing economies. These frontier markets possess vast natural mineral and hydro resources that can be harnessed to increase the production of energy from renewable sources," stated Dominovas Energy's CEO Neal Allen.

A little less than a year after being sworn in as finance minister, Bill Morneau is set to update the Commons - and Canadians - on the state of the both the Canadian economy and the federal balance sheet. Currently scheduled for delivery at approximately 3:30 ET, the now traditional fall fiscal statement may also feature a progress report on the measures introduced in the budget, as well as a preview on what, if any, actions the government may take in the months ahead. Even before the presentation wraps up, Conservative Leader Rona Ambrose and her deputy leader, Denis Lebel, will hit the House Foyer to share their thoughts on the newly released numbers with reporters, who can also count on hearing from the New Democrats and other opposition members. MPs will also get the chance to put their thoughts on the official record during the ensuing House debate, which will continue for the remainder of the sitting day. Before Morneau takes the spotlight, however, he and his Liberal colleagues are expected to vote to support a New Democrat-driven opposition motion that formally calls on his government to comply with the landmark ruling on First Nations and indigenous child welfare handed down earlier this year by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal , including "immediately investing an additional $155 million in new funding" to address the existing budget shortfall. Outside the Chamber, the Parliamentary Budget Office will publish a new report that explores the "fiscal considerations" of "legalized cannabis," including market forecasts projecting user numbers, price points and "aggregate consumption," as well as an "overview of potential revenues that could arise from legal cannabis sale." Meanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will meet with Concordia professor Homa Hoodfar, who was freed from months of detention in an Iranian jail earlier this fall. He's also scheduled to "deliver remarks" and take questions from the audience at the National Youth Forum on Accessibility at Carleton University. Elsewhere in the capital, Environment Minister Catherine McKenna voices her thoughts on " COP22 and the Canadian Context" in a morning keynote address at a conference hosted by the International Development Research Centre. Also on the Hill today: Cardus Senior Fellow Andrew Bennett, who served as "ambassador for religious freedom" under the previous government, unveils an "important new initiative" tied to the upcoming celebrations surrounding the 150th anniversary of Confederation. Dairy Farmers of Canada executive director Caroline Emond and president Wally Smith hit the stage at the National Press Theatre to introduce a "new organizational logo" that will, as per the notice, show the group is "looking to the future for the dairy industry and consumers." Finally, Fisheries Minister Dominic Leblanc may have to get Morneau to lend him his speaking notes, as he'll have to skip the statement in order to attend the weekly Senate ministerial Q&;A session, which is slated to begin at 3:30 p.m.ET. !@COPYRIGHT=\Â£9 2016 Postmedia Network Inc.

A United Nations decision to bar a Canadian news organization from next month's Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) makes it clear it's time journalism becomes a self-regulating profession - much like doctors or lawyers. The Rebel, a right-leaning platform created by Ezra Levant, was denied access to the conference in Morocco because "advocacy media outlets do not qualify for accreditation." The Rebel Media's journalistic credentials have been questioned before. Earlier this year, the Alberta government banned The Rebel's correspondents from press briefings in the legislature. The Canadian Association of Journalists (CAJ), representing reporters across Canada, demanded the province reinstate The Rebel. The ban was subsequently lifted. Independent journalism is indispensable. Journalists must strive for objectivity and seek out dissenting voices. News gathering must be held to ethical standards. Journalism is as much how you tell a story as what you cover. It follows, then, that not every blogger or basement commentator is a journalist. In true journalism, opinion or commentary must be clearly labelled as such. And blending hard news with commentary is insidious. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the movement toward 'independent' or 'grassroots' media was in full swing. Activists attacked conventional media as being 'corporate,' suggesting it offered propaganda more than news. To fight the concentration of media ownership, these activists decided they would report in a fashion that was independent, grassroots and anticorporate. But many of these independent 'reporters' thought they could march in demonstrations wearing their activist hats and then suddenly don their reporter caps and report the news objectively. . This isn't to suggest that The Rebel or other alternative media don't gather legitimate news stories and give voice to important issues. But media is too important to work without checks and balances. Journalists and news organizations must be held accountable for violating standards and ethics. The public can complain to a public editor or ombudsperson - if the news organization has one - or to a press council, if one exists in a given province. But these institutions are arguably more about public relations than enforcement of professional standards. Many also believe public editors or ombudspersons tend to reflexively defend the organizations they represent. However, a self-regulating profession can set ethical standards and enforce them up to the point of stripping someone of their credentials to practise that profession. Canadian journalists generally oppose government licensing or losing control over their work, or a homogenization of media. Some fear that professionalization could lead to formal requirements for obtaining a journalism degree. But surely proper training - a formal education in critical thinking, from a liberal arts education, for example - would be good for journalists and society. A profession should never fear more education. Becoming a self-regulating profession ensures that journalists are responsible - and reassures the public. Some journalists want to be activists and tell us how to think. A self-regulating profession could help deal with this kind of media bias. As traditional media confronts the explosion of digital, multimedia journalism, this conversation is important. Journalism is struggling to find a sustainable business model and this could help. But before we decide how to save an independent media, we need to decide who is the media. Self-regulation will help us decide. Joseph Quesnel is a Nova Scotia-based policy analyst and commentator.

The Trudeau government has just marked its 3,000th spending announcement and, in doing so, has shown itself to be much more adroit in getting its MPs to hand out cheques than its predecessor. The majority Harper government of the 41st Parliament didn't make its 3,000th announcement until nearly two years into its mandate, on March 11, 2013. During the four-year 41st Parliament, Conservative MPs made 7,307 spending announcements, a total that Liberal MPs, at their current pace, should easily eclipse early in the third year of their mandate. That said, the Harper Conservatives moved more money out the door even though they made fewer announcements. By end of day on Friday - 396 days since last fall's election - Liberal MPs had made 3,030 announcements funding projects worth a combined $18.9 billion. It took the Harper Conservatives just 72 days after the May 2, 2011 election for that government to eclipse $18.9 billion in spending announcements. The spending announcement figures are culled from a database maintained exclusively by the National Post that draws from the thousands of press releases issued by the government over the last eight years in which government MPs and ministers take credit for the allocation of a grant, contribution, or loan from the federal treasury. And it is always government MPs who get their names on the press releases when a cheque is handed out. Opposition MPs are never mentioned even when the project to be funded is in an opposition riding. The 3,000th announcement from the current government occurred Thursday when Environment Minister Catherine McKenna, at the COP22 climate change conference in Marrakech, Morocco, announced $3 million to the World Bank Transformative Carbon Asset Facility. Other recent spending announcements include $54 million in aid for Haiti, announced Friday by International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau during a visit to Portau-Prince. But the Trudeau government, like the Harper government before it, has plenty of money for smaller projects. For example, Liberal MP Nick Whalen had a few cheques to hand out Friday in the Newfoundland and Labrador community of Torbay, including one for $150,250 for the local Kinsmen's club to build a splash pad for kids. The money is drawn from a $300-million Parliament-approved pool of money for projects to mark Canada's 150th anniversary in 2017. The fund was established by the Harper Conservatives in its 2015 budget and was, at the time, denounced by Liberal MPs Adam Vaughan and Judy Sgro as nothing more than a "slush fund" for Conservative MPs. But once in office, the Liberals kept the Canada 150 fund going. The National Post database has logged 155 Canada 150 spending announcements worth a combined $27.9 million for projects in Liberal ridings. Just 15 announcements worth a combined $876,000 have been announced for projects in ridings held by Conservatives and 21 Canada 150 announcements worth $1,078,780 have been announced for NDP ridings. !@COPYRIGHT=\Â£9 2016 Postmedia Network Inc.

Canada's political and business leaders are pursuing an emissions-reduction agenda that will harm our nation's citizens and our economy. And it's an agenda that defies prevailing world trends. The COP 22 Imagine their shock when, just 24 hours later, they learned that Donald Trump is the next American president. Trump believes that man-made global warming is a "hoax" perpetrated by China and other countries wanting to steal American jobs. Trump opposes carbon taxes and wants to notch up production of America's oil resources to reduce imports from the Middle East and Venezuela. And he plans to scrap U.S. President Barack Obama's deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping to shut down American coal-fired power plants while allowing China to commission several new coal-fired power plants each week. In emitter No. 3, Vladimir Putin's Russia, environmental matters don't appear on the radar screen. In India, population growth, corruption and a rich-must-pay attitude means continuing emissions growth. So the four countries responsible for more than half of global emissions are going to raise, not lower, them. Adding other countries with no intention of playing the COP game - including most of Asia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Valenzuela - means emissions from countries representing over two-thirds of global emissions are going to go up, not down. The Africans' only objective at COP 22 was to convince others to buy carbon credits in return for their promises to plant or avoid cutting a few trees, with dubious results once the cash is paid. So who's left to save the planet from the predicted global warming Armageddon? Just the European Union, Japan and Australia, with a combined global emission share of 15 per cent. And, of course, Canada, with our minuscule 1.6 per cent emission share. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has anchored part of his "Canada is back" rhetoric to fighting global warming. All his mandate letters to cabinet ministers has emissions reduction as a headline item. Tellingly, there was scant mention in those letters of stimulating private sector investment to drive economic growth. And Trudeau's recent announcement of a national carbon tax isn't the only measure hitting consumers and businesses. Note the provincial subsidy programs for green power producers that drive up electricity rates. These measures impose a dead weight on an already-struggling economy. Adding to that economic burden is Trump's avowed intent to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement, which accounts for 90 per cent of our trade. There couldn't be a worse time to hand another competitive advantage to the Americans. Pricing carbon has always been based on the notion that, while Canada's emissions are small, we should do our part of a worldwide effort. But going it alone while our trading partners refuse would be a triumph of ideology over reason. We expect that from political leaders. But at least business could usually be counted on to herald the dangers of those leaders' ill-advised paths. So imagine my surprise when a recent morning's news carried a "Letter to First Ministers from Major Business and Civil Society Leaders," many of whom I know and respect. It offered support for "putting a price on carbon" and reads as if the signatories went to bed the night after the COP 22 's opening and woke up oblivious to the political earthquake south of the border. The statement alleges, "The world's most advanced players are hard at work forging cleaner, more innovative economies fuelled by a desire to compete in a changing global market place." With less than 17 per cent of global emissions being restrained? The statement adds, "Clean technology companies can tap into a fast-growing global market." A growing market it may be but not for Canadian manufacturers. Take wind power, the darling of the green energy advocates. Five of the top 10 wind turbine manufacturers are in China. America's GE Wind is the next largest manufacturer. Ontario's disastrous green power plan has driven electricity rates in Canada's manufacturing heartland from among North America's lowest to the very highest. Piling on a carbon tax will make certain that the beneficiaries of that "fast-growing global market" will not be Canadian workers. Far from being an effort to build a "high performance economy," the statement reads like an economic suicide pact. The most important responsibility of political and business leaders is to create an environment for Canadians to gain productive employment and continue to enjoy living standards that are the envy of the world.

The Canadian government recently announced plans to give away $1.8 billion to encourage environmentally sustainable innovation in development countries. The announcement came at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakesh, Morocco, earlier this month. How many hospitals, health care services and other projects would this amount of money buy to improve our quality of life? Canadians should come first!

B.C.'s delegation to the annual United Nations climate change summit has returned from the desert of Morocco, North Africa. B.C. Environment Minister Mary Polak skipped this year's event, sending West Vancouver MLA Jordan Sturdy to collect one of 13 UN "Momentum for Change" awards handed out at COP22 , the 22nd international "Conference of the Parties." B.C. was recognized for its revenue neutral $30-a-tonne carbon tax, still the only substantial tax on carbon fuel consumption in North America. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also passed this year, visiting Cuba and Argentina instead. His entourage would have brought Canada's delegation close to the record 335 Canadian officials who jetted to COP21 in Paris last year, but without him it was a relatively modest 225. A few more numbers: with 20,000 delegates and observers, another 30,000 "civil society" activists from 192 countries, and 1,500 journalists, a temporary city sprang up at the village of Bab Ighli near Marrakech. It was fitted with electric car charging stations, which sat unused after everyone flew in from around the world. Sturdy is B.C.'s Parliamentary Secretary for Energy Literacy and the Environment. This vast circus of hot air and hot airport tarmac certainly suggests a need for greater energy literacy, among participants especially. But enough of the UN's hypocrisy. The big news at Morocco was the surprise election of Donald Trump, who has vowed to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord. With no restrictions on rapidly growing China and India until 2030, and withdrawal of the U.S., the world's second largest emitter after China, other countries face an impossible burden. For countries that ratify it, the Paris deal consists of non-binding commitments to reduce their CO2 emissions with a goal to keep global average temperature rise below two degrees. Speaking in Morocco, federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna said Canada will stay the course. Trudeau has given provinces a 2018 deadline to impose their own carbon price, starting at $10 a tonne and rising by $10 each year, or Ottawa will do it for them. By 2021, this would see the rest of Canada catch up to B.C. How's that working here? After a dip in emissions mostly caused by a world recession, B.C.'s greenhouse gas emissions are rising along with its growing economy. But enough of my skepticism. I asked B.C. Green Party leader Andrew Weaver about all this. A climate scientist and hard-liner on carbon emissions, he says the intent of the Paris agreement for Canada is simple. That means no pipelines to B.C.'s northwest coast for liquefied natural gas exports to Asia, and no twinning of the 63-year-old Trans Mountain oil pipeline. The Trudeau government has approved the Petronas-led Pacific Northwest LNG project, which Weaver insists will never be built because the economics don't work. And he expects, like many others, that Trudeau is poised to approve the Trans Mountain project, which would face opposition like we've never seen before. If the U.S. actually tears up climate and trade deals, Weaver says other countries should impose tariffs on its export goods to price U.S. emissions. "I'm not overly concerned about Trump," he said. "The guy's a windbag." Pardon my personal carbon footprint, but I'm visiting Japan and China at the end of the month with B.C.'s annual forest ministry trade mission. Those two countries are key customers for B.C. LNG and Alberta oil. Tom Fletcher is B.C. legislature reporter and columnist for Black Press. Email: HYPERLINK tfletcher@blackpress.ca \~ \</doc>

By Joseph Quesnel A United Nations decision to bar a Canadian news organization from next month's Conference of the Parties ( COP22 ) makes it clear it's time journalism becomes a self-regulating profession - much like doctors or lawyers. The Rebel, a right-leaning platform created by Ezra Levant, was denied access to the conference in Morocco because "advocacy media outlets do not qualify for accreditation." The Rebel Media's journalistic credentials have been questioned before. Earlier this year, the Alberta government banned The Rebel's correspondents from press briefings in the legislature. The Canadian Association of Journalists (CAJ), representing reporters across Canada, demanded the province reinstate The Rebel. The ban was subsequently lifted. Independent journalism is indispensable. Journalists must strive for objectivity and seek out dissenting voices. News gathering must be held to ethical standards. Journalism is as much how you tell a story as what you cover. It follows, then, that not every blogger or basement commentator is a journalist. In true journalism, opinion or commentary must be clearly labelled as such. And blending hard news with commentary is insidious. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the movement towards 'independent' or 'grassroots' media was in full swing. Activists attacked conventional media as being 'corporate,' suggesting it offered propaganda more than news. To fight the concentration of media ownership, these activists decided they would report in a fashion that was independent, grassroots and anti-corporate. But many of these independent 'reporters' thought they could march in demonstrations wearing their activist hats and then suddenly don their reporter caps and report the news objectively. The result was left-slanted reports, mostly commentary, in place of what they criticized. This anti-corporate rhetoric emboldened some activists to take out their frustrations on career reporters. I saw physical attacks on mainstream news reporters' equipment and vehicles during my undergraduate years. The attacks reflected a profound lack of understanding of the ethics and training behind real reporting. This isn't to suggest that The Rebel or other alternative media don't gather legitimate news stories and give voice to important issues. But media is too important to work without checks and balances. Journalists and news organizations must be held accountable for violating standards and ethics. The public can complain to a public editor or ombudsperson - if the news organization has one - or to a press council, if one exists in a given province. But these institutions are arguably more about public relations than enforcement of professional standards. Many also believe public editors or ombudspersons tend to reflexively defend the organizations they represent. However, a self-regulating profession can set ethical standards and enforce them up to the point of stripping someone of their credentials to practise that profession. Canadian journalists generally oppose government licensing or losing control over their work, or a homogenization of media. Some fear that professionalization could lead to formal requirements for obtaining a journalism degree. But surely proper training - a formal education in critical thinking, from a liberal arts education, for example - would be good for journalists and society. A profession should never fear more education. Becoming a self-regulating profession ensures that journalists are responsible - and reassures the public. Some journalists want to be activists and tell us how to think. A self-regulating profession could help deal with this kind of media bias. As traditional media confronts the explosion of digital, multimedia journalism, this conversation is important. Journalism is struggling to find a sustainable business model and this could help. But before we decide how to save an independent media, we need to decide who is the media. Self-regulation will help us decide.

WASHINGTON, DC--(Marketwired - September 19, 2016) - Speaking at the 2016 Our Ocean Conference, Moroccan Minister Delegate in Charge of the Environment Dr. Hakima El Haite called for a "world partnership to establish a real vision and strategy to address oceans," noting that oceans both sustain life and are essential to the economies of coastal countries like Morocco. Addressing a panel on "Ocean and the Environment," Dr. El Haite said, "Morocco understands the impact of climate change on oceans every day." "The oceans are not just part of an environmental agenda," she added, "but an economic agenda and human agenda." To address these environmental and economic challenges posed by climate change, the Kingdom has undertaken a number of initiatives to protect its oceans, including adopting laws against illegal fishing, promoting the monitoring of fishing fleets, and creating protected zones along the coastlines. Morocco, which will host the next Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 22 ) in Marrakesh this November, will place oceans at the heart of its COP 22 agenda. Dr. El Haite stressed the importance of linking the aims of the Our Ocean conference to the implementation of the COP 21 Paris Agreement. On the sidelines of the event, Minister El Haite told ClimateWire that oceans should be "put in the heart of the development and human rights agenda" of Paris, and that "Including oceans in NDCs [nationally determined contributions] would be a clear political signal and commitment and would encourage more programs and initiatives from the private sector, the financial community and all the non-state actors." At the conference, Morocco also announced a partnership with France and the Principality of Monaco to ensure better protection of the biodiversity and richness of Mediterranean Sea against climate change. S\'e9gol\'e8ne Royal, French President of COP 21, said the partnership will strengthen the fight against pollution, noting that the goal is to set "rules of sustainable development" and "to protect the cradle of the Mediterranean, that links Europe and Africa." Morocco is frequently lauded as a leader in climate change policy. The 2016 Climate Performance Index> ranked Morocco among the top ten countries making the most progress in addressing climate change and number one among "newly industrialized countries," citing the country as one that shows "the potential of developing countries to move forward." "Morocco understands well the necessity of being a careful steward of the planet," said former US Ambassador Edward Gabriel, "which is why the country has for years led the way in sustainability and environmental protection in the Middle East and North Africa." The Moroccan Amercan Center for Polcy (MACP) is a non-profit organization whose principal mission is to inform opinion makers, government officials, and interested publics in the United States about political and social developments in Morocco and the role being played by the Kingdom of Morocco in broader strategic developments in North Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East.

Alberta is punching above its weight when it comes to climate leadership and the provinces actions would influence not only actions on climate change in Canada but also internationally, says the head of the Pembina Institute. The provinces plan to phase out all coal-fired power generation by 2030 is coming at a time when the Canadian government is considering its own national plan and it is being closely watched by Canadas partners in the United States, United Kingdom and Germany, Ed Whittingham, executive director of the environmental think tank, said in a speech to the Alberta NDP convention in Calgary on the weekend. The proposition is simple: if Canadas fossil fuel capital can do this, then surely you can too, he told the more than 800 delegates attending the convention. This also comes at a time when the leaders of France and Italy are considering their own coal phase-out requirements, convention delegates heard. Albertas Climate Leadership Plan was released in November 2015 with the backing of both industry and environmental groups. The plan, which includes an emissions limit for the oilsands, a carbon price across all sectors and an energy efficiency program, is now law with the approval last week by the legislature. Six months after the 2015 election, Alberta went from being a laggard and international whipping boy on climate to being one of the most progressive jurisdictions acting on the issue in the entire OECD (Organization for Economic Development and Co-operation), said Whittingham. The province, he added, has gone from being part of the problem to being part of the solution and a critical piece of the puzzle. Thats because while the previous Progressive Conservative government had failed to address the elephant in the room  absolute greenhouse gas emissions, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley and Environment Minister Shannon Phillips tackled the elephant head on by setting an absolute emissions limit of 100 megatonnes of greenhouse gases from the oilsands, he said. Some will argue that its too high and I can show you scars on my back from the environmental community of those who share that space, he said. To those who argue it is too high, my reply is simple, he said. Show me any other jurisdiction thats taken a major pool of carbon, whether its oil, gas or coal and said \Â£6 this going to give us certainty; its going to have an emissions limit and then once it hits that limit we are keeping it there, said Whittingham. No other jurisdiction has done that and moreover, its a precedent that the rest of the world can build upon. This week, as a member of an advisory team to Royal Dutch Shell Plc, he will be meeting in The Hague with the entire Shell executive team to talk about what happened in Alberta and how it is a precedent they should be advocating for in other energy-producing jurisdictions. Whittingham also acknowledged that some in the energy industry believe that the emissions limits are too low and the CEOs who stood on stage with Notley have scars similar to his. But what weve done is provide certainty around the biggest issue in the oilsands: greenhouse gas emissions, he said. We have taken that elephant in the room head-on \Â£6 and now this helps with social licence; undoubtedly, unquestionably, said Whittingham. The climate leadership plan is robust, it is comprehensive, it has already shifted the debate around the oilsands and Alberta doing its fair share to address climate change and now [it is] getting noticed for the right reasons, he said. We heard that in spades in Paris [the United Nations climate change conference ], he said. Lets face it. The premier [Notley] is our biggest source of soft power that this province has right now. The Alberta plan, though, is facing a backlash, convention delegates heard. The backlash is strong, is well funded and is rife with inaccuracies and frankly, outright lies, said Whittingham, adding that the importance of countering those claims with facts and practical solutions that can be supported with research and analysis cannot be overstated. Notley in a 40-minute speech to the convention outlined the accomplishments of her government in the year since it swept the Progressive Conservative party out of power after nearly 44 years in power. The government, she said, in the future needs to focus on economic diversification, job creation, getting products to market and being prudent with the public purse. The premier also emphasized that if Alberta wants access to global markets for its energy we have to step up to be a big part of the solution to one of the worlds biggest problems which is climate change. And that is exactly what the government is doing with the adoption of the climate bill, said Notley, describing it as one of the most significant public policy and economic initiatives ever introduced in the legislature. Asked later by a reporter about some of the opposition to the governments climate plan, Notley responded that its really important to move forward on what you talked to people that you would run on and to not be course changing all over the place, \Â£6 I think its more important about governing on the basis of your principles. Under the previous Conservative government, Alberta was locked into an outdated way of thinking that economic prosperity couldnt be reconciled with protecting the climate, Whittingham suggested. This government has figured out that action on climate change is consistent with economic prosperity; it is the two sides to the same coin, he said.Think of the jobs we are going to create by having our Alberta oilfield services companies figure out how to reduce methane and we will export those jobs globally; think about how the jobs we will create by investing in energy efficiency; think of the thousands of jobs we will create by building over 5,000 megawatts of renewable electricity. In a panel discussion that followed, Phillips said that Alberta is finally going to realize its dream of diversification through leading on climate change. What holds this whole plan together is that reinvestment and making sure that we are keeping those funds here in Alberta for the benefit of all Albertans, particularly working people, she said. Linda Coady, chief sustainability officer for Enbridge Inc., said the Alberta governments climate policy is important because it demonstrates that it is possible to grow Albertas energy sector in a way that is consistent with national and international goals on climate change. This will in turn allow us to secure the best market price for our product and enables the Alberta energy sector to play a leadership role in the transition to a cleaner, low-carbon future, she said. As a member of the Climate Advisory Panel, which advised the Alberta government on its climate policy, Coady said the panel heard loud and clear that carbon pricing should be used not only in increasing energy efficiency, but also for investment in new technologies that can help reduce the emissions level in the current fossil fuel supply chain. I think its very important and I think its definitely part of the plan that investment in new technology is going to be made going forward, she said. That will help improve the competitiveness of our industry because we can reduce our emissions per barrel, said Coady. We have already made a lot of progress on that in Alberta but there is more that can be done and the plan sets up the stage for that. The Enbridge executive also challenged the claim by some that high environmental standards will affect Albertas competitiveness. In a world that is moving towards action, acting on climate, the reality in the long-term is that if you are a high carbon producer, you are a high-cost producer so carbon emissions are definitely going to be a factor in the competitiveness of our energy sector going forward, she said. We need to get ahead of that curve with the new technologies, relationships and approaches that are envisioned in the plan. I think the world is changing and carbon is a cost and weve got to manage that cost like every other cost we have to manage to be competitive in the global market. \</doc>

A year ago, I listened to Justin Trudeau talk about "sunny ways" for Canada. I cautiously believed in a new, bright, reconciliatory moment for our country. Yet last week, in response to Donald Trump's election, Trudeau spoke about his "shared values" with Americans. As a Canadian studying in the United States, I have been surprised and shocked by the outcome of last week's presidential election. As a graduate student researching climate change, I am horrified that a country as important as the United States will be led by someone who denies climate change; he will be the only leader of a major industrial country to take that stance. However, what really worries me is how Prime Minister Trudeau will act on climate change in response to the U.S. election. Many conservative Canadian pundits are hailing a new era, saying that the Keystone XL pipeline - which was vetoed by U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this year - will come "back from the dead." Seemingly unaware of market forces that are accelerating renewable energy, they apparently assume that there will be pipelines galore criss-crossing the United States and Canada. What is Trudeau's response to these voices? Just how far do "shared values" go? Do they replace our "sunny ways"? During Canada's elections last year, a record number of young people voted for change. We voted in favour of lowering greenhouse-gas emissions so that global warming world would stay within two degrees Celsius, as the Liberal party promised. We voted in favour of stimulating renewable energy jobs - another Liberal promise. Yet, Trudeau has yet to deliver on any of these promises. While he has taken an important step in announcing a carbon price (the details of which are yet to be determined), the Liberal government has proved exorbitantly sympathetic to pipelines. Despite opposition and concern from a myriad of groups, Trudeau seems likely to go ahead with at least one of the pipeline projects that have been proposed - the Kinder Morgan pipeline - as well as the Pacific NorthWest Liquified Natural Gas project. Scientifically, there is no way the prime minister can promote pipelines while still promulgating Canada as a climate leader. Canada's oil reserves are the third-largest in the world - if we continue to expand our extraction, there is no feasible way we can avoid severe climate change thresholds. Nonetheless, Trudeau made a promise that Canada would act on climate change. I have been to several United Nations climate change negotiations, including the COP21 talks in Paris last December. I stood shaking as I saw Trudeau address the world and say that Canada was "back." I wanted him to lead on climate change, to change course from the previous Harper government's policies. Over and over, I listened to Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna assure youth that Canada was going to lead. When the Paris Agreement was signed, we knew it wouldn't be enough to adequately fight climate change - but it was an important first step. This week, the United Nations is meeting yet again for its yearly climate talks, at the COP22 conference in Morocco. Canadian youth at these talks have noted that Canadian negotiators need to step up with more leadership. It is clear that - if Trudeau is serious about leading on climate change, as he so often asserts - many fossil fuels will need to remain below ground. As a matter of fact, reports found that in order for the world to meet its Paris Agreement goals, no new fossil fuels can be drilled. I fear that a Trump presidency will allow Canadians to settle for the status quo, comparing ourselves to the U.S. and using it as an excuse for inaction. Canada has so much potential to be a leader in renewable energy. Let's take this moment as an opportunity to do just that.

The federal government is inviting Canadians to offer input on creating a new climate change policy. The Ministry of Environment and Climate Change is currently hosting public consultations at town halls across the country and accepting input online until Aug. 1. Comments can be submitted online at letstalkclimateaction.ca/ideas. The Liberal government has made a commitment to develop an action plan to combat climate change, put carbon-pricing policies in place, and lower greenhouse gas emissions. At last year's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, Canada and 194 other countries agreed to a long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to "well below" 2 C and aim to limit the increase to 1.5 C. \</doc>

Alberta government and industry representatives in Morocco for the latest round of United Nations climate talks will be dealing with a significantly altered landscape in the aftermath of Donald Trump's election. The U.S. president-elect - who has promised to accelerate fossil fuel development and once called climate change a hoax invented by the Chinese to undermine American manufacturing - vowed during the campaign to "cancel" the landmark deal struck at last year's climate conference in Paris. That agreement saw more than 190 countries make formal commitments to cut carbon emissions, but the prospect of a Trump presidency has many at this year's summit in Marrakech wondering how much progress can be made if the U.S. is not willing to participate. Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers president and CEO Tim McMillan, who is in attendance at the event, said at every panel session he's sat in on since Tuesday, the conversation has turned to the implications of a Trump presidency. "There's been a lot of speculation, and a real sense that it would change things, but no one can articulate exactly how until the new president and the new administration take office and set a clear direction," McMillan said. Trump said during his campaign he would approve Keystone XL, the $8-billion TransCanada Corp. pipeline that would give Alberta energy producers greater access to U.S. markets but was rejected by President Barack Obama. But McMillan said if Trump isn't willing to play ball on the climate file, there could be competitiveness concerns for Canadian producers. For example, Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. in June jointly announced major reductions on methane emissions as part of a broader North American climate and clean energy strategy. "I believe that allowed us to be more ambitious than we otherwise could have been, because we compete for the same markets as producers south of our border. If we're all investing in new technologies, if we're all changing our infrastructure, those competitive issues aren't dictated by borders," he said. "Does this change that approach? I don't know." Concerns have also been raised that carbon pricing policies could hurt Canada's industry if it becomes clear the U.S. has no intention of implementing one. Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall said in a statement Wednesday that it "makes no sense" for the federal government to push ahead with a national carbon tax when Canada's biggest trading partner, and biggest competitor for investment and jobs, won't have one. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - who announced last month that he'd impose a national floor price on carbon dioxide emissions starting in 2018 and rising to $50 per tonne by 2022 - indicated Thursday the plan is still full speed ahead. He said Canadians and the world understand that failing to fight climate change has a big economic downside, and he defended carbon pricing as a means of fostering innovation and improving the economy. "We know that putting a price on carbon pollution is a way to improve our response to economic challenges, to create good jobs going forward and to show leadership that quite frankly the entire world is looking for, along with the solutions that go with it," Trudeau said in Sydney, N.S. Alberta Environment Minister Shannon Phillips, who departed for Marrakech on Thursday evening, said the province's Climate Leadership Plan was designed for the Alberta economy, and Trump's election doesn't change that. "Our work remains the same on November 9 as it was on November 7," Phillips said. "Our values and commitment to the environment and the economy going hand in hand remain the same."

"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive." - Donald Trump, November 2012. The election of Republican Party nominee Donald Trump to the office of President of the United States of America means that there will be dark days ahead for those concerned about the climate crisis. Trump, who has called climate change a "hoax", campaigned on tearing up the 2015 international Paris climate treaty and expanding U.S. energy production from the very dirtiest form of carbon energy - coal. The chances of a Trump administration putting a price on carbon pollution are somewhere between zero and when hell freezes over. Trump is already in the process of disassembling out-going President Barack Obama's meagre climate change initiatives. The Keystone XL pipeline is being resurrected from the dead, and cries of "Drill, Baby, Drill!" are emanating from his transition team as they talk of opening more federal lands and oceans to fossil development. If the writing wasn't already on the wall throughout Trump's junk-science fuelled election campaign, the appointment of well-known climate change denier Myron Ebell to head the Environmental Protection Agency transition team was like erecting a 10-storey high billboard telling the fossil fuel industry to let the good times roll. Over in Marrakech, Morocco, at the COP22 climate conference, delegates from around the world are shell shocked. They're putting on a brave face, pretending that it's still business as usual. Ultimately, the international community will have to confront the U.S. as a rogue state - and international leaders like Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had best start turning their attention towards that. Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy is already thinking ahead. Earlier this week, Sarkozy said that Europe ought to consider placing carbon tariffs on U.S. imports if Trump refuses to put a domestic price on carbon pollution. Talk of tariffs is only going to increase as more regions and nations price carbon - while Trump calls for more protectionist trade policies and for tearing up trade deals like NAFTA. Not that it will likely matter to Donald Trump, but the World Trade Organization has already given a nod towards legitimizing carbon tariffs to protect business-exposed industries that are subject to domestic carbon prices. While the federal Liberals haven't yet released the specifics of their climate change plan, the plan will almost certainly have to include carbon tariffs that will level the field for goods crossing the Canadian border on nations that refuse to price pollution. A national carbon tariffwould also benefit provinces like Ontario, which is rolling out a cap-and-trade scheme in 2017. One of the big criticisms of Ontario's cap-and-trade initiative is that many of the province's biggest polluters won't have to pay into it for several years, due to being deemed 'trade exposed'. The freebie allowances they'll be receiving from the government will depress the market and may render the whole initiative ineffective. Premier Kathleen Wynne has been intending on using cap-and-trade revenues to fund a myriad of climate initiatives. With a national carbon tariffin place protecting trade exposed industries, it may be that Ontario can quit handing out permits to pollute. That'll be better for both the environment and the government's bottom line. Carbon markets are popping up everywhere. China, long deemed a climate enemy thanks to its reliance on coal to power economic growth, has committed to opening the world's largest carbon trading market next year. In a world turned upside down, it was China that emphatically told President-Elect Trump that he would be defying the wishes of the entire planet if the U.S. opted out of the Paris agreement. !@COPYRIGHT=\Â£9 2016 Osprey Media Group Inc.

June 22 (SeeNews) -\~ The\~International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)\~ and the Terrawatt Initiative yesterday announced the launch of a global effort to standardise contracts in order to streamline the development and finance of solar projects. On the sidelines of the InterSolar Europe in Munich, the two organisations announced their Solar Energy Standardisation Initiative which will bring together leaders in energy, finance and law to define and agree on a standard template for solar project documents that are effective and acceptable by finance institutions. "High transaction costs for some solar projects are due, in large part, to the complexity of the contractual documents supporting the projects," said Henning Wuester, Director of IRENA's Knowledge, Policy and Finance Centre.\~ "Simplifying the negotiation of these contractual documents will help reduce transaction costs, and allow investment in solar PV to advance more rapidly in more markets worldwide. That is what this initiative hopes to achieve," he added. The first meeting of the Initiative was held yesterday, with stakeholders including Agence Francaise de Developpement, Chadbourne & Parks, CITI, the Climate Bonds Initiative, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Eversheds, Gide Loyrette Nouel, Global Solar Power, Herbert Smiths Freehills, the Inter-American Development Bank, the International Finance Corporation, Norton Rose Fulbright, Simmons & Simmons, Trilegal, the United Nations Development Programme, and Watson Farley & Williams. The initiative aims to share templates and standard documentation by COP 22 in November 2016. \</doc>

A select group of just 225 of Canada's top climate change thinkers - led by federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna - gathered in Marrakech, Morocco, this week, along with a cosy crowd of 25,000 other politicians, bureaucrats and activists from around the globe, for COP22 . That's where 195 nations agreed to sign on to a longterm plan to curb carbon emissions in hopes of limiting any rise in global temperatures this century to no more than 2 C. As for the U.S., it's heading straight to the penalty box, after leading the global climate change campaign for years. With president-elect Donald Trump (who dubs climate change a hoax) set to assume office in January, and promising to roll back President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan, many fear the world's second-biggest emitter will ditch its Paris commitments. French President Francois Hollande voiced those fears Tuesday, urging the U.S. to honour the "irreversible" Paris agreement, while lavishing praise on Obama's past climate change policies. Whether Hollande's admonitions have any impact on Trump remains to be seen. But in truth, the much-ballyhooed Paris accord was never more than an aspirational document. Although McKenna and others claim it is "legally binding," there are no enforceable penalties for countries that fail to meet their emissions reductions targets. Nor will there be. That's because the world runs on fossil fuels and will for decades to come. Renewable energy advocates don't want to admit that, of course. Hence, the constant cheerleading around heavily subsidized wind and solar power. Yes, renewables are growing faster as coal-fired power plants are phased out in places such as the U.S., Canada, Europe and China. But fossil fuel consumption is also growing and won't plateau for decades to come. Don't take it from me. Consider what the International Energy Agency, or IEA, has to say. In its annual World Energy Outlook released Wednesday, the Paris-based agency says it expects global oil consumption to peak no sooner than 2040, almost a quarter of a century from now. Natural gas consumption is expected to jump 50 per cent. While demand for oil to power the world's one billion vehicles may eventually start to slow, the IEA, which provides energy data and research for 29 member countries, says other sources of energy demand are likely to more than offset any drop in gasoline consumption. "The difficulty of finding alternatives to oil in road freight, aviation and petrochemicals means that, up to 2040, the growth in these three sectors alone is greater than the growth in global oil demand," the IEA says. On the investment side, the IEA also expects the traditional fossil fuel sectors to attract the biggest share of capital spending globally. "A cumulative US$44 trillion in investment is needed in global energy supply in our main scenario, 60 per cent of which goes to oil, gas and coal extraction and supply, including power plants using these fuels," it says, "and nearly 20 per cent to renewable energies. An extra $23 trillion is required for improvements in energy efficiency." Compared to the 2000-15 period, when close to 70 per cent of total energy investment was focused on fossil fuels, this represents a marked decline. But once again, the IEA notes, that decline is gradual and fossil fuels will continue to attract the lion's share of investment. The bottom line: yes, the global energy system is changing. But change is likely to be slower than many expect and it may even stall once Trump is in office.

The federal government has released its long-term climate strategy with a caution that most Canadians - while sympathetic to the cause - don't yet understand the "magnitude of the challenge." The document suggests the country should find a way to cut emissions 80 per cent below 2005 levels by 2050 in order to match the ambition of the international Paris climate accord. That means ratcheting down Canada's entire output of greenhouse gases to 150 million tonnes a year. The most recent Environment Canada inventory assessed the country's carbon dioxide equivalent emissions at 732 million tonnes in 2014 - and slowly rising. "Most Canadians recognize the need to mitigate climate change and limit the increase in the global average temperature, but the magnitude of the challenge is less well understood, with a requirement for very deep emissions cuts from every sector by mid-century," says the 87-page plan, released Friday at an international climate conference in Morocco. Environment Minister Catherine McKenna was among those last year in Paris helping push for a target of limiting global warming to less than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and closer to 1.5 degrees. "Canada's Mid-Century Long-Term Low-Greenhouse Gas Development Strategy" says global emissions reductions of between 70 and 95 per cent are required in order to have a better than 50-50 chance of hitting the 1.5-degree temperature target. It lays out a number of strategies, including a major move to electrification for everything from transportation to building heating and industrial power. Forestry, agriculture, municipal waste, technological innovation and energy efficiency - 38 per cent of all emissions cuts needed to reach two degrees Celsius can be achieved through energy efficiencies, notes the paper - all get their own chapters, but Canada's oil and gas sector does not. Nor does the strategy paper mention the current political debate over approval of new, long-term fossil fuel infrastructure, including pipelines. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has already approved a major liquefied natural gas project for northern B.C. this fall and is poised to pronounce decisions on Kinder Morgan's proposed tripling of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline by mid-December. "Canada's mid-century strategy is not a blueprint for action and it is not policy prescriptive," states the document. "Rather, the report is meant to inform the conversation about how Canada can achieve a low-carbon economy." Environmental advocates were quick to weigh in. Sustainable Canada Dialogues, a group of more than 60 academics, offered its own report card Friday saying that "despite positive steps forward, the federal government has been unable so far to develop a coherent climate action plan largely because of its inability to address fossil fuels coherently." Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson, chair of the big-city mayors caucus in the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, was in Marrakech at the climate conference all week and has heard the anti-pipeline pitch repeatedly. "This is product that is already being extracted and processed, to some degree, today," said Iveson. "And it's going to continue to be as long as there's a market for it. And there's going to continue to be a market for it as we make this transition." Iveson used the example of Edmonton's looming shift to electric municipal buses, which will be a first in Canada. "But it will take me at least 15 years to phase out the last diesel bus - and only if the battery technology improves over the next 10 years to the point where I can use electric buses for all of our routes." As it stands, 20 per cent of Edmonton's bus routes are too long for current electric battery technology. "The notion that we could somehow stop powering our cities and our global economy with fossil fuel overnight just defies common sense." \</doc>

One can run but not hide from the aftershocks of Donald Trump's presidential victory. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is finding that out first-hand this week as his first trip outside Canada since the American election turns into a damage assessment mission. It is a testimony to the magnitude of the shift in the tectonic plates brought about by the U.S. outcome that there is not an international forum and precious few of the world's capitals that are not scrambling to pick up the post-election pieces. The questions raised by the imminent changing of the guard at the White House go well beyond the narrow scope of whether progressive governments such as Trudeau's can find productive common ground with a conservative president. Cuba was the first stop on the PM's itinerary this week. Until the U.S. vote, the prime minister might have expected to find some lingering buzz from President Barack Obama's historic visit to the island this spring. It was part of a thaw in the relationship between Cuba and the U.S. But in Havana, excitement has given way to trepidation. Uncertainty as to whether Trump will follow up on his predecessor's overtures has replaced momentum. On the campaign trail, the president-elect blasted Obama's visit to Cuba. Later this week Trudeau will land in Peru for the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. The organization's 12 member countries recently negotiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But the American election has sapped the impetus for the ratification of the massive free trade agreement. Last week, Obama formally abandoned plans to submit the deal to Congress for ratification before the end of his term in January. Trump wants no part of the TPP. The president-elect's shadow loomed large over this week's international climate change summit ( COP22 The accord's signatories - including Canada - argue that the changing of the guard in the White House will not diminish the political will to act in concert on climate change. Time will tell whether they are whistling past the graveyard of the Paris accord. A pivotal part of the infrastructure of the accord was an alliance between China and the U.S. They jointly agreed to a reduction in their carbon emissions. But Trump is not expected to hold to the American side of the bargain. On the heels of the U.S. election, Trudeau reaffirmed Canada's intention to lead a military deployment in Latvia as part of NATO's latest strategy to deter Russia. In Moscow, Trump's victory has been interpreted as an encouraging sign that could lead to NATO being forced to reconsider the deployment. A bit more than a week after Trump's victory, it has already become conventional wisdom that his installation in the White House will at least complicate, if not derail, Trudeau's Liberal agenda. There is truth in that. Under Stephen Harper, Canada took credit for playing host to the secret meetings that led to the U.S.-Cuba rapprochement. The Conservatives set the climate change targets that Trudeau is seeking to achieve as part of the obligations Canada contracted under the Paris agreement. One of the distinguishing features of Harper's foreign policy doctrine was his strong stance against Russian President Vladimir Putin's military goals. Trudeau's Latvia deployment fits into that doctrine, as does the ratification by the Liberals of the Canada-Ukraine free trade agreement initially negotiated under the Conservatives. And then, what would Harper - as a staunch champion of Israel - have made of the anti-Semitic undertones of some of the rhetoric of Trump's campaign? On Wednesday, interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose offered her caucus a few positive thoughts about Trump's victory. But when all is said and done, the president-elect poses a greater threat to Harper's trade and foreign policy legacy than Trudeau ever did. Chantal H#233;bert is a national affairs writer.

WASHINGTON, DC--(Marketwired - November 07, 2016) - Today, the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 22 ) opened in Marrakesh, Morocco -- a "perfect place for the world's biggest climate change conference," according to Quartz. Indeed Morocco's decades-long commitment to clean and sustainable energy is widely recognized, most recently by the 2016 Climate Change Performance Index, which ranked Morocco alongside Denmark, Sweden, and Belgium in the top ten most climatically conscious countries and number one in the developing world, based on criteria including CO2 emissions, renewable energy development, efficiency, and climate policy. To mark the start of this historic conference, which Morocco has dubbed "the COP of action" and which King Mohammed VI has vowed to make "a conference for Africa," here are the five ways Morocco is a climate change champion: "Morocco has made clear -- not just in words but in deeds -- for decades that it takes the issue of sustainable energy seriously," said former US Ambassador Edward Gabriel. "As the COP 21 signatories look to implement the policies put into place last year in Paris, the have much to learn from this year's host country."

Regardless if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump pulls back on his countrys federal commitments to combating climate change, Canada is moving forward as is the world on taking measures that strive to limit global warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels, says Environment Minister Catherine McKenna . I was at the Major Economies Forum with China, the EU, South Africa, UK, Japan and France, and everyone is absolutely committed to climate action, she told a media conference call on Thursday from the 22nd United Nations Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) in Marrakech, Morocco. McKenna added: Canadians know that climate change is among the greatest challenges of our time, and they also recognize the opportunity it brings. According to the environment minister, companies such as Suncor Energy Inc., TransCanada Corporation, Enbridge Inc., ATCO and TransAlta Corporation have representation at COP 22 , as they understand the benefits of Canadian leadership within a global conversation on reducing emissions, protecting the environment, and enhancing Canadas competitiveness and access to global markets in a low-carbon economy. We are in a transition period. We all know that and the world knows that. We have committed to action. We have put a price on carbon pollution and every province by 2018 must have a price on pollution. We will be announcing additional measures in the lead up and at the [next] first ministers meeting, and we know we need to do more. However, she added, the transition to a low-carbon economy will not occur immediately. Therefore, the federal government must take thoughtful action to ensure it is working with business, environmentalists, indigenous leaders, and all Canadians. We are going to come back [to COP]  as every country is going to come back  in five years, because we know we need to improve. But the market is clearly moving in a direction of a low-carbon future. Earlier this week, the federal government announced that it will contribute $14 million to reduce short-lived climate pollutants such as methane through partnerships with Mexico and Chile, assisting these countries to adopt clean technologies and employ Canadian expertise to reduce methane emissions ( HYPERLINK http://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2016/11/15/albertas-climate-plan-controls-competing-business-/ DOB, Nov. 15, 2016 ). As part of Canadas commitment of $2.65 billion over the next five years to help countries and communities worldwide pollute less, be better equipped to resist the effects of climate change, and make positive contributions to a global clean economy, funding to Mexicos oil and gas sector will reduce gas flaring from  plant operations, which is responsible for harmful emissions causing climate change and air pollution. In Chile, the funding aims to capture methane as it escapes from decomposing landfill sites, as well as diverting organic matter from the waste through composting. We are working extremely closely with all the countries in the world, because we know that we all need to do our part, McKenna said on Thursday. I have had a number of very good bilateral meetings with small island states and countries that need our support, and I am proud that Canada is stepping up, and we are stepping up at home. She added: When it comes to particular projects, we have an environmental assessment process, we announced transitional measures that will rebuild confidence in our environmental assessment process. With all projects, we take into account the emissions, and we make decisions based on science, evidence and facts, and when it comes to all projects, they also need to fit in with our climate plan  they need to take into account those emissions. On Wednesday, McKenna, along with Marie-Claude Bibeau, minister of international development and La Francophonie, also announced that Canada will invest nearly $1.8 billion to mobilize private-sector support for developing countries efforts to transition to cleaner, more sustainable economies. Leveraging private-sector investments in areas such as clean technology, climate-smart agriculture, sustainable forestry, and climate-resilient infrastructure, Canada will deliver support via a range of trusted partners  multilateral development banks with demonstrated expertise in innovative finance solutions to address climate change. Canadas bilateral support will focus, in particular, on female empowerment, and it will align with a commitment to support the UNs sustainable development goals. In supporting a wide range of partners and programs, Canada is ensuring that the worlds poorest and most vulnerable have access to the right tools and opportunities to make a difference, Bibeau stated in a news release. With this investment, Canada is not only helping developing countries transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient economies, but we are also advocating for the empowerment of women and girls. Marrakech is hosting the first COP meeting since delegates reached last years Paris Agreement, which strives to limit global warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels and calls for a transparent system to account for climate action while strengthening countries abilities to deal with climate impacts, recover from climate impacts, as well as support nations in building clean, resilient economies ( HYPERLINK http://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2015/12/14/environmentalists-support-paris-agreement-call-can/#axzz45Wlyst75 DOB, Dec. 14, 2015 ). \</doc>

$54M IN AID FOR HAITI DISASTER RECOVERY $158,173 IN PART, TO UPGRADE P.E.I. BOWLING ALLEY The Trudeau government has just marked its 3,000th spending announcement and, in doing so, has shown itself to be much more adroit in getting its MPs to hand out cheques than its predecessor. The majority Harper government of the 41st Parliament didn't make its 3,000th announcement until nearly two years into its mandate, on March 11, 2013. During the four-year 41st Parliament, Conservative MPs made 7,307 spending announcements, a total that Liberal MPs, at their current pace, should easily eclipse early in the third year of their mandate. That said, the Harper Conservatives moved more money out the door even though they made fewer announcements. By end of day on Friday - 396 days since last fall's election - Liberal MPs had made 3,030 announcements funding projects worth a combined $18.9 billion. It took the Harper Conservatives just 72 days after the May 2, 2011, election for that government to eclipse $18.9 billion in spending announcements. The spending announcement figures are culled from a database maintained exclusively by the National Post that draws from the thousands of press releases issued by the government over the last eight years in which government MPs and ministers take credit for the allocation of a grant, contribution, or loan from the federal treasury. And it is always government MPs who get their names on the press releases when a cheque is handed out. Opposition MPs are never mentioned even when the project to be funded is in an opposition MP's riding. The 3,000th announcement to be registered in the database from the current government occurred Thursday when Environment Minister Catherine McKenna, at the COP22 climate-change conference in Marrakech, Morocco, announced a contribution of $3 million to the World Bank Transformative Carbon Asset Facility. Other recent spending announcements include $54 million in aid for Haiti, announced Friday by International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau during a visit to Port-au-Prince; a new container terminal at the Port of Montreal built with a $44-million contribution from the federal government, opened Friday by Transport Minister Marc Garneau; and $1.5 million to expand a national diabetes prevention program, announced by Health Minister Jane Philpott last Monday. But the Trudeau government, like the Harper government before it, has plenty of money for smaller projects, the kind that helps a local MP get noticed back home. For example: ..In tiny Tyne Valley, P.E.I. (pop. 266), the Liberal MP Bobby Morrissey provided a grant of $158,173 that will help, among other things, upgrade a bowling hall, beloved by the community as "a popular local venue for a variety of community events and ... home to several bowling leagues," according to a press release. ..Liberal MP Nick Whalen had a few cheques to hand out Friday in the Newfoundland and Labrador community of Torbay, near St. John's, including one for $150,250 for the local Kinsmen's club to build a splash pad for kids. ..Liberal MP Rene Arsenault, who knocked off Conservative incumbent and cabinet minister Bernard Valcourt last fall in the northwestern New Brunswick riding of Madawaska- Restigouche, brought home cheques for 25 maple syrup producers in his riding. The producers split more than $7 million in federal loans announced by Arsenault on Nov. 7. The money for Torbay's splash pad and Tyne Valley's bowling hall were drawn from a $300-million Parliament-approved pool of money to fund all sorts of projects to mark Canada's 150th anniversary in 2017. The fund was established by the Harper Conservatives in its 2015 budget and was, at the time, denounced by Liberal MPs Adam Vaughan and Judy Sgro as nothing more than a "slush fund" for Conservative MPs to dip into to improve re-election chances. But once in office, the Liberals kept the Canada 150 fund going and have been busy dipping into it. In their first year in office, the Trudeau Liberals have made 207 announcements that draw money from the Canada 150 fund and the vast majority has gone to fund projects in ridings held by Liberal MPs. The National Post database has logged 155 Canada 150 spending announcements worth a combined $27.9 million for projects in Liberal ridings. Just 15 announcements worth a combined $876,000 have been announced for projects in ridings held by Conservatives and 21 Canada 150 announcements worth $1,078,780 have been announced for NDP ridings. Louis Plamondon is the only BQ MP to have seen any Canada 150 cash come his way. The feds will spend $47,087 for some new playground equipment in Grand-Saint-Esprit in his riding of B\'e9cancour-Nicolet-Saurel. Just a handful of Canada 150 projects are for initiatives where the spending will occur over several ridings held by MPs of different political persuasions. !@COPYRIGHT=\Â£9 2016 Postmedia Network Inc.

Alberta did not write its action plan on climate change based on an ambitious U.S. climate agenda, and even if President-elect Donald Trump does not pursue progressive federal-level measures in his own country, the provinces oilsands emissions cap already controls for competitiveness in an American business-as-usual situation. On the oilsands emissions limit, that was something industry had asked for, they did not ask for it in the context of robust U.S. leadership on climate  they asked us for those initiatives in the context of essentially the status quo or  business as usual in the United States, Environment and Parks Minister Shannon Phillips told a media conference call on Monday from the 22nd United Nations Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) in Marrakech, Morocco. That part moves forward, and it moves forward because we still get to have conversations with communities, our neighbouring provinces, and with others around the responsible extraction of our energy resources. According to Phillips, who is also the minister responsible for the climate change office, Albertas shift away from coal is part of an international movement. Across North America the economics of coal-fired power generation remains challenged because of the low price of natural gas, along with renewable energy. Subnational jurisdictions in the U.S. continue to see the economic logic of coal alternatives, regardless of their theoretical views on climate change. We also see many initiatives at sub-national levels in the United States  Washington State, California and the Eastern Seaboard states. In many ways, it moves forward because there is so much momentum around global action on climate change. In regards to carbon pricing, Phillips said the Peoples Republic of China is moving into a cap-and-trade system next year, which reinforces that carbon pricing is increasingly something that much of the world is doing. From our perspective on carbon pricing, Canada remains a leader and we will continue to be a leader through the carbon-pricing leadership committee with the World Bank and with others. Ernest Moniz, U.S. Secretary of Energy, spoke at the ongoing COP 22 , telling delegates that energy efficiency holds a $23 trillion private-investment potential in the developing world alone, noted Phillips. She said her province wants to ensure it is open to the job creation, diversification and other benefits that arise from a leadership position on carbon, given the business consensus and global consensus on the issue. What it means for us in Alberta is that we have an enormous amount of opportunity. As soon as you price carbon, you open up investment opportunities that were not there previously. That is why we have been spending some time at the World Bank with private-sector investors and others. Marrakech is hosting the first COP meeting since the Paris Agreement at COP 21, in which delegates reached an agreement that strives to limit global warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels and calls for a transparent system to account for climate action while strengthening countries abilities to deal with climate impacts, recover from climate impacts, as well as support nations in building clean, resilient economies ( HYPERLINK http://www.dailyoilbulletin.com/article/2015/12/14/environmentalists-support-paris-agreement-call-can/#axzz45Wlyst75 DOB, Dec. 14, 2015 ). We have really focused on ensuring that we are using this time to meet with investors, meet with folks from international financial institutions, and others, in order to really lay that groundwork for the tremendous amount of investment we know will flow into Alberta as a result of these actions, Phillips said, adding subnational governments are discussing climate action and opportunities at the subnational level. A lot of folks know what we are up to [in] Canada and around Alberta specifically in terms of carbon pricing and recycling those revenues to lower- and- middle-income folks, into efficiency and renewables, cleantech and so on. That story has largely been told, and we are continuing to tell it. At the current COP meeting, governments can recommit to the new agenda of rapid implementation, not least in pressing forward with adequate support for vulnerable countries to take their own action. On Monday, for example, the federal government announced that it will contribute $14 million to reduce short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) such as methane through partnerships with Mexico and Chile. These pollutants are powerful greenhouse gases that also have negative effects on peoples health, Catherine McKenna, minister of environment, stated in a news release. This investment will help grow a global clean economy and will benefit Mexicans, Chileans, and Canadians as it will make the air cleaner, protect our health, and slow warming on the planet we all share and for which we all care. Assisting countries to adopt clean technologies and employ Canadian expertise to reduce methane emissions, in Mexicos oil and gas sector the funding will reduce gas flaring from  plant operations, which is responsible for harmful emissions causing climate change and air pollution. In Chile, the funding aims to capture methane as it escapes from decomposing landfill sites, as well as diverting organic matter from the waste through composting. This weeks funding announcement is part of Canadas commitment of $2.65 billion over the next five years to help countries and communities around the world pollute less, be better equipped to resist the effects of climate change, and make a positive contribution to a global clean economy. \</doc>

Indigenous leaders are frustrated they've been invited to a separate meeting with the prime minister today ahead of his climate change discussions with the premiers in Ottawa. Natan Obed, the president of the national Inuit organization, said Thursday it has been "frustrating and problematic" the way provinces and territories have been engaging with indigenous leaders in advance of the first ministers meetings. Indigenous people should be directly involved in the climate change talks, he said, calling such inclusion critical in what the federal Liberal government describes as a time of renewed reconciliation. Climate change hurts the Inuit way of life, he added. "There are parts of first ministers meetings that are specifically between provinces and territories and the federal government and that's fine, that's fair," Obed said. "But for anything that affects our rights, that is about us, it doesn't make any sense for the first ministers to consider solutions and decide on solutions on our behalf without us in the room." Assembly of First Nations Ontario Regional Chief Isadore Day, the organization's co-chair on climate change, said First Nations deserve to be treated with the same respect as premiers and territorial leaders. Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne supports the push to have indigenous leaders participate in today's meeting between Justin Trudeau and the premiers, Day added, noting she needs support from other premiers to compel the prime minister to act. The prime minister is to meet this morning with the leaders of three indigenous organizations - Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the Assembly of First Nations and the Metis National Council - along with U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden. The indigenous leaders want the premiers there, too, but have no confirmation they'll all come. The Prime Minister's Office said Trudeau is looking forward to discussions with both the premiers and indigenous organizations to follow up on the government's plans to price carbon and phase out coal by 2030 and to discuss the federal government's recent decisions to approve the Kinder Morgan and Line 3 pipelines. However, there are no plans to formally bring the indigenous organizations into the first ministers meeting. Northwest Territories Premier Bob McLeod said Thursday provinces and territories are unified in understanding that the cost of doing nothing to fight climate change is far worse than acting to alleviate its effects. "We all know that northern territories are the most affected by climate change, yet we are only a very small population and a very large land mass," he said. "A large part of the problem is nationally and internationally." While climate is the main focus of the first ministers meeting, the premiers also plan to raise the contentious issue of health-care spending during a working dinner tonight. The issue has been an ongoing irritant between Ottawa and the provinces and territories, who are united in their opposition to federal plans to cut the rate of increase on federal health transfers to the provinces from six per cent to three per cent in April, while eyeing targeted investments in areas like home care. B.C. Health Minister Terry Lake said Thursday he is pleased there will be a discussion between Trudeau and the premiers, but said he would be quite surprised if a health accord is negotiated by the end of the year - a timeline that federal Health Minister Jane Philpott had in mind. The sensible thing to do would be to roll over the current six per cent formula while the provinces, territories and the federal government have an opportunity to get a longer-term agreement in place, Lake said. "We are having a real dilemma putting together our budget not knowing what the contribution from the federal government will be." Nova Scotia Health Minister Leo Glavine outlined what appears to be a developing deal on health funding. Glavine said his province could live with a smaller annual increase in the health transfer if the federal government puts enough money into the new health accord, which is intended to target funding on four priorities: homecare, mental health, innovation and pharmaceuticals. "That's where we feel that we could get a strong assist to deliver health care so that if there were less money in the actual transfer over the next 10-year period, we \</doc>

Seems a little odd that Prime Minister Trudeau should show up in Vancouver Monday to outline plans to make the harbour safe for oil-and gas-tanker traffic on the same day the world's climate community gathers in Marrakech to outline their plans to shut down such traffic. Welcome to the wonky world of carbon contradiction, in which the backers of the 2015 Paris climate agreement go about the earnest business of global carbon reduction while the same nations - including Canada - join hands with big business to keep the carbon economy humming. About 10,000 politicians, bureaucrats, corporate PR weasels, green activists, NGOs, rent-seekers, UN officials and other members of the carbon-control movement have descended on the Moroccan city for the 22nd meeting of the Congress of the Parties (COP) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The congress opened Monday in a celebratory mood, reports say. Over the next two weeks, through to Nov. 18, the objective is to keep the carbon-control train moving forward to achieve its Paris target - to hold the global rise in temperatures to about 1.5 degrees Celsius. But this is not the Marrakech Express. It's a train to nowhere, or at least a train that will never get where it wants to go. A report last week from the United Nations said that national carbon-reduction commitments under the Paris Agreement will fail to reduce temperatures. By 2030, said the UN report, the world will still be on track for temperature increases of up to 3.4 degrees "even if the Paris pledges are fully implemented." Canada and the United States were singled out for falling short of their pledges, which means they might have to "purchase offsets" from other countries. But nobody expects much progress in Marrakech. As usual, the big event is portrayed as another last chance on the road to saving the planet. "The eyes of the world are on us," said Morocco's minister of foreign affairs. Well, not quite, since the eyes of the world are actually on the U.S. election through the first week of the climate meeting. As the meeting progresses, and as the eyes of the world shift perhaps to Marrakech, what they will see is a climate-and carbon-policy quagmire. Over the years it has become abundantly clear that, despite more than two decades of UN and COP meetings - from Kyoto to Cancun to Paris and Marrakech - the world actually needs and wants the very carbon that the Congress of the Parties keeps trying to eliminate. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), carbon emissions from coal, oil and natural gas have doubled from 15 gigatonnes in 1971 to about 33 gigatonnes in 2014. The last time the COP gang met in Marrakech, in 2001, they boldly adopted detailed rules for meeting the Kyoto Protocol targets. That was COP7, but it's not an anniversary likely to be celebrated this week. Kyoto was a total bust. Today, as COP22 meets, global carbon emissions are 30 per cent higher than they were when they met in Marrakech in 2001. The international carbon-control PR machine keeps working at conveying a sense of progress in their attempts to curb carbon-based fuels. A news release from the IEA in late October claimed that renewable energy "surpassed coal last year" as the largest source of electricity. The word renewables may sound like clean wind and solar, but in fact wind and solar - despite billions in subsidies and hype - account for less than five per cent of global electricity production. The major "renewable" is hydro power, which accounts for another 16.5 per cent. Speaking of coal. Here's how the Paris/Marrakech/COP carbon-control racket works. The Guardian reports that Greece is about to build two massive 1,100-megawatt coal plants at a cost of $3.5 billion. To help pay for the plants, Greece will receive free carbon allowances worth $2.4 billion under a European Union carbon plan - carbon trading in action. The stations, burning high-carbon coal, will emit seven-million tonnes of CO2 a year. Then there's India, which - according to a news report from New Delhi - will be a "global coal production bright spot with the country increasing global market share of output from 10.1 per cent in 2016 to 13.1 per cent by 2020." The Institute for Energy Research last year reported that "China is building one coal-fired power plant every 7 to 10 days, while Japan plans to build 43 coal-fired power projects to replace its shuttered nuclear units." The world seems to want and need more carbonbased energy, not less. Canadian energy consultant Tom Adams, looking at Ontario's future energy needs, speculates that, as gas prices rise and nuclear refurbishment issues develop, the province may have to turn to cheap and abundant coal in future, despite Ontario's current claims to being a global renewable champion. Nothing of substance is likely to come out of Marrakech because that is not what the world really wants. Canada may talk the talk, but when Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in Vancouver Monday, he did not say he would ban tanker traffic along the B.C. coast. Instead, he promised a major $1.5-billion increase in Canada's capacity to deal with some of the risks of tanker traffic. Like the rest of the world, Canada depends on fossil fuels to keep its economy growing. Everybody knows it, including the 10,000 players in Marrakech. !@COPYRIGHT=\Â£9 2016 Postmedia Network Inc.

Environment Minister Catherine McKenna has a final environmental assessment of the Pacific NorthWest LNG project in hand, with the federal cabinet set to meet Tuesday in the national capital. A decision from the federal government on the proposed $36-billion project in northern British Columbia must be made no later than next Monday. When it happens, it will mark the first true litmus test of how Prime Minister Justin Trudeau navigates competing interests between environmentalists and First Nations concerned about climate change and salmon habitat and pro-development advocates, including the B.C. government of Christy Clark. The liquefied natural gas processing plant on Lelu Island near Prince Rupert would ship 19 million tonnes a year of frozen, liquefied gas to markets in Asia while pumping more than five million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually into the atmosphere. The federal government's acceptance or rejection of the project will set the table for an autumn of crucial decisions on a national climate change plan and energy sector infrastructure. McKenna is to sit down with her provincial and territorial counterparts next Monday in Montreal to begin hammering out a pan-Canadian strategy for meeting Canada's international commitments on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A draft assessment of the LNG project, whose major partner is Malaysia's state-owned Petronas, was released in February by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency. The agency found that the project was "likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects," although it said mitigation measures would result in no serious harm to fish habitat. Carbon dioxide emissions will reach 5.3 million tonnes a year from the LNG plant, according to the draft report, not including another 6.5 million to 8.7 million tonnes produced from natural gas collection and transportation. "This will increase the B.C. and national emission totals by 8.5 per cent and 0.75 per cent respectively, based on 2011 levels," said an early project assessment. "To date, clear guidance on how Canada and B.C. will address this issue has not been communicated." The Liberals added an additional three-month assessment period last spring to gather more information, and the final CEAA report was delivered last week. Caitlin Workman, a spokeswoman for the federal environment and climate change minister, said the environmental assessment "is one part of what the final decision-making will take into account." "The final decision will include the best available facts and science and evidence at hand needed to make a decision that does the best to protect the environment while considering our country's economy," Workman said. "At this time, we are still awaiting the finalization of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency's extended review of the project," Spencer Sproule said in an email. "Once a decision by the government of Canada is made, Pacific NorthWest LNG will conduct a total review of the proposed LNG facility prior to tabling it to the project's shareholders for a final investment decision." And sometime this fall, as negotiations over climate change plans and resource projects continue, the federal government said it will formally ratify the international Paris Accord, under which Canada committed to cut the country's greenhouse gas emissions 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. ENERGY DATES The fall of 2016 is shaping up as a period of crucial decisions by the federal government on climate policy and energy infrastructure. Here are some key dates: Sept. 20 - The federal government announced it would not seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada on a ruling that impacted the Northern Gateway pipeline proposal and First Nations consultation. The Federal Court of Appeal overturned the conditional approval of the oil pipeline in June, ruling that Ottawa failed to properly consult First Nations affected by the pipeline. The Liberal government said it agreed with the court judgment, and pointed the finger of blame at the previous Conservative government. Oct. 2 - The final, three-month review period for an environmental assessment of a liquefied natural gas export terminal in Prince Rupert concludes. Ottawa must decide by this date whether to approve the Pacific NorthWest LNG project, whose principal investor is Malaysia's state-owned Petronas. Oct. 3 - Federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna meets in Montreal with her provincial and territorial counterparts to begin final negotiations on a pan-Canadian climate plan based on the policy reports of four federalprovincial working groups. Nov. 1 - Report due from the threeperson federal review panel doing indigenous consultations on Kinder Morgan's proposed Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. Nov. 7 -18 - The 22nd Council of the Parties to the UN's international climate negotiations, or COP22 , takes place in Marrakech, Morocco, where national representatives are supposed to present an update on policy changes designed to make last year's landmark Paris climate agreement a reality. November/December - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has promised to sit down with provincial and territorial premiers to finalize a climate plan that will set Canada on course to cut emissions 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. The Prime Minister's Office says the date of the promised first ministers meeting has not yet been determined. Dec. 19 - Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr has said the federal cabinet will make a decision by this date on whether to approve or reject construction of an expanded Trans Mountain pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific port in Burnaby \</doc>

A year ago, I listened to Justin Trudeau talk about "sunny ways"( HYPERLINK http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/ns-prof-trudeau-sunny-ways-1.3280693 http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/ns-prof-trudeau-sunny-ways-1.3280693 ) for Canada. I cautiously believed in a new, bright, reconciliatory moment for our country. Yet last week, in response to Donald Trump's election, Trudeau spoke about his "shared values"( HYPERLINK http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-trump-canada-us-relations-1.3843142 ) with Americans. As a Canadian studying in the United States, I have been surprised and shocked by the outcome of last week's presidential election. As a graduate student researching climate change, I am horrified that a country as important as the United States will be led by someone who denies climate change; he will be the only leader of a major industrial country to t( HYPERLINK http://mashable.com/2016/11/09/trump-climate-denier-president/#lQraHAwHFkqE http://mashable.com/2016/11/09/trump-climate-denier-president/#lQraHAwHFkqE )ake that stance. However, what really worries me is how Prime Minister Trudeau will act on climate change in response to the U.S. election. Many conservative Canadian pundits are hailing a new era, saying that the Keystone XL pipeline - which was vetoed by U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this year - will come "back from the dead."( HYPERLINK http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-oil-good-or-bad-1.3843375 http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-oil-good-or-bad-1.3843375 ) Seemingly unaware of market forces that are accelerating renewable energy( \~ HYPERLINK http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-25/record-green-power-installations-beat-fossil-fuel-for-first-time http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-25/record-green-power-installations-beat-fossil-fuel-for-first-time ), they apparently assume that there will be pipelines galore criss-crossing the United States and Canada. What is Trudeau's response to these voices? Just how far do "shared values" go? Do they replace our "sunny ways"? During Canada's elections last year, a record number of young people voted for change. We voted in favour of lowering greenhouse-gas emissions so that global warming world would stay within two degrees Celsius, as the Liberal Party promised. We voted in favour of stimulating renewable energy jobs - another Liberal promise( HYPERLINK https://www.trudeaumetre.ca https://www.trudeaumetre.ca Yet, Trudeau has yet to deliver on any of these promises. While he has taken an important step in announcing a carbon price( HYPERLINK https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/10/03/5-things-to-know-about-canadas-carbon-pricing-plans.html ) (the details of which are yet to be determined), the Liberal government has proved exorbitantly sympathetic to pipelines( \~ HYPERLINK http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-14/trudeau-clears-path-for-canada-to-approve-kinder-morgan-pipeline http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-14/trudeau-clears-path-for-canada-to-approve-kinder-morgan-pipeline ). Despite opposition( \~ HYPERLINK http://climate101.ca/reasons-why / ) and concern( \~ HYPERLINK http://canadians.org/energyeast http://canadians.org/energyeast HYPERLINK http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-14/trudeau-clears-path-for-canada-to-approve-kinder-morgan-pipeline ) - as well as the Pacific NorthWest Liquified Natural Gas project. Scientifically, there is no way( HYPERLINK http://www.carbontracker.org/resources http://www.carbontracker.org/resources / ) the prime minister can promote pipelines while still promulgating Canada as a climate leader. Canada's oil reserves are the third-largest in the world( \~ HYPERLINK http://www.energy.alberta.ca/Oilsands/791.asp ) - if we continue to expand our extraction, there is no feasible way we can avoid severe climate change thresholds( \~ HYPERLINK http://priceofoil.org/2016/09/22/the-skys-limit-report/ ). Nonetheless, Trudeau made a promise that Canada would act on climate change. I have been to several United Nations climate change negotiations, including the COP21 talks in Paris last December. I stood shaking as I saw Trudeau address the world and say that Canada was "back." I wanted him to lead on climate change, to change course from the previous Harper government's policies. Over and over, I listened to Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna assure youth that Canada was going to lead. When the Paris Agreement was signed, we knew it wouldn't be enough( HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/23/ratifiying-the-paris-agreement-will-be-a-major-step-but-must-be-the-first-of-many https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/23/ratifiying-the-paris-agreement-will-be-a-major-step-but-must-be-the-first-of-many ) to adequately fight climate change - but it was an important first step. This week, the United Nations is meeting yet again for its yearly climate talks, at the COP22 conference in Morocco. Canadian youth( HYPERLINK http://www.ourclimate.ca/?utm_campaign=cydailynov11_12&;utm_medium=email&;utm_source=ourclimate http://www.ourclimate.ca/?utm_campaign=cydailynov11_12&;utm_medium=email&;utm_source=ourclimate ) at these talks have noted that Canadian negotiators need to step up with more leadership. It is clear that - if Trudeau is serious about leading on climate change, as he so often asserts - many fossil fuels will need to remain below ground( \~ HYPERLINK http://calgaryherald.com/business/energy/suncor-discussing-the-possibility-of-leaving-oil-in-ground-with-albertas-government http://calgaryherald.com/business/energy/suncor-discussing-the-possibility-of-leaving-oil-in-ground-with-albertas-government ) As a matter of fact, reports found that in order for the world to meet its Paris Agreement goals, no new fossil fuels can be drilled( \~ HYPERLINK http://priceofoil.org/2016/09/22/the-skys-limit-report/ http://priceofoil.org/2016/09/22/the-skys-limit-report/ ). I fear that a Trump presidency will allow Canadians to settle for the status quo, comparing ourselves to the U.S. and using it as an excuse for inaction. Canada has so much potential to be a leader in renewable energy. Let's take this moment as an opportunity to do just that.

MARRAKECH, Morocco - The election of a U.S. president who has called global warming a "hoax" alarmed environmentalists and climate scientists and raised questions Wednesday about whether America, once again, would pull out of an international climate deal. Several scientists warned that Earth will likely reach dangerous levels of warming if President-elect Donald Trump fulfills his campaign pledges to undo the Obama administration's climate policies. Many people at U.N. climate talks in Morocco said it's now up to the rest of the world to lead efforts to rein in greenhouse gas emissions. Others held out hope that Trump would change his stance and honour U.S. commitments under the Paris Agreement.

Small island nations fear they will be swallowed by rising seas. More than 100 countries, including the U.S., have formally joined the agreement, which seeks to reduce emissions and help vulnerable countries adapt to rising seas, intensifying heat waves, the spreading of deserts and other changes from man-made warming. "I'm sure that the rest of the world will continue to work on it," Moroccan chief negotiator Aziz Mekouar said at the climate talks. Brendan Smialowski / AFP / Getty ImagesUS Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is given a miner's hat during a rally May 5, 2016 in Charleston, West Virginia Others weren't so sure, with scientists and environmental activists calling Trump's election a planetary disaster. "The Paris Agreement and any U.S. leadership in international climate progress is dead," said Dana Fisher, director of the Program for Society and the Environment at the University of Maryland, said in an email. However, the transition toward cleaner energy is so entrenched in the U.S. it would continue without federal money, she added. The U.S., under the Bush administration, declined to join the previous climate deal, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which greatly reduced the accord's impact. But President Barack Obama made climate change a priority and was instrumental in making the Paris accord come together. The goal is to keep the rise in global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius, compared with preindustrial times. Temperatures, though, have already gone up by half that amount. Trump pledged in May to "cancel" the Paris deal. Ng Han Guan / Associated Press A man and a child wear masks during a heavily polluted day in Beijing, China, Saturday, Nov. 5, 2016 "Without U.S. action to reduce emissions and U.S. diplomatic leadership, implementation of Paris will surely slow and avoiding a 2 degree warming, the benchmark of danger, would become impossible," said Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer via email. About 21 per cent of the accord's expected reductions in heat-trapping gases through 2030 were to come from the United States, according to Drew Jones, co-director of Climate Interactive , a group of researchers who model climate emissions and temperatures. Trump has called for stripping regulations to allow unfettered production of coal, oil and natural gas - a key source of emissions - and rescinding the Clean Power Plan , an Obama administration strategy to fight climate change. Trump told an oil and gas conference in North Dakota he would "save the coal industry" and stop using tax dollars for global warming programs. MosaÂ£b Elshamy / Associated PressParticipants visit the Moroccan section on the second day of COP22 , in Marrakech, Morocco, Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016 But it's unlikely that Trump's actions would reopen coal mines or coal-fired power plants. What really killed coal in the United States is much cheaper natural gas from hydraulic fracturing or fracking, said former astronaut Jay Apt, now co-director of the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center. In a phone interview from Pittsburgh, Apt said it is likely the nation will use even less coal if Trump opens up more drilling and the price of natural gas drops. The pro-fossil fuels American Energy Alliance said Trump's victory presents a chance to reset "harmful energy policies" in the U.S. While shell-shocked American climate activists in Marrakech cried and embraced, U.S. negotiators declined to speak to reporters about the election outcome. Before the two-week conference, U.S. officials said they expect other countries to stay the course no matter what Washington decides. Li Shuo, a climate policy expert at Greenpeace in China, said his nation - the world's top polluter - would continue to work on climate change "out of its own very genuine concern." Brendan Smialowski / AFP / Getty ImagesUS Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump holds a miner's helmet up after speaking during a rally May 5, 2016 in Charleston, West Virginia Any U.S. withdrawal would take four years - an entire presidential term - under the terms of the agreement. However, Trump could also decide to simply ignore the U.S. pledge to reduce emissions by 26-28 per cent from 2005 levels by 2025. There is no punishment for countries that miss their targets. "If the U.S. drags its feet on climate in the next four years, then there is nothing stopping the rest of the world doing an awful lot," scientist Glen Peters of the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo, Norway, said in an email. Trump's win sparked hopes among the minority of researchers who disagree with the overwhelming scientific consensus that global warming is a major threat. "Expect some long awaited, rigorous examination of the theory/models," John Christy of the University of Alabama, Huntsville, said in an email.

The fall parliamentary session starts Monday with the Liberals gliding toward their first anniversary in power. They are 20 points ahead of their nearest rivals in the polls and there are few signs of a pivot away from them. They have spent lavishly and pushed a progressive agenda, and urged voters to have faith that their policies will produce the growth to pay for the largesse. Their government has been embraced with the intense fan frenzy normally lavished on boy bands. But if their debut was an immense success, they may soon experience the symptoms of "difficult second album" syndrome. Much of the government's early efforts tackled issues entirely within the bailiwick of the federal government - restoring the long-form census, doubling the number of familyclass immigration applications and launching an inquiry into murdered and missing indigenous women. But this fall, several major policy decisions need to be taken that involve consultation with provincial governments: a new climate-change plan, a fresh health accord, even decisions on pipeline infrastructure. The prime minister and his senior ministers have shown a remarkable capacity to build consensus when none appeared possible, such as the agreement in principle by most of the nation's finance ministers to enhance the Canada Pension Plan. But during the recent Liberal caucus retreat in Sudbury, Ont., Trudeau admitted the government faces a tough year. Canada has to come up with a climate change plan by Nov. 7, when COP22 meets in Morocco. There is currently no national greenhouse gas reduction plan. Canada is unlikely to meet even the modest emission targets set by the Harper government without more vigorous action. In Paris at COP21, Trudeau committed Canada to a more ambitious goal of limiting average temperature increases to 1.5 C. In March, premiers signed on to a communiqu\'e9 that suggested a low-carbon economy would result from a broad suite of measures, "including pricing carbon." But B.C. Premier Christy Clark said that could be interpreted broadly and Saskatchewan leader Brad Wall vowed to fight the imposition of a carbon tax by Ottawa. B.C. decided not to increase its carbon tax last month in a new provincial climate change plan, maintaining a freeze that has been in place for four years. Federal Environment Minister Catherine Mc-Kenna has said a finalized national carbon-pricing plan will emerge this fall and that she hopes B.C. will commit to any tax increases it includes. But with a provincial election set for next May, Clark is unlikely to be enthusiastic about new federal initiatives. Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Louis XIV's finance minister, once compared the art of taxation to plucking a goose - "obtaining the largest amount of feathers with the least possible amount of hissing." How will Trudeau react when geese attack? We may be about to find out. Pipelines is the other file set to cause the prime minister heartburn. Cabinet will decide by Christmas whether to approve the Trans-Mountain pipeline between Edmonton and Burnaby, B.C. The National Energy Board has give the go-ahead, subject to conditions, and the government must now decide whether it meets its enhanced criteria for "social licence." But the pipeline is hugely divisive on the Pacific coast. Approval would alienate some of Trudeau's environmental fellow travellers, including Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson, as well as First Nations. Yet, as Postmedia reported in April, the prime minister is convinced that one of the three major pipelines being proposed must make it to one coast or another if Canada is to get a world price for its resources. Ottawa may also be on a collision course with the provinces over the new multi-year health accord being negotiated this fall. Predictably for a federal health minister in a government that is running out of money, Jane Philpott has said she is unconvinced that putting more cash into provincial transfers is the best way to improve the health-care system. But the six-per-cent annual funding increases the provinces have enjoyed for the past 12 years end next April, after which the previous government said it would have to live on increases that match Canada's gross domestic product growth, or three per cent - whichever is higher. Health-care costs are rising and the population is aging, which the provinces say justifies larger transfers. Ottawa will send $36 billion to the provinces for health care this year, even as it racks up a deficit nudging $30 billion. The Liberals reneged in the past budget on a pledge to invest an extra $3 billion in better home-care services. Philpott has suggested that money could be delivered separately from health transfers. But the provinces' response to the suggestion of temporary, targeted funding was an unequivocal rejection. It is hard to see a way through this impasse. Even in Parliament, where they have a comfortable majority, the Liberals will face push-back from an opposition emboldened by its success last session in staring down the controversial Motion 6 that would have allowed the government to dictate the parliamentary agenda. Though the NDP and Conservatives will be distracted by their leadership contests, both can be expected to make vocal representation on issues such as electoral reform, where a special committee must recommend by Dec. 1 how to transform the system for electing MPs; on the legalization of marijuana, where an expert panel's conclusion on how cannabis should be manufactured and sold legally is due in November; and on a potentially hazardous peacekeeping mission in Africa, the details of which remain unclear. This conflation of vexations has the potential to catch the attention of people who don't follow public affairs closely - the silent majority that has been broadly supportive of Trudeau's quiet revolution. It may not prove to be a winter of discontent, but clouds are looming. The glorious summer the Liberals have enjoyed may soon be a fading memory.

WATERLOO, ON --(Marketwired - October 31, 2016) - Startling results from a new report out of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo find all 10 provinces and Yukon are not as prepared as they could be for floods. The report, Climate Change and the Preparedness of Canadian Provinces and Yukon to Limit Potential Flood Damage, surveyed 103 government representatives across 91 provincial and territorial ministries, departments and agencies between December 2015 to April 2016. Assessments focused on the preparedness of provinces and Yukon to limit flood damage relative to current and future major rainfall events, across 12 categories of assessment, including flood-plain mapping, land-use planning, public health and safety, and emergency preparedness and response. Using a scale from A (strong flood preparedness) to E (weak flood preparedness), the average score of the 10 provinces and Yukon is C-, suggesting there is considerable opportunity to limit future flood risk. Areas where the provinces and Yukon are not doing well include engagement with home and commercial property owners to identify and mitigate flood risks. Also, survey respondents often expressed frustration with municipalities that frequently override direction from the provinces to limit new development in flood-prone areas, thus putting homes and businesses at risk. "The financial and social costs to Canadians will mount if preparedness to extreme weather events, and in particular flooding, continues to receive limited attention. Premiers are showing leadership on carbon pricing. Now, they need to build upon this commitment by embracing adaptation to address extreme weather and flooding with equal enthusiasm -- this would be a strong position to lead with at COP 22 in Morocco," said Blair Feltmate, head of the Intact Centre and a professor in the School of Environment, Enterprise and Development at Waterloo. Based on feedback from those surveyed, the report recommends immediate actions to improve flood preparedness: 1. Chief Adaptation Officer: Provinces and Yukon should create the position of chief adaptation officer (CAO). The CAO, with direct accountability to the premier, would identify areas of strength and weakness in reference to flood preparedness and actions to mitigate risk. 2. Audited Flood Preparedness Reports: On a multi-year cycle, such as every five years, provinces and Yukon should issue audited public reports that document the state of flood preparedness. 3. Land-use Planning: Provinces and Yukon should mandate the restriction of new development in flood-prone areas, or at a minimum, that development in such areas be made flood-resilient. Where development already exists in known flood-prone areas, they should take action to limit potential flood damage. Municipalities should not be able to override direction from the provinces or Yukon that restricts development in flood prone areas, or that mandates flood resilient design. 4. Build Back Better: Where practically and actuarially cost-effective, infrastructure should be re-built to meet new and future-projected flood risks. Founded in 2015 with a gift from Intact Financial Corporation, Canada's largest property and casualty insurer, the Intact Centre helps homeowners, communities and businesses to reduce risks associated with climate change and extreme weather events.

WASHINGTON, DC--(Marketwired - August 01, 2016) - In a speech to the nation on July 30th marking the 17th anniversary of his reign, Morocco's King Mohammed VI lauded "what we have managed to achieve, a construction and development site and an oasis of security and stability, despite an international context characterized by a succession of crises and increasing tensions." The King spelled out domestic and foreign policy priorities -- including economic development, Morocco's bid to return to the African Union, and the future of the Western Sahara -- while urging citizens to participate in the country's upcoming parliamentary elections. "During the last 17 years, we have managed to implement thorough political reforms and carry out major economic and human development projects, which have reshaped the country," he said. "There is still much more to do, particularly as we are entering a new era, starting with the upcoming parliamentary elections "Citizens are the core element in the electoral process, not the parties, nor the candidates. Citizens are the source of power, which they delegate to their representatives. They have the power to hold them to account and replace them, on the basis of what they have achieved during their mandate. I therefore urge voters to act in good conscience and to have in mind the citizens' and nation's interest during the [elections] ." The King warned against political corruption, saying that "power is based on accountability, through monitoring and control mechanisms, law enforcement and, for elected officials, through elections and citizens' trust" and that "society, with all its components, has to fight corruption by rejecting it, publicly exposing those who are involved in it and educating its members to stay away from it ." Noting that political progress "needs to be supported by development," the King urged "all stakeholders, from public and private sectors alike" to "boost the competitiveness of our national economy," and welcomed the "increase in the number of international companies which have decided to invest in Morocco." On the Western Sahara, King Mohammed VI called 2016 a "'year of determination' as far as our territorial integrity is concerned," saying that Morocco will "remain open and ever ready to engage in constructive dialogue in order to find a final political settlement to this artificial dispute." The King reiterated that Morocco's recent decision to return to the African Union does not mean that "Morocco will relinquish its legitimate rights" on this issue. Rather, "[Morocco's] return to its natural place reflects our keenness to continue defending our interests from within the African Union and to enhance cooperation with our partners, at the bilateral and regional levels." The King highlighted Morocco's status "as a valued and cherished partner, thanks to its development and political model, as well as its role as a major player in promoting security and stability in the region and defending the cause of Africa," citing the country's role as co-chair of the Global Counterterrorism Forum, and its upcoming role as host of the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 22 ). The Moroccan Amercan Center for Polcy (MACP) is a non-profit organization whose principal mission is to inform opinion makers, government officials, and interested publics in the United States about political and social developments in Morocco and the role being played by the Kingdom of Morocco in broader strategic developments in North Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East.

Prepare for rapid change Your Nov. 15 article about just 30 per cent of Saskatoon's bridges being in very good condition raised a few questions in my mind. The world is moving ahead at a phenomenal speed, and such things as solar and wind power that were considered fringe technologies 25 years ago are now forming a new base for power supply. The BBC has reported that the Hyperloop, a proposed series of tubes that could shuttle humans and goods in pods at speeds up to 1,130 kph, could find an opportunity for actual realization in the United Arab Emirates by 2020. What if Saskatoon to Regina travel is reduced to about 15 minutes, and Prince Albert to Estevan to 30 minutes? Just as the roadways and air travel revolutionized services in the last century, such technological advancements could allow cost effective centralization of services such as health care, business, banking, education, social services and public administration. It will benefit a large section of the population and generate employment, opportunities for business, better access to education and prosperity for all. Are we getting ready for change? Like the leadership in health care, will we be known for leadership in transportation? How many will agree that, if we could make this happen in the next 10 years, it could provide a new opportunity for our children and next generations to prosper. The future is knocking at our door. What do we need to do to bring it in? Hemant Anand, P.Eng., Saskatoon No intention to act Climate scientists say the Earth is in great danger of warming more than two degrees Celsius within two decades. There is increasing evidence of this warming, to the point that it could make living and farming conditions difficult even for the northern hemisphere and impossible for many coastal and low-lying areas. I greatly doubt that hundreds of scientists around the world are running a big climate change hoax, and think that human causes of global temperature increases need to be controlled. I would like to see a workable plan that won't destroy our lives economically while still making changes needed to halt climate change. We live in a market economy, and almost no one is self-sufficient in producing their own food, clothing and other necessities. Our economy is powered largely by using oil products. Most jobs today require oil products for whatever service they provide. The federal government recently announced its intention to impose a carbon tax on all Canadians, without saying how it will use the proceeds to combat climate change. Cap and trade proposals have also been discussed, but these only create a market for trading carbon credits and won't reduce warming. Is there any non-tax proposal to reduce warming? Is there a plan to actually reduce the carbon in the atmosphere? How can we transition to a non-fossil fuel powered world and still ensure our economy doesn't die as a result? National governments have been discussing the problem for three decades and recently signed the COP 22 David Bridger, Saskatoon Students not out of line I am perplexed at the furor over EcoJustice students from the Catholic school division attending the recent "Stand with Standing Rock" rally in support of those who oppose the Dakota Access pipeline. The pipeline, rerouted because of the threat to Bismarck's water supply, will instead put at risk the water supply of the Standing Rock Sioux, along with desecrating sacred land and burial grounds that federal law is supposed to protect. Perhaps the students were heeding Pope Francis's reminder that "it is essential to show particular concern for indigenous communities and their cultural traditions. They are not merely one minority among others, but should be the principal dialogue partners, especially when large projects affecting their lands are proposed." The trustees, administration and John Gormley may wish to review the mission and vision of the Greater Saskatoon Catholic Schools, which says: "Through our encouragement and example, our students become people who feel a sense of responsibility to change the world for the better." They might then be able to heed Pope Francis's call that, "Environmental education ... needs educators capable of developing an ethics of ecology, and helping people, through effective pedagogy, to grow in solidarity, responsibility and compassionate care."

About Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) On 1 January 2016, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development -- adopted by world leaders in September 2015 at an historic UN Summit -- officially came into force. Over the next fifteen years, with these new Goals that universally apply to all, countries will mobilize efforts to end all forms of poverty, fight inequalities and tackle climate change, while ensuring that no one is left behind. The SDGs build on the success of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and aim to go further to end all forms of poverty. The new Goals are unique in that they call for action by all countries, poor, rich and middle-income to promote prosperity while protecting the planet. They recognize that ending poverty must go hand-in-hand with strategies that build economic growth and addresses a range of social needs including education, health, social protection, and job opportunities, while tackling climate change and environmental protection. While the SDGs are not legally binding, governments are expected to take ownership and establish national frameworks for the achievement of the 17 Goals. Countries have the primary responsibility for follow-up and review of the progress made in implementing the Goals, which will require quality, accessible and timely data collection. Regional follow-up and review will be based on national-level analyses and contribute to follow-up and review at the global level.

The Paris climate agreement officially comes into force today, but the celebrations in the climate community are muted amid fears that the election of a climate change skeptic as U.S. president could sink the deal. While the global climate change treaty is now legally in place \'e2\â¬  obliging the world to bring in measures starting in 2020, to limit the global temperature increase to no more than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels \'e2\â¬  the prospect of Republican candidate Donald Trump being elected is causing alarm. "It would take some steam out of the process, definitely," said Steven Guilbeault, who is the senior director of Quebec based environmental group Equiterre and a veteran observer of more than a dozen UN climate conferences. There are also warnings Canada's domestic climate change plans could be put at risk if Trump takes power. "If the U.S. stops these forward motions against climate change, then Canada is going to be in a really difficult situation," said Laura Dawson, director of the Canada Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington and an expert in trade and international agreements. "I think anything is possible and probably the extreme options are equally likely," Dawson told CBC News. Trump has been bluntly skeptical of global warming for years. He promised in a campaign speech at a Petroleum Conference in Bismarck, N.D., last May that he would scrap the Paris climate deal. "We're going to cancel the Paris climate agreement \'e2\â¬ \Â£6 and stop all payments of the United States tax dollars to UN global warming programs," Trump vowed. Trump has often used Twitter to express his views on climate change. Under President Barack Obama the U.S. has made climate change a priority, playing a key role in crafting the Paris climate agreement. In November 2014, Obama signed a landmark pact with China that put the world's two largest emitters in lockstep to cut carbon emissions. The U.S. vowed to cut emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025, while China agreed for the first time to cap its emissions by 2030. The deal broke the logjam in climate talks and paved the way for the Paris agreement. In September both China and the U.S. formally ratified the deal, prompting the rest of the world to follow. The next step in the process is the Marrakech Climate Conference ( COP 22 ) starting Monday, where more than 190 countries will negotiate the next steps for the deal. Growing nervousness As officials, negotiators and environmentalists head to Morocco, the possible effect of the U.S. election results on the negotiations is making some people nervous. "But some of them might say, 'Well listen, if the historical largest emitter of greenhouse gas isn't doing anything about it, why should we developing countries do something about it?' It would be a setback on the international scene." There are several ways Trump could legally abandon the Paris agreement if elected. He could pull out of the 1992 UN Convention on Climate Change that is the umbrella agreement for the Paris deal within a year of taking office. He could also wait until the end of his first term to use a provision in the Paris agreement to pull out of the pact. Or he could simply ignore the plans Obama has made to cut carbon emissions, ensuring the U.S. doesn't meet its promises. Canada could be left 'high and dry' That would be a huge setback to the work Canada and the U.S. have done jointly on climate change over the last few years, according to Dawson. "I'm concerned that Canada is going to be left high and dry, if there is a Trump presidency, on energy policies," she said. The two countries have signed a list of deals to cut emissions, including an exchange of hydro power to help U.S. states get off coal. They also share targets to cut methane emissions and plan to reach a goal of 50 per cent clean power by 2025. Ontario and Quebec now jointly share a cap-and-trade system with California. In fact, the Trudeau government's climate strategy and the energy policies of provinces like Ontario are based on the expectation that their largest trading partner will soon have a price on carbon as well. Dawson said that if Canada ends up with higher energy costs than the U.S., businesses will think twice about locating here when they can ignore climate policies that Canada holds dear. China weighs in The potential Trump effect on global climate change initiatives also prompted a rare comment on the U.S. election from China. "If they resist this trend, I don't think they'll win support of their people, and their country's economic and social progress will also be affected," said China's top climate negotiator, Xie Zhenhua. "I believe a wise political leader should take policy stances that conform with global trends." One of the largest environmental groups in the U.S. says China's comments are a big deal. "I think that is quite a rare moment where another country would comment on the dynamics of an election," said Jake Schmidt, senior adviser to the Action Fund of the Natural Resources Defense Council. "The reality is the business community wants this, that the investor community is already moving in this direction," he said. Combined with pressure from other countries, Schmidt hopes those forces would encourage even a climate change skeptic to "see the light and stick to the agreement." \</doc>

Energy-conservation, competition go together In the battle against climate change, we are properly encouraged to conserve energy, which should be good for both the environment and our wallets. Alas, when it comes to electricity and water, two essential services, governments have proven either incompetent or irresponsible in managing costs to consumers. In my household, we have shifted electricity use to off-peak hours as much as possible. Meanwhile, what has happened to off-peak hydro rates? They have increased from 2.7 cents per kilowatt/hour in May 2008 to 8.7 cents per KW/hr in May 2016. That's a whopping 222-per-cent increase in eight years, well beyond the rate of inflation during the same period. I am not making these figures up. My source is the Ontario Energy Board. Water rates have gone up 14 per cent over the past three years. Not as bad as hydro, but still well beyond the rate of inflation. Meanwhile, over the past several years we have seen long-distance telephone rates go down to the point where we don't even think about their cost, which used to be prohibitive for all but the wealthy at one time. How did this come about? The answer is technology and the elimination of monopolies. Given the monopoly enjoyed by local and provincial governments for the supply of water and electricity, perhaps the time has come to unleash the power of competition and let the market do what it does best. Government should get out of the way and limit itself to enacting regulations to ensure fair competition and protection of consumers. That is its proper role. It has certainly proven unable to control costs. Tony Manera, Kanata When cyclists should ride single file Cyclists, ride single file; it might save your life! Knowing the rules, whether you're a cyclist or driver, is important if injuries and deaths are to be avoided. Recently, I was on McCordick Road near Kemptville, a two-lane highway, with several other cars, when we came upon a group of four cyclists riding side-by-side. We were on a long hill with solid, no-passing lines. Despite numerous honks, the cyclists refused to move over, making it difficult to pass safely. Luckily none of the drivers was a hothead; each waited for a safe opportunity to pass. However, when the drivers and their passengers did so, there were hand gestures and verbal expletives directed at the cyclists. A cyclist myself, I slowed my car as I passed them and told them they were giving all cyclists a bad name. They signalled to me to pull over, which I did at a safe spot. Perhaps noticing I had Quebec licence plates, the cyclists explained to me that in Ontario, unlike Quebec, it is not illegal to ride side-by-side. They were adamant that this was not wrong. Later, I checked with the government of Ontario Ministry of Transportation. I was told there were rules for riding in groups and was referred to Ontario's Guide to Safe Cycling. Under the section Travelling in Groups, it states "Ride in single file on two lane roads or when traffic is heavy on multilane roads." The police confirmed that cyclists should move to single file on such roads. Bob McRae, Aylmer No need to make voting reform complex Re: Different Way to Count Ballots, Oct. 11. I believe MP Ron McKinnon will find that his proposal of "ranked pairs" will produce the same results as simple "ranked ballots," or preferential voting. What he proposes is a very complex process to arrive at voters' ranking of the candidates their constituency. But it would not produce a different result than simply ranking candidates from most to least preferred. The election outcome would be the same. Let's keep it as simple as possible. Don Ogston, Ottawa Canada needs true proportional representation I agree with Ron McKinnon that ranked-pairs voting can elect an MP with majority approval for a particular riding. However, that does not guarantee that Parliament as a whole will reflect the choice of the voters. Minority parties with broad support are much less likely to elect any MPs, while regional parties such as the Bloc Qu\'e9b\'e9cois or Reform can have more MPs in Parliament than their share of the national vote justifies. Pure ranked-pair voting would tend to divide the country, not unite it. Parliament would not reflect the choice of all the voters. The Green party would still have one of 338 MPs rather than the 12 seats its four-per-cent vote justifies. Proportional representation is the preferred form of democratic government in 92 countries. We need it so that all votes count in Parliament. When all Canadians' choices are represented, parties must cooperate to pass legislation. Our best legislation, such as medicare, the CPP, bilingualism, regulation of electoral spending, and our flag, were passed by minority governments. tOM Trottier, Ottawa Electoral reform townhall identified the real problem It was a Saturday night, raining, mid-September. To my surprise, I found myself in a room with about 200 other people who came to MP Anita Vandenbeld's town hall on electoral reform in Ottawa West-Nepean. Attendees were invited to come forward and speak, and allotted two minutes each to say everything they had to say on the subject. I wish I had come prepared for that. But it was fair. Everyone who wanted to speak got their minutes. There was the initial problem with hecklers, but Ms. Vandenbeld put them in their place. There was the usual problem of getting people to stop talking. After a while, things got more controlled. I suppose many of us would be accused of selective hearing, but I was happy to hear people voice their disenchantment with the way parties appear to control MPs, the very MPs who should be representing us. This gathering wasn't like the deluge of lobbying for Proportional Representation sent to the Electoral Reform Committee in the form of written submissions and oral presentations. It was more representative. Ralph Anderson, Nepean Our political scandals seem so quaint Re: Sex assault allegations 'pure fiction,' Trump says, Oct. 14. After hearing what Donald Trump had to say about women, I guess it now seems quaint to remember that some years ago, then-prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau shocked a few Canadians by uttering the now famous "Fuddle Duddle." Andr\'e9e Champagne, Ottawa Taiwan's voice must be heard Re: A disgraceful silence, Oct. 13. The silence of the Canadian government on Taiwan is disgraceful, but that is only part of the story. Not only did Canada fail to object to Taiwan's exclusion from the International Civil Aviation Organization meeting in Montr\'e9al, it also permitted ICAO to exclude Taiwan-affiliated journalists from covering the proceedings. One of these was a Toronto-based Canadian citizen who writes for Taiwan's Central News Agency. This was surely done to reduce media coverage about Taiwan's exclusion from the international aviation organization. China hopes to annex Taiwan, and must thus first convince the world that the issue of Taiwan's status is entirely a Chinese domestic affair. However, since Taiwan has never been a part of the People's Republic of China, and is separated by China by international waters, this is an international rather than domestic issue. Any change in Taiwan's status should happen only under international observation and with the full consent of the Taiwanese people. China's attempts to block Taiwan's international participation, and even to squelch discussion of Taiwan's right to self-determination, are part of a long-term strategy to prevent internationalization of the issue. This is a threat to freedom of expression in Canada and should not be tolerated. Scott Simon, PhD, Chelsea Let Taiwan participate in climate change meeting Re: A carbon tax isn't enough, Oct. 7. Canada's move to put a price on carbon and the support for this shown in a recent Nanos poll deserve applause. The Canadian government is fully aware of the consequences of climate change and acknowledges that something must be done soon. Like Canada, Taiwan has stepped up efforts in fighting climate change. Although not a member of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Taiwan voluntarily enacted the Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act in July 2015 to cut carbon emissions by 50 per cent below 2005 levels by 2050, making Taiwan one of the few countries to write its GHG reduction target into domestic law. This approach is in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. In her inaugural address in May 2016, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen made it clear that Taiwan will not be absent from the global efforts to mitigate climate change. Climate change is a global issue that knows no borders. It requires not only national but global solutions. As the UNFCCC charter states, "the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all countries ..." I sincerely urge the international community to support Taiwan's meaningful participation in the upcoming Marrakech COP 22 meeting. Chung-chen Kung, Representative, Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Canada, Ottawa Reckless drivers are NOT 'good people' I was shocked recently to see a number of TV commercials for an insurance company that portrayed over-the-limit drivers and texting drivers who rear-end other vehicles as "good people." It is most reassuring to know that the drunken driver who hits me or the lady who runs the stop sign and totals my vehicle is a "good person." Mothers Against Drunk Driving - where are you? Throw the phone in the back seat I know how addictive a smartphone is. I recognize how unbelievably foolish and dangerous it is to be distracted by one while driving. So here's a partial solution. When you unlock your car, throw the phone in the back seat and if it rings, park safely and answer it without causing you or others harm. That will save you three demerit points, $490 in fines and thousands in increased insurance costs. Dan Pearlman, Ottawa Here's why hurricanes hit Haiti so hard In the coverage of Hurricane Matthew, all of the focus seems to be on Haiti. But any hurricane, earthquake or other natural disaster that strikes Haiti also strikes the Dominican Republic, with which Haiti shares the island of Hispaniola. Why does Haiti, then, suffer disproportionately from these disasters? It's because of the selfishness and incompetence of two centuries of Haitian government. The situation is so bad that many Haitians would rather work as virtual slave labour on sugar plantations in the Dominican Republic, despite the fact that Toussaint l'Ouverture fought to liberate Haitians from slave labour on French sugar plantations two centuries ago. No amount of foreign intervention or charity can liberate the Haitian people from the consequences of the governments they have chosen. James Cobban, Kanata How we might confront assisted death for children Re: Who decides when someone dies? Oct. 7. The debate on whether children should have the option of assisted death isn't black and white. First, there's the question of whether they should be able to decide; then there's the question of whether parental consent is required. As a parent, seeing your child suffering and in pain is one of the worst feelings in the world. Yet you don't want to lose that child early, and bringing the day where you're ultimately separated closer is not an option for many. On the other hand, giving all of the power to the child to decide might be too big a decision; this isn't like choosing between two ice cream flavours. An option that might work could be some sort of counselling, where the parents and child together see all the options they have, and get a general estimate of how things will turn out under those options, then letting the child be the ultimate decider. Alessandro Reyes, Ottawa Reading your newspaper is exhausting It's been a few months since I've read a paper. I now remember why. Friday Sept. 30, page one "assisted death": good article. Page two "Widow queries treatment." News? No, trash. NP section, page one "Bishops refuse funerals." Who cares? If you weigh the necessity of assisted death, does a funeral matter? NP section, page two, "Africa is no Kumbaya." Amazing article. Would someone please listen to this man? NP section, page three, "Veterans Affairs bonuses." Bonuses for a job well done? What are we coming to? They should be made to give it back. Or maybe policemen, firefighters, nurses, doctors, electricians should get bonuses. Heck, the young kid who pumps my gas is pretty good. Is there no monitoring? NP section, page three, "Hockey gloves are gloves." Is this fictional? Who allows these ideas to get as far as the Supreme Court? So that's how far I made it into the newspaper that day, then stopped. I was nauseated, frustrated and mind-boggled. I may try to read again later, when I calm down.

DON MARTIN: Welcome back. Canada's getting squeezed on environmental policies. The government tries to pre-emptively fend off the Trump's presidency protectionism. That and this week's summit on the opioid crisis are today's big issues for the MP panel. Adam Vaughan is a Liberal MP from Toronto; Candice Bergen, a Conservative MP from southern Manitoba; Jenny Kwan, an NDP MP from Vancouver. Welcome to the show. Nice to have you guys back. JENNY KWAN (NDP - British Columbia): Good to be here. ADAM VAUGHAN (Liberal - Ontario): Good afternoon. MARTIN: This COP22 is going on, the UN Climate change conference. There's, they're saying that we're not true, truly green because we're developing our oilsands and there's a number of environmental groups that are trying to do this. Meanwhile, we discovered that Canada has one of the larger delegations there, 225 Canadians. That's more than China or France, and a lot of other countries. I guess those aren't exactly seamless topics, but I guess I'm trying to get a sense here, Candice, how green can Canada go if we're going to be up against a neighbour that's thinking brown fields are progress? CANDICE BERGEN (Opposition House Leader): Well, I think the Liberals had not really thought ahead as far as natural resources, the environment, how that really goes hand in hand and when we're talking about with a North American strategy. Now that we have President-Elect Trump, who has been very clear on the development that he's going to be encouraging and allowing it with natural resources, the Liberals have got to press reset here in Canada. And there are ways that they can do it. We can have responsible natural resources development. We can have champions of our natural resources and have a competitive edge here in Canada, if the Liberals would reverse some of their policy. For example, carbon tax which is going to make us hugely uncompetitive. But it seems like they're a little in, in awe right now, and they, they, I don't think they realize what's hit them. So, certainly, you know, they've sent a big delegation to the, to the conference, and they're probably getting pushed on, on the, on the left on that issue. But this isn't about politics. This is about jobs and jobs in the, in Canada. So they have to press reset and they have to re-look at their policy when it comes to natural resources development. MARTIN: Okay. I'll get yours in a minute, Adam, but do they have to put the reset button? Is that necessary because of the Trump victory, at all, Jenny? KWAN: Well, I would say that, on the contrary, more than ever, I think that the prime minister needs to stand firm and to be clear to work with the international community. Climate change is real. Climate action is necessary. The prime minister was in the international stage and he said Canada is back. So he needs to put teeth behind those words. And by the way, even though he's saying that, though, he adopted the Harper targets. It's not good enough. We need to do better. You need to actually show action with your words, and I think that's what people are calling for. MARTIN: Adam, can we afford to go beyond the Harper targets, and can we afford a carbon tax? VAUGHAN: You know, the issue and the statement that has been framed by what we say, quite often, is that the environment and resource development must go hand in hand for Canadians to have confidence in the process, but also if we're going to get product to market. And so, you know, the criticisms at Marrakech, they're probably based on the reputation that we earned over the last ten years, which is not a good one, and it did stand in the way of us getting product to market. We have to find a way to get to it market in a responsible way, in a way that, that has social license, and in a way that, that also moves the economy forward. If we can do that, and we think we have the plan to get that done, I think the criticism will disappear as the market activity increases. And we will be in a position to fight, fight climate change, but to do it in a responsible way that doesn't hurt the economy. That's the plan. There's no need to reset it. Our responsibility now is to, is to see that through. MARTIN: You don't see a line of demarcation where there's environmentalism on the north, and on the south, it's like find oil. VAUGHAN: Well, you can, well, you can hear it in the panel here tonight. There's, there's one side of the debate, which says leave the oil in the ground. There's another side of the debate, which says get it all out of the ground as quick as possible, no matter how you do it, it doesn't matter, just get it to market. You've got to land in the middle. And you've got to land in the middle in a way that respects the environment, but that produces the material in a way that's responsible to the environment, but good for the economy. That's the work we're doing now. BERGEN: We've been, we've been telling the government for the last year that what they're doing is making Canada uncompetitive... VAUGHAN: We disagree. BERGEN: ...when it comes to, when it comes to... VAUGHAN: not, not... BERGEN: It has, so it has been, let me finish. It is now on steroids in terms of being uncompetitive. With the new president being elected and, and Adam can aw, shucks, it, but he's, he's not in Alberta, where people are suffering and investment, which has been leaving, and has been, has been chilled because of the uncompetitive atmosphere and climate here in Canada... VAUGHAN: No. BERGEN: ...is now going, well, Suncor, well, look at... VAUGHAN: They collapsed the resource price. The commodity market collapsed... BERGEN: Well, this is the problem. The Liberals... VAUGHAN: ...is what created the situation. BERGEN: ...have their head in the sand as far as oil, natural resources development. It's going to go to the US. Donald Trump has said the US is wide open for business when it comes to natural resource development. MARTIN: Yes, he does. BERGEN: Oil, gas, absolutely wide open. And I get that maybe you're not quite sure where you're going to go, but the talking point you're giving right now, Adam, is not going to tell investors that Canada is making any changes that will make it welcome for them to invest. MARTIN: You want to make it even more difficult for business to, aren't you? Like you're, you want them to go further than they already are? KWAN: Well, what I want is big. I want the prime minister to live up to what he says and commit to Canadians, and he's done this very well to say all the very nice words. But in reality, is he going to deliver on that. I think Canadians voted for real change. They trusted this government to deliver. It's not good enough to say you will do these things, and then actually come around and not do it. The prime minister, by the way, actually said that he would bring in a new environmental assessment process. He has not delivered that at all. It's been one year into the election. Where is it? Climate action is real. Those things come hand in hand. And you know what, they want to divorce these things as though they're separate. Talking is one thing. But also, walking the walk is another... MARTIN: Okay, but... KWAN: And they need to deliver on it. MARTIN: Don't you think they should, I mean, circumstances change, and I think circumstances have changed very dramatically south of the border. You don't think modifying that plan is worth... KWAN: Well, I, I think more than ever, actually, because south of the border things have changed, that we need to stand firm. You know where Trump is going to go, and we need to actually not be scared of him and take him up on it, and actually work with the international community and drive the issue. VAUGHAN: Look it, we, we have proceeded with reforming the process by which pipelines are considered and, and approved in this country. That is environmental reform, and we're coming on environmental assessments next. VAUGHAN: We have, we have changed the process on that to make sure that we have a responsible environmentally clean way of doing things, a better way of doing things. And we are moving to bring pipelines and resource to market in a way that doesn't, that doesn't hurt the economy. We're doing both things my opponents are saying we're not doing. We're just not doing to the extremes that they've claimed to, to suggest there's a better way. KWAN: Where's the new environmental assessment process? VAUGHAN: It's coming. KWAN: It's coming? Except all the projects have already been approved. But it's coming, though. VAUGHAN: But those pipelines were in the approval process, while we're moving forward. KWAN: But that wasn't what you guys said during the campaign. VAUGHAN: That's exactly what we said. (OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS) KWAN: During the campaign, you said that you would bring in the new process. You said you would and you're not. MARTIN: Okay, no one's going to hear you if you're talking over each other. VAUGHAN: We have, we've reformed the process by which pipelines are being considered and approved. KWAN: After it's been approved. MARTIN: No. We'll find out. There's one coming up in mid-December. BERGEN: Can I just finish... MARTIN: Very quickly. BERGEN: Real leadership means being able to be nimble and being able to adjust with what's, what's going on. The Liberals are not showing that they have the ability to adjust when things change and, and that's a problem. MARTIN: All right. Can I get a quick thought from you on this, Adam, and I don't need the others to react? 225 Canadians going to COP. Isn't that a little excessive? VAUGHAN: Well, what we've done is we've broadened the delegation to include NGOs and, and the people... MARTIN: So they're paying their own way, right? We're not paying for them? VAUGHAN: I'd, I'd have to take a look at each, each one of the invitations, but, but there is, there is a combination of, of people who are brought as part of the official delegation, and people brought, who come on their own dime, who are included in the delegation. MARTIN: Okay. VAUGHAN: So there's a process attached to that. (OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS) MARTIN: But anyway, we'll see. KWAN: Yeah. One of many. VAUGHAN: It's broadening, it's broadening... MARTIN: This always happens. VAUGHAN: ...when Canada's back, when Canada's back, it means that Canadians are back in the international events representing the broad array of interests of Canada. KWAN: That's an old, "I'm entitled to my entitlements." VAUGHAN: No. MARTIN: Well, we'll see. (OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS) KWAN: Yeah. The Liberals are back. MARTIN: Listen, sad news. Three deaths today in, or last night, I guess, in the Winnipeg area, Fentanyl. BERGEN: Yeah. KWAN: Yeah. MARTIN: This opioid situation is completely out of control. The number of Canadians being hospitalized is up thirty percent over just eight years. Like, thirteen a day are going into hospital, and there's a summit coming. I guess the question I want to discuss with you three is what can the government realistically do? I mean, this is a painkiller that people need to be, as a treatment, but it's being abused by youth. What's the answer here, Adam? Do you, do you banish it? Or do you, what you do you do? VAUGHAN: The, the first thing is, is find out what's working on the ground to save people's lives. What's happening is a tragedy and to the families that have lost people today, it breaks people's hearts, it breaks our heart. The second, so you pull people together and you find out what's working. We know that East Vancouver has had experience that, that Winnipeg is having experience. Halifax is having a different experience. So, you need to find out and share best practices very quickly. We've also provided, we've taken the antidote, de-listed it from being prescribed and being a controlled substance, and made it more available quicker to folks that are, that are unfortunately engaged in this on the street, but also care, folks providing care so that it's available more easily, to save people's lives faster. The final approach has got to be harm reduction. You know, we, we had came through ten years of criminalizing drugs, and making harm reduction strategies very, very hard in this country. That puts people's lives at risk. That attitude has to change. We're in the process of making those changes, as well. There's a safe injection site coming in my riding. We need it in Toronto yesterday. Not tomorrow. MARTIN: Toronto's getting it, but you're, you're, Vancouver's the epicentre of this. What, what needs to be done? What are you seeing out there that could be given to Canada-wide, and maybe help deal with this? MARTIN: Candice, what needs to be done? BERGEN: Well, when we were in government, we looked at it in terms of, it's a prescription drug that's being abused... MARTIN: Mm-hmm. BERGEN: ...which is one of the largest abuses in Canada. Alcohol, prescription drugs, probably the top two. So we went to doctors. We, we invested in research. We went and, so that doctors wouldn't be able to just prescribe it. We put on a ban so the pill couldn't be altered. Abusers crush it and they snort it, or they inject it. Unfortunately, and I'm not sure why, but the Liberals have just reversed that, so it's easier for abusers to be able to, to crush it, so then it's snorted and, and inject it, which is... VAUGHAN: Well, there's a reason for that. BERGEN: Now, they're reason is that they, they want to allow, they think that the, the result, or the best... VAUGHAN: No, I'll, I'll give the reason why if you don't. It's better than listening to you make one up. BERGEN: Well, okay, well, let me finish, let me finish, thanks, Adam. And here's another point. You know, Adam said that the people, the people in Toronto want to have a, what he calls a safe injection site, which by the way, there's absolutely no way that it can be guaranteed as safe. What the Liberals are saying is that they want to take out consulting communities, and I know that, you know, I know that there's a number of other issues involved in this, but communities, mayors, reeves, municipalities have the right to speak about whether they want to have one of these injection sites in their neighbourhood. And I don't think that it's up to the government to supersede. MARTIN: Okay. BERGEN: They want to consult on everything. What about giving people drugs and having these sites where people are going to be injecting drugs at alarming rates. Alarming rates. MARTIN: She's got a long list here, Adam. Be quick about it. VAUGHAN: Okay. So the issue is this is that, is that the move to try to make them uncrushable is, is part of what's spawned the Fentanyl dynamic because other opiates became impossible to, to manipulate, and as a result, addicts went looking for other opioids, and you can't keep up to the innovations that happen on the street. That's why harm reduction's got to be the strategy, not constantly, you know... BERGEN: Give them more, like is that what you mean? Or... VAUGHAN: No, it's not what I mean at all. BERGEN: Like, give them more drugs, or what? VAUGHAN: What it means is, is that we have a serious set of addiction issues in this country, and we have got to address it as a medical issue, not a criminal issue, in so many ways on the street. And the points that Jenny makes are absolutely fundamentally right. We have got to get on top of this issue from a harm reduction and a care strategy, because quite clearly, the war on drugs over the last ten years produced what we have now on the streets, and it's producing the tragedies, and we have not, we have not turned the corner on it precisely because the strategies over the last ten years failed. And they failed people, not just this country. MARTIN: You're generally on the same page, right, Jenny? (OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS) VAUGHAN: And, and the urgency comes from Vancouver. I get that. KWAN: I, I think it's really important to focus on the evidence and the science and in my own community, Insite has proven time and time again, peer review after peer review that supervised injection facilities save lives. There has not been one fatal overdose since it opened. I think this is what we've got to get to. Like, I mean, I'm a mother, and I just sit there and I shake, if I think that my child is going to try drugs and the first time that my child tries, that they actually die. We cannot let this happen. And this is what's happening in our communities.

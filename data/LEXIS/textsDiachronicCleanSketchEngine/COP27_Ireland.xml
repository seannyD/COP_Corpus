PUPILS from across Northern Ireland yesterday played the part of politicians, journalists and lobbyists at a mock COP27 event in Belfast. The debate on climate crisis was held at Belfast City Hall and gave students the opportunity to find out what it\' s really like to negotiate a climate deal. During the debate, which coincided with the UN Climate Change Conference being held in Sharm El-Sheikh, pupils had to agree on a global strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep the global temperature from rising above two per cent. To do this, they used computer software developed by Climate Interactive and MIT to create a real-life climate simulation. Pupils from schools across London and Egypt also took part in the negotiation via Zoom. The event, which involved more than 80 students, was organised by the British Council Northern Ireland, and was led by Dr Peter Doran, senior lecturer in law at Queen\' s University Belfast. Dr Doran said:  If there\' s a ray of hope in the midst of this climate and civilisational emergency it is the courage and leadership of young people.  Many of us grown-ups lose the art of asking the right questions along the way.  Young people are less invested in business-as-usual. He said that the event saw the participation of  upcoming global citizens, a generation who have come to understand that activism for the planet and justice is the royal road to wellbeing and the good life . Jonathan Stewart, director of British Council NI, said he was delighted to see young people from across Northern Ireland, London and Egypt  have the chance to come together to actively engage in the challenges of climate change.  This event put pupils at the head of the negotiating table giving them a real flavour of what negotiations such as those taking place at COP27 are like, giving them the skills and confidence to take on some of the world\' s biggest challenges, he said.  The initiative is part of the British Council\' s Climate Connection programme, which supports people globally to find creative solutions to climate change in support of the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El Sheik this month.  The British Council is supporting the summit by engaging with networks of young Egyptians, education professionals, students, academics, researchers, artists, civil society leaders and policymakers to participate in meaningful dialogue and bring about real change for our planet. \</doc>

This November's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( Cop27 ) will come at a time of economic and geopolitical turmoil, affecting food security, public health, and more. But the immediate challenges we face must not distract us from an unassailable truth: the single most important battle our generation will face is the fight against climate change. Earlier this year, extreme rainfall caused one of South Africa's deadliest disasters this century. Today, the worst floods in Pakistan's history have left one-third of the country underwater. Far from freak occurrences, such severe weather events are becoming the new normal. Experts believe that extreme rainfall is now twice as likely, owing to climate change, which has also led to other types of devastation such as droughts and wildfires. Africa is especially vulnerable to these effects. According to the acting chief economist of the African Development Bank (AfDB), climate change is costing the continent between 5% and 15% of its per-capita GDP growth. This would have devastating consequences, not only for economic development, but also for food security. Cop27 But we in Africa prefer to see it instead as "the implementation Cop" -- a meeting that will move beyond lofty aspirations and vague pledges to deliver a comprehensive, results-oriented agenda. And, yes, that agenda should include delivering greater support -- financial and otherwise -- to Africa, which has contributed the least to climate change. To echo AfDB president Akinwumi Adesina, we Africans do not come to beg; we come with resources and solutions. We are already taking concrete action to accelerate the green transition and protect ourselves from the worst effects of climate change. For starters, African countries are embracing green energy. In recent years, the continent's renewable-energy capacity rose sharply, with double-digit annual increases in solar, wind, and hydro power. Africa is home to two of the world's largest solar projects (in Egypt and Morocco), and two of Africa's 20 fastest-growing companies in 2022 are in the solar-energy business. From Nigeria to Namibia, countries are embracing climate-friendly technologies such as green hydrogen. The African Union Commission is fully engaged in tackling climate change on multiple fronts. The mandate of the AU Commission for Agriculture, Rural Development, Blue Economy, and Sustainable Environment (ARBE) has been broadened to reflect the importance of resilience-building, adaptation, and mitigation. It also recently contributed to developing an integrated strategy to guide the development and application of weather and climate services in Africa. Meanwhile, specialised agencies of the AU, such as the African Risk Capacity (ARC) group, are helping African countries take advantage of technology-based early-warning and preparedness systems to improve their resilience. The organisation works closely with governments to strengthen their capacities to protect lives and support the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure in the wake of natural disasters. Through ARC Limited, the insurance affiliate of the group, it provides parametric insurance against extreme weather events. For its part, the AfDB has shifted its attention -- and resources -- toward climate change. In 2020, 63% of AfDB funding went to projects related to climate-change adaptation, the largest share of any development finance institution. This year, the bank committed another $12.5bn toward climate-adaptation financing through the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP) -- an African-led multi-stakeholder body established in 2021. Africa's adaptation-financing needs are estimated at $52.7bn annually through 2030. The AAAP's funding target was set at $25bn, with rich countries expected to make up the rest. But, even as Africa pursues -- and funds -- climate action, the international community's commitments continue to fall short. We commend the British government's success, at Cop26 in Glasgow last year, in mobilising not only the international community, but also the private sector and civil society, thereby crowding in record climate-finance pledges. But a year on, many of these pledges remain just that: promises. Perhaps we should not be surprised. After all, at the 2009 Cop in Copenhagen, rich countries committed to deliver $100bn in annual funding to help developing countries advance mitigation and adaptation goals by 2020. Two years after the target date, rich countries' commitments remain largely unfulfilled. That is why we are calling for the introduction of improved mechanisms for monitoring and tracking climate-finance commitments. It should not be difficult to attach clear timelines and implementation benchmarks to pledges. Processes for accessing these funds must also be simplified. It will be essential at Cop27 to shift the focus from decisions to action. We do not need more agreements on future progress. Rather, we must translate the achievements of past summits into global co-operation on comprehensive climate action. For example, initiatives to strengthen disaster risk management must take a holistic approach, covering everything from resource mobilisation and early-warning systems to technology transfer and capacity-building. A more holistic approach is also needed in Africa, which is not only highly vulnerable to climate change, but also has considerable development needs. Such an approach will demand a significant capital outlay, which cannot be financed by borrowing without driving already debt-distressed African countries toward crisis. Beyond fulfilling their funding commitments, international actors must also provide a broader selection of financing options for all African countries, regardless of their financial position. This effort should include the private sector. To support implementation, African countries will need access to appropriate technical support. The scale of the climate challenge cannot be overstated. Confronting the threat of climate change will require a combination of mitigation, resilience-building, and adaptation, enabled by strategic partnerships, effective knowledge-sharing, and the delivery of adequate financial support and technical know-how. Africa is doing its part. The rest of the world must do the same -- beginning at Cop27 . \</doc>

Summit extended after failure to reach consensus on compensation Environmental Correspondent The UN climate change Cop-27 summit is to be extended after intense negotiations failed to reach a deal on compensating vulnerable countries fo r extreme weather events. Like previous Cop events, the two-week summit in Egypt's Sharm-el-Sheikh ran into overtime as hopes of a last-minute breakthrough before the scheduled end ran out. "Loss and damage" - essentially richer countries paying a significant share to more vulnerable countries to compensate for the climate change-related disasters already occurring and which cannot be avoided even with defences - remained the major sticking point. It is not unusual for Cop events to go beyond deadline. Just six of the previous 26 have finished on schedule. Environment Minister Eamon Ryan, appointed this week as EU ministerial representative on loss and damage to work alongside European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans, conceded yesterday that consensus remained a long way off. "There is a lot of work to be done. There is no certainty as to what the response will be," he said, after the EU offered what it said was a compromise. The EU's proposal to break the deadlock honed in on funding "the most vulnerable countries". However, developing countries want the agreement to extend beyond the most vulnerable, while countries such as the US fear being held legally liable in the future for loss and damage. There is also debate over the wording around the future of fossil fuels. The top seven emitters - China, the EU, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Russia, and the US - plus international transpor t, accounted for 55% of global emissions in 2020. Collectively, G20 members - 19 of the world's biggest economies plus the EU bloc - are responsible for 75%, according to UN data. Greenhouse gas emissions are a major contributor to human-induced global warming, which has led to the proliferation of extreme weather disasters. Egyptian foreign minister Sameh Shoukry, chairing the Cop27 talks, said he expected talks to extend over the weekend. "I remain concerned at the number of outstanding issues," he told delegates late yesterday evening. Irish observers on the ground said negotiators, including Irish delegates, needed to push hard in the final hours. Energy officer with Friends of the Earth, Clare O'Connor, said: "If Cop27 fails to explicitly call on countries to phase out production of fossil fuels, it will be a colossal political failure and a win for an industry that is killing between three and five million people annually from air pollution." Christian Aid Ireland policy officer Ross Fitzpatrick said: "If this Cop is to deliver on climate justice, then it must deliver meaningful progress on loss and damage. "Rather than trying to obstruct progress or drive down ambition by seeking to cherry-pick elements of proposals that they find acceptable, wealthy countries should listen to the vast majority of countries." \</doc>

As we enter the second week of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( Cop27 ) in Egypt and read daily reports from our Science and Environment Editor Kevin O'Sullivan, I thought it would be timely to devote this week's column to the health effects of climate change. First up, like me, you may be confused by the Cop nomenclature. It stands for "Conference of the Parties". The parties are the attending countries that signed up to the original UN climate agreement in 1992. Countries and health systems continue to contend with the health, social, and economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, while Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a persistent fossil fuel overdependence has pushed the world into global energy and cost-of-living crises. Meanwhile, climate change escalates unabated. Its worsening impacts are increasingly affecting the foundations of human health and wellbeing. At Cop27 In the run-up to Cop27 , the 2022 report of the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Climate was published. It has some dire findings. With an average global surface heating of 1.1 degrees, climate change is increasingly undermining every pillar of good health. The health harms of extreme heat exposure are rising, affecting mental health, undermining the capacity to work and exercise, and resulting in annual heat-related deaths in people older than 65 years increasing by 68 per cent from 2000-2004 to 2017-2021. The changing climate is exacerbating the risk of infectious disease outbreaks and threatening global food security, with heatwave days associated with 98 million more people experiencing food insecurity in 2020 than in the years up to 2010. These health impacts add additional pressure on overwhelmed health systems. We need to adapt at a faster pace to buttress this. However, the Lancet report found that authorities are not acting fast enough and adaptation funding remains insufficient. The increased use of air conditioning and a scattered implementation of nature-based solutions are not good enough. How might these trends affect public health in Ireland? Infectious diseases The changing climate is affecting the spread of infectious diseases, putting us at higher risk of emerging diseases. We know that coastal waters are becoming more suitable for the transmission of Vibrio bugs; non-cholera Vibrio bacteria survive in brackish waters, and can cause gastroenteritis if ingested in contaminated food, and potentially lethal wound infections if direct contact is made with contaminated water. Meanwhile, the likelihood of developing dengue fever - a viral infection spread by mosquitoes - has risen in Europe, with France recording a threefold increase in local transmission of the virus in 2022. As we saw in Ireland this summer, climate change is leading to an increase in the frequency and intensity of heatwaves. Exposure to extreme heat is associated with acute kidney injury, heatstroke, adverse pregnancy outcomes and poor sleep patterns. It also has a negative impact on mental health, and it worsens underlying cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Exposure to extreme heat affects health indirectly by restricting people's capacity to work and exercise. Regular physical activity contributes to a healthy bodyweight, improves physical and mental health, and helps to prevent many non-communicable diseases. However, hot weather reduces the likelihood of engaging in exercise, and it increases the risk of heat illness for those who do engage. We are also seeing an increase in flooding as a result of climate change. Severe flooding can overwhelm sewage systems, endanger sources of drinking water and facilitate the spread of water-borne infectious disease. The time for action is now. \</doc>

Climate Minister Eamon Ryan has described the weekly protests by student climate strikers for the last four years as ``inspirational''. The Green Party leader said students' willingness to stand in protest, make a banner and raise their voices gives ``hope'' and ``dispels fear''. Schoolchildren of all ages held a demonstration on Friday to mark 208 consecutive weeks - four years - of climate protest outside the gates of Dail Eireann. The students are calling for politicians to take urgent action on climate change. ``For 208 Fridays in a row there have been people standing in this spot demanding climate action,'' Mr Ryan told pupils demonstrating outside the gates of Leinster House in Dublin. ``That's been an important thing, that's been a voice, a message, that's been an inspiration for a lot of people. ``We need to think about the next generation. We need to think about what we need to do now to secure our future. ``You could give up hope, you can be very despairing sometimes when you look at the science. But we have to retain that hope, that sense that we can actually protect our future.'' The students held colourful banners and posters calling for climate action. They were joined by environmental activists and other supporters to mark the occasion. Mr Ryan told the crowd that he had recently returned from the United Nations climate change conference , Cop27 , in Egypt. ``While it wasn't perfect, while you would tear your hair out as to how long it takes and how slow it is, but there is a change coming,'' he said. ``There is real ambition now to make the change we need to make. And do it in a way that brings justice. That we protect those most vulnerable countries. ``It's really important we do it here at home. That's why I think you're important. It's bringing it home, outside our Dail every week...that act, that stepping out. Be willing to do the hard thing. Stand in protest, make a banner, raise your voices. That gives hope. That dispels fear.'' ``It's made a difference, don't stop,'' he added. Since then students have been holding protests outside parliaments across the world every Friday. end \</doc>

Recrimination and anger at the end of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( Cop27 ) in Egypt should not distract from two big outcomes with real potential to accelerate world decarbonisation while protecting the most vulnerable. The first win is setting up a loss and damage fund. This will finally begin compensating the vulnerable developing world for sins of wealthy countries drunk on fossil fuels for decades and in denial of its environmental consequences. It is a great moment for those on the front lines of climate crisis. The detail needs to be worked out, the amounts involved have yet to be determined and, critically, who pays but the direction of travel is clear for donors and recipients. Expect a big battle over who is put into which category. There is an expectation the likes of China, Saudi Arabia and other emerging big economies will have to begin paying their dues. A marker has also been put down that the global oil and gas industry that has raked in an average equivalent of $1 trillion a year in unearned profits for the past 50 years will have to cough up under this heading. It is flagged in the cover decision by the following lines: "[The world's nations] call on the shareholders of multilateral development banks (MDBs) and international financial institutions to reform practices and priorities, align and scale up funding ... and encourage MDBs to define a new vision that [is] fit for the purpose of addressing the global climate emergency." This is significant because such reforms would scale up finance and change the lending approach of the World Bank. The call adds to pressure from developing countries, under the Bridgetown Agenda championed by Barbados prime minister Mia Mottley, and from G7 and G20 power blocs who are responsible for 80 per cent of global emissions. Tacit blessing The obvious weakness in outcomes relates to the global mitigation programme and addressing fossil fuels; notably, commitments made at Cop26 in Glasgow to scale up ambition on slashing emissions. Even worse, there was a deplorable level of row-back. The final text even offered a tacit blessing of natural gas, which is exacerbating the climate crisis by including a message that "low-emission" energy should be part of the world's response to rising seas and weather extremes exacerbated by global heating. The ambiguity is deliberate, allowing for multiple interpretations. One can only deduce the 636 registered fossil fuel lobbyists at Sharm El Sheikh delivered handsomely for their bosses, who were already buoyed by the bounty arising from an unrelenting energy crisis. Their continued presence at Cops is one of their most odious aspects. But that is only one indicator of increasingly gaping flaws in the process. It was always known that Cops were imperfect agents of change when it came to applying the levers to effect timely climate action but at Cop27 their inadequacy was laid bare. Minister of State for Overseas Development Aid and Diaspora Colm Brophy put it best when warning it risks becoming "an irrelevancy" because of persistent failure to turn promises into action, with the developed world most to blame. That is evident, he added, in the climate roots of the unfolding hunger catastrophe in the Horn of Africa. Disconnect also surfaced in the face of indisputable science. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was set up by the UN to advise on science, yet some countries wished to remove references to its latest findings from the final text. 'Tipping points' Instead, a reference to the key finding of "tipping points" was put in - a warning the climate does not warm in a gradual and linear fashion, but we risk tripping feedback loops that will lead to rapidly escalating effects. These include the demise of the Amazon, which could turn the rainforest into savannah, transforming it from a carbon sink to a carbon source; and melting permafrost that releases vast quantities of the most powerful greenhouse gas, methane. Former Cop negotiator Alden Meyer, known as the "Cop whisperer" for his insights on how behind-closed-doors talks are progressing, provided updates throughout Cop27 in podcasts via the think tank E3G. Amid growing despondency in its final days, he said there would be an outcome but the question was: "Will it be sufficient for what the world needs?" Outside observers often misunderstand what Cops are about and overestimate their influence. They are essential to effective global collective action but this mechanism alone is not going to solve the highly complex interlinked crises of climate breakdown and nature collapse. That acknowledged, Cop27 has made due recognition of the plight of the most climate-vulnerable countries under the loss and damage heading but, regrettably, the sum of commitments is insufficient in contributing to what the world needs right now. The science was made shockingly clear in the run-up to Cop27 ; it was reinforced by even more findings during the summit. Effects are getting worse, developed countries can no longer expect they will escape lightly. And yet the single biggest contributor to this scenario, the burning of fossil fuels, was in effect relegated to a side issue - and in some respects weakened compared to what was promised at Cop26. Yes, there is an expectation that the fossil fuel and aviation sectors will pay into the loss and damage fund. But it still adds up to another year of nothing done to stop oil and gas expansion fuelling further climate chaos. \</doc>

The agreement by the 194 countries at COP27 to agree to setting up a new Loss and Damage Fund to channel money from the wealthier and developed world to the most vulnerable is an amazing achievement. Two weeks ago, this item wasn't even on the COP27 agenda for discussion. Developing countries had refused to discuss it because it was originally spoken about as a form of compensation to the victims of climate change. Compensation has legal connotations and could have landed the developed world with unlimited liability claims for centuries to come. No country could ever afford that. But this was an African COP taking place in Egypt. And African countries are very sore about the rich world. They have been repeatedly let down by wealthy nations who have not delivered the climate finance promised for years and continue to increase greenhouse gas emissions compounding the problem. So poorer and developing countries dug in their heels. Rows took place behind the scenes. Then finally at the last minute, just before the negotiations started, "Loss and Agenda" minus the term "compensation" was put on the official COP27 agenda. Nobody expected what followed. That within two weeks the nations of the world would have agreed to, and signed off on, setting up of a Loss and Damage Response fund, and that all governments in a position to contribute would be expected to do so, including China and Saudi Arabia. Both of these nations were developing countries 30 years ago and might have expected to be beneficiaries. But they are rich countries now and they too are expected to play their part in this. And who would have thought that world\' s governments would agree to explore how the money for the fund could be raised by levies on the international oil and gas industry, international shipping and aviation, all of which have made phenomenal profits from emitting extraordinary amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, and are making more and more each year. The fact that all this could happened in the space of two weeks is unprecedented for these events. The United Nations Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, piled on the pressure from day one. He told the delegates in his opening address that Loss and Damage would now be the litmus test for the success or otherwise of COP27 . COP27 Halfway through the second week of negotiations the EU took a major leap, formally tabling a proposal for the Loss and Damage Response Fund. This was a diplomatic move of the utmost seriousness and the rich countries were obliged to respond. They simply could not look away. The rich world, or the developed countries, or the so-called Global North (take your pick) has been responsible for putting the vast majority of the greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution and have become wealthy as a result. Yet it is the poorest and most vulnerable, the developing countries, the so-called Global South who bear the brunt of the consequences, and will continue to suffer the worst effects of climate change into the future. In so many parts of the world it is the poorest and most vulnerable who are the main victims of atmospheric pollution to which they have contributed the least. The world has watched in horror this year as the most torrential rain imaginable flooded at least one third of Pakistan and displaced millions of people. The same type of event occurred in Nigeria where historic flooding from extreme rainfall washed away all before it. And what about the millions of people in the Horn of Africa where the rains have failed for five years in a row, and the weather predictions suggest a sixth year of rain failure ahead. It gets worse by the year. Nobody can pretend they don\' t see it, or know about it. It\' s all over our TV screens, our newspapers and the internet. Against that background how could the rich world look away when the European Union put forward the formal proposal to help these unfortunate victims of climate chaos deal with the catastrophic losses and damages they have and will continue to suffer. The EU formal proposal to go for this fund at COP27 was unexpected. It was a brave move, a well-timed move, and a humanitarian act that will help restore some of the trust that has been so lacking between the North and the South, between developed and emerging economies. Against all odds COP27 has turned out to be a huge success. No doubt the Egyptian COP27 presidency will claim some credit. But it was the European Union and the way it went about delivering its Loss and Damage Response Fund proposal that is the main reason for this success. \</doc>

COP27 delegates have agreed to discuss whether rich countries should compensate poorer nations most vulnerable to climate change at the United Nations climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Diplomats approved a much-disputed agenda item to talk about matters relating to "funding arrangements responding to loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including a focus on addressing loss and damage." At COP26 last year in Glasgow, high-income nations blocked a proposal for a loss and damage financing body, instead supporting a new three-year dialogue for funding discussions.

HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/news/environment/2022/1106/1333450-cop27-explainer/ What the latest IPCC science says about climate change HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/eile/climate-change/ Latest Climate stories COP27 has begun against a backdrop of nearly 200 countries struggling to outpace increasingly dire climate impacts in a world upended by war and economic turmoil. "Report after report has painted a clear and bleak picture," said UN chief Antonio Guterres in the run-up to conference. " COP27 Concretely, that means slashing greenhouse emissions 45% by 2030 to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above late-19th-century levels. Warming beyond that threshold, scientists warn, could push Earth toward an unlivable hothouse state. But current trends would see carbon pollution increase 10% by the end of the decade and Earth's surface heat up 2.8C, according to findings unveiled last week. Promises made under the Paris Agreement would, if kept, only shave off a few tenths of a degree. "Our planet is on course for reaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible and forever bake in catastrophic temperature rise," Mr Guterres said recently. "We need to move from tipping points to turning points for hope." For the UN climate forum, that means transitioning from negotiations to implementation. It also means a shift from politics to the economy, with government investments in China, the US and the European Union leveraging hundreds of billions of yuan, dollars and euros into trillions. The already daunting task of decarbonising the global economy in a few years has been made even harder by a global energy crunch and rapid inflation, along with debt and food crises across much of the developing world. "But this is a perfect storm," dubbed by some a "polycrisis", said the 30-year veteran of the climate arena. After front-line negotiators set COP27 in motion today, more than 120 world leaders will put in appearances tomorrow and Tuesday. US President Joe Biden has said he will come, but only after legislative elections on Tuesday that could see either or both houses of Congress fall into the hands of Republicans hostile to international action on climate change. Cooperation between the United States and China - the world's two largest economies and carbon polluters - has been crucial to rare breakthroughs in the nearly 30-year saga of UN climate talks, including the 2015 Paris Agreement. But Sino-US relations have sunk to a 40-year low after a visit to Taiwan by House leader Nancy Pelosi and a US ban on the sale of high-level chip technology to China, leaving the outcome of COP27 in doubt. A meeting between Mr Xi and Mr Biden at the G20 summit in Bali days before the UN climate meeting ends, if it happens, could be decisive. One bright spot at COP27 will be the arrival of Brazilian president-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, whose campaign vowed to protect the Amazon and reverse the extractive policies of outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro. More than any other COP, perhaps, this one will be about money - or how little of it has flowed from countries that got rich burning fossil fuels to mostly blameless poorer nations suffering the worst consequences. Developing nations have "high expectations" for the creation of a dedicated funding facility to cover loss and damage, UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said on Friday. "The most vulnerable countries are tired, they are frustrated," Mr Stiell said. "The time to have an open and honest discussion on loss and damage is now." The United States and the European Union - fearful of creating an open-ended reparations framework - have dragged their feet and challenged the need for a separate funding stream. \</doc>

The sprawling nature of the Cop27 summit can make it difficult to see the wood from the trees. However, money is at the centre of the discussions and is set to be highly contentious, alongside the headline issues of commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and whether long-standing promises can be turned into long-awaited action. While there have been lengthy discussions about funding the green transition - the massive investment required in renewable energy - the funding debate at Cop27 goes wider than this. It includes demands from less-developed countries for compensation for the costs of dealing with climate change, imposed on them by the pollution from richer countries. The agreed agenda does include this "loss and damage" issue, but omits any reference to the liability of the richer countries to provide this, or to compensate for past actions. That richer countries have been responsible for the vast bulk of emissions, and less developed countries have faced most of the costs - this year's terrible floods in Pakistan being just one example - is obvious. What can be done to offset this damage and help poorer countries mitigate the cost in years to come? The real issue is what actually happens and whether the big players step up and provide the resources, rather than tortuous debates over language. US climate envoy John Kerry plans to present one proposal, which would involve raising funding from companies buying carbon credits from governments and state agencies - who in turn would earn them for reducing fossil fuel emissions. The funding raised would then be directed to help less developed countries reduce their reliance on more polluting fuels. This idea may have merit, though the concept of companies buying credits to offset emissions remains controversial and is clearly used in some cases for greenwashing. Better that companies cut emissions. For governments, putting money on the table will be required if Cop27 is to have any chance of making its mark. Woolly promises will simply not be enough. \</doc>

Brazilian president-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has joined calls at COP27 for the creation of a fund to compensate developing countries, while Eamon Ryan has been asked to be the EU Ministerial Representative on crucial talks on Loss and Damage at the summit. "We very urgently need financial mechanisms to remedy losses and damages caused by climate change," Mr Lula told the UN's COP27 climate conference in Egypt, where the topic has divided rich and developing nations. Mr Lula also vowed to fight deforestation in his country, saying "there is no climate security for the world without a protected Amazon". United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last week that the progress COP27 makes related to 'Loss and Damage' funding will be the litmus test for the success or failure of this COP meeting. Meanwhile, the Minister for the Environment has been asked to represent the European Council in the final days of the negotiations at the COP27 summit on the critical issue of funding for climate related damage for disadvantaged countries. He will be working closely with the EU Vice President for the Green Deal and Commissioner for Climate Action Frans Timmermans, as well as an EU team and other EU colleagues through the final and critical days at the UN Climate Conference in Sharm el-Sheikh. The minister said that from this point on during COP27 he would be speaking on behalf of the European Union and not Ireland on this key issue. Also at the conference, Mr Ryan announced funding support of \€ 2.5 million to United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) climate finance activities including the Financial Centres for Sustainability (FC4S) network. "A UNDP Sustainable Finance Hub flagship initiative, today FC4S members collectively represent US$84 trillion equity market capitalisation, with members based in Africa, Asia, the Americas, the Gulf and Europe," said Stephen Nolan, Managing Director, UNDP FC4S network. "Minister Ryan's support will allow FC4S turbocharge its support to our members, particularly those in emerging market and developing economies, with a particular emphasis on mobilising greater amounts of capital required to meet the Paris Agreement and SDGs." Loss and damage controversy The concept of funding for loss and damage to be provided by richer developed countries for poorer and developing nations has been highly controversial at COP27 from the start. It was only put on the formal agenda for discussion at the eleventh hour. Developing and poorer countries had been demanding that richer and more developed countries should provide financial compensation to them for the loss and damages they have, and will continue to suffer, due to extreme weather events and the impacts of climate change, for which they claim they have had the least amount of responsibility. Developed countries strongly resisted the inclusion of the notion of "compensation" associated with the loss and damage as that would be an open-ended and potentially unmanageable financial commitment. Now instead of "compensation" the issue at the heart of the heart of these negotiations is funding, and on that front several proposals have been touted. However, Minister Ryan explained that the EU has become concerned that draft and preliminary final COP27 Fears over swallowed-up funds The EU fear is that funds that could be provided that will be available to all developing countries in such a fashion that they could be swallowed up by large countries like China which is not considered to be a poor country. Mr Timmermans stated very clearly in his address to COP27 yesterday that the EU is strongly in favour of providing funds for loss and damage for poorer countries and wants to see significant progress on this issue over the coming days. However, it is clear the battle lines on the use of any such funds have now been drawn, and Minister Eamon Ryan will be Europe's key negotiator in the discussions ahead. Talks being held up - Robinson Former President Mary Robinson said she was concerned at the state of talks on planned measures to address loss and damage suffered by poorer countries as a result of climate change. "There does seem to be a bit of a block in loss and damage. There isn't an agreement, it would appear, across the board, on a fund here and now," Mrs Robinson, who heads a group of prominent former world leaders known as the Elders. She said China and Saudi Arabia were holding up talks. "I'm also very worried about the fact that the Santiago Network negotiations last night came up with a real problem because China and Saudi Arabia - and I'm naming names... are trying to block technical assistance for loss and damage going to the most vulnerable countries," she said. HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/eile/climate-change/ Latest Climate news A spokesperson for the Saudi delegation to the talks declined to comment on Mrs Robinson's remarks Meanwhile, HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2022/1116/1336375-g20-summit-latest/ leaders at the G20 meeting in Bali agreed to pursue efforts to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius COP27 climate talks. Egypt's COP27 presidency special representative welcomed the commitments made by G20 nations, saying their final declaration contained many promising aspects. "There are very strong elements and commitments, and reiterations of previous commitments," ambassador Wael Aboulmagd told a news conference. "We welcome it, obviously."

The last eight years are on track to be the warmest on record, while the rise in sea levels has doubled in the last 30 years - just some of the "dramatic telltale signs of the impacts of climate change". That is according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which warned that the toll taken by ever-rising greenhouse gas concentrations and accumulated heat will continue unless firmer action is taken. Cop27 got under way in Egypt, the WMO warned:  The rate of sea-level rise has doubled since 1993, and levels have risen by nearly 10mm since January 2020 to a new record high this year;  An "exceptionally heavy toll" was taken on glaciers in the European Alps, with initial indications of record-shattering melt;  The Greenland ice sheet lost mass for the 26th consecutive year and it rained rather than snowed in September for the first time. While 2022 will likely be the fifth or sixth-hottest ever year, "it is only a matter of time until there is another warmest year on record", the WMO warned. The urgency of the crisis has been heightened in recent months, with devastating heatwaves, droughts, and extreme weather in Europe, while Pakistan was hit with the worst floods in recent memory, with more than 1,700 lives lost and over 30bn damage. Last week, it was revealed that Europe is warming faster than anywhere else on the planet and some of the world's most prominent glaciers, including Yosemite and Yellowstone parks in the US and on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, will disappear by 2050. Ireland recorded one of its warmest Octobers ever this year, and Moore Park weather station in Cork last month saw its highest-ever rainfall for October. The grim prognosis comes as political leaders including Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin, US president Joe Biden, and new British prime minister Rishi Sunak attend the Cop27 summit in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. However, the leaders of China and India, two of the biggest polluting economies, will not be present, it is believed. The disproportionate impact of climate change on smaller nations will be one of the key topics, with Mr Martin to meet Vanuatu's newly elected leader, Ishmael Kalsakau, to discuss the plight facing the low-lying Pacific island nation. Mr Martin told the Irish Examiner Cop27 "People can understandably despair at times, but the efforts made are beginning the turn the curve," he said. "However, it is not fast enough and we must accelerate the actions we take. "We talk of the just transition in Ireland, where we want to bring people along through the transformation of a green economy and society, but that also applies to islands and more vulnerable nations. Loss and damage and climate finance must be major outcomes of Cop27 ." "If adaptation is not met, if the issue of finance is not fulfilled, then we will continue to lag behind," said Cop27 president Sameh Shoukry, opening the event yesterday. "There is no room except to move forward to obtain our objectives." His predecessor, Alok Sharma, called on countries to fulfil their pledges. "You made commitments to phase down coal; you made commitments to come back and revise your emission-reduction targets; developed countries made commitments on more financial support to developing nations," he said. "We have to deliver on that. It is about the credibility of this process." News: 7 \</doc>

Representatives from nearly every country on Earth will come together in Egypt on Sunday to coordinate global climate action for the next year. Heads of state, ministers and negotiators, climate activists, mayors, civil society representatives and CEOs will meet in the Egyptian coastal city of Sharm el-Sheikh for the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ). COP27 takes place with the UN Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres warning that the world is "doomed (unless) we bring back climate change to the centre of the international debate". We spoke to three young Irish delegates about their hopes and fears ahead of the crucial summit. Rosalind Skillen, 24, is a climate activist from Belfast who is currently doing a Masters degree in Environmental Policy at UCD. She is attending COP27 to make sure key issues affecting young people are represented. She attended COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland last year, but said this summit will be very different. Many African countries are now spending more on efforts to adapt to the effects of climate change than they are spending on health care, Rosalind said, quoting a recent survey. So, this year\' s COP in Egypt will focus on climate finance, climate adaptation, implementation and also loss and damage reparations. "One of the big injustices in the whole climate crisis is that the countries that have done the least to contribute to the climate crisis are those who are paying the most for it," she said. Rosalind hopes wealthy countries will step up in terms of their climate finance commitments during COP27 , and help countries in the African continent adapt to the impacts of climate change. However, with the summit taking place against the backdrop of the cost-of-living crisis and Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, she fears "it won't be treated seriously, and it will just be pushed back again down the priority list". Are you wondering what COP27 is all about? We've been finding out what to expect from the UN's climate conference and why it should matter to you. https://twitter.com/hashtag/COP27?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw # COP27 \~ HYPERLINK #ClimateAction \~ HYPERLINK https://t.co/gWrhXHVhSe pic.twitter.com/gWrhXHVhSe HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/rtenews/status/1587897333022334987?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw November 2, 2022 Jenny Salmon, 20, is a third year law student at Trinity College Dublin and is going to COP27 as a Youth Climate Ambassador for Concern, Ireland's largest aid and humanitarian agency. Her aim is to show that many young people really do care about the climate crisis. "Because, we've inherited climate change, and so it's kind of up to us to deal with it now," she said. Jenny is taking messages from young people who attended last month's COPON! festival in Dublin. She hopes to be able to share these messages with leaders from Ireland and all over the world. "What I'd most like to say to the Taoiseach at COP27 , if we get to speak, would just be to highlight how much Irish young people are looking for more local solutions," she said. There is no transparency at the moment - or data, really, she explained, in terms of how much carbon each area is creating. "If we don't know how much carbon we're emitting in each area, how are we supposed to know how we can reduce it?" Like Rosalind, she fears the summit could be "all dialogue, where nothing will get done meaningfully". But she believes the human cost from catastrophes like the floods in Pakistan and the famine caused by drought in parts of East Africa, is going to be "a real push factor for people to make those kind of conversations more meaningful". This year\' s COP will be the second one for 22-year-old Oile\'e1n Carter Stritch from Clondalkin in Dublin. She will go as a Youth Ambassador with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications and the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI). She has been a climate advocate since she was 15, and has been involved with NGOs like ECO-UNESCO, NYCI, and Plan International. She said: "As I grew up, I always had this want for social justice and I think I realised how interlinked it was with climate justice and the climate crisis. "People can hear \' climate change\' and the acronyms and jargon and they just zone out and shut themselves out of the conversation, but it\' s all linked to other issues that we have going on around us, including local issues and the cost-of-living crisis. "All this jargon locks the everyday person out of the conversation and it's the everyday person that we need in the conversation." Oile\'e1n hopes countries will make climate targets that are effective at COP27 . "This is why having Youth Ambassadors at this type of meeting, voicing their opinions, is really important. We bring a sense of urgency to the table. "I think we feel a lot of these issues a lot more than older generations because we know that it's really going to affect our future and it's already affecting our future. "I think the news every day is so sad and depressing, and you kind of wonder what's going to happen in the future. I think you would question whether you're going to have a family or where you're going to live, what you're going to do. You question it all." \</doc>

All the signs suggest that the COP27 climate negotiations in Sharm el-Sheikh, which have been ongoing for almost two weeks are unlikely to conclude this evening as scheduled, and are likely to carry over into tomorrow. The Egyptian COP27 COP27 text is unlikely to be completed by the end of today. Minister Eamon Ryan, who is the EU Ministerial Representative at the COP27 negotiations on the issue of climate-related loss and damage, said he does not expect the talks to conclude today. He said there is still a lot to do before an overall agreement can be reached. Overnight the EU formally proposed the establishment of a new Loss and Damage Response Fund to help the poorest and most vulnerable countries who are exposed to some of the worst climate change impacts. The EU proposal would see multiple new sources of finance for such a fund, including levies on aviation, shipping, and the coal and gas industries, as well as richer nation states including China. It would also include other innovative sources of finance. While this formal proposal from the European Union is a sign of progress, there is no agreement yet and it remains to be seen what the response from other countries negotiating at COP27 will be. That offer is inextricably linked to other aspects of the EU proposal which would require all countries to increase their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - mitigation - and increased investment in adaptation measures and finance for developing countries to deal with the impact of the changing climate. There is a fear that the talks could end in failure with the parties still divided on a number of significant issues. Mr Ryan said it is "not certain we'll get a deal across the line". "We would do that at the same time as broadening the source of funds going into that - including the likes of aviation, chipping, fossil fuel industries, reform of the global financial system - to deliver the climate justice we need in the whole climate process," the minister told RT\'c9 News. "At the same time, what we have to do is also get greater ambition and reducing emissions, because the quicker and more we do that, the less the damage will be done and the less the need for such funding. "It's a difficult day ahead of us. It\' s not certain we\' ll get a deal across the line, but I think what we did in the European Union yesterday gives us the possibility of getting that." Minister for Climate HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/EamonRyan @EamonRyan calls for greater ambition on reducing emissions, saying 'the quicker and more we do that, the less damage will be done' and the less need there will be for climate justice funding for vulnerable countries | HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/hashtag/cop27 # cop27 | HYPERLINK https://t.co/XiZEkh8XUF https://t.co/XiZEkh8XUF HYPERLINK https://t.co/sXVHh2vPiu pic.twitter.com/sXVHh2vPiu HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/rtenews/status/1593527820780998657 November 18, 2022 Developing and poorer countries had been demanding that richer and more developed countries should provide financial compensation to them for the loss and damages they have, and will continue to suffer, due to extreme weather events and the impacts of climate change, for which they claim they have had the least amount of responsibility. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has warned negotiators that the blame game is a recipe for mutually assured destruction and urged them to act quickly. He described what is unfolding at COP27 last evening as a clear breakdown in trust between north and south, with less than 24 "scheduled" hours remaining in the marathon climate negotiations. It was billed at the "Implementation COP", a summit that would finally get countries to step up and deliver on the Paris Climate accord of 2015. That would mean increased pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the delivery of \€ 100 billion per year in international climate finance that poorer countries are still waiting for, and an increased focus on efforts to prevent the rise in global temperatures exceeding one point five degrees. But so far it is not shaping up like that. A small number of countries tried but failed to get the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit dropped, saying it is unrealistic and too hard to achieve. The language around phasing out the use of coal has been weakened in a draft text to phasing out "the unabated" use of coal. Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies has become phasing out and "rationalising inefficient fossil fuel subsidies", another weakening. Not surprisingly climate activists are alarmed heading into the final day. Mr Guterres has said that the most efficient way to re establish trust between the richer and poorer countries - the so-called Global North and Global South - is by finding an ambitious and credible agreement on loss and damage and financial support for developing countries. Yet the sides are miles apart. Ministers from poor nations on the frontlines of fiercer floods, droughts and storms said the COP27 talks would let down their hard-hit people if they end without agreement on a fund to deal with worsening "loss and damage" driven by climate change. "Climate justice delayed will be climate justice denied," said flood-battered Pakistan's climate change minister, Sherry Rehman. She called for "a bargain between the Global North and the Global South" to set up a fund that would later channel billions of dollars to those bearing the brunt of climate change impacts. "It is of pivotal importance," she said, noting the recent flood in her country from super-charged monsoon rains - which covered a third of its land - had affected 33 million people. "Vulnerability should not become a death sentence, because that is what many economies and countries and people are facing," Ms Rehman said, adding that parts of the world could become uninhabitable if climate change continues unchecked. Mr Guterres said the time for talking on loss and damage finance was over and urged action. "No one can deny the scale of loss and damage we see around the globe. The world is burning and drowning before our eyes," he told journalists. "I urge all (government) parties to show that they see it - and get it. Send a clear signal that the voices of those on the frontlines of the crisis are finally being heard," he added. Some rich nations favour using the new Global Shield Against Climate Risks, which will provide insurance and other social protection to get money fast to disaster-hit communities outside the UN process, in addition to other potential sources of finance such as development banks. Alioune Ndoye, Senegal's environment minister, noted that the group of 46 least developed countries he represents at the talks are already paying the price for climate change - despite being the smallest contributors to planet-heating emissions. In Niger and Nigeria, for example, heavy floods this summer displaced 1.5 million people from their homes, he added. The thorny question facing wealthy governments is where to find more funding when they have yet to meet existing promises of climate finance to vulnerable nations, and are failing to fully cover UN appeals for humanitarian aid, leaving people short of life-saving relief. Overstretched aid agencies have warned at COP27 that they cannot be expected to meet rising needs from people battered by climate disasters. Additional reporting Reuters \</doc>

Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications Eamon Ryan is leading the Irish delegation for the second week of the COP27 Climate Conference at Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. A lot of work, much of it tedious and technical, has been going on behind the scenes at COP27 over the past week as officials and negotiators from the 194 countries, sometimes with opposing interests, inch forward on the key issues. There is also the pressure to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Only 29 out of the 194 participating countries had delivered increased pledges to cut emissions, as required, before the start of the summit last week. There is even bigger pressure for new money for loss and damage that climate change has caused in the poorest countries. The Government has committed to more than double Ireland's international climate finance contribution to \€ 225 million by 2025. \€ 18m of that will be announced by Mr Ryan at the summit today. HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/eile/climate-change/ Latest Climate stories "Loss and damage is a priority for Ireland at COP27 . We are committed to supporting the most vulnerable who continue to be the most exposed to climate change," he said. "Urgent action is required to protect our planet and our people, from further climate-induced devastation. "This means staying true to the science, delivering immediate and rapid reductions in emissions through an accelerated clean energy transition, breaking our dependence on fossil fuels as well as scaling up of climate finance, including for loss and damage in ways that meet the needs of the furthest behind first," Mr Ryan said. "Ireland is committed to deliver a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. The next Climate Action Plan, which will be published in the coming weeks, will set out how we will achieve reductions across key sectors to ensure that we deliver on our commitments under the Paris Agreement", he added. Mr Ryan's engagements at COP27 this week include participating at membership meetings of high-level coalitions, including the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, the High Ambition Coalition, and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition. He will also attend a number of bilateral meetings, and actively participate in negotiation meetings throughout the final days of the summit. \</doc>

Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin has defended the Cop27 summit in Egypt, which has come in for withering criticism from high-profile environmental activists as high-level "greenwashing" and ignoring human rights abuses . The likes of Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg and Guardian environmental political writer George Monbiot have decried the two-week UN-backed event in Sharm el-Sheikh . Ms Thunberg said the event was an exercise in greenwashing - the practice of countries and companies making unproven claims about their environmental credentials through slick marketing with scant evidence to back it up . Mr Monbiot said he would not attend because of Egypt's "brutal and despotic" regime, and that "the decision to hold this conference in Egypt grants unwarranted legitimacy to an illegitimate government" . The likes of Human Rights Watch and other groups claim the host country is stifling dissent from climate scientists . Egypt, which is seeing rising sea levels and water scarcity already having an impact, has silenced critics from inside the country, according to a report from the human rights organisation . The Egyptian government has severely curtailed environmental groups' ability to carry out independent policy, advocacy, andfield work essential to protecting the country's natural environment, it claimed . Mr Martin told the that while he understood the criticism, it was a worthwhile event . "This is an African Cop event, which is the most vulnerable to climate change," he said. "People can be cynical about global gatherings, of course, but it is an event where all global leaders gather together in one place to get things done . "This must become a Cop of action, following on from various pledges. I attended an event hosted by German chancellor Olaf Scholz between the G7 countries, and the V20 group of vulnerable countries, that aims to come to agreement on how best protect those nations. I'm meeting the leader of Vanuatu, one of the vulnerable countries. This is a challenge we must take together . "Cop26 in Glasgow last year was very invigorating and a turning point in the climate change fight, I believe. Now it is time in Sharm el-Sheikh to follow through with actions" . Action Aid Ireland, an organisation that works with women and children, said richer nations can no longer ignore the plight of millions of people losing their lives and livelihoods to climate change . Global lead for climate justice at Action Aid, Teresa Anderson, said: At this Cop27 , governments must finally agree to setting up a financing facility to address loss and damage and give hope to those living through the reality of climate change every day." \</doc>

The first draft of a deal being hashed out at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt would keep a target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius but left many of the most contentious issues in the talks unresolved ahead of tomorrow's deadline. Egypt's COP27 "Time is not on our side, let us come together now and deliver by Friday," COP27 President Sameh Shoukry said in a letter to delegates dated Wednesday and published yesterday. The 20-page draft for a hoped-for final agreement repeats the goal from last year's Glasgow Climate Pact to limit warming to 1.5C, and asks countries "to accelerate measures towards the phase down of unabated coal power and phase out and rationalise inefficient fossil fuel subsidies". It also "welcomes" the fact that delegates had begun discussions on launching a so-called loss and damage fund for countries being ravaged by climate impacts, but did not include details for launching it. Climate-vulnerable countries including tiny island nations want the agreement to lead to a fund, and soon, but wealthy countries have resisted the idea over fear such a deal could open them up to endless financial liability for their historical contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. Delegates have worried the sticking point could stymie agreement at COP27 , this year's edition of the annual United Nations meeting that aims at global action to slow climate change and the damage it causes. "The main thing missing from the cover decision is a clear commitment for financial support for loss and damage for the most vulnerable, and a facility to deliver it," said a Henry Kokofu of Ghana, a spokesperson for the Climate Vulnerable Forum of climate-vulnerable nations. "If the text is not corrected, COP27 will fail the world\' s most vulnerable," he said. EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said the first draft left a lot to be desired. "The cover text still needs a tremendous amount of work," he told Reuters. "So, we will continue the discussions and will give our input and hope that we can find this common ground before the end of the COP." Temperature target On limiting the global temperature rise, the document mirrors language included in last year's COP26 agreement. It stresses "the importance of exerting all efforts at all levels to achieve the Paris Agreement temperature goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial levels". US Special Climate Envoy John Kerry had said last week that a few of the nearly 200 countries gathered for the talks in Sharm El Sheikh had been resisting language around 1.5C, but declined to name them. Scientists say limiting average planetary warming to 1.5C is important to averting the worst effects of climate change. Temperatures have already increased by 1.1C. While last year's climate summit had also agreed to call on countries to outright phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, this year's draft encourages efforts to "phase out and rationalise inefficient fossil fuel subsidies". Catherine Abreu of the E3G non-profit worried that tweak to the language could represent a weakening of the goal. "Instead of a reference to phasing out all fossil fuels we have an even weaker version of the language around coal and fossil fuel subsidies than we got last year," she said. Other unresolved issues include calls for boosting a global goal for finance to help developing countries adapt to the impacts of a warmer world, and plans for ratcheting up targets for cutting climate-warming emissions. "I think the problem is that there's a lot in here, and lots of it will be shot down by parties on all sides", said Tom Evans, a climate policy analyst at E3G. \</doc>

THERE are real fears the two-week Cop27 climate summit could end without any real progress as a number of key issues remain unresolved. Leaders from the host country conceded that time is running out to secure deals before the event in Sharm el-Sheikh winds down this weekend. Egypt's Cop27 presidency special representative Wael Aboulmagd said: "I think we have a larger than normal number of lingering issues. "We would have hoped under the current circumstances to see more willingness to cooperate and accommodate than we are seeing." While leaders at the G20 meeting in Bali agreed to accelerate efforts to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C to avoid the worst effects of climate change, and newly elected Brazilian president Luiz In\'e1cio Lula da Silva announced a reinvigorated commitment to climate change action, there was still pessimism in the halls of Cop27 that lasting and meaningful deals could be agreed. Reuters reported an official close to the talks as saying divisions remain over issues including whether rich nations should set up a fund to cover irreparable damage being wrought by climate change, language addressing fossil fuels use, and whether 1.5C should remain the explicit targeted limit for planetary warming. "There is concern about how we're to get to the end, and there is concern because we're talking about the biggest problem facing humanity," the official said, Environment Minister Eamon Ryan cut a frustrated, if hopeful, figure as he was appointed an EU ministerial representative on 'loss and damage' to work alongside European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans. Mr Ryan told reporters he felt "the prioritisation of the most vulnerable countries... has been undermined". "We're serious here. We're serious about providing the greatest possible support for particularly the most vulnerable countries," he said. "And I suppose the key task is to turn that intent into a common text that people can rally behind. It'll be difficult, it will be probably protracted over the next two days. But we're committed to doing whatever we can to help our union and deliver a good outcome. "It does have to be real money, but it does have to be money from a variety of sources. Like you could end up with a fund that brings in little money, it takes ages to deliver, is bureaucratic, and not directed and targeted at the most important areas. So yes, we need real money, but we need real money in the right place and at scale and from different sources." Some richer countries have resisted culpability for loss and damage, fearing they would be on the hook for large bills to assist more vulnerable countries as the fallout from climate change continues. Mr Ryan said it is important that countries do not lose sight of mitigation, or reducing emissions, as well as adapting to climate change, and compensating for the damage caused. "We cannot lose sight of the need to reduce the emissions," he said. "There's a basic concept here. The more mitigation you do, the less adaptation you need to do. The more adaptation you do, the less loss and damage you'd have to do. In other words, you have a resilient system. "You need all three, you need mitigation of scale, that reduces the need for adaptation, but you need that at scale to reduce the need for for loss damage, because you can avoid a lot of loss and damage if you invest in adaptation," he said. Tr\'f3caire said it has serious concerns at the lack of progress at Cop27 on the establishment of a loss and damage fund, adding that it fears "the issue will be kicked to touch again as the summit enters its final days". Head of advocacy and policy Siobhan Curran said: "So far at Cop we have seen pledges of finance, but these are a re-labelling of previous promises. It's deeply unfair that the world's poorest countries are being forced to divert much needed public finance for sustainable development into dealing with crises and are incurring massive debt." \</doc>

In the end, Cop27 in Sharm el-Sheikh at least ended up making modest progress on loss and damage - nations with high emissions agreeing to pay those countries bearing the brunt of climate mayhem that they had little to do with bringing about. However, yet again, there was no commitment to cutting the emissions accelerating this crisis, without which this agreement is nothing more (as one delegate commented) than a "down-payment on disaster". No seasoned observers are of the opinion that the world is any nearer to tackling the climate emergency. Indeed, the real legacy of Cop27 could well be exposing the climate summit for what it has become, a bloated travelling circus that sets up once a year, and from which little but words ever emerge. It really does beggar belief, that in the course of 27 Cops, there has never been a formal agreement to reduce the world's fossil fuel use. Not only has the elephant been in the room all this time, but over the last quarter of a century it has taken on gargantuan proportions - and still its presence goes unheeded. It is no surprise, then, that from Cop1 in Berlin in 1995 to Egypt this year, emissions have continued to head remorselessly upwards. Expectations were never especially high since Glasgow's Cop26. Even so, Cop27 has to be a new low - held in a country cowed by a malicious dictatorship, the world's biggest plastic polluter on board as a sponsor and hosting more than 600 fossil fuel representatives and many others who are there to prevent, rather than promote progress and action. Some have labelled it the worst Cop ever, and I doubt many would argue. I would never question the sincerity of those working within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, established in 1992, nor those embedded in the Cop climate apparatus, who I know are desperate to find a solution to our predicament. I do, however, seriously wonder whether an annual extravaganza in the full glare of the world's media is the way to do this. In all honesty, it is becoming increasingly difficult to view these events as anything other than photo opportunities for presidents and prime ministers. And there is another huge and growing problem too. The all-encompassing nature of the annual Cop climate conference provides one enormous open goal for fossil fuel representatives; an unprecedented opportunity to kettle ministers and heads of state from every corner of the planet, but particularly the majority world, to browbeat them into handing over their untouched fossil fuel reserves for exploitation. At Cop27 In retrospect, it does seem that the whole idea of annual climate carnivals was probably not the best means of promoting serious action on global heating, but their hijacking by the fossil fuel sector, and failure, year on year, to do the job they were set up to do, surely means that Cop is no longer functioning. I don't claim to be an expert in negotiation policy, and procedure. I can, however, spot when something clearly isn't working and needs a serious reboot. However, if the annual Cop climate conferences go then what would replace them? What is needed is an apparatus less cumbersome and more manageable - something leaner and meaner that zeros in on the most critical aspects of the climate crisis, that does its work largely hidden from the glare of the media, and which presents a less obvious honey pot to the busy bees of the fossil fuel sector. One way forward, then, could be to establish a number of smaller bodies, each addressing one of the key issues - notably energy, agriculture, deforestation, transport, loss and damage, and perhaps others. Such bodies would operate full-time, liaising with one another and perhaps coming together a few times a year. Ideally, they would be made up of representatives from developed and majority -world countries. In direct contact with representatives of national governments, part of their remit would be to negotiate agreements that are workable, legally binding, and which actually do the job - whether reversing deforestation, cutting methane emissions, or drawing down coal usage. As and when all terms and conditions are agreed, these could be validated and signed off by world leaders as a matter of course and without the need for the ballyhoo of a global conference. In the 1970s the economist and early environmentalist, EF Schumacher, wrote that in respect of economics, small is beautiful. It is a phrase that today could equally well apply to our international negotiating efforts to bring global heating to heel. After the abject failure of Cop27 it's worth a try, surely.

Wheelchair struggles, scarce drinking water, $15 sandwiches and hotel price-gouging at the COP27 climate summit have sparked anger and forced host country Egypt into damage-control mode, participants at the two-week meet said. Organising a UN climate conference - which brings together up to 35,000 people from 195 countries each year - is a world-class logistical challenge, and veterans of the nearly 30-year process are used to minor inconvenience. But this year's sprawling event in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh has been plagued with problems, participants say, the most basic perhaps being accessibility. Pratima Gurung, who works with a disability advocacy group, said she and the Disability Rights Fund's Krishna Gahatraj, who uses a wheelchair, have been left in the middle of the road "multiple times" while waiting for shuttle buses. Organisers "haven't clearly instructed the drivers" on how to accommodate people with disabilities, said Gurung, who runs the National Indigenous Disabled Women Association in Nepal. Though ramps abound, attendees with physical impairments say they are not standard, and that the UN climate summit has been especially difficult for them to navigate. "As a disabled person, COP is inherently inaccessible for me," said Sustained Ability's Jason Boberg, who has attended the past five summits organised by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC. Last year's meeting in Glasgow also saw accessibility issues, with the Israeli energy minister initially unable to enter in her wheelchair. 'Most confusing COP ever' Another recurrent complaint in Sharm el-Sheikh is poor and scarce signage. "This is the most confusing COP ever," said Bianca, a three-time climate summit attendee who asked to be identified only by her first name. The size of a small town, the COP27 area is a sprawling archipelago of pavilions, meeting rooms, halls connected by bitumen roads that soak up the 30 degree Celsius heat. Journalists in a hangar-like media centre could be seen wrapped in jackets and shawls to protect themselves against the industrial-strength air conditioning. Also problematic and ironic, given the topic at hand, is a chronic shortage of drinking water. During the first week of the conference, which runs until 18 November, sparse water dispensers stood empty for hours at a stretch. Delegates took to bringing in their own supplies, and a few were said to have ignored warnings not to drink desalinated water running from bathroom taps. "People already under stress" should not "have to look for water all the time", said one climate COP veteran from an NGO. Exorbitant food prices, including sandwiches going for up to $15, have been especially problematic for those on tight budgets. "I have never seen prices like this at a COP," the NGO representative said, declining to be identified. In response to the complaints, organisers on Thursday made drinks free and slashed food prices in half for the rest of the conference. Well before COP27 kicked off on 6 November, alarm bells were ringing as the tourist town's hotels suddenly tripled or quadrupled room rates, even for those with confirmed bookings. Some delegates arrived to find their reservations had been cancelled. "People are now stranded, sleeping on the road, in bus stations," youth activist Olumide Idowu from Nigeria wrote on Twitter on Monday. At a press briefing on Thursday, special representative of the COP27 presidency, Wael Aboulmagd, told reporters that the "one case where people were asked to leave" will "not happen again", and that "government officials have intervened." \</doc>

The European Union supports a call by India to phase down fossil fuel use as part of a COP27 deal, the bloc's climate policy chief Frans Timmermans has said, provided it does not weaken previous agreements on reducing the use of coal. India, the world's second-biggest buyer of coal, wants countries to agree to phase down all fossil fuels at the UN climate summit in Egypt, rather than a narrower deal to phase down coal that was agreed at COP26 last year. "We are in support of any call to phase down all fossil fuels," Mr Timmermans told a news conference. "But we also have to make sure that this call does not diminish the earlier agreements we had on phasing down coal, so if it comes on top of what we already agreed in Glasgow, then the EU will support in this proposal." Mr Timmermans' comments come even as the EU ramps up its quest for coal and natural gas in the near term to counter an energy supply crunch triggered by high demand and supply disruptions since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The proposal could benefit India by easing the global focus on its coal use, but is also likely to face stiff opposition from developing countries with rich oil and gas deposits that want to avoid language limiting their use. "We have come out strongly to indicate that we should be facilitated to sustainably explore our oil and gas resources," Irene Batebe, permanent secretary at Uganda's energy ministry, said. "For us, and that's the African Union's position, we wouldn't be pushing for a phase down, unless the phase down is clearly defined, because many of us are discovering new resources," Ms Batebe said. Saudi energy ministry official and COP27 negotiator, Khalid Abuleif, said his country, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' biggest producer, was worried the final talks would "demonise" the fossil fuel industry. India was among the countries resistant to efforts to eliminate coal at last year's climate talks in Glasgow when the final deal at the last minute dropped wording calling for a phase out of coal-fired power, replacing it with phase down. Mr Timmermans said the EU was not seeking to dictate a country's investment plan but wanted to send a warning on investing in fossil fuels. "I'm not telling African countries not to invest in fossils, let me be very clear about that. I'm just telling them 'be careful what you do' because if you invest in coal now, you're sure to create stranded assets. If you invest in oil, you're probably going to create stranded assets," he said. He said natural gas "is a different situation for which I have some understanding, especially if you combine that with infrastructure that is prefitted to also carry gases with other densities, such as green hydrogen or green ammonia in the future." Natural gas burns cleaner than coal, but drilling it and getting it to market often leads to leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. The Egyptian COP27 Presidency last night released a two-page sketch of what could become a deal, featuring bullet points outlining many of the issues countries have asked be included - some of which have deeply divided nations. The document did not refer to fossil fuels, although a COP Presidency spokesperson later said the list was not exhaustive and did not contain the language that would be used in the final version. North vs South COP27 has exposed deep divisions between wealthy polluters and nations vulnerable to the most ferocious climate impacts. "The lack of leadership and ambition on mitigating greenhouse gas emissions is worrisome," said Senegalese Environment Minister Alioune Nodoye, speaking on behalf of the Least Developed Countries Group. Belize Climate Change Minister Orlando Habet called for more action from the G20 group of the world's wealthiest nations, which are responsible for 80% of global emissions and are meeting at summit in Indonesia. "In how many COPs have we been arguing for urgent climate action? And how many more do we need, how many lives do we need to sacrifice," Mr Habet said. UN climate talks often go into overtime and this year's meeting, due to end on Friday, could be no different. The first draft of the final declaration only has bullet points so far, with a line on the "urgency of action to keep 1.5C in reach". Wealthy and developing nations are sharply divided over money at COP27 . HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/eile/climate-change/ Latest Climate News Developing countries says this year's floods in Pakistan, which have cost the country up to $40 billion, have highlighted the pressing need to create a "loss and damage" compensation fund. In a small breakthrough, the United States and European Union agreed to have the issue discussed at COP27 But Western governments favour using existing financial channels instead of building a new mechanism. COP27 started on 6 November. "Loss and damage must remain firmly on the table as we continue to witness increasing appearances of severity of climate change impacts everywhere," Samoan Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata£fa told delegates. "The financial burden for loss and damage falls almost entirely on affected countries and not those most responsible for climate change." \</doc>

I N SEPTEMBER 2020, I travelled to the Arctic aboard a Greenpeace ship with scientists looking to find if the ice was at its thinnest in history. We found the ice to be at its second thinnest ever, only beaten by a year when the weather had caused it to be worse. Photos from that day went viral, being published in 200 news outlets around the world. For me, as I stood there for four hours, it was a profoundly emotional experience. What the photographs do not show is the sound of the sea gushing below the ice, just below me. Despite my call to various UN world leaders from the ship, nothing changed then and nothing has changed since. Look at all the weather disasters just in this year alone, especially the floods in Bangladesh - where my Nanabhai and Nanu's (grandfather and grandmother) family are from - and in Pakistan where one-third of the country was submerged under water, and the record-breaking heatwaves across Europe and the world. At one point over the at night, hundreds of burning Last year, I attended COP26, which was hosted by the UK government in Glasgow, and spoke on various panels. But the lack of action or leadership from government was disastrous. The final straw was the proposal agreed by then president Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil to end illegal deforestation - by 2030, basically allowing him to continue his mass deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon. I travelled there in 2019, witnessing the Amazon rainforest being chopped down by unrelenting Bolsonaro supporters. At one point we flew over the Amazon at night, seeing hundreds of fires burning below. we flew fires When I left Glasgow to go back to university in Cambridge, I felt totally demoralised and disheartened. COP26 had failed me and every young person around the world, whether they knew it or not. However, COP26 did agree to limit global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels, but the countries in the global north are nowhere near hitting this target. COP27 being held in Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt is totally unacceptable. The Sinai is enclosed and those without entry to COP27 will be restricted. There is no right to protest, and so it is unsafe for protesters and women in particular. For this reason, I am not attending and I do not recommend others attend, especially women. However, there is plenty of spin from the Egyptian leadership. President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi said: "I deeply believe that COP27 is an opportunity to showcase unity against an existential threat that we can only overcome through concerted action and effective implementation. "As the incoming presidency, Egypt will spare no effort to ensure that COP27 becomes the moment when the world moved from negotiation to implementation and where words were translated to actions, and where we collectively embarked on a path towards sustainability, a just transition and eventually a greener future for coming generations." There are so many issues that need to be tackled as a matter of urgency. I do not have much hope, but I think that it is important to focus on some of the world's most pressing problems. We must stop all new fossil fuel projects and end all existing projects. We must put a stop to all deforestation - whether for logging, palm oil or cattle. We need urgent research into improving renewable energy and new technologies. What we need from COP27 is to bridge the mitigation gap to help limit global temperature rise to 1.5C; to deliver high-quality and scaled-up finance flows, especially to the most vulnerable; to enhance efforts to implement adaptation measures; to secure finance for loss and damage; and to implement the Paris Rulebook to hold countries and non-state actors accountable.

We have been at this for 30 years. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the UNFCCC) is an international agreement started 30 years ago to bring all the countries together to act collectively and face up to the humanity's biggest threat - to stop dangerous human-induced planetary climate change. How does COP work? Over 190 governments and states have signed up and are committed to act. Obviously some are more committed than others. The countries who have signed up are referred to as "Parties" to the framework convention. Once a year these parties assemble somewhere in the world at a huge meeting called a "Conference of the Parties" or COP for short. The aim at these meetings - which last for up to a fortnight - is to assess progress on global climate action, and pile on the pressure for countries to do more. Last year the gathering took place in Glasgow, Scotland. This year its being held at Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt\' s holiday resort on the Red Sea. This will be the 27th year the "Parties" will have met. That\' s why it is called COP27 . COP27 however is still in dispute, according to Associate Professor of Climate Policy at UCD, Dr Cara Augustenborg. The issue, she says, is that wealthy countries say they want to focus on helping developing nations "get off" fossil-fuels and transition instead to renewable sources of energy. However, the developing countries have a different take. They say they are already experiencing the impacts of climate change. They want to focus instead on getting financial compensation for the climate change impacts that they did not cause. The money that poorer countries are demanding is for the likes of having to move villages and towns away from the sea or from flood-prone regions to protect the lives and livelihoods of impoverished people. The so-called Global South - a term used to describe the poorer and most vulnerable nations - have spend years banging the table to get rich countries to pay for the economic losses associated with weather-related disasters and other climate impacts that they are already experiencing. Separate to this issue of compensation for loss and damage, the richer developed nations gave a firm commitment at a COP meeting in 2009 to provide $100bn in funding per year to help less developed nations adapt to, and overcome, the challenges and impacts of climate change. But 13 years on since then and we are far short of the $100bn funding target. This has fuelled a loss of trust among poorer countries and undermined any sense of solidarity around tackling climate change. COP27 So will the real focus of COP27 end up being the need for financial reparations to be paid to developing nations or will it instead turn out to be about helping those developing nations to transition away from fossil fuels. We will have to wait and see. The Secretary General of the United Nations Antonio Gutteres is urging both sides to work together to form a historic pact. " COP27 must be the place to close the ambition gap, the credibility gap, and the solidarity gap. To rebuild trust and to re-establish the ambition needed to avoid driving our planet over the climate cliff," he said. However, in reality what matters even more is the need for continued pressure to get greenhouse gas emissions down urgently. That is the only way to prevent runaway climate change which would be catastrophic. In the last few weeks, report after report have painted a clear and bleak picture. Take for instance the 2022 Emissions Gap Report from the United Nations. It speaks about a "closing window" for climate action and says that the international community has fallen far short of what is required. Emissions are still growing at record levels. So far, human induced greenhouse gas emissions have warmed the earth by almost 1.2C compared to pre-industrial times. The recent United in Science report coordinated by the World Meteorological Organisation said there is now a 50% chance that the Earth will exceed 1.5C of warming at least one year during the next five years. Meanwhile temperatures are on course to rise by as much as 2.8C by the end of this century with the present policies in place. What this all means is that our planet is on course to reaching tipping points, that will make climate chaos irreversible and temperature rises unavoidable. From tipping points of disaster to turning points of hope The United Nations Secretary General says that governments at COP27 need to move us away from the tipping points of climate disaster towards turning points for hope instead. That will require urgently increasing ambition and trust, especially between the global north and south, he says. Time is clearly running out when it comes to reducing emissions. The major focus at COP27 really needs to be on making sure that government pledges about emissions reductions are increased as much as possible. And this means not just increasing the pledges from wealthy nations but increasing climate pledges from developing countries too. The fact that COP27 is being held in Africa this year is particularly relevant as 17 million people in the Horn of Africa are currently suffering from extreme climate stress and the onset of famine. This is something that Emeritus Professor at Maynooth University John Sweeney - a veteran participant at COP meetings - says developing countries will want to highlight at Sharm El Sheikh. But Professor Sweeney says he is also worried this year about the impact of growing geopolitical tensions between the world\' s two largest greenhouse gas emitters, the United States of America and China. There are also the very serious considerations related to the war in Ukraine, spiralling food and energy prices, deepening concerns about public finances and the devastating impacts of the pandemic. Many countries are now prioritising their own energy needs over and above global climate ambitions. This increased focus on short-term issues, has caused some governments to take their eye off the ball in terms of what Professor Sweeney describes as "a tidal wave of climate change" that the whole world is facing over the next few years. Because of all this, COP27 is not expected to achieve as much as some previous COP meetings. If that turns out to be the case, it would be an unfortunate loss of the limited amount of time left for the world to act. \</doc>

Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan has defended the Government's climate change pledges at COP27 . In his HYPERLINK address to the climate summit in Egypt yesterday, the Taoiseach announced Ireland would donate \€ 10m to the Global Shield initiative for 2023 . The initiative is aimed at scaling up finance needed to protect against climate risks in poor countries. Speaking as he arrived for this morning's Cabinet meeting, Mr Ryan said he "didn't know about that definition of old money or new money, but it is important that we did provide the money and that we were there offering support." He added: "There is new money. We have to deliver on the commitment we made last year which is up to \€ 225 million a year for climate finance, and that's really important first of all that we help the developing world to switch to renewables, protect them from the climate change that is happening and also to provide for loss and damage. "The details of that are going to discussed at COP, the Toaiseach was obviously involved in those negotiations yesterday but the real work will be done in the next ten days." Mr Ryan said that Ireland would be working collectively "within the European Union negotiating position". \</doc>

Countries adopted a hard-fought final agreement at the COP27 climate summit early that sets up a fund to help poor countries being battered by climate disasters - but does not boost efforts to tackle the emissions causing them. After tense negotiations that ran through the night, the Egyptian COP27 presidency released the final text for a deal and simultaneously called a plenary session to quickly gavel it through. The swift approval for creating a dedicated loss and damage fund still left many of the most controversial decisions on the fund until next year, including who should pay into it. Negotiators made no objections as COP27 President Sameh Shoukry rattled through the final agenda items. And by the time dawn broke over the summit venue in the Egyptian resort of Sharmel-Sheikh, the deal was done. Despite having no agreement for tougher emissions reductions, "we went with what the agreement was here because we want to stand with the most vulnerable," said Germany's climate secretary Jennifer Morgan, visibly upset. Delegates praised the breakthrough on setting up the fund as climate justice, for its aim in helping vulnerable countries cope with storms, floods and other disasters being fuelled by rich nations' historic carbon emissions. When asked by Reuters whether the goal of stronger climate-fighting ambition had been compromised for the deal, Mexico's chief climate negotiator Camila Zepeda summed up the mood among exhausted negotiators. "Probably. You take a win when you can." Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan, who was the EU lead negotiator on loss and damage at the summit, described the deal reached as "historic". Speaking to RT\'c9 News at the end of the conference, he said: "Firstly I'm relieved, and I think for the developing world and for climate justices in this world, it is a historic deal. "It's just a political decision, but it is a decision that gives this mandate to change the global financial system to support loss and damage. To support the countries hit most by climate change." However, the minister said that the deal does not do enough to make progress on climate mitigation. Mr Ryan said: "We have seen in the last year, our world where we have floods in Pakistan, droughts, temperatures in Europe we have never seen before. And what is in this text doesn't give us the leap we need to make in that. "We are going to have to come back COP and the one after and deliver greater ambition." Minister Eamon Ryan has described the deal reached by delegates at the COP27 summit as "historic". He said that the deal supports countries hit most by climate change | HYPERLINK https://t.co/wPZeWTMBYy https://t.co/wPZeWTMBYy HYPERLINK https://t.co/erZgqChbeW pic.twitter.com/erZgqChbeW HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/rtenews/status/1594269894299860993 November 20, 2022 The two-week summit has been seen as a test of global resolve to fight climate change - even as a war in Europe, energy market turmoil and rampant consumer inflation distract international attention. Billed as the "African COP," the summit in Egypt had promised to highlight the plight of poor countries facing the most severe consequences from global warming caused mainly by wealthy, industrialised nations. Negotiators from the European Union and other countries had said earlier that they were worried about efforts to block measures to strengthen last year's Glasgow Climate Pact. "It is more than frustrating to see overdue steps on mitigation and the phase-out of fossil energies being stonewalled by a number of large emitters and oil producers," German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in a statement. In line with earlier iterations, the approved deal did not contain a reference requested by India and some other delegations to phasing down use of "all fossil fuels". It instead called on countries to take steps toward "the phasedown of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies," as agreed at the COP26 Glasgow summit. "Too many parties are not ready to make more progress today in the fight against climate crisis," EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said, describing the deal as "not enough of a step forward for people and planet." The text also included a reference to "low-emissions energy", raising concern among some that it opened the door to the growing use of natural gas - a fossil fuel that leads to both carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Small island nations facing a climate-driven rise in sea level had pushed for the loss and damage deal, but lamented the lack of ambition on curbing emissions. "I recognise the progress we made in COP27 " in terms of establishing the fund, the Maldives climate minister, Aminath Shauna, told the plenary. But "we have failed on mitigation ...We have to ensure that we increase ambition to peak emissions by 2025. We have to phase out fossil fuel." The climate envoy from the Marshall Islands said she was "worn out" but happy with the fund's approval. "So many people all this week told us we wouldn't get it. So glad they were wrong," Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner said by email. Still, "I wish we got fossil fuel phase out. The current text is not enough." \</doc>

Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin will address global leaders later today when he outlines Ireland's position on climate action at the COP27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. He is expected to make it clear that Ireland remains committed to scaling up its contribution to international climate finance in support of vulnerable communities who are impacted most by climate change. HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/news/2022/1107/1333611-cop27-climate-summit/ Secretary General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres warned leaders that the clock is ticking , that the global climate fight will be won or lost in this crucial decade, and that all hands on deck are needed for faster bolder climate action. On his arrival at the summit yesterday, HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/news/2022/1107/1333583-cop27/ the Taoiseach said it is very important that world leaders are brought together annually to keep a focus on climate change At a round table event on food and security, he also emphasised the irrefutable link between conflict and food insecurity, and utterly condemned what he described as Russian President Vladimir Putin\' s weaponising of hunger. Later today when he makes his formal COP27 address, Mr Martin is expected to tell fellow leaders that not only is Ireland committed to scaling up its international climate finance contribution, but that it is also resolute about making real progress on the issue of loss and damage for climate impacts, recognising that this is a key priority for developing countries. Mr Guterres told leaders yesterday that progress on this issue will be the litmus test of whether COP27 Chair of the Elders and former President of Ireland Mary Robinson said the war in Ukraine broke a momentum that existed after COP26, because European countries have been forced to focus on how they can replace gas from Russia with gas from other sources. Now is the moment for Europe to go "even faster" into clean energy, she said.

She said she would attend the second week of COP27 , because she wants to assess "all the talk of the leaders". "We just don't have the political will. That's what I'll be calling out if governments don't do in commitments what they say. And that will be right across the board. The Elders are global. So we call out the United States if necessary, we call out Europe if necessary, but we also call out the ones who are supporting too much the fossil fuel lobby." Mrs Robinson also said that countries like China and India have done a lot to harness solar energies but the leaders from these countries are not at COP27 . However they will attend the G20 which is responsible for more money than COP, she added. Mrs Robinson said the economies of developed countries were built on fossil fuels and these countries are now telling developing countries they should not do the same. She said that it is important that Africa can use its gas - especially for clean cooking - but the case must be made that building a new infrastructure on oil and gas would not be a good idea.

Ruth Spencer, from Antigua and Barbuda, said "alternatives that work" must be found and new voices brought to the decision making process on climate action. Speaking on RT\'c9's Morning Ireland, she said that that one size will not fit all and peoples' ideas and solutions must be brought into the process. Ms Spencer said that even on small islands the wrong decisions can be made and once a bad environmental decision is made, everybody suffers. For the future generations and protections of our eco systems, we must speak out, she said. "We have to be alarmist. We have to sound the alarm to the public that sometimes the decisions made for projects and activities will bring harm." \</doc>

UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has defended his heavily criticised decision not to attend next month's COP27 climate change summit, saying he had to focus on "pressing" economic problems. In an interview with Sky News a day after Downing Street announced he was skipping the summit, the prime minister stressed he was "very personally committed" to environmental issues. "I just think at the moment it's right that I'm also focusing on the pressing domestic challenges we have with the economy, and I think that's what people watching would reasonably expect me to be doing as well," Mr Sunak said. The COP27 Opposition Labour party leader Keir Starmer attacked the Tory leader's decision to "shun" the event, while Green Party leader Caroline Lucas said that Mr Sunak's absence was a "shameful way to end the UK's COP Presidency". The UK hosted the previous summit, COP26, in Glasgow in Scotland in 2021, with British politician Alok Sharma serving as president. Mr Sunak said the UK should be "really proud of how we're doing" as "one of the countries that has decarbonised the fastest". Downing Street confirmed today that King Charles III, who has long taken a keen interest in environmental issues, will not be going to the summit either. A spokeswoman said the royals had sought government advice earlier and officials had unanimously agreed it was not the "right occasion" for the monarch to go in person. She said she was not aware of any changes. Charles and his son Prince William spoke at the 2021 event. Former health minister and now environment minister Therese Coffey told Sky News this morning that "it's up to him (Charles)" whether to go to the summit. The minister downplayed the significance of the Egypt event, saying: "The big push happened last year in Glasgow." \</doc>

The European Union has warned that it was prepared to walk away from climate negotiations if a satisfactory outcome could not be reached, but said it still believed a deal could be struck between negotiators at the COP27 summit in Egypt. "We need to move forward, not backwards and all (EU) ministers ... are prepared to walk away if we do not have a result that does justice to what the world is waiting for - namely that we do something about this climate crisis," said EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the summit, he called on other parties to the negotiations to reciprocate efforts to find a deal, particularly on the issue of funding for poorer countries hit by climate disasters. "We believe that a positive result today is still within reach. But we are worried about some of the things we have seen and heard over the last, let's say, 12 hours," he said. "We'd rather have no decision than a bad decision." Meanwhile, COP27 "The vast majority of the parties indicated to me they considered the text as balanced and that they constitute a potential breakthrough that can lead to consensus," Mr Shoukry, who is also Egypt's foreign minister, told journalists as the talks went into overtime. Negotiators were poised to make a final push for a deal at the summit, as persistent disagreements over money forced the two-week talks into overtime. Complicating matters, US Special Climate Envoy John Kerry - a powerful force in climate diplomacy - tested positive for Covid-19 following days of bilateral in-person meetings with counterparts from China and the European Union to Brazil and the United Arab Emirates. The outcome of the conference, which was meant to end yesterday, is widely seen as a test of global resolve to fight climate change, as a war in Europe and rampant consumer inflation distract international attention. But it left crucial issues unresolved, including the main sticking point between rich and poor nations of how to compensate countries already ravaged by climate-driven floods, droughts, mega-storms and wildfires. In a potential breakthrough, the EU said late on Thursday it would back the demand of the G77 group of 134 developing countries to set up a fund to help them cope with so-called "loss and damage". But it was unclear yesterday whether developing countries would accept the EU's stipulation that the funding come from abroad base of countries including China, and that only "the most vulnerable countries" benefit from the aid. Delegates were still waiting to learn how the United States and China would respond. Some countries, including the EU and Britain, have also pushed for the overall deal in Egypt to lock in country commitments for more ambitious climate action. Others, including India, are hoping the final deal asks countries to phase down all fossil fuel use, instead of just coal - an idea that resource-rich countries, especially in Africa, have resisted. A deal at COP27 must be made with support from all of the nearly 200 countries present. \</doc>

Guardian and Irish Examiner reporters Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has said she will skipCop27 talks in Egypt, criticising the global summit as a forum for "greenwashing". The Cop27 "I'm not going to Cop27 for many reasons, but the space for civil society this year is extremely limited," she said at the launch of her latest book in London. The 19-year-old activist had previously tweeted to express solidarity with "prisoners of conscience" being held in Egypt. The UN's 27th conference on climate opens in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm elSheikh on November 6. "The Cops are mainly used as an opportunity for leaders and people in power to get attention, using many different kinds of greenwashing," she said. The Cop conferences, she added, "are not really meant to change the whole system", but instead encourage gradual progress. "So as it is, the Cops are not really working, unless of course we use them as an opportunity to mobilise." Ms Thunberg was among those who last week signed a petition by a human rights coalition calling on Egyptian authorities to open up civic space and release political prisoners. The petition had almost a thousand organisational and individual signatories including 350.org, Amnesty International, and Climate Action Network, the world's largest climate network made up of over 1,500 civil society organisations. Some groups, including Greenpeace UK, were criticised for not signing the petition. The event in Sharm-El-Sheikh has already been a lightning rod for controversy, with Human Rights Watch and other groups claiming the host country is stifling dissent from climate scientists. Egypt, which is seeing the impact of rising sea levels and water scarcity, has silenced critics from inside the country, according to a report from the human rights organisation. The Egyptian government has severely curtailed environmental groups' ability to carry out independent policy, advocacy, and field work essential to protecting the country's natural environment, it claimed. Released last week, Ms Thunberg's The Climate Book includes about 100 contributions from various experts, including economist Thomas Piketty, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and the writer Naomi Klein. Ms Thunberg's royalties for the book will go to her foundation, which will distribute them to charitable organisations working on environmental issues. The activist said she wanted the book to "be educational, which is a bit ironic since my thing is school strikes", referring to her protests in front of the Swedish parliament starting in 2018. \</doc>

Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney will represent the Irish Government at several high-level meetings and events at the COP27 climate talks in Sharm el-Sheikh today. Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2022/1108/1333804-cop-27/ warned fellow leaders yesterday The heads of states and political leaders have now left COP27 and Sharm el-Sheikh after delivering more than one hundred National Climate Statements over the two days. Today the focus will shift to the theme of climate finance - the cornerstone for implementing climate actions and scaling up ambition. A special report, commissioned from the Independent High-Level Expert Group on Climate Finance for COP27 , found that by 2025, $1 trillion in investment per year will be required to cut greenhouse gases, boost climate resilience, restore nature, and pay for the damage caused by extreme weather events in developing countries outside of China alone. By 2030 that figure will be up to $2.4 trillion per year. How to ensure that kind of money is made available in an affordable manner, and who will provide it, will be very much under the spotlight today. HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/eile/climate-change/ Latest stories on climate change Speaking on RT\'c9 Morning Ireland Stephen Nolan, managing director of the United Nations Development Programme's Sustainable Finance Hub, said it was vital that recent progress around funding is maintained this week. "I think this is a key COP for the momentum to be maintained and built on from COP26 last year," he said. "You see the latest few days reports around $1 trillion per annum by 2025 now required - and that builds to $2.4 trillion by 2030. "So those figures are quite big, however in terms of society we've never had so much money in humankind, and that capital now needs to be deployed in an urgent way to tackle climate change." He said sustainable finance was facing the same pressures as the broader investment scene, with access to capital tightening as interest rates rise and economies brace for a downturn. However he said, in the long-term, the messages coming from governments would be key to expanding the amount of money that's directed to the cause. "The key thing is investors are looking at the policy signals being sent by policy makers," he said. "So if you look at the EU, you've got Fit for 55 and the EU Green Deal. In the US you've got the inflation reduction act. "So investors are gearing up on the basis of those two key policy agendas from two big jurisdictions, seeing that a lot of capital has to flow to meet those policy objectives." A report from Skillsnet Ireland today highlighted the need for more training around climate finance in Ireland. Mr Nolan said Ireland had been recognised internationally as a leader in the area of climate finance training and the key now was to build on that and train more people in the coming years. Mr Nolan also said that tight regulation was key to ensuring that 'greenwashing' did not succeed, as it was vital that sustainable finance was used for genuinely sustainable projects. \</doc>

W ARNINGS from UN secretary general Antonio Guterres at the Cop27 climate summit that humanity is on a "highway to climate hell" may seem overly dramatic to some, but they should be taken extremely seriously. Climate change is not a problem facing a few countries, but the entire world, and this is evident in the disastrous floods in Pakistan and heatwaves across Europe and China. The climate summit - which is held annually and involves more than 90 heads of state and representatives from 190 countries - is meant to be a place where governments agree on policies to tackle the impacts of climate change and limit global temperature rises. However, it is frequently criticised for being a "talking shop" which results in little change. Each year, the warnings coming from those attending the summit are increasingly dire. Earlier this week, Mr Guterres said: "We are in the fight of our lives and we are losing and our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible. "We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator." He stressed that the summit could effect real change if both developed and developing countries make a deal on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and set out a low-carbon future. The alternative doesn't bear thinking about. Already, however, we have seen criticism from the representatives of poor countries hitting out at richer nations for not paying their fair share. That is understandable, given wealthy countries are the biggest greenhouse gas polluters, while poorer countries often bear the brunt of extreme weather caused by climate change. In order to avert a full-blown crisis, the switch to alternative fuels needs to happen as a matter of urgency, but ultimately, it is down to the larger, richer countries to lead the way. In that regard, the signs don't look good. Chinese leader Xi Jinping, for instance, whose country emits more greenhouse gas emissions than any other country, is not even attending the summit, while UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak originally said he was too busy to go, only to perform a U-turn later. Kicking the can down the road when it comes to tackling climate change will only pass on a worse situation to future generations. Will Cop27 result in a landmark pact to put the Earth on the right path? Only time will tell... and time is running out. \</doc>

Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan will seek Cabinet approval later today to provide for Ireland's full participation in the COP27 Climate Summit. Mr Ryan is due to travel to Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt for the conference of parties later this month. He will also seek the Government's approval today to grant him authority to sign up to any initiatives or agreements reached at the conference. The COP27 During that time, the conference will be attended by Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Minister of State for Overseas Development Aid Colm Brophy. Separately, ministers will be told at Cabinet today that delivery targets, as set out under the Government's Housing For All strategy, are on course to be achieved by the end of the year. They will hear that Ireland remains on course to achieve its overall housing delivery target of 24,600 homes by the end of the year. Over 8,000 social homes are under construction. A target of 9,000 social homes delivered by the end of the year is set out under Housing For All. Ways to improve delivery will also be discussed, including the expansion of modern construction methods and the sourcing of additional construction workers. Meanwhile, Minister for Education Norma Foley will tell today's meeting that inflation has contributed to increased expenditure for her department. According to the third quarter expenditure report, net capital expenditure is \€ 170 million ahead of profile and net current expenditure is \€ 141 million ahead of profile. A 21% rise in building costs in the year to June, increases in the provision of special classes and special school places and the arrival of around 12,000 additional students from Ukraine all contributed to the rise in spending. Minister for Housing Darragh O'Brien will bring a memo on the appointment of the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) as the statutory registration body for the construction sector. This change was provided for under a law passed by the Oireachtas known as the Regulation of Providers of Building Works Act. It is seen as a way to help better protect consumers and give those that engage with a registered builder assurance that they are dealing with a compliant operator. Separately, Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys will seek approval to expand the eligibility for Community Employment Schemes. \</doc>

COP27 took place against the backcloth of an energy crisis, a food crisis and a financial crisis. Even before the conference began, people had low expectations about what COP27 could achieve, calling it "the in-between COP". The conference marketed with the slogan 'Together for Implementation', from the outset the Egyptian presidency were clear that this COP was about implementation, action and "holding people to account" for promises they had made - to echo the words of UN climate chief Simon Stiell. However, both implementation and "holding people to account" proved to be difficult on the ground in Egypt. This is demonstrated by the fact that COP27 was the second-longest COP to overrun, finishing at 9.19am on Sunday November 20, nearly 40 hours later than intended. Those additional 40 hours were critical for advancing the negotiations and, thanks to this extra time, we now have the Sharm El-Sheik Implementation Plan. Frankly, it is a wonder that we have any text at all: towards the end of week two, it looked unlikely that countries would even strike a deal. But we do, and now the focus shifts to what the Sharm El-Sheik Implementation Plan really achieves. The biggest achievement of the Implementation Plan is the decision to establish a loss and damage fund. This is "an important step towards justice", as the UN secretary-general explains, as the fund will help developing countries to cope with irreversible losses and damages caused by climate change. These losses and damages could be economic (eg, losing your house or job), or non-economic (eg, losing your language or culture). One of the challenges with the issue of loss and damage is that many losses (eg, loss of life) are simply unquantifiable. How can you place an economic value on someone's life? This, in part, was one of the reasons that rich nations opposed loss and damage being included in the final text. Some feared loss and damage represented a bottomless pit of money, and for the first 48 hours of the weekend, before COP27 had begun, parties were fighting about whether to even include loss and damage on the COP agenda as a discussion point. In the days that followed, loss and damage continued to be the most contentious issue at the conference, and it was not until the last official day of COP27 (Friday, November 18) that the EU decided to back a fund. The next day, the US conceded, agreeing to listen to the demands of the 130-plus nations advocating for loss and damage. Now that a loss and damage finance facility has been established, the conversation turns towards how to resource the fund. A popular idea, put forward by UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres and Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, was to fund loss and damage through a 10% windfall tax on oil companies. This seems like a reasonable proposal: had such a windfall tax been introduced in 2022, it would already have raised $24bn (\£320bn). This money would literally not be missed by fossil fuel companies. In fact, even with this tax, fossil fuel profits would still be higher than they were last year. However, where the decision to establish a loss and damage fund gave reason for optimism, the lack of progress on climate mitigation gave reason for disappointment. One year on from COP26 and countries simply copied and pasted old text from the Glasgow Climate Pact, reiterating a "phase-down of unabated coal power" and refusing to commit to 'phase out' fossil fuels. The exemptions granted to fossil fuel companies over the past 50 years have enabled them to make eye-watering profits (this is especially true for 2022), yet it seems crazy that countries still refuse to end their addiction to fossil fuels. Global emissions are rising (having risen by 1% in 2022) and climate scientists repeatedly explain that we need to halve emissions in this decade if we are to have any hope of a liveable future. If we don't move away from fossil fuels, we don't stand a chance of reducing emissions by 50% by 2030 - and we certainly don't stand a chance of "keeping 1.5 alive". The power that the fossil fuel industry harnessed at COP27 (636 fossil fuel lobbyists attended the conference as delegates - a 25% increase from Glasgow) was undoubtedly a key driver behind failure to move forward on this issue. This, then, raises questions for next year: COP28 will take place in the United Arab Emirates, a stronghold for oil and gas investment. Given the influence of the host country in setting the agenda, we can anticipate many challenges ahead. However, if we cut through the fossil fuel lobbyists, the controversial Coca-Cola sponsorship and the corporate greenwash, one of the biggest reasons for hope following COP27 is that the message of global solidarity feels like it is beginning to resonate. As people often say, carbon emissions don't know borders, and we face the choice of "climate solidarity" or "climate suicide", to quote the UN secretary-general. The huge poster on the Pakistan pavilion at COP27 also reminded us of this, writing: "What goes on in Pakistan will not stay in Pakistan." Originally proposed in Rio in 1992, it's taken more than three decades for countries to agree on a fund for loss and damage and accept that the climate crisis is a global issue which requires global action, justice and solidarity. It also feels like we're finally beginning to recognise that the climate crisis is a concern for 'people' as well as 'planet' and that it has seriously devastating human consequences. The centring of loss and damage at COP27 therefore serves to remind us that people are paying for broken promises with their lives and that we're abdicating our responsibility as global citizens of planet earth when we do nothing. \</doc>

KEVIN O'SULLIVAN Science & Environment Editor Deadlocked UN climate talks in Egypt have been extended into the weekend, having been upended by a dramatic intervention by the EU. It proposed a loss-and-damage fund yesterday with an expanded range of financial sources for the most vulnerable countries. The proposal was tied in to a requirement that countries pursue increased ambitions on reducing emissions, building on what was agreed at Cop26 in Glasgow last year - and keeping the key Paris Agreement target of maintaining global temperature increases below 1.5 degrees. The Egyptian presidency chairing the talks, however, published a draft agreement that offered no firm proposal on the first part and fell short on the second, suggesting an impasse as loss and damage is regarded as the litmus test issue on whether Cop27 will be a success or not. The EU proposals bring the fossil fuel sector into the frame by way of making it contribute to loss-and-damage funds for poorer countries being hit by climate-related disasters. The bloc wants large developing-world emitters such as China to pay in. In exchange, countries would vow to peak global emissions before 2025 and to "phase down all fossil fuels" - not just coal, which was spelt out in last year's Glasgow Climate Pact. Leading economies At stake is the question of whether some of the world's leading economies - such as China, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf petrostates, Russia and countries with high per capita income such as South Korea and Singapore - should start contributing for the first time to help the poorest countries experiencing the most severe climate impacts. "The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC] was written from a 1992 perspective," said Minister for the Environment and Climate Eamon Ryan, who is leading EU negotiations on the loss-and-damage issue. \</doc>

AIRLINES, shipping firms and fossil-fuel companies face demands from Ireland and other EU countries to pay for the climate damage caused by their emissions. In a bold move tackling high emitters, proposals are being made to levy every airline ticket sold and every shipping container transported. The profits of coal, oil and gas companies would also be targeted. Money raised would go towards paying the "loss and damage" bills of the poorest, most vulnerable countries hit by climate-related disaster and disruption. The move was outlined by Climate Minister Eamon Ryan earlier this week and has now become the official EU position in talks at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt. Mr Ryan, who is the EU's lead negotiator on loss and damage at the summit, said new data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) strengthened his stance. "The global oil and gas industry will see net income revenue this year of $3.9tn - double what it was last year," he said. "I believe it's fair that they make a contribution towards the funding we will need for the scale of loss and damage we're going to face. "Some 4.5 billion air tickets were sold last year. If we had one euro for every ticket that would give (EURO)4.5bn towards a loss and damage fund that could give real certainty, real ongoing funding support. "Something similar could be done with every shipping container," he said. He added that industry contributions would be part of a "mosaic" of funding sources which would also include governments, multinational development banks and other private-sector players. He said the move would need international agreement because of the global nature of high-emitting industries. EU climate chief Frans Timmermans, however, hinted it may be applicable within the EU even if other regions did not come on board. "I think we should be creative here and we will certainly look into this in the EU," he said. This, and the wider issue of loss and damage, who should pay it, receive it and oversee it, remained to be agreed last night with just 24 hours to the summit's scheduled close. The G77 group of 134 underdeveloped countries are pushing for certainty on a dedicated fund to be established within a year. The EU will agree to a fund on condition that it focuses on the most vulnerable nations but the US and other wealthy countries want a watered-down commitment. Other key issues still not tied down were how to accelerate emissions cuts and contributions to an existing global fund for climate adaptation to help prepare countries for climate change impacts. Progress was "lacking" and there were "persistent divergent views", said COP27 president Sameh Shoukry. "Parties are shying away from taking the difficult political decisions," he said. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres, whose fiery "highway to climate hell" speech at the summit's opening two weeks ago tried to set a pace for the talks, returned to the venue last night in an attempt to inject more urgency into the final hours. "The world is burning and drowning before our eyes," he said. "I urge all parties to show that they see it - and get it." \</doc>

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was rushed off the stage at an event at COP27 in Egypt on Monday afternoon. A video which captured the prime minister\' s exit was shared on social media by journalist and director/editor of UK climate change website, Carbon Brief, Leo Hickman. Mr. Sunak was on stage with other world leaders for a climate change event when his aides interrupted him. It has not been confirmed what information Mr. Sunak received from his aides. It is being reported that two minutes before he fled the stage, an aide spoke to Mr. Sunak who subsequently left the stage and Mr. Sunak remained seated. However, a short while later, another aide approached Mr. Sunak and it was then that the prime minister ran off the stage and out one of the exits at the rear of the hall. No official statement has been issued by Downing Street to explain the prime minister\' s dramatic exit however it is believed he left early to prepare for a keynote climate change speech he would make later in the afternoon. Mr. Sunak used the speech to announce that the UK remains committed to donating \£311.6b to a climate change fund. Mr. Sunak also said the UK would be tripling the amount of money earmarked for adaptation to \£31.5bn by 2025. Mr. Sunak, who only last week said he would attend COP27 , went on to echo the words of French President Emmanuel Macron by saying Russia\' s invasion of Ukraine must not be used as an excuse to row back on climate change promises. \</doc>

Britain's King Charles has been advised not to attend the Cop27 climate summit in Egypt, Downing Street has acknowledged, arguing it is not the "right occasion" for him to make the trip. Number 10 conceded for the first time yesterday that the king had been urged not to attend the United Nations conference in Sharm El-Sheikh. King Charles is a long-term campaigner against the climate crisis but Downing Street said it was "unanimously agreed" he would not attend. British prime minister Rishi Sunak has also ruled out going. Downing Street had previously been refusing to comment on a Sunday Times report that said then prime minister Liz Truss had told the king not to go during a meeting in Buckingham Palace in September. But, yesterday, a Number 10 spokeswoman said: "As is standard practice, government advice was sought and provided under a previous PM, and it was unanimously agreed that it would not be the right occasion for the king to visit in person. I'm not aware that that advice has changed but obviously any confirmation of the king's travel would be for the palace." Earlier in the day, cabinet minister Therese Coffey had said whether the king attended the summit or not was "up to him. I'm conscious that King Charles has always taken a very deep interest in the environment and climate change," she told Sky News. She said the "big Cops" tended to be every five years, adding that "many members of the royal family" attended the UK summit last year. "But, in between, it tends to be more of a - I'm not going to say low key - but not quite the same level of heads of state and prime ministers attending," she said. Address Charles and his elder son, William, the then-Duke of Cambridge, both spoke at last year's Cop26 event in Glasgow, while Queen Elizabeth recorded an opening address urging the assembled world leaders to take action on climate change. - PA \</doc>

A few countries have resisted mentioning a global goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius in the official text of the COP27 summit in Egypt, US Special Climate Envoy John Kerry said at the conference today. "You're absolutely correct. There are very few countries, but a few, that have raised the issue of not mentioning this word or that word," Mr Kerry said when asked about opposition by some governments to mentioning the 1.5C target. "But the fact is that, in Glasgow that was adopted, the language is there. And I know ... Egypt doesn't intend to be the country that hosts a retreat from what was achieved in Glasgow," Mr Kerry said, referring to last year's COP summit in Scotland. World governments agreed in 2015 during a UN summit in France to try to limit the average global temperature increase to 1.5C, a deal dubbed the Paris Agreement that was seen as a breakthrough in international climate ambition. Greenhouse gas emissions have been rising ever since, however, and scientists say the world risks missing the target without swift and deep cuts. Breaching the 1.5C threshold risks unleashing the worst consequences of global warming. Already, the world has warmed more than 1.1C from the pre-industrial average temperature - fueling extreme weather that is already delivering steep economic losses. Many developing countries have demanded the establishment of a "loss and damage" fund that could disperse cash to countries struggling to recover from disasters. Mr Kerry said the United States would not support establishing such a fund, and instead believed existing platforms should be used. "It's a well known fact that the United States and many other countries will not establish ... some sort of legal structure that is tied to compensation or liability. That's just not happening," he said. "We will find a way, I am confident, to be able to have financial arrangements that reflect the reality of how we are all going to deal with the climate crisis." \</doc>

COP27 is not our last chance to avert the full impact of climate change, because we have missed that chance. Globally, we have done irreversible damage to our climate. Although we don't often see those effects in Ireland, thousands of people have already lost their lives, livelihoods and family members as a result of climate change. So, to speak of averting the full impact of climate change would be to ignore the lives of those already lost in the Global South, through droughts, flooding and famine. COP27 is perhaps our last chance for correct climate policy implementation before the livelihoods of those in the Global North are impacted. We need adequate climate policies. We need a just transition, and we need to listen to the scientists and academics who have done decades of research into this. Our behaviour is predictable and repetitive. We know that our resources are finite, yet we behave as though they are not. We are utterly focused on economic growth. Even when considering "sustainable" production, the intended outcome of said production is still growth. We are still focused on consumption, possibly even blinded by it. We have come so far in terms of need for mass production that saving our planet, our home, is genuinely a debate. This is because corporations have led us into believing that if we take personal responsibility in our consumption, the Earth will be OK. As if they are not draining our planet of all of our natural resources and killing people in the process. The truth is that there cannot be ethical consumption under capitalism. Sustainable growth is a myth sold to consumers by corporations who are draining our resources and destroying our planet, but we are told it is OK because we have paper straws. The date for saving our planet has passed. Our need for mass production to meet demand for overconsumption is not going to go away overnight. Introducing paper packaging will not bring the global temperature down. Resource maintenance is all fine and well, but the time frame for maintaining our resources is long gone. COP27 is an opportunity to get our act together, because what is the point of 27 conferences, or any further conferences, if there aren't any plausible outcomes? COP27 is the last chance we have to make the change necessary for survival. We do not lack the information we need to save the planet - we just choose to ignore it. For my generation, COP is perceived quite negatively. Some have labelled it as a waste of time while others have criticised the lack of proper climate policy implementations. Most can agree that the generations who have come before us were living in comfortable denial, and many believe the greenwashing lies the agri-food system sells us. Economic growth is always going to be unsustainable, and we cannot save our planet when factoring growth into the equation.

ON the same day that the UN warned that countries are not on track to keep below 1.5C of warming, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that he will not be attending the UN climate change conference, Cop27 . Not great timing. According to the UN report, under countries' current climate plans, emissions are set to increase by 10.6% by 2030. Climate change science is telling us that we need to cut emissions by about 50% before the end of this decade. We're headed in completely the wrong direction. Last year, the international community united around a global goal to 'keep 1.5 alive' - a campaign to stop earth's temperatures from rising above 1.5C. One year later, we are so far off track that even a 2C world looks unlikely. The report shows that we are hurtling towards a 2.8C world. It's hard to visualise, but the difference between a 1.5C or 2C world is huge. Any increase in temperature will destabilise the planet, wipe out species and cause extreme weather events, like droughts and floods. This is the same "catastrophe" that the UN Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres was talking about last week. In his address, he called upon both Mr Sunak and King Charles III to attend Cop27 , explaining that world leaders "must prioritise" tacking climate change. Yet, it is quite clear that Mr Sunak is doing the very opposite. A Downing Street spokesperson explained that Mr Sunak's reasoning for not attending Cop27 was "due to other pressing domestic commitments including preparations for the autumn Budget". The suggestion being that there are pressing things to deal with at home. However, this raises profound contradictions - is climate change not a pressing domestic issue? Yes - climate change is a global crisis, but it also requires domestic efforts. Domestic climate policies in the UK, like energy efficiency programmes, help us to prepare for and mitigate climate change impacts. In addition, the climate crisis is at the epicentre of the other issues that we face in the UK, like energy costs and food insecurity. It's the primary driver behind these social, economic issues. The fact that the UK hosted Cop26 in Glasgow last year - and that they still hold the Cop presidency until the beginning of negotiations in Egypt - makes Sunak's absence look even worse. At the end of Cop26, it was clear that much of the work had not been tied up. Key issues, like climate finance and adaptation, were pushed back to Cop27 , and nations, like the UK, promised that they would deal with these issues, and raise their levels of ambition, in Egypt. For instance, Cop26 saw the creation of a two-year 'Glasgow-Sharm el- Sheikh work programme on the global goal on adaption', recognising that additional work would be required at Cop27 to provide finance for adaptation. Although it is important to note that there will be representation from theUK Government at Cop27 (including Environment Secretary Therese Coffey and outgoing Cop26 President Alok Sharma), Cops are literally summits for world leaders. It is clearly an event that Mr Sunak should 'prioritise' in his calendar - to use Ant\'f3nio Guterre's words. However, critically, this is about more than world leaders meeting other world leaders and demonstrating 'leadership'. This is about demonstrating global solidarity and taking responsibility. It's an inconvenient truth, but unfortunately, while Cop21 in Paris and Cop26 in Glasgow were held up as 'temple Cops', the UK Government has framed Cop27 as an 'in-between Cop' because the negotiations will be centred around issues that are less relevant to their agendas. Although, crucially, this doesn't mean these issues are any less important. As an African Cop, Cop27 The fact of the matter is that rich nations, like the UK, are responsible for a greater volume of carbon emissions than countries in the African continent, for example. Wealthy nations (like the UK, the EU and the US) are home to just 14% global population, yet they are responsible for nearly 50% of historic emissions. By contrast, African countries emit 27 times less carbon than the global average. This is unjust, and the UK needs to help countries, worst impacted by the climate crisis, to come up with solutions to climate change and to create resilience. Floods in Pakistan and Nigeria. Drought in the Horn of Africa. Low-income countries are paying the price for a crisis they did cause. Yet the UK - a self-proclaimed 'climate leader' - is abdicating leadership, abdicating responsibility, and writing itself out of the global narrative. The Prime Minister should re-evaluate his decision, not just to £ttend' Cop27 , but crucially, to use it as an opportunity to deliver justice and show global solidarity. This is what it means to be a 'climate leader'. \</doc>

Ant\'f3nio Guterres, UN secretary general, offered world leaders the starkest of choices at the opening of the Cop27 climate negotiations in Egypt two weeks ago: "co-operate or perish. It is either a climate solidarity pact - or a collective suicide pact." This was not hyperbole. The evidence that our activity is pushing the world over a climate cliff has been compelling for a decade. Awareness that this crisis does not reside in some nebulous future, but is already upon us, has surged with the recent rapid succession of extreme weather disasters across the world. Yesterday morning an exceptionally fractious conference, which had almost collapsed as it ran 36 hours beyond its deadline, concluded with a remarkable, if long overdue, advance in solidarity. But in terms of actually averting climate collapse, we remain frightening close to disaster. The good news was undoubtedly the last-minute consensus on a "loss and damage" fund. This promises aid from developed states to developing countries, when they are devastated by climate-related disasters such as drought, floods, and fire. The deal tacitly acknowledges the historical responsibility of the industrialised world for the climate crisis, the severest impacts of which are so far felt where greenhouse gas emissions have been lowest. This fund is rooted in the concept of climate justice, for which former president Mary Robinson has been such an early and visionary advocate. Significant credit for the deal is due to Climate Minister Eamon Ryan, at the cutting edge of negotiations for the EU, building consensus for an idea long resisted by many in Brussels, and persuading developing countries to accept less than their ideal version. Irish credibility, built on decades of quiet climate mitigation work by Irish Aid with poor and vulnerable countries, was skilfully deployed in Egypt by the Irish team. Would that we were as successful at climate action advocacy at home. But as Ryan said, the real work, making this fund operational, remains ahead. The ongoing failure by developed countries to honour their 2009 commitment to contribute $100 billion annually to help the developing world transition to clean energy does not augur well. It is also very troubling that targets from last year's Glasgow Cop26, including the vital commitment to keep emissions from rising more than 1.5 degrees, were very nearly unpicked at this conference. Avoiding backsliding is hardly progress. Indeed, the shameful failure of key countries to enhance emissions reductions this year, as promised at Glasgow, leaves us on track to exceed the long-term target of 1.5 degrees in just nine years. As Mary Robinson said, nothing at this conference "changes the fact that the world remains on the brink of a climate catastrophe." \</doc>

TALKS at the COP27 climate summit are intensifying with just two days left until the official deadline for reaching consensus on a joint wording to wrap up the negotiations. A draft of the wording, known as the "cover decision", is due to be circulated to the 197 participating countries this morning but haggling over its final content is expected to continue past the formal Friday-night deadline. Negotiations on four main issues are taking place between various blocs of likeminded countries. Environment and Climate Minister Eamon Ryan was yesterday appointed the European Union's lead negotiator in the "loss and damage" strand. Loss and damage is the crunch issue at the summit as wealthy nations seek to stall or dilute a proposal that they pay for the harm to climatedamaged countries. Mr Ryan said the EU was going into the negotiations determined that a commitment to loss and damage funding be included in the final text but with the condition that it prioritised the most vulnerable countries and allowed time to work out funding sources and a fair method of distribution. "We're serious about providing the greatest support for particularly the most vulnerable countries," Mr Ryan said. "The key task is to turn that intent into a common text that people can rally behind." Other issues have also to be resolved. There is still some disagreement on how the 2015 pledge to cut emissions sufficiently to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C will be continued in the final text. Mr Ryan said the word he was getting from other strands of the talks indicated there were some positive moves on that front after earlier fears the pledge could be abandoned. Climate and human rights campaigners remained to be convinced, however, and staged further small-scale protests at the summit venue yesterday, demanding there be no backtracking. Talks on strengthening commitments to emissions cuts and on climate finance to help poor countries develop renewable energy and protect land, infrastructure and agriculture against climate impacts are also continuing. \</doc>

KEVIN O'SULLIVAN in Sharm El-Sheikh There are indications of a possible breakthrough on loss and damage, regarded as the critical issue at Cop27 , with some progress between developing countries and wealthy countries on how funds might be provided to those most impacted by the climate crisis. If scaled up negotiations continue to make headway over coming days, negotiators believe it will help other big issues to get across the line, notably on climate migration in the form of increased emission reduction commitments and on adaptation supports to increase the resilience of countries to climate shocks. Meanwhile concerns about efforts to weaken commitments to the key Paris Agreement target of 1.5 degrees have eased. Germany's climate envoy, Jennifer Morgan, said the inclusion of 1.5 degrees in the G20 communique "sent an important signal - to the ministers and negotiators here at Cop27 and to the whole world". "The G20 stand by the Glasgow climate pact and there cannot be any rollback on this here in Sharm el-Sheikh," she added. At an EU co-ordination meeting early yesterday Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan was asked to be the EU ministerial representative on the most crucial talks at this point - loss and damage - and to speak on behalf of the EU. Concerns He will be working alongside European Commission vice-president Franz Timmermans, and his team, and will be supported by an Irish delegation experienced in providing loss and damage supports. Mr Ryan said at a briefing the EU co-ordination team considered a proposal on loss and damage from the G-77 - which now includes more than 130 developing countries - and China. He said, however, the EU had concerns largely based on reports from the Santiago Network that large emitting developing countries were attempting to block technical assistance for loss and damage from going to the most vulnerable countries. These large emitters were advocating that loss and damage finance could be allocated on a geographical basis and through national governments. This, he said, would not work for the most vulnerable countries and communities, adding that they would be at real danger of them being left further behind. The Santiago Network was set up at Cop26 last year as a broad-based group dedicated to providing technical assistance for averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable. "We need a solution for a 2022 world, not a 1992 world," the Minister said, referring the year when the first COP took place. "We must have a focus on the most vulnerable, and flexible ways to reach them with finance and support. It must be demand driven and targeted - to get support to those who need it most. "This is an issue that is critically important to Ireland. Climate change is having a devastating impact on people's lives and livelihoods, on the fertility of their land and on their water sources." He said loss and damage needs were urgent and vast, and that financing had to increase. However, he warned that there was no silver bullet solution but "we could make the most of existing mechanisms to respond to loss and damage quickly". "We need a mosaic or ecosystem of solutions that suit different needs and circumstances. Above all, we need to listen and respond to the voices of those most exposed to climate destruction. We also need unprecedented financing, from a variety of sources, exploring taxes, levies and debt forgiveness, for example." "We take the positive things out of it, but there are elements that we found very difficult," he said. Mr Ryan said he believed prioritisation must be given to countries most vulnerable to the climate crisis rather than including wealthier countries such as China under a blanket arrangement. The EU was looking as well at an ecosystem of financial funding mechanisms, not just one fund, he said. "The key task is to turn that intent into a common text that people can rally behind. It will be difficult, it will be probably protracted over the next two days. But we're committed to doing whatever we can to help our union and deliver a good outcome." India is gathering support for a proposal for countries to agree to the "phase down" of all fossil fuels. This would be instead of the "narrower" decision to "phase down coal", agreed at the Cop26, it claims \</doc>

FROM a climate change campaigner to presenting a new far-Left political agenda against "racist" capitalism, meet the new Greta Thunberg. The 19-year-old Swedish activist has said that as well as tackling climate action, she has thrown her weight behind defeating the West's "oppressive" capitalist system. At her book launch in London, she said the world's "normal" - dictated by the people in power - has caused the climate breakdown. She said: "We are never going back to normal again because 'normal' was already a crisis. What we refer to as normal is an extreme system built on exploitation of people and the planet. It is a system defined by colonialism, imperialism, oppression and genocide by the so-called global north to accumulate wealth that still shapes our current world order." She said the climate crisis is rooted in "racist, oppressive extractivism that is exploiting both people and the planet to maximise short-term profits for a few". Ms Thunberg made the comments at London's Royal Festival Hall for the launch of The Climate Book on Sunday night. People pointed out the political emphasis on social media, with author Michael Shellenberger tweeting that "this is proof that Greta hates capitalism for reasons that have nothing whatsoever to do with climate change". Ms Thunberg described COP27 as a forum for "greenwashing" and said she would not attend. This year's conference takes place from this Sunday until November 18 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. She said: "Of course it's very symbolic that it's held in a tourist centre - a tourist paradise - in a country that violates most of the basic human rights, and many world leaders are too busy to go there."

Brazilian president-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is expected this week at the UN climate summit in Egypt to pledge to reverse the environmental policies of his right-wing predecessor and protect the Amazon rainforest. Mr Lula's trip to the COP27 talks in Sharm el-Sheikh will be his first international visit since beating Brazil's far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro in the 30 October run-off election. The 77-year-old, who promised on the campaign trail to work towards zero deforestation, will address the conference on Wednesday, his press team said. In a nod to Mr Lula's victory speech, in which he pledged to end Brazil's "pariah" status, his team said he had wanted to hold "more talks with world leaders in a single day than Bolsonaro had in four years." Mr Lula might, however, meet with US climate czar John Kerry and announce that Brazil is willing to host the COP30 summit in 2025, the newspaper said. Latin America's most populous country grew more isolated under Mr Bolsonaro, analysts say, in part due to his permissive policies towards deforestation and exploitation of the Amazon, the preservation of which is seen as critical to fighting global warming. If Mr Lula - who served as president from 2003 to 2010 - manages to curb deforestation and illegal mining, he would make a major contribution to the global fight against climate change, said Francisco Eliseu Aquino, a climate expert at Rio Grande do Sul University. To meet the environmental challenge, the former steelworker who begins his third term on 1 January, hopes to get help from the international community. Mr Lula's former and likely future environment minister, Marina Silva, has already been holding meetings at the UN summit, and has said that Brazil will lead "by example" on combatting climate change. She said Mr Lula plans to fight the destruction of the Amazon and pursue a reforestation target of 12 million hectares, with or without international aid. But she welcomed announcements from Norway and Germany that they would resume financial support to the Amazon Fund. Both countries withdrew aid in 2019 shortly after Mr Bolsonaro came to power. "With Lula's weight and influence, and due to worries all over the world for the Amazon, it is possible that some bilateral agreements might be reached," said Daniela Costa, a spokesperson for Greenpeace Brazil. She also said in an interview with Brazilian broadcaster Globonews that she had invited the United States to contribute to the Amazon Fund. Deforestation was at a high level at the start of Mr Lula's first term in 2003, before falling sharply under Ms Silva as minister. But she resigned in 2008, saying was not getting the money she needed to take her efforts even further. Read more: HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/eile/climate-change/ Latest climate stories Aquino said the policies of Mr Lula's next government need to be "much more daring" than during his first two terms in power. At COP27 Since Mr Bolsonaro - a staunch ally of agribusiness - took office in January 2019, average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased by 75% compared to the previous decade. The fight against global warming is not just about protecting precious areas like the Amazon, he said. "It also involves the economy, health and agriculture." "We welcome the arrival of Lula with much hope," said Dinaman Tuxa, coordinator of the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil. \</doc>

KEVIN O'SULLIVAN Environment and Science Editor The opening of the Cop27 climate summit got off to a difficult start with a stand-off between participating nations providing a stark indication of major differences between wealthy and developing countries. Two weeks of talks at Sharm el-Sheik in Egypt were delayed after delegates from 196 countries tussled late on Saturday night and into yesterday morning over what should be discussed at the conference. The disagreement centred on how the contentious loss and damage issue should be addressed - this refers to how best to help the poorest countries, especially from consequences of extreme weather events. Developing countries are most vulnerable to accelerating global warming. The final agreed agenda item directed the parties to discuss "matters relating to funding arrangements responding to loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including a focus on addressing loss and damage". There was no reference to liability or compensation. US special presidential envoy on climate John Kerry said on Saturday the issue would be on the agenda. "Obviously those countries with greater means across the board - and that includes some developing countries that have greater means - need to also step up and help in this transition." 'Loss and damage' He added: "We don't view it - and we're not going to view it - as compensation. We are going to view it as our efforts to try to help countries to adapt, to be able to become more resilient and obviously address the challenges that they face as a result of the losses and damages. " "The opening plenary was a very bad start for the critical loss and damage issue," said Ross Fitzpatrick of Christian Aid Ireland. "Loss and damage is officially on the Cop27 agenda but wealthy countries have already stripped out language referring to 'liability' or 'compensation'," he added. "This is a blatant refusal to acknowledge the 'polluter pays' principle - a core element of climate justice." "Political leaders meeting at Cop27 have a special responsibility to urgently drive the transformation needed to secure the sustainable future of our planet and its people," Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin said in advance of the leaders' summit which opens today. \</doc>

A very troubling paradox overshadows the opening of the 27th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), which begins in Egypt tomorrow. As the grave dangers of failing to take radical action to alleviate the crisis become ever clearer, the will and capacity of world leaders to do so becomes less and less credible, while global public opinion seems more polarised than ever. The 2015 Paris conference was the first time the gravity of the emergency was really recognised. This raised hopes that, despite shortcomings, the Paris Agreement marked a turning point. However, last year's Glasgow conference showed that we were failing to meet even the Paris target: holding average temperatures to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2030. But while the Glasgow Agreement was an abject failure, leaving us on course to a disastrous 2.7-degree rise, there was a face-saving mechanism that might have worked. Countries agreed to consider improving their commitments in time for the Egyptian summit. But only a few countries, and only Australia among the big emitters, have even submitted revisions a year later. Predicted warming stands at a barely improved 2.5 degrees. Every fraction counts, but this remains a scenario that would make much of the planet uninhabitable, and erase vast swathes of the biodiversity on which our survival also depends. Worse, that scenario does not figure in tipping points that such a rise may drive us over, such as massive release of sub-Arctic methane, which could accelerate temperatures beyond any conceivable human control. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin's war-mongering, and the sabre-rattling between China and the US, demonstrate that we lack leaders with the vision to promote, let alone implement, the revolutionary social transformations that the recent UN environment report sets out so clearly as the only route out of the climate crisis. All this makes it hard to hope for significant progress in Egypt. But hope we must, because despair makes progress impossible. This conference will give thousands of committed people another opportunity to find new and compelling ways to convince the world to change direction. They need all our active support. \</doc>

RISHI Sunak will call for a "global mission for clean growth" as he joins other world leaders for the opening day of the latest Cop27 international climate change talks in Egypt. Downing Street said the Prime Minister will be looking to set the seal on last year's Cop26 summit in Glasgow with more than \£3200 million in UK funding to protect forests and invest in "green" technologies. In his opening address on Monday, he will say it is essential countries stick to commitments made in Glasgow if the world is to avoid the worst impact of climate change by limiting warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. At the same time, he will argue that the transition away from fossil fuels has the potential to drive growth and deliver jobs in the new green industries of the future, while cutting off funding for Russia's war in Ukraine. Mr Sunak is expected to say: "The world came together in Glasgow with one last chance to create a plan that would limit global temperature rises to 1.5C. "The question today is: can we summon the collective will to deliver on those promises? "I believe we can. By honouring the pledges we made in Glasgow, we can turn our struggle against climate change into a global mission for new jobs and clean growth. "And we can bequeath our children a greener planet and a more prosperous future. That's a legacy we could be proud of." Downing Street said Mr Sunak will announce a further \£365.5 million for the clean energy innovation facility which provides grants to researchers and scientists in developing countries working on clean technologies - from biomass-powered refrigeration in India to lithium-ion batteries in Nigeria. The UK is also committing \£390 million for conservation in the Congo Basin rainforest and \£365 million to support indigenous and local forest communities as Mr Sunak launches a new group to track commitments made in Glasgow on deforestation. Mr Sunak had originally not intended to travel to Egypt, arguing that his priority was to sort out the estimated \£350 billion black hole in the public finances ahead of Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's autumn statement on November 17. But he was forced into what opposition parties called a "screeching U-turn" after coming under fire from within his own party, as well as from environmentalists questioning his commitment to the net zero agenda. "It makes no sense and it makes a complete joke, frankly, of Rishi Sunak, the man who couldn't even decide whether he was going to go Cop27 ," he told Sky News. "It makes a complete joke of the idea that he's somehow a leader on clean energy." The latest round of UN climate talks takes place against a backdrop of increasingly devastating extreme weather around the world as well as an energy and cost-of-living crisis driven by President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. While there is evidence Russia's actions have prompted an acceleration towards clean technology, the UN has warned that, based on countries' latest climate action plans, there is currently no credible pathway to meet the 1.5C goal intended to avoid the worst impact of global warming. Rich countries are also falling short in providing the finance needed to help developing nations adapt to a changing climate and develop cleanly, the UN has warned. \</doc>

The worsening impacts of climate change at home in Ireland and across the world the pace of decarbonisation needs to be stepped up dramatically, a leading authority on sustainability and climate issues has said in advance of attending the COP27 summit as part of a delegation from University College Cork. "It's\~\~impossible to overstate the importance of this climate summit," said Dr. Hannah Daly,\~Professor in Sustainable Energy and Energy Systems Modelling at UCC and MaREI, the SFI Research Centre for Energy, Climate and Marine. "While countries have made strong commitments to decarbonisation, that ambition is being realised only at a snail's pace relative to what is necessary. "This will be the COP of implementation: governments, businesses and civil society must come together to collaborate on the millions of individual actions essential to drive emissions down rapidly." The COP27 UCC Law student Natasha Sutton stressed the importance of young people being at the forefront of the discussion around climate destruction.\~ Cork engineering students' device to improve detection of cervical cancer wins top award Deputy Thomas Gould accuses Cork council of dereliction of legal duties by not collecting levy Cork County Council's abandoned trip to Bratislava would have cost \€ 25,000 "My expectations of COP are that hopefully the seeds can be sown for a more global community effort in achieving the SDG's and alleviating to some respect the damage done.

BEFORE the war in Ukraine, Nataliya Lushnikova was an actress outside of her day job. "You know Martin McDonagh? I was in The Beauty Queen of Leenane, the first performance in Ukrainian. I was Maureen," she said. "You know Denis McClair? I studied about him. We have many examples of his work." Ms Lushnikova also studied architecture and is referring to the little-known Westmeath man, regarded as Ireland's first landscape gardener, who went on to design 50 public parks in Ukraine from the late 1700s. She is caught halfway between joy and sorrow at the memories, and takes a moment. Then, like any good actress, she is fully re-immersed in her new role and playing it with passion. She has come to the COP27 climate summit as part of the team manning Ukraine's national pavilion, which many find a surprise presence given the pressing issues at home. The pavilion's task is twofold - to illustrate the enormous damage done to Ukraine and to show how the country plans to build back better, greener and carbonfree after the conflict. Exhibits, audio-visual displays and virtual-reality headsets allow visitors to see the destruction close up. But they also reveal a side of war often overlooked. While concern for human life is an obvious priority, major environmental damage can make the post-conflict recovery much harder. A destroyed apartment block can be rebuilt with relative ease compared to the restoration of agricultural soils baked to stone by the heat of immense blasts and left useless for cultivation. The same soils are heavily polluted with the residue of explosions, as is the water. Bombed dams have caused enormous flooding, exacerbating the problem. Fires from shelling have destroyed millions of acres of forest, fields and grasslands, including areas protected under biodiversity conventions. The loss of wildlife is immeasurable. In the context of a climate summit, the destruction has other significance. A report presented by the Ukrainian delegation has calculated the greenhouse gas emissions generated by the war between February and September this year. It counted the movement of millions of refugees over long distances, fuel consumption by tanks and jets, fires, the destruction and reconstruction of buildings and leaks from the damaged Nord Stream pipeline. The total over seven months comes to just under 100 million tonnes of carbon - 60pc more than all of Ireland's emissions in a year. Campaigners have long called for military emissions to be included in the global total, arguing that they could make up as much as 5pc of all emissions so it is false accounting to omit them. President Volodymyr Zelenksy also called for conflict emissions to be counted to show how any war is a war on climate. A fast-heating world "cannot afford a single gunshot", he told world leaders in his video address to the summit. If there was doubt about his determination to hold on to Crimea, occupied by Russia since 2014, his position on the region's emissions clears it up. He has been pushing to be allowed, under the UN's complex accounting rules, to add the region's emissions to Ukraine's total even though data will not be precise. \</doc>

KEVIN O'SULLIVAN in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt A historic global agreement at the Cop27 climate summit is expected to generate trillions of euros for climate-vulnerable countries with wealthy states, including the world's biggest carbon emitters, making payments for loss and damage caused. Consensus was reached in the early hours of yesterday after a difficult weekend of negotiations involving almost 200 countries gathered at the United Nations climate summit in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. While the deal was broadly welcomed, the summit was condemned for backing down on greater cuts to greenhouse gas emissions and an end to fossil fuel use. The United States and other wealthy countries had long blocked the loss and damage plan, for fear they could face unlimited liability for the emissions that are driving global warming. The European Union was first to offer potential to break an impasse by backing the issue, which was considered critical to the success of Cop27 . Inevitable consequences This outcome had been reinforced by strong calls to reform international financial institutions to unlock more funds for climate action, especially in helping countries become more resilient in adapting to the consequences of global warming and in switching to clean energy. The breakthrough on loss and damage contrasts, however, with the failure to step up emissions pledges. The EU and other countries said the commitments on limiting temperatures to 1.5 degrees represented no progress on agreements reached at Cop26 in Glasgow last year. Egyptian foreign minister and president of Cop27 Sameh Shoukry said: "We rose to the occasion. We worked around the clock, day and night, but united in working for one gain, one higher purpose, one common goal. In the end, we delivered. We listened to the calls of anguish and despair." Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan, who helped lead EU negotiations on loss and damage, welcomed the decision to establish the new funding arrangements . 'Innovative sources' "Progress on broadening the contributor base to now include the potential for innovative sources of funding could open the way for a landmark break from traditional thinking," he added. Such sources could include sectors like aviation, shipping and the fossil fuel industry, said Mr Ryan. "There is now scope for exploring the potential for financing and debt relief for especially vulnerable countries from multilateral and development banks." He agreed the mitigation elements on emissions ambitions were weak though a commitment to keep the key Paris Agreement target of containing global temperature to 1.5 degrees was "a crucial underpinning". "Without mitigation, the more adaptation we would have to do and the more loss and damage would cost," warned Mr Ryan. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen described the deal as "a small step towards climate justice", but said much more was needed for the planet: "We have treated some of the symptoms but not cured the patient from its fever." \</doc>

KEVIN O'SULLIVAN Environment and Science Editor The provision of offshore wind energy will be accelerated under changes to planning legislation which will make it harder to block projects, Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin has said. Speaking at the Cop27 global climate conference in Egypt, Mr Martin pledged to deliver on Ireland's carbon-reduction commitments by scaling up the development of offshore wind projects. Yesterday UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres said time was running out to address the climate crisis and, in a highly- critical address to world leaders, called on governments to tax the windfall profits of fossil fuel companies. "Let's redirect the money to people struggling with rising food and energy prices, and to countries suffering loss and damage caused by the climate crisis." In advance of a series of meetings with global leaders gathered in Sharm el-Sheik, Mr Martin said delivery of climate pledges must be accelerated by developed countries, including Ireland. He will outline Ireland's national position at Cop27 this afternoon. He said Ireland would be pushing at the UN climate talks for delivery on measures to accelerate emission reductions and scaling up of climate finance for vulnerable countries - especially those already suffering from a warming world and extreme weather events. "We need to focus more on delivery measures . . . We all have work to do. Ireland has work to do. We achieved a lot with onshore wind. We need to ensure we can accelerate offshore." Attorney general Paul Gallagher is currently conducting a review of planning legislation with the intention of consolidating and streamlining the legal framework for planning decisions. It is expected to be finalised later this month, and published before the changeover in government in December. It is understood that it will seek to speed up the planning process for major projects of national importance such as offshore wind farms, judged by the Government to be central to efforts to decarbonise Ireland's energy sector and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is likely to confine the right to object to projects to people living in their immediate vicinity. It will also narrow the scope for people to take judicial reviews challenging decisions to award planning permission, which can currently delay projects by years. \</doc>

B Y now most of us acknowledge that the planet is burning and as a species we are on borrowed time. So the outcome of the global climate conference in Egypt, which began on a very gloomy note, does offer some hope - albeit via limited progress which also leaves much crucial detail unresolved. As dawn broke over the sumptuous Egyptian resort of Sharm El Sheikh yesterday, 197 participating countries at the COP27 conference adopted a hard-fought final agreement to set up a fund to help poor countries being battered by climate disasters. But the emerging deal left many of the tougher decisions on definitions and funding until the next leaders' gathering on climate change next year. The omissions which stuck out were the failure to nail down who will fund supports and reparations and what the criteria will be to decide which beleaguered countries qualify for help. There was no agreement on extending alreadyagreed carbon-emission reductions and this appeared to be a negative outcome. But realistically what is more urgently needed right now is progress on delivering the carbon cuts already enthusiastically agreed but not so readily implemented. Many delegates rightly said the real heart of this meeting was about advancing supports for those countries most likely to suffer from climate change and which have contributed least to the crisis. In sum, there was limited progress on advancing so-called "climate justice" to help fund vulnerable countries to cope with storms, floods and other disasters fuelled by rich nations' historical and ongoing carbon emissions. On this, there was progress in principle - but not much detail. It must be acknowledged that the Irish delegation, led by Environment Minister Eamon Ryan, did play an important part here in brokering a final big-picture deal which must be built upon. This reminds us that smaller countries have a potential role and a moral obligation to play their part, as does every Irish citizen in doing their bit to cut carbon emissions. However, this two-week summit was a test of global resolve to fight climate change - even as a war in Europe, energy market turmoil and rampant consumer inflation combine to distract international attention. The brutal reality - which must never allow us to succumb to inaction, much less defeatism - is that a handful of countries and corporations hold the key to success in saving the planet. If these could finally cut emissions, considerable progress would happen. Ultimately, there must be increased political and moral pressure on this small group of big carbon polluters to act. A major part of that is by showing example here in Ireland, and by extension continuing lobbying in those international bodies such as the EU, the UN, and others in which this country actively participates. The final deal did not contain a reference requested by India and some other delegations to reduce the use of "all fossil fuels". This was a loss which must be rectified next time out. A handful of countries and corporations hold the key to saving the planet \</doc>

KEVIN O'SULLIVAN Environment and Science Editor The worsening impacts of the climate crisis will outstrip the ability to provide protection for the vulnerable unless there is a rapid increase in financial assistance to them. This rapid scaling up of funding must provide for adaptations to build resilience for inevitable outcomes from a warming world, according to UN Environment Programme (UNEP) report. Global efforts in adaptation planning, financing and implementation are not keeping pace with the growing risks, and this will lead to "knockout blows" to future generations in climate-vulnerable countries, it warns in its latest "adaptation gap" report. Climate adaptation includes preparing defences against rising floods, shelters against intensifying cyclones and emergency plans to protect people during worsening heatwaves and droughts. The report identified a rising need for funding in developing countries that is set to escalating to $450 billion by 2030. It found 80 per cent of countries had started adaptation plans, but only a third had quantified targets with deadlines. It has led to calls for the Cop27 meeting, opening in Egypt this weekend, to agree a clear and time-bound roadmap on closing the finance gap under the "loss and damage" agenda item. Securing more supports for climate-vulnerable countries under the adaptation heading is one Ireland's key priorities at Cop27 , which will be attended by the Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin on Monday and Tuesday. More than 120 global leaders will attend a two-day summit in Sharm El Sheik. A dramatic increase in funding for climate adaptation is needed to save millions of lives from "climate carnage", UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres said in response to the report. "Adaptation needs in the developing world are set to skyrocket to as much as $340 billion a year by 2030. Yet adaptation support today stands at less than one-tenth of that amount. "The most vulnerable people and communities are paying the price. This is unacceptable," he added. "Adaptation must be treated with a seriousness that reflects the equal worth of all members of the human family. It's time for a global climate adaptation overhaul that puts aside excuses and picks up the toolbox to fix the problems," he said. Finance gap Cop27 must set out a way to close the finance gap while addressing the loss and damage issue, Mr Guterres said. "This will be a central litmus test for success at Cop27 ." Inger Andersen, UNEP executive director, highlighted current impacts including a multiyear drought in the Horn of Africa which has put millions on the brink of starvation. "The floods in Pakistan caused over $30 billion in damages and economic losses. Severe summer heat across the northern hemisphere brought destructive and deadly wildfires," she pointed out. These events are inextricably linked to climate change and evident at only 1.1 degrees above pre-industrial temperatures. Policies currently in place put us on the path for a 2.8 degree rise by end of the century, she said. "Climate change is landing blow after blow upon humanity, as we saw throughout 2022: most viscerally in the floods that put much of Pakistan under water," Ms Andersen said. The world has to urgently reduce carbon emissions to limit climate impacts, while also urgently increasing efforts "to adapt to the impacts that are already here and those to come". She added: "We must quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and strive for net-zero. But people, ecosystems and economies are already suffering. And it will be decades before temperatures start to fall again - if we manage to cut emissions. "So, we must also urgently increase efforts to adapt to climate change." With over 80 per cent of countries having at least one national adaptation planning instrument in place, these are increasingly prioritising disadvantaged groups such as women and indigenous peoples, she confirmed. "However, to turn adaptation plans into action, we need funding. And this funding isn't coming through," Ms Andersen underlined. Developing countries In 2020, international adaptation finance flows to developing countries hit $29 billion. This leaves a yawning gap to be filled - around 5 to 10 times the size of adaptation finance that arrived in 2020, the report confirms. Nations need to live up to the Glasgow Climate Pact with strong action at Cop27 , she said. "We need a rapid acceleration in scientific research, innovative planning, adequate finance and implementation, and deeper international co-operation." \</doc>

TAOISEACH Miche\'e1l Martin has urged world leaders to show determination in cutting greenhouse gas emissions, warning that they will leave people hopeless if they do not act. Delivering his national statement to COP27 , the global climate summit, Mr Martin said future generations would not forgive today's leaders if they did not do more. "As leaders, we must lead," he told the gathering in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. "Our citizens will become increasingly cynical, weary and hopeless if words are not urgently matched by deeds, if commitments do not generate new realities." Mr Martin spoke of the clear evidence of climate change in record temperatures, floods, fires and droughts around the world. "What were once exceptional events are now occurring with increased frequency and ferocity" he said. "This generation of leaders cannot say we didn't know. The science is clear: every tonne of carbon warms the world, every delay makes our task that bit bigger. Let us not waste a second more." He voiced support for vulnerable countries suffering the worst effects of climate change they did least to cause. "People in the poorest parts of our planet are being driven from regions that can no longer support and sustain them," he added. "Climate change is fuelling conflict, global instability, competition for resources and abject human misery. "The burden of climate change globally is falling most heavily on those least responsible." Mr Martin spoke of how Ireland would double its climate finance fund for poor countries to (EURO)225m a year by 2025. He said (EURO)10m of that would go to a new Global Shield initiative spearheaded by Germany to deal with "loss and damage" - a contentious issue at COP27 as wealthy carbon-polluting nations try to dodge responsibility for compensating climate-damaged countries. The Taoiseach's emphasis on the urgency of action on climate change and backing for vulnerable nations was welcomed by scientists and campaigners. But they noted that while he referenced Ireland's legally binding emission reduction target of 51pc by 2030, the commitment to being carbon-neutral by 2050 and the sectoral emissions ceilings set for each sector of the economy, he omitted the detail that our emissions grew this year. "While it's the right thing to do for Ireland to help protect vulnerable countries from the damages of climate change with financial commitments, prevention is better than cure," Professor Hannah Daly of UCC said. They also took issue with Mr Martin's categorisation of the Global Shield initiative as a response to loss and damage. Karol Balfe, the chief executive of ActionAid, said: "The Global Shield, essentially relating to insurance and involving subsidies from northern governments to northern-owned insurance firms, shouldn't be mistaken for a loss and damage financing facility designed to channel funds to communities on the front lines. "It is shocking that after decades of climate negotiations, there is still no financial support provided to countries harmed by climate change. Ross Fitzpatrick, of Christian Aid, also said the Global Shield was a largely insurance-based mechanism when what was needed was straightforward, easily accessed funding. He also said the (EURO)10m should not come from existing funds. "Loss and damage finance needs to be new and additional so that poor countries are not left to pick up the tab," Mr Fitzpatrick said. Trocaire also expressed disappointment. The Taoiseach finished his time in Sharm El Sheikh by meeting youth activists and academics from Ireland. Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney will be next to attend the summit. Before leaving, Mr Martin expressed hope that the fortnight-long talks would produce a worthwhile agreement. "One would have confidence that a text will emerge that will represent progress on a number of fronts, particularly putting flesh on the bones of some of the commitments that were made last year," he said. "We do believe we can see incremental progress." \</doc>

KEVIN O'SULLIVAN in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt Ireland has joined a global alliance, which includes some of the world's biggest offshore wind energy producing countries, to rapidly ramp up production with increasing collaboration on know-how and sharing of technology. Its new members were unveiled at a meeting attended by ministers for climate and energy from the EU and Australia at Cop27 yesterday. A total of new 11 countries including Belgium, Colombia, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, the UK, the US, Australia and Portugal have joined the Global Offshore Wind Alliance (Gowa). Initiated by the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena), Denmark and the Global Wind Energy Council, it emerged from Cop26 last year with a view to bringing together governments, the private sector, international organisations and other stakeholders to accelerate deployment of offshore wind power. It has also been endorsed by the World Bank and some of the world's largest wind generation companies. Ireland's Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan said collaboration on developing offshore wind energy was set to be "the peace project of our time". 'Windiest places' He confirmed Ireland would have its first offshore wind auction next month with a view to delivering 5 gigawatts (GW) by 2030. This would be mainly for the Irish Sea "but the prize for us is in the west of Ireland, one of the windiest places on the planet", he added. The biggest challenge, he predicted, would be scaling up supply chains, providing the ships required and putting in place the cabling and interconnectors needed to facilitate sharing of energy. "We are doing it for energy security and for climate reasons," he added. Critical to success, Mr Ryan said, was ensuring community support for offshore projects while protecting nature. Ireland was like Japan in having to contend with waters that get deep quickly, he noted - and hoped the two countries could work together on resolving challenges in that regard. Cheapest source Danish minister for climate and energy Dan Joergensen said offshore was often the cheapest source of electricity "and many times cheaper than coal and nuclear, which is pretty fantastic". It could generate vast quantities of energy at global scale but this would only happen through partnerships, setting standards and showing tangible ways to deliver on the green transition. Global Wind Energy Council chief executive Ben Blackwell said when the alliance initially set a target of 380GW by 2030, there was a view it was "a bit too spicy and ambitious" but a year on, and governments had already pledged 370GW. "This is realisable if we get planning and regulation right," he added. Dutch Minister for Climate and Energy Policy Rob Jetten said the North Sea - "the electricity factory of the EU delivering energy to millions and millions of people" - would be generating 260GW by 2050 under the auspices of the North Sea Energy Cooperation, which includes Ireland. This North Sea working with Gowa would enable system-wide integration of offshore and onshore wind, hydrogen production and solar energy, he believed. Belgian energy minister Tinne Van der Straeten told the meeting it was accelerating the energy transition with quadrupling the offshore wind capacity by 2040, building "a hybrid energy island", as well as new interconnections with North Sea countries. The efficiency of wind, she suggested, was illustrated by the fact that just three turns of a modern wind turbine generates enough power to recharge an EV. \</doc>

VLADIMIR Putin's war on Ukraine and rising energy prices are a reason to "act faster", not go slow on climate change, Rishi Sunak has told leaders at the Cop27 summit. Speaking at the latest round of UN climate talks in Sharm El- Sheikh, Egypt, the Prime Minister said it was morally right to deliver on promises on tackling climate change - but also economically right, reducing energy dependency and providing new jobs and growth. Mr Sunak's comments came after UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres warned at the start of Cop27 that the world is "on the highway to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator". Mr Guterres said: "We are in the fight of our lives - and we are losing, with greenhouse gases still increasing and temperatures still rising." And while the world's attention is gripped by the war in Ukraine - prompting an energy, food and cost-of-living crisis - and other conflicts, Mr Guterres said: "Climate change is on a different timeline and a different scale. "It is the defining issue of our age. It is the central challenge of our century. It is unacceptable, outrageous and self-defeating to put it on the back burner." He warned: "Today's crises cannot be an excuse for backsliding or greenwashing." The latest round of talks comes amid high geopolitical tensions sparked by Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, worsening extreme weather and calls for rich nations to provide finance for the loss and damage hitting poor countries as a result of the climate crisis. Leaders including Egyptian president Abdel Fattah El-Sisi called for an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine as they spoke to the opening ceremony of the summit. Attending a side event at Cop27 , Boris Johnson warned the fight against climate change had become a "collateral victim" of the invasion of Ukraine, with countries questioning the goal of cutting emissions at a time of soaring energy prices. And he warned against the risk that "some people will go weak and wobbly" on commitments to cut emissions to zero overall - known at net zero - to tackle the crisis. Mr Sunak said the UK was keeping its promises on climate action, which include cutting emissions by 68% by 2030 and \£311.6 billion for poorer countries to tackle the crisis, including tripling funding for adaptation to \£31.5 billion as part of the total. In his speech to the leaders' summit, the PM said: "Climate security goes hand in hand with energy security. "Putin's abhorrent war in Ukraine and rising energy prices across the world are not a reason to go slow on climate change. "They are a reason to act faster, because diversifying our energy supplies by investing in renewables is precisely the way to insure ourselves against the risks of energy dependency. "It's also a fantastic source of new jobs and growth." Mr Sunak's attendance at the gathering in the Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh alongside leaders such as US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, marks his first outing on the international stage since becoming Prime Minister last month. In a packed day at the conference, the Prime Minister also held a series of bilateral meetings, including with Italy's new far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen amid ongoing tensions over post-Brexit trading arrangements. But on the climate issue, he faces criticism over the Government's decision to issue more licences for oil and gas exploration in the North Sea and its continued opposition to new onshore wind. The UK is also currently not on track to meet its carbon cutting goals into the 2030s, and is under pressure over its delivery of climate finance commitments. Friends of the Earth's inter- national climate campaigner Rachel Kennerley said the UK Government was failing to deliver adequate finance to support vulnerable nations and was still helping fund a damaging gas project in Mozambique, as well as allowing new North Sea oil and gas schemes. Instead, ministers should lift barriers to onshore wind and roll out insulation, paid for with a bigger windfall tax on fossil fuel firms, she urged. And Mariana Paoli from Christian Aid said: "What is needed to truly help those facing the worst impacts of the climate crisis is a fund to compensate them for the permanent loss and damage they are experiencing," warning the UK has been quiet on the issue. Funding for loss and damage from climate change, such as destruction of crops, buildings and infrastructure in poorer countries, is now an item on the official agenda for the talks. It is a key demand for some of the world's most vulnerable countries, who are on the frontline of climate impact and yet have done least to cause the crisis, though developed countries have historically been reluctant to discuss it. In his speech to world leaders, Mr Guterres warned that "loss and damage can no longer be swept under the rug. It is a moral imperative", calling for concrete results on the issue at Cop27 . Mr Guterres also called for a pact between developed and developing countries, in which all nations make an extra effort to reduce emissions, and richer countries provide financial assistance to help emerging economies tackle climate change, and to end dependence on fossil fuels. He said the United States and China had a particular responsibility to join efforts to make the pact a reality, warning humanity had a choice to "co-operate or perish".

IRST the good news. The battle to reduce and eventually eliminate the worst effects of climate change is over. F The bad news is, we lost. Or rather, we surrendered, waved the white flag and as good as admitted we no longer have any hope of winning, or more correctly, any will to win. That is the only conclusion that can be drawn from last weekend's COP27 meeting in Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt. Like Philip Morris or the Marlboro Man finally admitting the harm they had done to generations of smokers, the major polluting nations have come out with their hands in their pockets and one question for their victims: "OK, how much is this going to cost us?" For the first victims, the low-lying islands of the Caribbean, for example, or Bangladesh and Pakistan, subject to devastating flooding, or African countries facing famine directly attributable to climate change, this compensation scheme is welcome. But they will have to work hard to get the trillions of dollars they deserve. And there is no guarantee the worst polluters will make commensurate reparation. The plan is not based on current figures, which show China is by far the greatest producer of carbon emissions (11,472 tonnes), with more than twice that of the US (5,007 tonnes), followed by India (2,710), Russia (1,756) and Japan (1,067). Other notable culprits are Iran (749), Germany (675), Saudi Arabia (672), Indonesia (619), South Korea (616), Canada (546), Brazil (489), Turkey (446), South Africa (436), Mexico (407), Australia (391), UK (347), Italy and Poland (329 each), Vietnam (326), France (306), Taiwan (283), Thailand (278), Kazakhstan (277) and Malaysia (256). Ireland would come a long way down that list with just 37 tonnes. But that doesn't put us on the high moral ground. Last Tuesday's update on the Government's Climate Action Plan shows that we are lagging behind on our stated ambitions - 23pc behind in fact - mostly because of lack of progress in the areas of beef and dairy production and the slow uptake of electric vehicles. The compensation scheme agreed at COP27 has its faults, but it is welcome, and it was welcomed effusively by the representatives of those countries who have been fighting for it since Rio back in 1992. However, that welcome gave the impression that this was a successful conference with a good outcome in the battle against climate change effects. Not so. Not if you measure success in terms of maintaining the target limit of 1.5 degrees of global warming. Going into the Egyptian COP meeting (COP-out might be a better name), delegates from the 200 nations represented had before them the Global Carbon Project science team's projections of 40.6 billion tonnes total of carbon emissions for this year - a 1pc increase on last year, all from fossil fuels. So, it was obvious progress needed to be made urgently. After all, we have been listening to the 10-year warning about reaching a tipping point for nearly 20 years now. The EU pushed hard, and India - with the backing of the EU - suggested phasing down the production of fossil fuels. But the fossil fuel producing nations were dogged in their opposition and succeeded in ensuring no progress was made beyond what had already been agreed at the last COP in Glasgow. Yes, there were some pious statements about alternative and renewable energy. But there was also row-back from some of what had been agreed before. Now natural gas will be considered "green energy" with alleged "low emissions". With 636 fossil fuel lobbyists registered at the conference, you would not expect anything else. At the end of the day, it is now clear that those who have the power - the main fossil fuel producers and users - have no sense of urgency and no will to do anything that might discommode them in the short term to save the long-term life of the planet. In the meantime, we see a noticeable increase worldwide in the negative effects of climate change, from flooding and heatwaves to hurricanes and bushfires, each of which takes lives in ever greater numbers. It has been that way for decades, but now it is worse. The war in Ukraine has distorted the energy market, which allows us to concentrate on fixing that in whatever way we can without thinking, for now, about climate change. It also adversely affects the supply of grain, which leaves those facing famine in Africa with little hope of relief. There is not much chance that Russia will make any contribution to a solution as long as Vladimir Putin remains in charge. And in China (population 1.45 billion), President Xi Jinping seems too focused on achieving economic parity with the US (population 331 million) - something it is well on the way to achieving anyway - to be of any help. And we still have to contend with climate-deniers everywhere, but especially in the US. Paradoxically, all of this is not a reason for Ireland as a small country, or the people of Ireland as individuals, to give up. If we continue (or begin) to recycle and re-use or save on our energy use, and especially on our use of fossil fuels, that will not prevent the inevitable consequences of climate change. But we can at least know we are making some effort to delay the fate of future generations. Tackling climate change requires a planet-wide movement. The last time we had one of those was between 1939 and 1945 when our freedoms were at stake. But then it was one half of the world against the other. Sadly today when our very existence is at stake, the world is just as divided. All of this is not a reason for the people of Ireland to give up \</doc>

T HE LAST delegates who attended the COP27 global climate summit will be arriving home today and reflecting on a hectic two weeks in Egypt. A look at the main points here will help unpack what it achieved and didn't, and what it means for Ireland. Q. What happened at COP27 ? A. 197 countries reached agreement on what they're calling the "Sharm El Sheikh Implementation Plan". The summit was hosted by Egypt in the city of Sharm El Sheikh. Q. What's in the plan? A. Sixty-two statements setting out where the countries stand on various aspects of climate action, and on the many agreements and pledges made during the previous 26 COPs, or Conferences of the Parties. Q. What are the strong statements? A. The plan contains an agreement to set up a new "loss and damage" fund to help the poorest, most vulnerable countries deal with the costs of unpreventable climate change impacts such as floods, droughts and land loss to sea level rise and desertification. It restates the importance of limiting average global temperature rise to 1.5C as agreed at COP21 (it's currently 1.1-1.2C) to prevent escalating climate change and its impacts. It resolves to "pursue further efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C". Q. And the weak ones? A. The plan urges speeding up the "phase-down" of coal (the most carbon-polluting fossil fuel) as agreed at COP26, but doesn't extend that to oil and gas and doesn't use the stronger term "phase out". It stresses the need for a rapid switch to renewable energy but also allows for a future of "low-emission" energy, ie fossil gas. It says accelerated action is needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions but adds that emissions cuts targets can take account of "differentiated responsibilities" and "different national circumstances". That leaves lots of room for countries to wriggle out of setting tougher emission limits. It encourages countries to honour an existing but unfulfilled financial commitment to provide $100bn ((EURO)97bn) a year to help the most vulnerable countries prepare or adapt to climate change. But that commitment is 10 years old and costs have escalated enormously since. Q. What happens next? A. A "transitional committee"is to be set up to work out the details of how the loss and damage fund will be formed and operate. It will have 24 members - 10 from developed countries and 14 from developing countries - to be nominated by December 15 and to begin meetings before the end of next March. On all other issues, it's really business as usual until COP28 which is to be held in December 2023 in Dubai. Q. Will the plan have any impact on life in Ireland? A. The EU takes COPs and climate action quite seriously and was one of the few regions to increase its emission cuts target for COP27 . As a bloc, the plan is to reduce emissions by more than half (57pc) by 2030. Ireland has a plan and law that aims for a 51pc cut by 2030. The new EU target might not require us to increase our target but it will exert more pressure on us to meet our national one. That means more pressure to act on all the measures the Government has already agreed. All those measures have costs in terms of money and inconvenience that will take time to show dividends in cleaner, more secure, more climate-safe ways of living. At COP27 , Ireland signed up or reaffirmed its pledges to various multi-national initiatives such as the Global Offshore Wind Alliance, the Net Zero Government Initiative, the Global Methane Pledge and the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, but the aims of these largely match what's in our own national climate action plan and they are voluntary in any case. On existing climate finance commitments to developing countries, we've already agreed to double our contribution to at least (EURO)225m a year by 2025 which must be found from public funds. On the new loss and damage fund, a decision will have to be taken on how much Ireland will pay each year, but it will likely be millions of euro and, again, that is money which must come from public funds. On the 1.5C limit, if it can be achieved, it will be extremely important to help Ireland avoid increased weather extremes and the kind of drought-deluge swings we have been seeing, as well as to minimise sea level rise, which will be hugely challenging for our coastal communities. Ireland has experienced very mild climate change impacts so far but many other countries and regions that we trade with, holiday in, emigrate to and need to keep stable to avoid international crises, are already suffering severe impacts that are forecast to intensify. In failing to tackle with increased urgency the underlying causes of climate change, the plan does little to safeguard the wider world. That leaves every country vulnerable. It will be extremely important to help Ireland avoid drought-deluge swings \</doc>

T HE annual COP climate summit is verging on irrelevancy and risks becoming a parody of itself, Overseas Development Aid Minister Colm Brophy has said. In a stinging attack on the COP27 summit which he is attending in Egypt, Mr Brophy said there were more good intentions signalled in the fortnight of COP than in the first two weeks of January but the will to honour them was lacking. He also questioned the commitment of the largest nations such as the United States on the day President Joe Biden flew in to address the summit. "There are very few countries delivering on the level to which they need to. There is a comment President Biden made that this is a world effort. "There's no point in keeping on saying that unless you actually come out of here and live it in a meaningful way." Mr Brophy said his views were overwhelmingly influenced by his trip to the Horn of Africa in August, when he visited starving communities hit by a record drought. He said what he witnessed was "horrendous". "There is something about standing, watching a mother, knowing that her child could be dead within 36 or 48 hours or talking to a community who are literally on the verge of being wiped out," he said. "What's happening in the Horn of Africa is an entirely climate-related, man-made catastrophe and there are aspects therefore, when you come to COP, that I just find really unacceptable. "I think it's on the verge of turning itself, if it's not careful, into an irrelevance. "Countries like Ireland are coming in and playing a huge part, the developing countries are coming in and making a huge case, but at the very top level, there still seems to be a lack of willingness to implement. "The definition of madness is repeating the same thing again and again and again but we're on COP27 ." "Within two decades you could be looking at large swathes of Africa in particular but other parts of the world also being a no-go zone for people to be able to live." He said the world's attention was on Ukraine, not Africa. "Obviously Ukraine is a huge issue and there is a need to meet commitments there. "But this is what really scares me, if we wait until the moment where you have the Bob Geldof moment where the world's cameras show up, that's complete and utter failure." He said trillions of euro and a collective effort by the world's richest nations were needed to secure a future for climate ravaged nations. Ireland has pledged to increase its annual climate finance for developing countries to (EURO)225m by 2025 but aid agencies say a fairer share would be (EURO)500m. They also criticised Ireland's failure to lead on establishing a separate "loss and damage" fund to compensate vulnerable countries for the climate damage caused by high carbon polluting nations. Ireland is contributing (EURO)10m to a new Global Shield fund under a loss and damage heading but critics say that underwrites insurance companies and is not what poor countries want. Mr Brophy defended Ireland's financial contributions, saying they were generous compared to countries of similar size. Government ministers have also been criticised for going to COP27 with no reduction in national greenhouse gas emissions to report. "It's not right that emissions have gone up," he accepted. "The Government has put in place a series of programmes and legislation and the infrastructure now to seriously tackle our mission and the will of this government is 100pc to achieve that. "I believe we're going to live the life of what we talk about here. That involves very tough political decisions back home for a whole host of people across all their lives. "If everyone could even half see the reality of what climate change means to people in places like Africa, compared to what it means to us in the West, there is no comparison. "That's why we need to play the bigger role." Later, President Biden made a number of funding announcements and said the US was on track to at least halve its emissions by 2030. \</doc>

They call it the plane pause, the eight to 10 seconds when the roars of the low-flying aircraft passing directly overhead become so loud, the speaker must stop and wait for it to pass. Depending on time of day, planes press pause on Cop27 activities as often as every 10 minutes. A more apt symbol of the battle for progress at the global climate summit you could not HYPERLINK www.find.No matter how much talk goes on in the sprawling desert compound about the urgency of transformational change in how the world works, business as usual keeps getting in the way. Many of the 30,000 attendees testify to this. Fossil fuel executives are thick on the ground here - more than 600 of them. They are still pushing the notion that gas is a 'transition' fuel. Cleaner than coal and oil, they argue it will help the world keep the lights on until the switch to renewable energy can be achieved. Lots of political heads nod eagerly in agreement, complicit in overlooking the obvious, though less profitable, reality that most of Africa and many other under-developed regions could be speedily powered by solar if the nodding heads would just say it must be so. Countries could show the well-diggers the door and mount their own renewables transformation, but they need money and there are possibly even more financiers here than fossil men. They talk of 'just financing', of green loans, of leveraging private capital and unlocking innovative investment. But the estimate is anything from $4trn to $7trn ((EURO)4.5trn to (EURO)6.75trn) will be needed every year to turn the world's energy, transport and food systems into clean, carbon-free, sustainable versions of themselves. That kind of money does not enter the scene without strict conditions on recipients and a tasty profit incentive for the provider. So we've had a lot of talk about decarbonisation - making fossil fuels, transport, agriculture and industry cleaner and greener but not actually clean and green. Meanwhile, on the issues that benchmark the progress of a Cop gathering, the report card so far goes as follows. Have we reduced greenhouse gas emissions? No. Have we agreed to stop using fossil fuels? No. Have we found a way to fairly finance the transformation required? No. Yesterday, Mary Robinson criticised the world's richest countries for failing to live up to their climate commitments. Our former president said leaders of wealthy nations needed to "step up" and deliver on their promises. "I didn't hear much leadership from the G20 countries," she said of the statements delivered by heads of state earlier in the week. "In fact, half the leaders were not here." The leaders of China, India, Russia, Brazil and the US were not present for the world leaders segment that opened the summit. US President Joe Biden stayed behind to deal with mid-term elections at home and came for a short spell on Friday instead. Mrs Robinson acknowledged his late arrival but said: "Even the United States has not stepped up enough on climate finance and certainly hasn't stepped up enough on reducing emissions." The G20 group of the world's 20 biggest economies are meeting in Bali, Indonesia, next week. Mrs Robinson said a message must be delivered to them that they needed to do more. "You must step up and commit your and make sure that we must stay below 1.5C degrees," she said. Mrs Robinson said she was worried the pledge of the 2015 Paris Agreement to take action to stop the rise in global temperatures from exceeding 1.5C was being abandoned. "We have, not a target, but a limit, a scientific limit of a liveable world and therefore we have to adhere to that." Week one of Cop27 began with talk and ended with talk. At the start it was the impressive fury of United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres with his "highway to climate hell" remonstrations. At the end it was the unconvincing flatness of Biden, so tied up trying to steer his administration along a pathway potholed by Republican obduracy that he appears to have run out of gas even as his country drills for new supplies. Biden's visit was a flying one. He arrived, stumbled over his speech and left, a military helicopter signalling his departure. A little while later, yet another low-flying plane drowned out the talking and we counted to 10 again. \</doc>

ANYONE who thought youth climate activism was a passing fad would reconsider after a spell at COP27 . Two Irish activists among them took time out of Youth Day activities yesterday to speak. Oile\'e1n Carter Stritch (22), from Clondalkin, Dublin, is Ireland's first official climate youth delegate, travelling as part of the negotiating team and representing Ireland in the high-level talks. Her job is to bring the voice of young Irish people to the meeting and learn how the negotiations work to help inform activism at home. Jenny Salmon (20), of Bray, Co Wicklow, is Concern's first climate youth ambassador, and her responsibility is to help amplify the voice of global youth at home and abroad. Both said the summit - Jenny's first and Oile\'e1n's second - has been an eye-opener. "Previously, I would have been asking, how can they not be moving faster? Why can't they just make a decision and do it?" Oile\'e1n said. "But with the perspective I've got this year you see how slow but important the democratic process is. "It's important every country is comfortable with how we are moving forward and every country's voice is heard and every country's needs are met. "It's very easy to get frustrated at the process and how slow it moves when it feels like the world is ending but it's not for a lack of will - at least not in the people I've met. "How to move the process faster without compromising the democratic process is a really difficult one." Meeting fellow delegates has also provided fresh ideas. "A thing that jumps out is a conversation about how really there's not a huge amount of people who deny climate change yet we spend a lot of time trying to reach them," Oile\'e1n said. "It has been a prerogative of mine, but maybe the time would be better spent getting information to the people who want to make changes" Jenny has had enlightening encounters too. "Hearing from the people who are being impacted by climate catastrophes is what's most amazing to me," she said. "I've met people from Concern offices in different parts of the world and young people from places being affected by climate right now. "I met the environment minister from Kenya where Concern has an office working to help with the drought there and in the Horn of Africa. "When you hear from someone saying it's my town or it's my village that's affected and I know people who lost their homes, lost livelihoods, lost everything, it makes it so real and you think, how can I not care about this?" She has also had some good practical advice. "When you get involved in climate activism, you feel you have to save the whole world," she said. "But one girl I met was talking about looking at the world as your own community and taking a more local approach to it so you do something in your community. "If others do that too, you can cover a lot of ground without becoming overwhelmed." Jenny is collecting viewpoints and messages to bring home for a Concern project and she is keen to find a way to keep up her climate work. She is in her third year of studying law at Trinity and would like to explore environmental law in future. Oile\'e1n just graduated in politics, geography and international relations from UCD and is working on several projects, including the social enterprise Change Clothes Crumlin, a clothing swap shop and mending hub. She attended COP26 with a youth group and misses the protesters here. "On the way in you'd have to go through 10 minutes of protesters and by the time you got to the gate you were like, OK, this is why we're here, and you'd feel so motivated," she said. "It can feel daunting and sad at times. That's why I'm doing Change Clothes. It's positive and fun. You have to learn to find your motivation." \</doc>

The annual global gathering of countries trying to forge collective action in addressing the climate crisis risks becoming "an irrelevancy" because of persistent failure to turn promises into action, according to Minister of State for Overseas Development Aid and Diaspora Colm Brophy. Speaking at the latest UN "conference of the parties" - Cop27 in Egypt - Mr Brophy said his view was "overwhelmingly influenced" by what he experienced in the Horn of Africa recently. "There is something about standing watching a mother, knowing that her child could be dead [from starvation] within 36 hours, within 48 hours; talking to a community who are literally on the verge of being wiped out, not enough being done by the developed world at all - and realising what's happening in the Horn of Africa is entirely climate-related; a man-made catastrophe," he added. "And there are aspects, therefore, when you come to Cop - for me - that I just found really unacceptable. I think it's on the verge of turning itself, if it's not careful, into an irrelevancy," Mr Brophy said at a media briefing. Ireland This was because of inaction by developed countries at the highest level of Cops, he said. "So countries like Ireland are coming in and playing a huge part, the developing countries are coming in and making a huge case. But at the very top level, there still seems to be a lack of a willingness to implement. "So we're on the verge of having a situation where there's more promises and good intentions made in the two weeks of Cop than are made in first two weeks in January - and they're forgotten just as quick. And the definition of madness is repeating the same thing again and again and again. We're on Cop27 ." "When you see the fact that because of what we've failed to do so far, we're facing a catastrophe right across the Horn of Africa and other parts of Africa. We're facing what's actually happened, not what will happen." On migration alone, within two decades they could be looking at large swathes of Africa in particular, but also other parts of the world, that are no-go zones for people effectively unable to live there and have a sustainable future, Mr Brophy said. He noted countries were bidding for Cops in two and three years' time, "and yet you wonder, as it currently stands without a change, whether or not you'll see the same set of promises being reworked again". While there was inevitable focus on Ukraine war, if the world's cameras turned up in the Horn of Africa for "the Bob Geldof moment", it would represent "complete and utter failure", he believed. Emergency work was entirely necessary but also adaptation had to be done to sustain communities in the long term to ensure food system security. This was the approach of Ireland, which it hoped would receive increased backing from fellow EU countries. There was a necessity to make Cops work; "nobody wants it to be a jamboree". They should mean "50 weeks follow-up to the two weeks here", Mr Brophy said. Most people including himself want to see Cops work effectively and not see countries pushed out. The Horn of Africa could be an indicator of what potentially could happen in 40 years' time to other parts of the world, he warned. \</doc>

Negotiators at the Cop27 climate summit in Egypt last night neared a breakthrough deal for a fund to help poor countries being ravaged by the impacts of global warming, but remained deadlocked over how to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions driving them. With a final climate accord already more than a day overdue, representatives of nearly 200 nations were anxious for an agreement they could bill as a step forward in the fight against climate change. "We have to be fast here now, but not fast towards a bad result. Not fast in terms of accepting something that we then spend years regretting," said Enviroment Minister Eamon Ryan. Frans Timmermans, the European Union's climate policy chief, said ministers from the regional bloc were prepared to "walk away" if the accord is not ambitious enough. The outcome of the two-week summit in the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh is a test of worldwide resolve to fight global warming, even as a war in Europe and rampant consumer inflation distract international attention. A Cop27 Days of tense bargaining between wealthy and developing nations at the summit yielded a proposal yesterday to set up a fund to benefit countries coping with irreparable damage from severe storms, floods, droughts and wildfires. Rich countries, including the US and those in Europe, have for decades resisted the idea of a so-called loss and damage fund for fear it would open them up to legal liability for their historic greenhouse gas emissions. Negotiators said the idea had won broad support, but would need to be coupled with increased ambition to cut the emissions that are driving global warming. "It is not acceptable that we will fund the consequences of climate change while not also committing to working on the actual consequences of the emissions," said Romina Pourmokhtari, Sweden's climate minister. China and the US, the two biggest greenhouse gas emitters, have so far been mum on the proposal. The EU had boosted the discussions earlier in the week by offering to support the loss and damage fund, provided large polluters including China pay into it and that countries also ramp up efforts to cut emissions. It was not yet clear if the EU's conditions would be met. The Cop27 "That is certainly a disappointment, given the importance of doing so with all fossil fuels to stay below 1.5C," said David Waskow, international climate director for the World Resources Institute. The EU renewed its request to add the language in negotiations late yesterday, according to a source familiar with the matter. Oil- and gas-rich African and Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia, have opposed the idea. In an attempt to close the yawning gap between current climate pledges and the far deeper cuts needed to avert disastrous climate change, the draft also requested that countries which have not yet done so upgrade their 2030 emissions-cutting targets by the end of 2023. But some negotiators are keen to see the draft require upgrades not just next year, but every year for the rest of the decade to ensure emissions drop as quickly as scientists say is needed to avert the worst impacts of climate change. Some campaigners said the draft offered some positive elements, but was still wanting in ambition. Complicating matters, US Special Climate Envoy John Kerry, a powerful force in climate diplomacy, tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday after days of bilateral in-person meetings. Mr Kerry could not attend in-person negotiations yesterday, but was participating in bilaterals by video phone, the US State Department said. We have to be fast here now, but not fast towards a bad result \</doc>

A HEAD of the COP27 talks getting under way in Egypt tomorrow, here are some pertinent questions about the climate-change conference answered: What is COP27 ? COP stands for Conference of the Parties so it's a meeting of the parties (countries) that are signed up to the United Nations Convention on Climate Change. The convention was signed in 1992 by 197 countries pledging to combat climate change. This is the 27th summit to revisit those pledges and other agreements made since. It is taking place in Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt from tomorrow through to November 18. Who is going? Climate activists and scientists also attend and hold side events. NGO observers are admitted to monitor talks and add a degree of transparency. Industry figures also attend, chiefly energy companies (including fossil-fuel firms) and financial institutions, along with media in a total attendance over 30,000. Ireland will be represented at various times by Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney and junior minister Colm Brophy, as well as Environment Minister Eamon Ryan. A team of Irish officials who are expert in climate negotiations are attending along with a number of academics, state agency and aid agency representatives and youth activists. What happens there? Some pomp, some detailed negotiation, and lots of networking. The pomp comes on Monday and Tuesday of the first week when the "world leaders summit" takes place. Each head of state who wishes to speak has a three-minute slot. They can also attend roundtable discussions on issues such as water security, energy and just transition. After that, the summit works around 11 themed days covering issues such as science, agriculture, biodiversity and decarbonisation. Many presentations and debates take place each day while behind-closed-doors negotiations between national delegations get under way in earnest. Countries with similar views tend to agree initiatives in blocs and then try to bring other blocs on side. Agreements such as last year's methane pledge on cutting methane emissions by 30pc by 2030 came out of such side talks. By the final day, a new declaration setting out some kind of shared vision for the way forward, will be agreed and published. What will be the sticking points? Emissions and money. Cuts to greenhouse gas emissions are still not happening nearly fast enough to align with the pledges made in the 2015 Paris Agreement which aims to keep global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees or as far below 2 degrees as possible. Countries were asked at COP26 to redouble their efforts and increase their targets before COP27 but only a small proportion have. A slew of scientific reports in the last fortnight have shown how the collective failures to cut emissions is pushing the world closer to catastrophe. There has also been a failure to honour an agreement in place since 2009 to create a "climate finance" fund of $100bn to help poor countries take climate action. That target has not been reached yet and it was agreed last year it should increase. A bigger financial issue is around "loss and damage". That means providing easy access to high levels of no-strings funding for poor countries to deal immediately with the impacts of climate change that can no longer be avoided - such as floods, destruction of infrastructure or loss of land to sea-level rise. Poor countries have to beg for help every time this happens or sink further into debt by taking out expensive loans. They believe nations that became wealthy by using fossil fuels owe them loss and damage payments. Wealthy nations fear if they give in, the demands on them will be endless. Up to yesterday morning, the issue was not even on the formal agenda although the agenda will not be finalised until tomorrow, and numerous countries will be pushing for its inclusion over the weekend. Egypt, as hosts, say headway must be made on the issue. Where does Ireland stand? We go to each COP as a standalone country and as a member of the European Union which negotiates as one unit. On emissions, the EU is trying to agree a set of proposals and laws that would cut emissions by all of its member states collectively by 55pc by 2030. The EU has also said it is open to going beyond 55pc "if appropriate". The "Fit for 55" package has not been passed yet so Ireland is saying, we're backing the 55pc target but waiting until it's agreed. Our own national target of a 51pc cut by 2030 was new last year and has not been increased since COP26. What controversies are dogging the summit? Coca-Cola, the world's largest producer of plastic bottles (and plastic pollution), is sponsoring the event for a start. It is being hosted by an oppressive regime that allows little political opposition, free speech or public protest. Thousands of human rights campaigners, climate activists and political opponents are in jail in Egypt. British-Egyptian pro-democracy campaigner, Alaa Abd El-Fattah, has been on hunger strike in jail and has vowed to stop drinking water from the opening day of the summit. The usual demonstrations that take place around COP summits are in doubt. Egypt says it will facilitate some but they must be pre-approved and are expected to be heavily vetted. Greta Thunberg is skipping it, citing the human rights abuses and dismissing the summit as "a green-washing" event that allows laggard leaders to appear to be doing more on climate than is reality. She also doubts it will achieve anything, based on the response since COP26. Is she right? There is a growing disillusionment with COP and the fact that in the 30 years since the convention on which it is founded was signed, emissions, global warming and climate change have all accelerated. \</doc>

'What's the point of Cop27 ?" a friend asked the other day of the UN climate talks starting next week in Egypt. "When it comes to climate change, aren't we doomed?" That question is often asked in advance of these annual climate gatherings and it always leaves me with a deep sense of cognitive dissonance - the unsettling psychological state caused by holding two conflicting beliefs at once. In this case, bleak pessimism versus unexpected optimism. The reasons not to be cheerful are obvious. Despite 27 years of UN climate Cops - a catchy title for the more cumbersome Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - greenhouse gas concentrations are still rising to record highs. So climate change is already here, its fingerprints literally measurable in the lethal heatwaves, wildfires and floods pounding a globe that has warmed by about 1.1 degrees since the late 1800s. The 2015 Paris agreement is supposed to be driving enough emissions cuts to keep warming well below 2 degrees and ideally 1.5 degrees. But we are heading for at least 2.4C according to a stinging UN report that last week branded existing Paris climate efforts "woefully insufficient". Then there are the jolting economic and political shocks that have led us to talk of "polycrisis" and "permacrisis". Poor countries Hundreds of Cop27 Some climate finance is also heading in the wrong direction. Cross-border climate investments that boomed in 2021 are now on track to decline. Blended finance deals that use public funds to make green investments more attractive to private investors have nosedived. So has support for some shareholder climate resolutions at oil groups such as BP and Shell. The list goes on. So what grounds are there for optimism? One big reason: governments and regulators that have been missing in climate action are finally getting serious, and taking unprecedented steps that would have been unthinkable even a year ago. This is most notable in the US where, in August, president Joe Biden signed into law the most significant climate legislation in US history: the Inflation Reduction Act. It could have been bigger and some of its $370 billion (EUR 375 billion) worth of support for electric cars and other green tech is unhelpfully protectionist. Still, it is finally possible to imagine a time when the power of green moguls and green jobs is impossible to ignore, with big knock-on effects. The US law has already spurred calls for the EU to ramp up backing for technologies such as green hydrogen. And the EU itself shows why the International Energy Agency said last week the war in Ukraine could ultimately hasten the clean energy transition. To wean itself off Russian fossil fuels, Brussels has unveiled RepowerEU, a sweeping EUR 210 billion plan to boost green energy. It's still a blueprint, but it is also a stark shift from a year ago. Likewise, Ukraine did not stop a record $226 billion of new renewable energy investment globally in the first six months of 2022, led by China. In a way though, it is more striking to see what corporate regulators are suddenly doing. Two weeks ago, the UK's advertising watchdog banned a set of HSBC adverts for greenwashing, the first move of its kind. Another first came a week later when Australia's corporate watchdog fined an energy company 53,280 Australian dollars for exaggerating its green credentials. This has happened as EU countries, including France, Spain and Poland, have suddenly decided to quit the 28-year-old Energy Charter Treaty, a contentious trade and investment accord that campaigners have long claimed stymies climate action. None of this gets us close to the 45 per cent fall in emissions needed by 2030 to keep the 1.5 degrees temperature goal alive. But it could be a sign that we are nearing vital political tipping points. A growing body of research suggests sweeping social change can be unleashed once 25 per cent of a population is pushing for such a shift. Rising concern about the climate must be bringing that threshold closer in many places. Either way, it is clearer than ever that the climate burden falls heavily on those least able to bear it, so every tenth of a degree of warming matters. Pessimism may feel unavoidable but caving into defeatism is ultimately a luxury that vanishingly few can afford. - Copyright The Financial Times \</doc>

Kevin O'Sullivan Environment & Science Editor The capacity of the world to respond to climate change is most lacking where risk is highest, according to an expert group commissioned by the UN to review key temperature targets of the Paris Agreement. Pathways to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees require global emissions to peak in 2025 and be roughly halved by 2030, it concludes. The world, however, is on a pathway to global warming of 1.5 degrees in 2021-2040 and 2 degrees around 2050, the group warns in a report issued with 10 key messages. The global financial system overall, however, "is poorly aligned with the Paris Agreement goals, with investment in fossil fuels still outweighing climate investment," it adds. The "structured expert dialogue" issued its findings in Sharm el-Sheik at the weekend, the culmination of almost three years of work - co-facilitated by Irish climate scientist Dr Tara Shine. Critical The dialogue involved 100 government representatives - "parties" to the Paris Agreement - experts and civil society representatives from all parts of the world, who reviewed critical "long-term temperature goals" - to hold global temperatures to well below 2 degrees and preferably 1.5 degrees. Redoubling efforts to cut emissions prior to 2030 is the only way to remain on a pathway to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees "with no or limited overshoot", the co-facilitators say. A significant gap remains between emission reduction pledges and reductions required "to limit warming to 2 degrees, let alone 1.5 degrees", they note. Although adaptation in building resilience for inevitable climate impacts is widespread, "it is hampered by lack of access to finance and linked to limited evidence of resulting risk reduction". "Parties must act not only urgently but also equitably in reducing emissions and enhancing adaptation. Continuing to scale up financial support and support for other means of implementation will enable more ambitious mitigation and effective adaptation by all parties towards achieving the long-term global goals," the group says. Its 10 key messages focus on the need to accelerate action. The group points out that at 1.1 degrees of warming the world is already experiencing extreme climate change and delaying action reduces options for mitigation and adaptation. Not acceptable Meanwhile, climate justice campaigner and former president Mary Robinson has warned about a sense of defeatism about limiting global overheating to 1.5 degrees. "I have been worried that there seems to some kind of attempt to say may be 1.5 degrees is not achievable any more, staying below 1.5 degrees of warming. That is not acceptable," she said. That was not a target, Ms Robinson stressed, but a scientific limit of a liveable world that had to be adhered to. She was speaking at a meeting at Cop27 on Saturday hosted by the Irish Government on climate justice and its role in enhancing adaptation and responding to loss and damage in vulnerable countries. Ms Robinson, who is chairwoman of The Elders, a group of global leaders working for peace, justice and human rights, called for a new global movement beyond the "1.5 to stay alive" campaign that was pivotal to securing the Paris Agreement, to change governments and investment priorities in a "ridiculous" scenario when $1.8 trillion was being spent on fossil fuel subsidies. \</doc>

THE Taoiseach has warned that if the current generation does not urgently step up to act on climate change, future generations will "not forgive us". Micheal Martin told the Cop27 climate summit in Egypt that Ireland is doing all it can to reach its climate targets. Giving Ireland's national climate statement at the climate summit in Sharm El- Sheikh, Mr Martin said that as political leaders, it is their responsibility to drive the transformation necessary. "What were once exceptional events are now occurring with increased frequency and ferocity," Mr Martin said in his address on Tuesday. "People in the poorest parts on the planet are being driven from regions that can no longer support and sustain them. "Climate change is fuelling conflict, global instability, competition for resources and abject human misery. If this generation doesn't step up urgently, future generations will not forgive us. As leaders, it is our responsibility to drive the transformation necessary. In Ireland, the government has set legally-binding emission reduction targets of 51% by 2030 and has committed Ireland to becoming climate neutral by 2050. "We have fixed Sectoral Emissions Ceilings limiting greenhouse gases emissions for each economic sector. "Achieving these targets will be challenging, so we have enacted a legal framework to guide and underpin our efforts. "The burden of climate change globally is falling most heavily on those least responsible for our predicament. Ireland has therefore published an international climate finance roadmap, reaffirming our commitment to supporting the world's most vulnerable people. "We are more than doubling our finance to almost 225 million euro a year by 2025." Mr Martin is on a two-day trip to Egypt, while Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications Eamon Ryan, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Minister of State for Overseas Development Aid and Diaspora Colm Brophy is also attending. Meanwhile UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres has hit out at the "rank deception" of fossil fuel firms with net zero pledges who are still expanding their operations. Mr Guterres was speaking at the launch of a report by an expert group he established last year to tackle greenwashing and gaps in net zero commitments by companies, banks and regions. The report sets out red lines on greenwashing, and standards and criteria for net zero commitments, to ensure they help cut emissions to curb dangerous warming. \</doc>

In some ways, the d\'e9nouement of the Cop 27 talks at Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt at the weekend was pretty predictable: frenzied last-minute negotiations; divided opinions and snotty threats to collapse the talks; a curve ball from the European Union; and finally, a last-minute deal which everyone signed up for. A successful week, then? Well, perhaps, but with lingering and real concerns about the honesty and commitment of the globe's biggest players - including the US, China and the EU - to the process of fighting the scourge of global warming. And, with growing economies such as India and Brazil coming ever-more into the equation, the whole picture about the economies of climate change has become ever-clearer. The unexpected introduction by the EU of a system to come up with financial assistance, obliquely called 'loss and damage,' to poorer nations who suffer most from the ravages of climate disaster and yet who have done least to cause it, called for on these pages last week, was successful after marathon negotiations and very welcome. But the clouding of the target of reaching a point where the world can contain temperatures rising beyond a 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold, beyond which scientists say we should not breach, was unsatisfactory as current policies indicate a temperature increase of the order of 2.8 decrees which would devastate the lives of billions of people and threaten countless ecosystems. The lack of mention in the final text from Sharm el-Sheikh of the phasing out of fossil fuels and scant reference to the 1.5C target is worrying and seems to indicate a weakening of requirements from the big economic powers to make new and more ambitious climate commitments. Then there is also the continued influence of the big oil producing countries who appear to have been successful in thwarting efforts to strengthen the deal. Host nation, Egypt, has taken some of the blame for protecting neighbouring alliances in the formulation of a deal - a claim it denies - but the fact the next COP will take place in Dubai and be hosted by the United Arab Emirates, which is a massive oil exporter, does not inspire confidence. Right now it is nearly remarkable we have come so for in such a short time and that the target of a sub-2 degree is still possible, especially as credible estimates originally considered we only had an eight per cent chance of achieving it. But the work has to continue and it is crucial that internecine bickering does not derail us from the ultimate aim. We have seen progress in the past week but, as ever, that is not something which can be taken for granted. \</doc>

C HECKING the clock is a constant during an international gathering like COP27 as delegates try to remember what time zone they're in. Trying to recall the year is a sign the confusion is about more than hours. Yet it was necessary during yesterday's world leaders segment to repeat the mantra that this was 2022 because it looked and sounded very like 2021 and COP26. Every speech sounded like every speech before it which sounded like every speech last year. The time for talking was over, action was the only response, we still have a chance, it could be a great world if we took it - it was as if the words came from a pick 'n' mix collection for uninspired orators. A film showing extreme weather events of the past year, followed inevitably by scenes of solar farms, wind turbines and laughing children, was striking because it would take a metal heart not to be disturbed by the chaos and suffering climate change has wrought. But really the only difference from last year was that the voiceover came not from David Attenborough but from Ahmed Amin, an Egyptian comedian. There was no comedy, of course, and he delivered his lines sincerely, it not being his fault that they'd mostly been said before, just in a different accent. Some speakers did try hard to inject the occasion with the urgency it required but the two stand-outs were not heads of state. Antonio Guterres, secretary general of the United Nations, has persistently and passionately pleaded, cajoled and exhorted heads of state to act in all of his big speeches. This time he tried terrifying them. "The clock is ticking. We are in the fight of our lives. And we are losing," he said. "Greenhouse gas emissions keep growing. Global temperatures keep rising. And our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible. "We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator." Al Gore, another non-head of state, although as former US vice-president he came close, tried another tactic - embarrassing them. "We have a credibility problem - all of us," he told the assembled presidents, prime ministers and princes. "We are where we are today because we continue to use the thin blue shell that surrounds our planet as an open sewer."No blushes were evident but then world leaders tend to have thick skins through which no embarrassment burns. And some have much less reason for shame than others, the hall being occupied by heads of rich, resilient, carbon-polluting economies as well as poor, low-polluting, vulnerable, climate-walloped countries. But reasons for shame keep coming at this conference. A study published by Oxfam to coincide with the event showed how a billionaire emits a million times more greenhouse gases than the average person. The aid agency found that the $2.4trn investments held by 125 of the richest billionaires in fossil fuels and high carbon polluting industries produced greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to all of France. If any one of those 125 would like to turn over a new non-gold leaf, the World Meteorological Organisation was going around pleading for a mere $3bn to set up an "early warning for all" system. The idea is to ensure there is enough information and communications technologies for all to warn people so that they might escape with their lives, even if not their homes and livelihoods, when an extreme weather event strikes. Meanwhile, in an effort to show the upside of the summit, 112 countries announced they were now supporting a '30' initiative, pledging to protect at least 30pc of land and ocean from further degradation by 2030. It's not clear whether their founders were among the 125 who, by Oxfam's calculations, would do the world a bigger favour simply by not being billionaires. Cynicism is cheap, of course, and while there is fertile ground for its cultivation at this summit, Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin offered a different perspective. Arriving in Sharm El Sheikh in advance of his address to world leaders this afternoon, he spoke of the need to tell people the changes they were making or trying to make were important. "We don't want people to become totally overwhelmed by the negativity and doomsday scenarios," he said. He said we had to guard against "depressing people away from action". Maybe that's a hint of what he plans to say today when he takes his place among leaders as diverse as the prime minister of Pakistan who saw a third of his country under flood waters earlier this year, and the president of Poland which is cranking up coal production. The gathering is scheduled to end with words from another comedian who today plays a very different role. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky is due to give a video address to the event he'd much rather be attending in person. That may be all the reminder needed that this is indeed 2022. \</doc>

The UN COP27 climate summit in Egypt drew praise for the HYPERLINK creation of a "loss and damage" fund to help vulnerable countries cope with the destructive impacts of global warming. But there was also anger over a failure to push further efforts on cutting emissions to keep alive the aspirational goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C from pre-industrial levels. Here are some of the reactions: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres: "This COP has taken an important step towards justice. I welcome the decision to establish a loss and damage fund." "Clearly, this won't be enough... To have any hope of keeping to 1.5, we need to massively invest in renewables and end our addiction to fossil fuels." Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, COP27 chairman: "Millions around the globe can now sense some glimmer of hope that their suffering will finally be addressed appropriately." Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif: "The establishment of loss & damage fund at the UN climate summit is the first pivotal step towards the goal of climate justice." Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama: "From the bottom of my heart, vinaka vakalevu (thank you very much) to our tireless Pacific negotiators for securing a loss and damage fund at COP27 ." Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and chairperson of the Elders: "The historic outcome on loss and damage at COP27 shows international cooperation is possible. Equally, the renewed commitment on the 1.5C global warming limit was a source of relief." "However, none of this changes the fact that the world remains on the brink of climate catastrophe." Mohamed Adow, executive director of Power Shift Africa: "At the beginning of these talks loss and damage was not even on the agenda and now we are making history." "It just shows that this UN process can achieve results, and that the world can recognise the plight of the vulnerable must not be treated as a political football." Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of World Resources Institute: "This loss and damage fund will be a lifeline for poor families whose houses are destroyed, farmers whose fields are ruined, and islanders forced from their ancestral homes." Frans Timmermans, vice president of the European Commission: "What we have in front of us is not enough of a step forward for people and planet. It does not bring enough added efforts for major emitters to increase and accelerate their emissions cuts." Maldives Environment Minister Aminath Shauna: "I want to continue to live in the Maldives. I also want my two-year-old girl to also grow up in the Maldives." "We are just a metre (about a yard) above sea level. Every fraction of degree in increase in temperature and every millimetre of sea level rise threatens our existence." "We made it clear over the past two weeks that mitigation ambition (cutting emissions) was a cornerstone of our outcomes here at COP27 . I am disheartened we did not get there." German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock: "It was always clear that COP27 would not be easy. When it comes to the result, hope and frustration lie close together." "We have made a breakthrough on climate justice with a broad coalition of states after years of stagnation." "It is more than frustrating that ... overdue steps to reduce emissions and phase out fossil fuels were prevented. As a result, the world is losing precious time on the path to 1.5 degrees." French Energy Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher: "The COP27 "Emissions peaking before 2025, as the science tells us, is necessary. Not in this text. Clear follow-through on the phase-down of coal. Not in this text. A clear commitment to phase out all fossil fuels. Not in this text. And the energy text, weakened, in the final minutes. "Each of us will have to explain that, to our citizens, to the world's most vulnerable countries and communities, and ultimately to the children and grandchildren to whom many of us now go home."

US President Joe Biden will attend COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh today where he is expected to hold talks with Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi before delivering a speech this afternoon outlining America's very strong commitment to climate action. Yesterday, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi said leaders had a moral obligation to be good stewards of the climate negotiation process for the children and for the future. COP27 is one venue where President Biden is very likely to be welcomed with open arms. One of his first acts on becoming United States President was to sign an Executive Order bringing the US back into the Paris Climate Accord after his predecessor Donald Trump had taken it out. The United States is the world's second largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China, and global efforts to tackle climate change would be far more difficult without America. Instead, a very strong pro-environment quote from President Biden is emblazoned on the wall of the US exhibition pavilion in Sharm el-Sheikh. It says: "We are going to take the most aggressive action ever, ever, ever to confront the climate crisis and increase our energy security." President Biden said this about his Inflation Reduction Act, signed last August, providing $370 billion for climate action and promising to cut America's greenhouse gas emissions by 1 billion tonnes in 2030.

The head of the EU executive Ursula von der Leyen has described the Cop27 deal as "a small step towards climate justice", but said much more was needed for the planet. In a dramatic U-turn on Friday, the European Union acceded to poor countries' demands to create a new fund to address the loss and damage caused by global heating, a decision that paved the way for an agreement early yesterday. Senior EU figures responded cautiously to the outcome of the conference. Ms Von der Leyen said much more was needed for the planet: "We have treated some of the symptoms but not cured the patient from its fever," she said. "I am pleased that Cop27 has opened a new chapter on financing loss and damage, and laid the foundations for a new method for solidarity between those in need and those in a position to help. We are rebuilding trust. " Cop27 has kept alive the goal of 1.5C. Unfortunately however, it has not delivered on a commitment by the world's major emitters to phase down fossil fuels, nor new commitments on climate mitigation." Alok Sharma, the UK representative at Cop27 and president of Cop26, was critical of the outcome, describing the 1.5C goal as being "on life support". While he said that progress on loss and damage has been "historic", he warned that it was not a moment for "unqualified celebration". Mr Sharma indicated the deal did not go far enough, as he told the closing session: "Many of us came here to safeguard the outcomes that we secured in Glasgow, and to go further still. "Friends, I said in Glasgow that the pulse of 1.5 degrees was weak. Unfortunately, it remains on life support. "And all of us need to look ourselves in the mirror, and consider if we have fully risen to that challenge over the past two weeks." \</doc>

'Permacrisis" is the word of the year; "polycrisis" is the term I've used in these pages. The implication is the same: the crisis is seemingly permanent; the crisis is everywhere. As COP27 , the annual United Nations climate change conference , kicks off today in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, expect a barrage of doomsday headlines and terrifying imagery. The week before last, we learned the global temperature rise is set to hit a catastrophic 2.5 degrees by the end of this century. Last week, we learned European temperatures have already risen by 1.5 degrees over the past 30 years. This week, in the US mid-term elections, Republicans may seize control of the legislature, surely condemning the world's largest economy and most influential culture to another period of climate denial and obstructionism. You could be forgiven for giving up. We have grown accustomed to looking at the climate crisis through the lens of failure - captured in the title of perhaps the most influential book on the issue in recent years, The Uninhabitable Earth, by David Wallace-Wells. But is there an alternative lens? What happens if we make an effort to look at the crisis through the lens of progress? This column is an attempt to do that. 1. THE UNITED STATES In August, US president Joe Biden succeeded where Bill Clinton and Barack Obama had failed, in passing landmark climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act. Is that about to be undone by a Republican takeover of Congress in Tuesday's mid-terms? Perhaps not. As a recent report by the investment bank Credit Suisse concluded, red states are likely to see the greatest economic benefits from the act. And despite no Republicans in either house voting for it, many of its measures are popular with their voters. The act returns the US to the realm of international cooperation on climate action. Analysts have said it puts the target of the US reaching "net zero" emissions by 2050 back on the table. The Credit Suisse report argues that the act's economic impact - redirecting investment into clean energy - could be far greater than previously estimated, making clean energy now "the safe, smart, government-backed bet", even for conservative investors, as The Atlantic magazine's climate reporter, Robinson Meyer, concluded. 2. CLEAN ENERGY The Credit Suisse report was one of a series of recent reports highlighting the scarcely-believable progress made in the transition to clean energy. The International Energy Agency - an organisation that has been accused in the past of bias toward fossil fuels and nuclear energy - concluded recently that fossil fuels were approaching a "definitive peak", with coal demand peaking this decade, natural gas by the end of the decade and oil by the mid-2030s. Even as the energy crisis and Russia's war on Ukraine have provoked a temporary surge in demand for fossil fuels, they have hastened the reorienting of the global economy toward clean energy. This year has seen the largest annual rise in global renewable electricity generation (led by solar PV and wind technologies) on record, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported. That shift will further accelerate as scale and innovation lower costs. Until now, it has always been thought that the energy transition would be an economic burden. But recent research by Professor Doyne Farmer and colleagues at the Oxford Martin School has calculated that an accelerated transition will more than pay for itself. "Completely replacing fossil fuels with clean energy by around 2050 will save us trillions," Farmer has said. 3. CLIMATE TECH Elon Musk last year announced a $100m ((EURO)100.4m) prize for an invention to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere or ocean at scale. But Richard Branson announced a similar competition (valued at $25m) 15 years ago and never delivered. Climate tech has long been a bete noire of climate activists, who dislike the libertarian-capitalist utopianism of the "tech bros" and fear the sci-fi glamour of their "blue-skies" thinking distracts from the challenge at hand and promotes complacency. In the here and now, climate tech has made extraordinary strides. New analysis by Bloomberg has identified tipping-points for the mass adoption of green technologies. In a number of new technologies, from electric motorcycles to heat pumps to gridscale batteries, they found that once the rollout of the technology reached thresholds at or around 5pc adoption accelerated rapidly. This suggests other countries and markets will follow the same path when adopting this tech. "The world is crossing into a mass-adoption moment for green technologies," Bloomberg concluded. 4. COMMUNICATIONS The portrait we are fed by our media (and social media) of politics in general, and of US politics in particular, is hopelessly polarised. The Republicans seem lost to climate action: as Hurricane Ian hit Florida in September, for example, Fox News continued to deny the link between climate change and worsening hurricanes. But this portrait is deceptive. Most Americans are worried about climate change, say it is a threat they will face in the next 20 years, believe it should be a priority and believe the government is not doing enough, the Yale Programme on Climate Change Communication has found. Critically, Americans (and their media) do not realise this. A recent study led by Boston College psychologist Gregg Sparkman found most Americans significantly underestimate the general support for climate action. But crucially, this also creates great potential: it suggests there is significant untapped support for climate action in the US. Proving to people that their own viewpoint supportive of climate action was, in fact, the majority viewpoint and not a minority one would likely embolden both the public and policy-makers in driving policy change. "Politics is downstream of culture," Andrew Breitbart, founder of the eponymous website, used to argue - an insight that was weaponised in the culture wars, with extraordinary success, by one-time Trump adviser Steve Bannon. But climate activists and experts are winning the culture war. And politics and finance are following.  The temperature-rise stories of recent weeks were reported as indicators of failure, but they can also be seen as indicators of progress. Only five years ago, the world seemed on course for warming of double the 2.5 degrees recently projected by the UN. This is "genuine and world-shaping progress", wrote none other than the aforementioned "doomist", David Wallace-Wells, in the New York Times. "The fight against climate change is going to change more in the next four years than it has in the past 40," wrote The Atlantic magazine's climate reporter, Robinson Meyer, in a recent analysis of the Inflation Reduction Act. "The great story of our lives is just beginning." If the future is less apocalyptic, there is more to fight for. This is the great story. How we contribute to that story is up to each of us, but it is not a narrative of powerlessness. Once the rollout of new, greener technology got to 5pc or around, adoption levels accelerated \</doc>

Why is Cop27 in Egypt the first United Nations climate conferenceto directly connect climate and nutrition . With climate change already seriously threatening human health and food and water securityin Egypt and the rest of Africa (the home of many of the 193 million facing crisis or worse levels of food insecurity), it should come as no surprise that the vital role of agriculture and food systems in both food supply and emissions is acknowledged at this COP (Conference of Parties) . Adding urgency are the disruption of regional food supply chains by the war in Ukraine, which hit the Middle East and North Africa hard, and droughts and floods in Africa this year devastating agricultural yields . Cop27 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) call last year for strong climate action in agriculture, to curb emissions, has also raised awareness of the food sector . To move toward a netzero-emissions world, emissions from agriculture and forestry must be addressed, alongside a focus on carbon sequestration . One of the Cop27 . At COP26, rules for carbon markets to help count ries meet their Paris Agreement commitments were discussed. Carbon credits are generated by reducing emissions, and trading of credits allows capital to flow to climate change mitigation in regions where no funding might otherwise be available. It is a way for developed countries to invest in poorer countries' climate change mitigation . But strict rules are needed, for example, to prevent double-counting by both the credit buyer and seller. The rules were to be fur ther discussed during Cop27 . . Will sound food and agriculture decisions be made at Cop27 ? It is reassuring to see a big presence at the conference from Wagening en University & Research (WUR), the world's leading supplier of scientific education in the healthy food and living environment domain . There are four central questions on food systems for each country at Cop27 , says Ivo Demmers, Head of WUR's Food Security and Valuing Water Programme . He believes that global food security is about more than the climate . He says the right choices must be made in food production, and there is a good example in Egypt, where it was chosen to use available water and land for export purposes. Ratherthanproduce wheat, which the Egyptians themselves might use to bake bread, they opted to produce, for example, string beans for European supermarkets. It was a very profitable short-term option, but clearly now leaves the Egyptian population vulnerable. when wheat prices are soaring on the international market . "The climate, in short, is just one of the factors influencing our food system. Soil quality, availability of water, and biodiversity also play an essential role. Challenges in the food system are interlinked," says Demmers. His central questions are : How can we produce food as effectively as possible in a particular location What determines the diet in that location (what are suitable crops and animals) Can farmers generate an income from their farms, and is food affordable What is the environmental impact, on climate, biodiversity, soil and water quality The answers determine whether a country is sufficiently resilient to adapt to changing circumstances . Demmers says there is no "silver bullet" when making the right choices to safeguard food security in a future with a changing climate . Soil, biodiversity, water availability, manure, and people's diets differ geographically. Much research and exchange of scientific knowledge are needed . "It is no more than just that we should discuss vulnerability, resilience and climate action on one of the continents most affected by the consequences of climate change during this COP" . At Wageningen, in the Netherlands, transition to a circular economy is seen as necessary to feed the increasing world population within planetary boundaries. Water, nutrients, and carbon must be continuously re-used, and the loss of natural resources minimised . \</doc>

Cop27 conference takes place in Egypt next month  Government set to update Climate Action Plan The coming weeks will be "crucial" for climate change both nationally and internationally, according to environmentalists, with Ireland's latest Climate Action Plan and the international Cop27 global summit in the final planning stages. The UN-backed Cop27 at Sharm-El-Sheikh in Egypt next month follows on from the Cop26 event in Glasgow last year. It aims to build on a number of pledges made by governments around the world on tackling greenhouse gas emissions. Meanwhile, the Government is poised to update its Climate Action Plan to incorporate the agreement on "carbon budgets" and ceilings imposed on various sectors as to the emissions they can produce, reflecting legally binding reduction targets for 2030 and 2050 in the Climate Act. Stop Climate Chaos (SCC), an umbrella group of more than 30 organisations in Ireland, said: "The next few weeks are a crucial period for climate action. Big decisions are due to be made both nationally and internationally. "A trio of Irish climate policies are due to be finalised or progressed. The global Cop27 climate negotiations start next month. Every action that every one of us takes between now and then is important." A breakthrough on loss and damage is "desperately needed" at the Egypt event, SCC said. The UN uses the term "loss and damage" during climate negotiations to refer to the consequences of climate change that go beyond what people can adapt to, or when options exist but a community does not have the resources to access or utilise them, according to the World Resources Institute. SCC said: "Sometimes climate impacts are so severe they go beyond what people can adapt to. Think of the current climate-exacerbated drought in the Horn of Africa, heavy rains destroying hectare upon hectare of crops in Rwanda, or recent flooding that left one third of Pakistan under water. Climate impacts like this are referred to as 'loss and damage'." The bigger and more developed countries, typically in Western societies, are the biggest culprits when it comes to emitting greenhouse gases that are warming the planet, but it is the smaller countries that are paying the price of devastation from extreme weather events and global warming, SCC said. "Big polluters should be paying for the loss and damage they cause MDASH but at the moment they're not," it said. "Climate-vulnerable countries and climate justice movements will make a huge effort to change this at Cop27 ." Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney attended a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg yesterday, where co-ordination on EU efforts on climate change ahead of Cop27 was discussed, among other issues such as the Ukraine crisis. "Ireland is extensively engaged in EU preparations for the Cop27 conference in Sharm el-Sheikh," he said. "This includes working to increase our collective climate ambition in line with the Paris Agreement, and pushing for urgent implementation of prior commitments." Cop27 is already under fire from human rights organisations over fears that the host country is stifling dissent from climate scientists. Egypt, which is seeing the likes of rising sea levels and water scarcity already having an impact, has silenced critics, according to a report from Human Rights Watch. The Egyptian government has severely curtailed environmental groups' ability to carry out independent policy, advocacy, and field work essential to protecting the country's natural environment, it claimed. \</doc>

T HIS week's report from Somalia by Conor Feehan and Mark Condren in the Irish Independent has provided for us all a valuable account of the horrific situation facing people of the Horn of Africa. Somalia, for example, stands on the brink of a third famine in three decades. It is a region with which I am personally familiar. Thirty years ago, I travelled to Somalia with Sally O'Neill of Tr\'f3caire and saw first-hand the death and destruction caused by the 1992 famine. My predecessor as President, Mary Robinson, visiting at the same time, having seen the devastation at the Mandera refugee camp, immediately travelled to the United Nations to draw the attention of world leaders to the horror of the famine. The response of the international community to what she described was that "it must be never again". Twenty years later, Mary Robinson travelled again to the region to sound the alarm on another devastating hunger crisis that was unfolding due to one of the worst droughts in decades. A delayed global response resulted in a famine that claimed the lives of more than 260,000 people in Somalia, half of them children under the age of five. Once again the international community's response was: "It must be never again." But today, as detailed so vividly in Conor Feehan and Mark Condren's report and photographs, we find ourselves, once more, in the throes of another grave hunger crisis. It is one of cataclysmic proportions, with a death occurring every 48 seconds in drought-ravaged Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia. Our humanitarian response is urgently needed. If we continue waiting until a famine is declared, it will be too late to stop needless deaths and misery. The world community needs to make the required funds available immediately if we are to stave off this unfolding humanitarian disaster, get immediate aid to people who are starving, and thereby prevent the deaths of millions of poor and marginalised people. Above all, however, we must be willing to acknowledge that there are structural features, which those in power have not been prepared to recognise or shown a willingness to change, which are producing these repeated famines. How can it be that we would allow such a situation to occur every decade? From tomorrow, world leaders will be meeting in Sharm El Sheikh for the COP27 Climate Change Conference. It is vital that this conference recaptures those great moments of optimism reached at COP21 in Paris in 2015 and in the agreement on the UN Sustainable Development Goals in New York that same year. All our global crises are inter-connected. Climate change consequences, desertification, famine, displacement. COP27 must recognise that connection has created what Mohamed Fall, Unicef's Regional Director for East and Southern Africa, has termed "the perfect storm of horror". The structural issues being neglected are forcing millions of people to leave their homes in search of clean water, food and farmable land, leading to huge increases in the number of internally displaced persons in the region. The global community is challenged by this unfolding famine, and all famines, to honour its obligations on climate change mitigation and adaptation, to protect our fragile environment, to ensure regulatory frameworks respect the right of small landholders to stay on their land and retain access to water sources. We cannot allow such famines to slip off the agenda of meetings of those who have most to give. This is a matter which I have raised in the strongest terms in my recent address to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg and during the annual meeting of non-executive European Presidents, the Arraiolos Group, which took place last month in Malta. Specifically, there are changes in staple food production that we must make. We must break open monopolies in food production and distribution. There are dependencies which must be broken on suppliers and markets. We are required to restructure trade, and we must recognise the immorality of basic foods being defined as a commodity for speculation. We must become better at utilising famine early warning systems so that we take timely and effective action. There are the regional protections including grain resources that we must fund. And we must give debt relief. Smaller countries, including Ireland, have been leading the vital humanitarian support for famine relief in Eastern Africa. It is time for those with the greatest capacity to follow the lead of smaller countries and their peoples, and not only in terms of meeting humanitarian response targets. Responsibility must be taken. It is, after all, the richest countries who have produced the lion's share of emissions, that have precipitated the desertification of countries whose peoples have been least responsible for the destruction of our planet. We, the global community, can no longer avert our gaze from what threatens as a human and biodiversity species failure. We have a moral and ethical responsibility. A worldwide response is urgently needed if our words of before - "it must be never again" - are to ring true. Each day of inaction costs lives. The transformation we need is overdue. It is our global duty to make it happen. The global community is challenged by this unfolding famine to honour its obligations on climate change mitigation \</doc>

On any morning at the Cop27 climate conference, you can expect a gauntlet of anti-meat protesters wearing pig and cow costumes, holding banners decrying the carbon footprint of livestock, and chanting slogans like "Let's be vegan, let's be free." Activist groups and corporate star tups have descended on the two-week climate summit in Egypt to heap pressure on the hundreds of global policy makers there over the world's love affair with meat and its role in warming. Their demands range from lowering meat consumption to policies as seemingly outlandish as transitioning to cell-based meat grown in steel vats, which could eliminate feed crops, ranch land and slaughterhouses. And researchers fear the impact may be greater, after recent efforts to measure emissions at individual U.S. farms - by, say, flying a methane-detecting plane over them - showed them churning out much more than estimated. "We seem to be wildly off. Virtually every time these ... measurements are conducted they disagree with (official data)," said Matthew Hayek, a researcher at New York University. Negotiators from nearly 200 countries at Cop27 are holding discussions focused on the problem for the first time in the UN summit's nearly three-decade history. But cutting meat and dairy output is not yet on the agenda for governments- many of which give billions of dollars to livestock farmers in subsidies. Instead, they are advancing policies to reduce the emissions using feed additives that make animals less gassy, and technology that sucks up the methane wafting off manure heaps. Activists aren't buying it. "This can never be the way to net zero," said Max Weiss, a campaigner at the Plant Based Treaty, a global activist group promoting a meat-free diet. "We have to move away from animal production." Climate scientists are also skeptical that industry-preferred measures will go far enough. UN IPCC climate panel cice chair, and farm emissions specialist Andy Reisinger, said feed additives could worsen emissions by promoting intensive farming. "It would result in more intensive livestock production that would require larger areas of land to produce the animal feed, putting pressure on forest land," Reisinger told Reuters . A report released on Tuesday by the Changing Markets Foundation, a sustainability advocacy group, showed the combined emissions from 15 of the world's top meat and dairy companies exceeded those of Germany. Anti-meat campaigners have been protesting food kiosks at the Cop27 summit for selling burgers and chicken - foods which they say don't belong at a climate conference. "When you enter the conference, you have the scent of grilled animal meat in your nose. Which is dystopian to me," Weiss said. But not everyone minds the smell of barbecue. That's why several companies represented at the summit want to commercialize an emerging technology to grow real meat in steel vats using microbial fermentation. Their aim is to be able to provide steaks, chicken breasts, and pork without the downsides of traditional animal agriculture. "We think people want to eat meat," said GOOD Meat CEO Josh Tetrick, who was serving up his company's cell-based chicken during an event on Cop27 's sidelines. "We're just trying to figure out a more climate-friendly way of giving them what they want." Tetrick's company already sells small amounts of "cultivated chicken" to restaurants in Singapore and is investing in production capacity in the United States in a bet regulators will approve its sale there. While the taste and texture are nearly identical to chicken, the financial cost is about 10 times higher. "We need to fix that," Tetrick said. FAIRR Initiative - an investor network focused on sustainable agriculture - policy director Helena Wright, said she was encouraged by the focus on food at Cop27 . "The conversation has started. And regardless of whether governments act, the market is already shifting," she said.  Reuters \</doc>

The conference in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh comes in a fraught year marked by Russia's war on Ukraine, an energy crunch, soaring inflation and the lingering effects from the Covid pandemic. But Simon Stiell, the UN's climate change executive secretary, said he would not be a "custodian of backsliding" on the goal of slashing greenhouse emissions 45% by 2030 to cap global warming at 1.5C above late-19th-century levels. "We will be holding people to account, be they presidents, prime ministers, CEOs," Mr Stiell said as the 13-day summit opened. "The heart of implementation is everybody everywhere in the world every single day doing everything they possibly can to address the climate crisis," he said. \</doc>

IRISH ministers attending COP27 in Egypt have expressed concern about human rights abuses in the host country. Egypt's leader, president Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, was first to address the world leaders' summit segment of the annual climate conference yesterday. He urged the almost 100 heads of state present to move for "rapid, effective and equitable implementation" of climate commitments. However, Mr El-Sisi has been criticised by human rights bodies for leading a regime that represses political opposition and civil society activism. Thousands of campaigners and protesters, including climate activists, are in prison. Prominent pro-democracy campaigner Alaa Abd El-Fattah is on hunger strike in an Egyptian jail with fears growing for his health. Asked if the Taoiseach would raise human rights during talks with any members of the Egyptian delegation or other attendees at COP27 , a Government spokesperson said: "Ireland is concerned about human rights in Egypt. "At the UN Human Rights Council in March 2021, we co-signed a Joint Statement on Egypt with a number of other countries, expressing our deep concern about the trajectory of human rights in Egypt, drawing particular attention to restrictions on freedom of speech, the right to free assembly, the lack of space for civil society and for political opposition, and the application of terrorism legislation against peaceful critics. "We regularly raise these concerns bilaterally at the UN and together with our EU partners, and will continue to do so." A Department of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said Minister Simon Coveney, who will attend COP27 later this week, had also expressed concern. "Ireland takes a consistent position on human rights in Egypt and Minister Coveney has previously raised Ireland's concerns with his Egyptian counterpart. These issues form a regular part of our bilateral engagements." COP27 next week and a spokesperson for his department said he would raise the issue of human rights but it is not clear if he will specify Egypt's track record. "Climate action has to be about climate justice first and foremost and cannot be separated or divorced in any way from broader human rights," the spokesperson said. "The minister has spoken in the past about the integral link between climate action and social justice, equality and human rights and it will be to the fore during his participation at COP27 ." Ministers meet with many delegates from the different negotiating blocs during their time at the climate summit. Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin will today meet the V20 group of finance ministers from climate-vulnerable countries and the G7 economies at talks chaired by German chancellor Olaf Scholz. Mr Martin said Ireland would make an announcement at the event on "loss and damage" funding. The issue is dominating this year's summit as demands from poor countries grow for compensation for climate disasters caused by carbon-polluting rich nations. Yesterday he also attended a roundtable discussion on food security at which he raised the inequity of developing countries that contributed the least to climate change suffering its worst impacts. He also spoke of the "irrefutable" links between climate change, food insecurity and conflict. The Taoiseach briefly met British prime minister Rishi Sunak and later joined president Nikenike Vurobaravu of Vanuatu for a discussion on the concerns of small island states. Vanuata is under threat of being submerged by rising sea levels. Ireland has made support for small island states a priority at the summit. \</doc>

A HALF-YEAR'S profits by six of the biggest fossil fuel companies would cover the cost of climate-related disasters in developing countries, with billions to spare, a new report shows. Oxfam Ireland is among the 100 organisations behind the report which shows that oil companies could more than pay for the damage their products cause. It comes a fortnight before the start of the UN climate summit, COP27 , where world leaders will come under pressure to set up a permanent 'loss and damage' fund. The fund, first proposed 30 years ago, would provide certainty around financial aid for the countries most affected by extreme weather disasters but which have the least means for recovery. The 'Cost of Delay' report, by Oxfam and the Loss and Damage Collaboration, shows that BP, Shell, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Total and Eni between them made profits of $95bn ((EURO)96.33bn) between January and June this year. Over the same period 119 extreme weather and climaterelated events were recorded in developing countries, with costs running to $26.2bn ((EURO)26.57bn). One example highlighted in the report is the recent devastating floods in Pakistan which directly affected 33 million people. The estimated cost of the damage to homes, infrastructure and livelihoods is over $30bn ((EURO)30.42bn) but a UN appeal for aid only targeted $470m ((EURO)4476.6m). So far, wealthy countries have only come up with 19pc of that amount. Pakistan is now having to take out costly loans to try to fund the recovery operation, whereas a loss-and-damage fund would provide grants and other assistance to ensure a struggling country was not further burdened by debts. "It is not too late to end this intolerable injustice," said Oxfam Ireland CEO, Jim Clarken. " COP27 "An ambitious outcome is critical not only for those dealing with climate impacts in developing countries, but also for maintaining trust and credibility." His call is backed by former President Mary Robinson, who writes a foreword to the report. "The costs of climate impacts which cannot be mitigated or adapted to are very real and are currently being paid for by those least responsible for the climate crisis," she wrote. "At COP27 The report's release comes a day before NGOs and human rights groups appear with Climate Action Minister Eamon Ryan before the Oireachtas Committee on the Environment and Climate Action to discuss Ireland's approach to COP27 . Oxfam Ireland has nominated the Kenyan climate activist Elizabeth Wathuti to appear before the committee. The award-winning campaigner, who began her activism as a schoolgirl, has been working alongside Oxfam over the last few months documenting the impact of climate breakdown in Africa. She will be attending COP27 to advocate for loss-anddamage funding. Speaking about the release of the report, she said: "The impacts of climate inaction are claiming lives and livelihoods, displacing people from their homes, and millions are facing climaterelated starvation. "Loss and damage is becoming the priority and defining issue for COP27 ." Mr Clarken said Oxfam would be appealing to the Irish government to take a very clear and public stand on the issue. "Ireland has a real opportunity to show leadership by publicly supporting a loss-anddamage facility in the run-up to COP27 ," he said. "Ireland's political support to developing countries on this issue would send a hugely significant message among EU states. We must end this delay. The best time to start was 31 years ago, the next best time is now." "Since then, developed countries have used various tactics to delay any progress on the issue," the report says. It says the fossil fuel industry made enough profits from 2000 to 2019 to cover the costs of climate-induced losses in 55 of the most climate-vulnerable countries nearly 60 times over.

Hopes of limiting global warming to 1.5C have been described as being "on life support", despite a last-minute deal to compensate poorer countries on the frontline of climate disasters agreed at the Cop27 conference. Environment Minister Eamon Ryan called the deal "historic and progressive" but also conceded it is "not perfect". The UK government's representative at Cop27 , Alok Sharma, who also chaired Cop26, warned it wasn't a time for "unqualified celebration". It sees richer nations, for the first time, agree to help pay for the damage that the overheating world is inflicting on poor countries. However, despite agreeing to establish such a fund, key details were not pinned down, including who should pay into it. Other failures, including Cop27 's "weak language on fossil fuels", were highlighted by critics throughout the day, with Mr Sharma claiming that the target of limiting global warming to 1.5C is "on life support". Mr Sharma, in his closing remarks at the conference, pointed out numerous gaps in the agreement in terms of the overall temperature goal, emissions cutting, and the desire to target all fossil fuels for phase down. "We have had to battle to build on one of the key achievements of Glasgow." Mr Ryan, who took the lead as EU negotiator for the talks, said: "This new agreement will now mean that millions of people, whose land, water sources, and livelihoods are being eroded every day because of the impacts of climate change, can begin to look forward to targeted and strengthened support and protection from the global community." "What we have in front of us is not enough of a step forward for people and planet," said Frans Timmermans, executive vice-president of the European Commission. "It does not bring enough added efforts from major emitters to increase and accelerate their emissions cuts. We should have done much more." European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said Cop27 had "kept alive the goal of 1.5C" but hadn't delivered in many areas. Tr\'f3caire, meanwhile, said that the progress on Loss and Damage was a "bright spot in an otherwise underwhelming Cop". The organisation's head of policy and advocacy, Siobhan Curran, said: "After years of broken promises on climate finance, the failure to agree clear commitments for delivery is a let-down for communities facing the worst impacts of the climate crisis."

There has been a mixed reaction from Irish scientists following Cop27 , with praise for the deal on "loss and damage", but bitter disappointment over emissions reduction progress. The Irish contingent at the UN climate change summit in Egypt, led by Environment Minister Eamon Ryan and a team of civil servants, has been hailed across the board for taking a lead role in striking a deal on so-called loss and damage. Loss and damage - ostensibly richer countries paying a significant share to more vulnerable countries to compensate for the climate change-related disasters already occurring and which cannot be avoided even with defences - looked unlikely until the last minute at the Sharm-el-Sheikh event. The conference was due to finish on Friday, but negotiations continued into the early hours of Sunday when the deal was finally struck. However, the watering down of language surrounding fossil fuel usage in the future, and the influential role played by fossil fuel interests as a whole at Cop27 , had led to trenchant criticism from environmentalists who say that progress on the reduction of green house gas emissions, a major driver of global warming, was not nearly enough. Maynooth University professor of geography and climate change, Peter Thorne, told the Irish Examiner that the Cop27 event was a "mixed bag". "From a parochial viewpoint, we should be cheering the Irish delegation and Mr Ryan to the rafters. Their leadership of the EU team unlocked the loss and damage issue that has bedeviled the process for 30 years. That will be a lasting and enduring legacy in terms of recognising that those most impacted are those least responsible and that financial assistance must flow accordingly." However, nothing substantial happened on emissions, he warned. "There are still a handful of countries who are blocking the agreement that is patently obvious - that we need to rapidly phase down and ultimately phase out fossil fuel use, particularly so unabated fossil fuel use. "Equally, arguably the unprovoked war in Ukraine and its ramifications are accelerating a transition regardless. But it could be faster and we need greater honesty from the handful of states that are stopping this development." Student at UCC's Environmental Research Institue and environmental technologist, Rajas Shinde, who attended Cop27 , said the loss and damage deal seemed artificial in many ways. "While it is positive that an agreement was reached on the loss and damage fund in the end, it comes across as an insincere effort to get a token success story out of Cop27 ." "More delay gives an opportunity for the countries that obstructed the deal in the first place to prepare for ways to dampen the implementation of the fund," he added. Hopes for stronger language on keeping the 1.5C goal alive after Cop26 in Glasgow were let down, he said. A 1.5C temperature rise is considered the limit by scientists to avoid the very worst of climate change. Mr Shinde said: "There were neither increased ambitions set, nor the proposal for phasing out of all fossil fuels agreed upon to limit emissions which cause global warming. With this lack of urgency and stringent measures to take actions, the hopes of the most vulnerable and especially the youth are largely lost and damaged." \</doc>

Delegates from nearly 200 countries kicked off the UN climate summit in Egypt yesterday, with an agreement to discuss compensating poor nations for mounting damage linked to global warming, placing the topic on the agenda for the first time since climate talks began decades ago. The agreement set a constructive tone for the Cop27 summit in the seaside resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, where governments hope to keep alive a goal to avert the worst impacts of planetary warming as a slew of crises - from a land war in Europe to rampant inflation - distract the international focus. For more than a decade, wealthy nations have rejected discussions on what is referred to as loss and damage, the term used to describe rich nations paying to help poor countries cope with the consequences of global warming for which they bear little blame. At Cop26 last year in Glasgow, high-income nations including the US, and the EU blocked a proposal for a loss and damage financing body, instead supporting a three-year dialogue for funding discussions. Pressure to address the issue has been increasing as weather calamities mount, including floods in Pakistan that caused losses of over 30bn, and left hundreds of thousands homeless. "The inclusion of this agenda reflects a sense of solidarity for the victims of climate disasters," Cop27 He said the decision created "an institutionally stable space" for discussion of loss and damage, and the talks are intended to lead to a decision "no later than 2024". \</doc>

French President Emmanuel Macron has urged the United States, China and other non-European rich nations ahead of COP27 talks to pay their fair share to help poorer countries deal with climate change. "We need the United States and China to step up" on emissions cuts and financial aid, Mr Macron told French and African climate campaigners on the sidelines of the UN climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Stepping up financial aid to poorer countries that face the brunt of climate-induced disasters has emerged as a major issue at the 13-day climate conference that began yesterday. The heads of developing nations won a small victory when delegates agreed to put the controversial issue of money for "loss and damage" on the agenda. Nearly 100 heads of state and government will speak at the summit today and tomorrow, but China's President Xi Jinping is not attending the conference and US President Joe Biden will come later this week following Tuesday's US midterm elections. The summit comes as nations worldwide are facing increasingly intense natural disasters that have taken thousands of lives this year alone and cost billions of dollars. At the opening ceremony, COP27 officials urged governments to keep up efforts to combat climate change despite the economic crises linked to Russia's war on Ukraine, an energy crunch, soaring inflation and the persistent Covid-19 pandemic. "The fear is other priorities take precedence," top United Nations climate change official Simon Stiell told a news conference. The "fear is that we lose another day, another week, another month, another year - because we can't", he said. The world must slash greenhouse emissions 45% by 2030 to cap global warming at 1.5C above late-19th-century levels. But current trends would see carbon pollution increase 10% by the end of the decade and Earth's surface heat up 2.8C, according to findings unveiled in recent days. Only 29 of 194 countries have presented improved climate plans, as called for at the UN talks in Glasgow last year, Mr Stiell noted.

Another new leader, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, reversed a decision not to attend the talks and is due to urge countries to move "further and faster" in transitioning away from fossil fuels. Pakistan, which chairs the powerful G77+China negotiating bloc of more than 130 developing nations, has made the "loss and damage" issue a priority. "We definitely regard this as a success for the parties," said Egypt's Sameh Shoukry, who chairs the COP27 . The United States and the European Union have dragged their feet on the issue for years, fearing it would create an open-ended reparations framework. But European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans welcomed the inclusion of loss and damage, saying on social media that the "climate crisis has impacts beyond what vulnerable countries can shoulder alone". The promise is already two years past due and remains $17 billion short, according to the OECD. COP27 is scheduled to continue until 18 November with ministerial meetings. \</doc>

KEVIN O'SULLIVAN Ireland is falling short in its actions to avert "the gravest crisis facing humanity" and must step up its commitments to pay its fair share of the devastating costs of climate change, Tr\'f3caire has said. The overseas development agency said the Government must increase its commitments at Cop27 on the issue of loss and damage finance to support countries experiencing the inevitable impacts of climate disruption - an issue set to dominate at the "African Cop" in Egypt. Tr\'f3caire called on Ireland to show leadership by following Denmark and Scotland, who are among the first wealthy countries to commit to loss and damage finance. Successive droughts Cop27 and a key demand for civil society and developing countries". Meanwhile, delegations from across vulnerable country blocs including African states, which will negotiate together at Cop27 , have set out a six-point roadmap in an effort to ensure Cop27 is a success. It covers loss and damage, climate finance, increasing adaptation funding and enhancing mitigation efforts to contain global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. Tr\'f3caire said agreeing to a finance facility was a matter of climate justice, while climate finance needed to be in line with the needs of developing countries and to be "new and transparent, and additional to any future increases in overseas development assistance". The Government should pledge support for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, it said - a move that is supported by the European Parliament. "Current targets set by Government must represent the absolute floor of our ambition and significantly ramping up efforts over the coming years will be crucial if Ireland is to meet its fair share of the global climate mitigation effort," said Siobh\'e1n Curran, head of policy and advocacy at Tr\'f3caire. While Ireland's Climate Act had set out a target of reducing carbon emissions by 51 per cent by 2030, "we remain the third highest emitters per capita in the EU", she said. " Cop27 offers Ireland the opportunity to lead by example: to take responsibility for its role in contributing towards the emissions that are spurring climate breakdown, and to work to advance climate justice. It also offers Ireland the chance to champion the voices of those most impacted, particularly grassroots women who face barriers to participate meaningfully in these negotiations and in climate decisions affecting their lives," she said. African group of negotiators chair Ephraim Mwepya Shitima said Africa contributed least to global warming - generating less than 4 per cent of global emissions - and yet was the most adversely impacted. "Africa is already experiencing severe and widespread impacts of climate change causing devastation to lives, livelihoods and the continent's development trajectory. And this is a clear manifestation of climate injustice," he said. There were high expectations "the African Cop" would deliver substantive progress and implementable climate actions on priority issues for Africa and other developing countries, he said, "with the ultimate aim of correcting the injustice and getting the world on a path to a secure and safe climate future." Chairwoman of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) group Madeleine Diouf Sarr, said: "Since 2013 rich countries have recognised the need for loss and damage of climate change to be addressed but have dragged their feet ever since. But the momentum is building and it's becoming clear that no one can stand in the way of this issue being properly addressed. An African Cop is the ideal place to see the creation of a loss and damage fund so that the poorest and most vulnerable people can get the help they deserve." Egypt's chief climate negotiator Mohamed Nasr said: "The world faces many challenges right now, not least [the] food and energy crisis. But the climate crisis cannot be ignored, it continues to devastate lives and livelihoods of the poorest people and without swift and substantial action, things will only get worse. Covid-19 and this year's geopolitical challenges have seen nations coming together to provide support for those in need. Cop27 offers a chance to do the same for the victims on the front line of the climate emergency." Separate analysis by the World Health Organisation published on Thursday found the number of reported disease outbreaks and climate-related health emergencies in the greater Horn of Africa have reached their highest level this century, deepening a health crisis in a region where 47 million people are already facing hunger. \</doc>

At the HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/news/2022/1106/1333447-cop27/ COP 27 conference in Egypt The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) produces reports roughly every five years that represent global scientific consensus on climate change, its causes and its impact. Last year's report tackled the main drivers of global warming and the core elements of climate science. That was followed by two major reports this year - HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/news/environment/2022/0214/1280689-climate-change-report/ one in February addressing how the world will need to adapt to climate impacts, from rising seas to dwindling wildlife, and another HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/documents/news/2022/11/ipcc-ar6-wgiii-full-report.pdf in April on ways for "mitigating" or reining in climate-warming emissions. Key takeaways from those reports: THE SCIENCE REPORT Last year's report on the physical basis for climate change pulled no punches, stating unequivocally that humans are to blame for rising temperatures. It also warned that climate change was already dangerously close to spinning out of control. Once-rare weather extremes are becoming more common, and some regions are more vulnerable than others. For the first time, the report's authors called for urgent action to curb methane. Up to this point, the IPCC had focused on only carbon dioxide, the most abundant greenhouse gas. With time running out for preventing runaway climate change, the authors said it was worth looking into the benefits and drawbacks of geoengineering, or large-scale interventions to shift the climate, such as injecting particles into the atmosphere to block out solar radiation. The report warned the world's nations, including the wealthy ones, that everyone needed to start preparing for climate impacts and adapting to a warmer world. THE ADAPTATION REPORT With climate change already fueling extreme weather worldwide, the report urged rich and poor countries alike to adapt now to impacts including more frequent heatwaves, stronger storms and higher sea levels. The report made clear that different regions face different risks and impacts, and offered localised projections for what to expect. Millions of people face poverty and food insecurity incoming years, as climate change hits crops and water supplies and threatens to disrupt trade and labor markets. The daunting forecast for the world's poor reignited calls for a "Loss and Damage" fund through which rich nations would compensate costs already being incurred by poor countries in climate-fuelled disasters - a key demand by vulnerable countries going into the COP27 talks in Egypt. THE MITIGATION REPORT It's "now or never," one report co-chair said in releasing findings that show that only drastic emissions cuts in the next few decades would keep warming from spiraling out of control. The report teased out how various emissions scenarios would likely translate into future temperature rise. Cities are a big part of the emissions problem, it said, but also a major source of hope and positive solutions. The energy transition to renewable sources and clean-burning fuels is moving too slowly. The report went beyond focusing on fossil fuels and manufacturing to urge strong climate action in agriculture, where farming methods and better forest protection could help curb emissions. It warned that climate change threatens economic growth, and for the first time highlighted the need for action at the individual level, calling on governments to pass policies toward changing consumer and transportation habits to encourage less waste and more efficiency. \</doc>

ACTIVISTS HIGHLIGHT IRELAND'S FAMINE HISTORY AS THEY CALL FOR CLIMATE ACTION By David Young, PA Campaigners held a protest at the Irish Famine Memorial statues in Dublin during the Global Day Of Climate Action. The action was organised as governments continue to debate how they tackle global warming at the Cop27 The event at Custom House Quay was organised by the Stop Climate Chaos coalition. Campaigners appealed to the Irish government to stand with countries such as Somalia and Ethiopia that are experiencing food shortages brought on by the effects of climate change. Siobhan Curran, the head of policy and advocacy at Stop Climate Chaos member organisation Trocaire, said: ``Given our history of colonisation and famine, we have a unique opportunity to show solidarity with some of the poorest countries in the world who are experiencing massive losses and damage due to the climate crisis. ``They cannot be left to pay the price for a crisis not of their making. ``This is why we are calling for Ireland to stand with communities of the global south - it's time to answer their calls for a loss and damage finance facility to help deal with the climate impacts that have been caused by the emissions of rich countries like Ireland.'' Simon Murtagh, of Oxfam Ireland, added: ``It is urgent that Ireland expresses its support for the establishment of an international loss and damage finance facility without delay. ``The time for quiet diplomacy is over and, as the Taoiseach learned at Cop27 this week, 2.1 million people in Pakistan have lost their homes and are now living under the open sky with no source of food and water. There is no time for further delay.'' Christian Aid Ireland's policy and advocacy officer Ross Fitzpatrick said the issue of loss and damage goes to the very heart of climate justice. ``Developing countries cannot be left to pick up the tab and be expected to pay for the huge costs of environmental disasters caused by a climate crisis they did least to create,'' he said. ``Wealthy, polluting countries must use Cop27 as the moment to make good on their ecological debt and commit to providing new and additional funding for loss and damage.'' Karol Balfe, chief executive of ActionAid Ireland, said: ``Communities and countries on the front lines of climate change are pinning their hopes on Cop27 to deliver the help they urgently need to recover from disasters. ``As the climate crisis escalates, a new UN funding facility to cover the losses and damages caused by floods, droughts, and cyclones would be a game-changer in helping vulnerable countries to avoid deepening debt and poverty. ``It is shocking that after decades of climate negotiations, there is still no financial support provided to countries harmed by climate change. ``The cost of inaction has a detrimental impact on the lives of women and girls being affected for years, decades and even generations to come.'' Stop Climate Chaos policy co-ordinator Dr Brid Walsh added: ``The vast majority of loss and damage has been caused by the emissions of rich countries in the global north who are responsible for 92% of excess emissions. ``At Cop27 countries should significantly ramp up climate finance flows to support poorer countries to cope with the impact of rising global temperatures. ``Ireland needs to do the same, and this finance should be new and additional to existing funding.'' end \</doc>

Brazil's President-elect Luiz Ignacio Lula De Silva is the climate action equivalent of a global rock star. That much was made clear by the highly enthusiastic reception he received and the excitement he engendered on his first public outing at COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh last evening. Between Heads of State and high-ranking national representatives about 110 global leaders delivered national climate action statements at COP27 since the start of last week. But none of them, not even US President Joe Biden with his strong climate credentials, came anywhere close to the enthusiastic reception Lula got from delegates, observers, and non-government organisations here at Sharm El Sheikh. Lula doesn't take over as President in Brazil until sometime during January. So, he didn\' t come to COP27 to deliver a Brazil\' s National Climate Statement. Instead, to a packed audience, spontaneous outbursts of "Ole, Ole, Ole", and several rounds of applause throughout, he delivered a speech setting out what he stands for, what his election means for climate action in Brazil, and what he intends to do. The destruction of large tracts of the 1.3-billion-acre Amazon rainforest - the so-called lungs of the world - under Brazil\' s outgrowing President Jair Bolsonaro over the past four years had horrified and distressed environmentalists and was a huge setback for the global fight against climate chaos. Now all that is about to change. "I am here to say that Brazil is ready to re-join efforts to build a healthier planet." Lula told the audience. He went on to say the following: He will prioritise action to stop deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. Climate change will have the highest profile in his government. He will strengthen and recreate the environmental oversight and monitoring systems, dismantled by Bolsonaro over the past four years. There is no climate security for the world unless the Amazon rainforest is protected. He is proposing an Amazon Co-operation Treaty Conference to work with neighbouring countries on protecting the rainforest. Brazil is back to co-operate on Climate investments, including investments with Africa. A compensation fund is urgently needed for developing countries impacted by climate disasters. Wealthy nations must deliver on their pledge to provide $100 billion per year in Climate Finance. Brazil under his leadership, will aim to host COP30 in three years' time (2025) at a venue in the Amazon rainforest. He will ensure that Climate is top of the agenda when Brazil hosts the G20 meeting in 2024. He will create a Ministry of Indigenous People. The world has been ignoring the warnings about climate change while spending trillions of dollars on war.

It's not what you'd associate with a summit aimed at preventing the end of the world as we know it, but in hushed tones among attendees heading to Cop27 , the question is being asked: are you bringing a swimsuit? It would be a pity not HYPERLINK http://www.to.Be www.to.Be it ever so humble, every hotel, apartment and spare room in the host Egyptian resort of Sharm El-Sheikh seems to have a pool or a pathway leading hypnotically to the turquoise waters of the Red Sea. Perfect for soaking away the stress of hectic rounds of high-stakes international climate negotiations in temperatures tipping 30 degrees. But oh dear, the optics. How would it look to have delegates cooling off in pools when, just two countries down on the African continent, people are dying from drought? What dictates that an entire no-expensespared resort city for wealthy white tourists can be built on the edge of a desert, when there is apparently no money to save countless communities across the continent from climate disasters? How can the hot sun be celebrated in beach bars and pool chairs when the heating Earth is slowly being baked alive? Sharm El Sheikh can't help but bring the unfairness of climate change into sharp focus. Maybe it's a good thing that the split is so clearly illustrated. Delegates from poor countries of the global south have made it clear that they want this Cop to address head-on the inequalities that climate change causes and amplifies. They want countries that industrialised and grew wealthy using fossil fuels to pay for 'loss and damage' incurred by countries that left their fuels in the ground, remained underdeveloped - and for their troubles are now suffering the worst impacts of climate change. Wealthy countries are terrified about this. It puts them in the role of villain, requiring them to admit they did something wrong and must pay reparations. They prefer the self-appointed role of magnanimous benefactor, moved by charitable concern for the plight of their unlucky neighbours to whom they throw some spare change from time to time. Tentative progress was made on the issue at Cop26 in Glasgow last year, if agreeing to talk about it may be classed as progress. If you looked at the agenda for Cop27 up to this weekend, you'd have thought the 'Glasgow Dialogue' (as the talks process was called) was a huge success, as loss and damage were not even up for discussion. You'd have thought wrong. The agenda is likely to change by the time it is finalised today, however, as numerous countries - from both sides of the luck divide - say loss and dam- age must feature large. It is hard to say on what further headway will be made. It's been a tough year in the global north after all, what with the war in Ukraine and fears of energy shortages and inflation going mad. Some countries even had to find money to fund electricity credits for holiday homes. Those excuses won't wash with the nations of the global south. For them, every year is a tough year - with climate change exacerbating conflict, energy security a pipe dream, and the answer to recurrent cost-of-living crises often simply being death. Yet if loss and damage does get the prominence at the summit that many commentators expect, it will be hard to consider that a success - as it is really a symbol of failure to get to grips with the climate crisis. On that core issue, Cop27 has enormous work to do. Of 197 countries signed up to the Cop process, just 24 revised their national emission reduction targets as requested in Glasgow and submitted pledges with higher ambitions. The Chinese president and Indian prime minister, heads of the world's two largest emitters, will not be among the 125 or so world leaders who have agreed to attend in person. If all countries were to hit their targets as they now stand - and that is very doubtful - the collective effort would not be enough to slow global temperature rise and stop climate change escalating. That, ultimately, is what Cop27 needs to hammer home - because there is still complacency in the lucky global north about what an out-of-control climate will do. As the revised saying goes, we're not all in the same boat, we're in the same storm. It's not blowing evenly everywhere - but eventually even those venturing out in swimsuits will need to look for lifejackets.  Colin Murphy, page 27 Q How likely, if at all, do you think it is that the Cop27 summit beginning in Egypt today will result in significant action to tackle climate change? \</doc>

Coca-Cola is sponsoring Cop27 , this year's global climate conference. Last year, Coca-Cola produced 5.17 million metric tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. That tells you quite a lot about Cop27 - namely that it is often a frustrating pretence where the world's worst climate offenders talk a lot and act very little. Let's not mention the impact of thousands of people flying to Egypt for the event. In fact, it could be argued that, far from solving the climate crisis, it provides cover for the status quo, to na- tions and corporations, to engage in greenwashing, distraction and delay. The Irish Government attends Cop27 in force. This year, both Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin and Environment Minister Eamon Ryan are addressing the assembled delegates. Once climate laggards, we have just adopted an ambitious climate bill. We are investing in renewables and retrofitting. Why lend our new-found bona fides to those for whom Cop27 is merely an annual theatre event, while business as usual proceeds for the rest of the year? Ireland is right to show up and show our worth. We know Cop27 will produce some movement on climate globally, however inadequate. Last year, 190 countries agreed to phase down coal power, resulting in a 76pc decrease in planned new coal power output. Crucially, we perhaps underestimated the impact on our home turf. The debate on climate change in Ireland continues to be fraught and runs over similar ground time and time again: is the science there to support action? Is Ireland too small to make a difference? Aren't large corporations mostly to blame? Surely climate change is inevitable so we should focus on adapting over anything else. Would warmer weather really be so bad? Many of those queries are valid and prescient, and are worth unpacking. Can we rely on the science of the climate crisis? The big questions around the human role in global temperature rises over the last decades and in the decades to come do enjoy scientific consensus. That said, as much as we like to believe all scientific discourse is objective, we know a small number of scientists receive industry funding that may cloud that objectivity. We need look no further than the recent Teagasc event on the societal role of meat to watch a state agency financially back its preferred narrative. At its most basic, the resulting Dublin Declaration made no significant differentiation between the value of high emissions beef, for example, as opposed to the far-more-modest carbon cost of chicken and eggs. It is a low for an organisation built on the quality of its research and not helpful to an industry that needs to face its challenges with candour and practicality. Can any work Ireland achieves on climate be meaningful overall? Ireland is a small country. However, the idea that we are too small to make a difference has given us permission to be climate laggards for years. Ultimately, every state and province in the world will experience the impacts of climate change. To insist that, no, it's others who need to change and adapt, is short-sighted. Are large corporations mostly to blame for climate emissions? They most certainly are, but all the products and services they produce are ultimately consumed by individuals who vote governments into place and who, in turn, create favourable business and tax regimes for those same corporations. Governments repeatedly fail to enforce waste and pollution laws on those corporations, and allow them circumvent labour rights and safety protocols. The list of infractions from big business against the environment is endless but it cannot be divorced from our own behaviours. Why bother fighting climate change? Should we simply adapt? The unpalatable truth now is we will not hold back climate change. It is already all around us and therefore adaptation will have to form a large part of our response. We have seen the environmentally disastrous attempts by the OPW to control our rivers as a result of increasing levels of flooding. Largely making things worse rather than better, these engineering solutions to climate change also fail to include consideration of more intangible impacts - like that of species collapse. I'm sure none of us want to know what a world adapted to exist without bees and birds feels like. There is no upside to climate change, although there are many benefits to climate action. You can't tell people who fail to access flood insurance or who are struggling with a fodder shortage that Ireland's weather becoming warmer and less predictable is nothing to worry about. So we dutifully file along to Cop27 , make our speeches and hope for the best. Neasa Hourigan is the Green Party TD for Dublin Central \</doc>

Political leaders from around the globe have a ``special responsibility'' to urgently drive the transformation needed to tackle climate change, Taoiseach Micheal Martin has said. He made the comments as he prepares to attend the Cop27 UN climate talks in Egypt. The climate change conference takes place in Sharm El-Sheikh this week. Mr Martin will attend the event as well as Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications Eamon Ryan, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Minister of State for Overseas Development Aid and Diaspora Colm Brophy. At the summit, the Taoiseach will participate in a number of high-level events and roundtables, including on food security and on the sustainability of vulnerable communities. He will join Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for a working breakfast on The Global Shield Against Climate Risks, a new initiative sponsored by the G7 and the V20 group of vulnerable countries aimed at scaling up the finance needed to protect against climate risks in poor countries. On Tuesday afternoon Mr Martin will deliver Ireland's national statement, setting out Ireland's climate ambition, and the Government's commitment to supporting vulnerable countries who, despite having contributed least to climate change, are bearing the brunt of its impact. He will also have a number of bilateral meetings with fellow leaders in the margins. Cop27 Delegates will seek to make progress on addressing the loss and damage caused by climate change, and on increasing funding for climate resilience. Speaking ahead of the summit, the Taoiseach said: ``Climate change is the single greatest challenge the world faces. ``Its effects are already being felt in more extreme weather events, and its consequences are fuelling conflict, global instability, competition for resources and abject human misery in some of the world's poorest countries. ``Political leaders meeting at Cop27 have a special responsibility to urgently drive the transformation needed to secure the sustainable future of our planet and its people. ``It is very clear that some of the countries that contributed least to climate change are bearing the worst brunt of its impacts. ``Many of these vulnerable countries lack the resources they need to deal with the challenges they face. ``I expect that climate finance will be a prominent issue in our discussions at the summit, and I hope that developed countries will step up, ensuring that commitments entered into at previous meetings are delivered.'' Mr Ryan said: ``The devastating effects of climate change are clear to all, with extreme weather events becoming ever more frequent across the world. We know we must act now to protect people and the planet, and it is vital that we act together. ``We have to move as hard and as fast as possible to reduce our emissions. Every kg of emissions saved matters at this stage. Cop27 is an opportunity to work together to keep commitments already made on track and to make further progress on net zero ambitions. ``Ireland is committed to reducing our emissions by 51% by 2030 and to reaching net zero emissions by 2050, as set out in the Climate Action Plan 2021. ``This year's successor to that plan, which we will publish in December, will emphasise the need to speed up measures to decarbonise our economy and move towards renewables. ``The scale of change we need to make is beyond compare but I am optimistic that we can do it and that we will play our part in ensuring that we have a greener, healthier, more prosperous globe to pass on to our children and their children.'' Mr Coveney said: ``2022 has been a year for devastating climate impacts. ``The deadly floods in Pakistan are just one recent example of why the decisions to be taken at Cop27 are so important. ``I am looking forward to visiting the conference on Wednesday to hold discussions with climate-vulnerable countries and with Ireland's partners to see what more Ireland can do to promote strong and rapid climate action.'' end \</doc>

RONAN McGREEVY Climate change activists blocked Molesworth Street in the centre of Dublin for a time yesterday and staged a protest outside the gates of D\'e1il \'c9ireann. Some 150 protesters accused the Government of hypocrisy and of doing little to change the fact that Ireland has the second highest emissions per person in the European Union. The protest was organised by four groups - Extinction Rebellion, Animal Rebellion, Fridays for Future and a group of students from Trinity College Dublin (TCD) - to coincide with Cop27 , which is taking place in Egypt. Many carried posters of clocks symbolising that the world is running out of time to deal with climate change. Among those taking part in the protest were secondary school students who have been protesting outside the D\'e1il every Friday for months. Flossie Donnelly (15), who attends St Andrew's College in Booterstown, Co Dublin, said she has attended 210 Fridays for Future demonstrations in a row, stretching back to when she was 11. She said many climate activists are frustrated at the lack of progress at successive Cop summits. "We want greenwashing to finally stop. Last year in Cop26 we had so many promises made and none of them have come through. Cop27 is just a greenwashing event and it is so disappointing." 'Walk the walk' Nathan Hutchinson (20), an environmental sciences student at TCD, drew a large cheer when he announced the Supreme Court had ruled the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between the European Union and Canada is unconstitutional. He said he was wrong to assume the Supreme Court would rule against the case brought by Green Party TD Patrick Costello. "It is a significant win and it shows what can be achieved when people work together." TCD associate professor at the school of psychology, Dr Clare Kelly, said the world is facing a "unique, historical moment", a last chance to deal with climate change before it is too late. She said Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin "talked the talk" at Cop27 , but there is "no evidence" he will walk the walk in bringing down Irish emissions. "Can you explain how being the second highest emitter of greenhouse gasses is consistent with doing everything in our power to ensure a sustainable planet?" \</doc>

M UCH of the talk at COP27 has been about 'loss and damage', and whether or not progress can be made on it. Here's what it's all about. What is loss and damage? It is the harm caused to countries by climate-related disasters. It can be a sudden event such as the huge floods in Pakistan, when water from rapidly melting mountain glaciers met unusually heavy rain and flooded a third of the country. It can also be a slow-onset occurrence such as sea-level rise swallowing coastal areas of South Pacific and Indian Ocean islands, or prolonged drought in the Horn of Africa. It also takes in losses that are hard to quantify - historic places or sacred spaces lost to the sea, or culture and traditions vanishing because communities are displaced or dispersed as climate refugees. Why is it on the COP27 agenda? Poor and developing countries have been pushing for nearly 30 years to have rich, developed nations pay for loss and damage. With COP27 taking place on African soil, their campaign gained strength and they finally got the issue into the formal talks. Why would rich countries pay poor countries for problems relating to climate change? Wealthy nations grew their economies on industry powered by fossil fuels. Their high-consumption lifestyles drive up fossil-fuel use further. Those same fossil fuels emit the greenhouse gases that are causing global warming and climate chaos. Some of the most severe impacts of climate change are experienced in poor countries and they have the least resources to cope with them. Don't rich nations already give money to poor countries to help with climate change? They provide limited amounts of money in two ways - for climate mitigation and climate adaptation. Mitigation means reducing emissions to prevent climate change escalating. Examples of how funding might be used are replacing diesel generators or solid-fuel cooking and heating with renewable energy, managing urban dumpsites to prevent methane emissions, or developing clean public transport. Adaptation means helping countries withstand climate change already happening. It might mean developing flood defences, replacing shanty-town homes with buildings that can protect against intense heat, or installing groundwater abstraction and irrigation systems for farming communities that can no longer rely on failing rains. Loss and damage refers to the effects of climate change that cannot be prevented or adapted to. How much would it cost? 'Climate Clock' - a collective of academics and NGOs working on climate change - say the current debt owed by the G20 (the 20 biggest economies plus the EU that together account for 80pc of global wealth) is $38 trillion ((EURO)36.8trn). For perspective, US military spending this year has a budget of $1.64trn. Would that settle the debt? No. The G77 (134 developing countries) pushing for lossand-damage funding want an open-ended fund established to deal with the future impacts of climate change. Climate Minister Eamon Ryan has pointed out that the more you mitigate, the less you have to adapt and the more you adapt, the less lossand-damage you have to pay. Where does the G20 stand? They're opposed to the G77's concept of a permanent, dedicated fund, fearing the scale of contribution they would be expected to provide indefinitely. They largely agree that loss and damage should be addressed but want to keep the wording of any commitments vague, push out action by a few years and provide funding under existing mitigation and adaptation programmes. Could wealthy countries use the fund? Under the current broad proposal by the G77, yes, and Ireland has a problem with that. It could, for example, mean China, which has huge wealth, although it is very unevenly distributed, claiming funds for flood damage in poorer regions. What might it cost Ireland? Working out the relative responsibility for climate damage by any given country is very complex. For perspective, we have a goal of increasing our overseas climate finance (for mitigation and adaptation) to (EURO)225m a year by 2025. At COP27 \</doc>

Environment Minister Eamon Ryan has hailed a "historic and progressive" deal reached at Cop27 and said that it will see millions of people whose "land, water sources and livelihoods are being eroded every day" offered greater protection. Mr Ryan was speaking after leaders at the climate conference reached the landmark Loss and Damage agreement at the conference in Egypt. It sees nations of the world, for the first time, agree to help pay for the damage that the overheating world is inflicting on poor countries. While charities welcomed the agreement, they also criticised the lack of progress in other areas with ActionAid saying that polluters had been "let off the hook" with Cop27 's "weak language on fossil fuels". Mr Ryan said the agreement would establish new funding arrangements to assist developing countries that are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. "Progress on broadening the contributor base to now include the potential for innovative sources of funding could open the way for a landmark break from traditional thinking," he said. "Such sources could potentially include sectors like aviation, shipping and the fossil fuel industry. "There is now scope for exploring the potential for financing and debt relief for especially vulnerable countries from multilateral and development banks." The Green Party leader maintained that the commitment to "Keep 1.5 alive", which refers to the objective to ensure global warming stays within a 1.5C increase above pre-industrial levels. Experts have warned that this essential measure is looking increasingly unlikely to achieve. Despite this break-through, the marathon talks at Cop27 did not manage to make further progress on a number of issues. As delegates approved the compensation fund, they also had not dealt with the contentious issues of an overall temperature goal, emissions cutting and the desire to target all fossil fuels for phase down. The package was revised again late Saturday night and into yesterday morning, removing most of the elements Europeans had objected to but added none of the heightened ambition they were hoping for. "What we have in front of us is not enough of a step forward for people and planet," a disappointed Frans Timmermans, executive vice president of the European Union, told his fellow negotiators. "It does not bring enough added efforts from major emitters to increase and accelerate their emissions cuts. "We have all fallen short in actions to avoid and minimise loss and damage," Mr Timmermans said. \</doc>

MAROS Sefcovic has suggested that UK-EU agreement on checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland could happen within weeks, with the right "political will". It comes as Rishi Sunak and Ursula von der Leyen agreed to "work together" to end the row over the Northern Ireland Protocol, when they met for the first time at Cop27 in Egypt. Mr Sefcovic, the European Commission vice-president and Brexit negotiator, made the comments in Westminster during a meeting of British and European parliamentarians. He said: "This is the area where we do not seek any political victory. We just want to solve the problem." Discussing EU proposals to reduce checks, he said: "Is it too much to do this? Can we not find pragmatic, technical solutions to make this thing work? I believe it could be done, if there is political will, I'm sure that we can sort it out really within a couple of weeks because really both sides of our negotiating teams we know these topics from all angles." Earlier, Mr Sefcovic told parliamentarians that he did not believe the EU and the UK were "worlds apart" on the protocol, as he warned that unilateral action by the Government would have "serious" consequences. Cop27 climate conference on Monday, with Mr Sunak stressing the need to "find solutions" to the "very real problems" caused by the post-Brexit arrangements in the region. The post-Brexit solution, designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, is cited as the Democratic Unionist Party's main reason for refusing to return to powersharing. The instability in Northern Ireland has raised concerns in Dublin, Brussels and Washington, and the row between the UK and the EU shows few signs of coming to a rapid conclusion, despite indications of a more positive tone from the British side in recent weeks. Ms von der Leyen called it a "good first meeting". "We face many challenges, from tackling climate change and the energy transition to Russia's war against Ukraine," she tweeted. She said she looked forward to "constructive co-operation" between the two countries. Cop27 summit, pages 14-15 \</doc>

Ireland was the second country in the world to declare that we are living in the midst of a climate emergency, which sounds rather impressive of us. In truth, the moment was more bizarre than historic - it happened during a poorly attended D\'e1il sitting on a dank Thursday evening, in May 2019. I was sitting in the media perch, overlooking the near empty chamber, as six TDs mulled over a Fianna F\'e1il amendment to a comprehensive Oireachtas Committee Report on Climate Action. The debate wrapped-up more quickly than anyone had expected and, at that juncture, there were no Fianna F\'e1il members in the chamber. An eagle-eyed Eamon Ryan, who was on the Opposition benches at the time, spotted his chance. The Green Party leader and Dublin Bay South TD put the motion which was then passed without opposition, and the session adjourned. It had happened in a flash. I scrambled to have a word with Deputy Ryan to be certain about what had just transpired, and caught-up with him as he crossed the plinth towards the bike rack near Kildare Street. Had we declared a climate emergency or not? I asked him. "We have " he replied, with a smile, "in our own Irish way." The news flashed around the world - Ireland had followed the United Kingdom in declaring a climate emergency. Climate action activist Greta Thunberg, then 16-years-old, was quick to tweet: "Great news from Ireland! Who is next?" She continued: "And remember: #ClimateEmergency means leaving fossil fuels in the ground." Completely? If yes, then by what date? And how does that square with the economic requirement to have a guaranteed energy supply which is relatively cheap? Those questions remain at the heart of the climate debate more than three years after that historic D\'e1il vote. It's the conundrum still confronting Mr Ryan who has traded his place on the Opposition benches for the position of Minister for Transport, Climate, Environment and Communications - with responsibility for energy policy. He knows the brief - he was previously Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, between 2007 and 2011. When Mr Ryan joined us on the RT\'c9 News Your Politics podcast last Wednesday, he had just left a Cabinet meeting which finalised the rules for the first ever sale of offshore wind development rights. "Our sea area is seven times our land area, and it happens to be the windiest place on the planet"/n The Minister hailed the decision as a "massive step forward" because the project had the potential to generate half of Ireland's daily electricity requirements, with more to come. He was bullish, given the incredible potential of our natural resources: "Our sea area is seven times our land area, and it happens to be the windiest place on the planet." Six areas off the east coast of Ireland, and one off the west, have now been designated for development but it will take five years before the green electricity will arrive. That begs the question - what do we do before reaching that green nirvana? Minister Ryan said the intermediate step, up to the end of this decade, will be the use of gas. He said: "We do need new gas fired stations to back-up that wind. You will have more gas stations, but using less gas, because you only use it when the wind isn\' t blowing." Mr Ryan is currently formulating a proposal to bring to Cabinet, following a public consultation. Brave new world There\' s a touch of science-fiction to it all - a brave new world where gas is replaced by green hydrogen generated from renewable sources. Time will tell. A more immediate concern is the government\' s plan to speedily expedite a gas storage facility on foot of the global energy disruption crisis triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Mr Ryan said it makes sense to have "an absolute cast-iron certainty" over our supply, but that did not entail the private sector. He told us: "That gas storage is not for commercial purposes. It\' s for security purposes. It\' s State controlled State led State regulated . to give you security in those circumstances." Last September, Shell pulled out of two offshore wind projects in the west of Ireland, operated by the Simply Blue Group - a year after the company acquired stakes in the developments. This time last year, the Norwegian giant Equinor walked away from a joint venture with the ESB, including a 1.5 gigawatt plan to generate electricity off the coasts of Clare and Kerry. "He's difficult to slow down as he breezes into open country, with a messianic glint in his eye, talking about how floating windmills the size of the chimneys at Moneypoint will be firing electricity into future interconnectors"/n Minister Ryan contended on our podcast, however, that change is a-comin\' . He said: "The Attorney General is going full steam, if you excuse the inappropriate metaphor, in changing and looking at our planning laws to ensure that we don\' t have an incredibly complicated planning system." Again, time will tell. Minister Ryan himself can be difficult to harness in an interview. At times, he\' s difficult to slow down as he breezes into open country, with a messianic glint in his eye, talking about how floating windmills the size of the chimneys at Moneypoint will be firing electricity into future interconnectors with France and the UK. At the same time, he can be precise when it comes to rejecting suggestions that liquified natural gas (LNG) can help. Fine Gael Minister of State, Patrick O\' Donovan, contends that an LNG terminal on the Shannon is essential if we are to avoid catastrophic electricity outages and economic damage. Minister Ryan would see this as a retrograde step: "Yes we will have storage; but it will not be the commercial LNG that people have been kind of promoting and promising." 'Massive imponderable' Energy targets are just one component of the government\' s legally binding Climate Action Plan which aims to reduce our emissions by 51% by the year 2030. The CAP was due to be updated to include sectoral emissions-ceilings, such as targets for agriculture, which were agreed after lengthy and sometimes fraught negotiations. It was due to be published this month but Minister Ryan said it would now be delayed until the middle of December as he wanted to get it right rather than rush it. The expectation had been that it would be published to coincide with the latest UN climate conference, which is underway, at Sharm el Sheikh in Egypt. Minister Ryan is on his way to COP 27 , (the 27th time that there has been a meeting of the Conference Of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). He will be operational in Sharm el Sheikh later today for what will be the second week of this annual climate jamboree, where the nitty-gritty of the negotiations are nailed down. On Tuesday, the Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin addressed the summit and declared: "If this generation doesn\' t step-up urgently, future generations will not forgive us." He\' s right. However, Minister Ryan was downplaying what might come out of COP27 . He said that last year\' s summit in Glasgow was more significant, even if the pace had been "tortuous and slow", as a complicated rule book regarding emissions had been signed-off. Minister Ryan felt the single most important outcome from COP27 would be to ensure there was a clear signal from the summit in Egypt that climate justice was central to the UN\' s global plan. That\' s part of the reason why Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney met the President of Somalia, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, for a bi-lateral discussion while in Sharm el Sheikh: he wanted to offer support to a country wracked by famine due to a climate related drought. 'Loss and Damage' The centrepiece of COP27 is a debate entitled "Loss and Damage." According to the UNFCCC, loss and damage includes extreme weather events but also slow onset events, such as sea level rise, increasing temperatures, ocean acidification and glacial retreat. Their logic is that the developed world must pay to offset these consequences, on the basis that it has emitted the greenhouse gases which are causing such horrendous damage to poorer countries. The Taoiseach, Miche\'e1l Martin, has already given a commitment that Ireland will back the plan, albeit that the \€ 10m flagged for the initiative will come from a pre-existing Climate Finance Fund. Minister Ryan said: "We need to act fast. We need to be part of a global solution which does put justice at its centre, and I think we\' re well placed to do that." Does this qualify as evidence that the world is adequately responding to a climate emergency? Not in the view of Greta Thunberg, who is staying away from Sharm el Sheikh. She tweeted to her 5,000,000 followers: "The people in power don\' t need conferences, treaties or agreements to start taking real climate action. "They can start today. When enough people come together then change will come and we can achieve almost anything. So instead of looking for hope - start creating it." A reminder: the people in power don't need conferences, treaties or agreements to start taking real climate action. They can start today.When enough people come together then change will come and we can achieve almost anything. So instead of looking for hope - start creating it./n Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg/status/1460159146720997377 November 15, 2021 When COP27 wraps-up, most likely with a deal, Minister Ryan will be back in the D\'e1il outlining his updated Climate Action Plan. Will the words match the deeds? If Ireland truly believes there is a climate emergency, it should be self-evident given we're now three years on from the original declaration. \</doc>

Cop27 is likely to see highly contentious negotiations between countries on the topic of "loss and damage". This summit is an opportunity for representatives from poor and vulnerable countries to confront leaders of rich, high-emitting countries to demand actions to address the injustice of climate change. Climate change is already irreparablydamagingpeople and nature, through floods, extreme heat, food insecurity and rising sea levels. Climate change is shockingly unfair - the damages are concentrated in poor and vulnerable countries, particularly the least-developed countries and low-lying island states, who are least responsible for causing it. Developed countries that enjoy the benefits of fossilfuel-based industrialisation and are less vulnerable to climate change are mainly culpable. Europe, for example, with only 6% of the global population, has been deforesting and burning fossil fuels since the industrial revolution, and is responsible for 22% of the excess carbon in the atmosphere, whereas the whole continent of Africa, with more than twice the population, is responsible for only 3% of global warming. Moreover, access to modern energy is hugely unequal. Three billion people live in countries whose per-capita electricity consumption is lower than the typical American fridge. Despite our small size, Ireland punches above our weight in terms of our impact on global warming. As the EU's second-highest per-capita emitter of greenhouse gases, if every country in the world had emitted as we do, the world would already have heated by a catastrophic 3C instead of 1.2C. To address this injustice, developing countries are demanding a firm financial mechanism for this "loss and damage" to funnel financial compensation from rich countries following disasters and losses caused by climate change. Developed countries will not easily admit liability. The best outcome we can hope for at these talks is a firm agreement on a financial mechanism to direct money on an ongoing basis to compensate for damage caused by climate change, as well as financial commitments to allow developing countries to decarbonise and adapt. Scotland and Denmark have been at the forefront so far, committing tens of millions of euros to climate justice and loss and damage funds. While this is a drop in the ocean relative to what will be necessary, it demonstrates the value of small, developed countries in diplomacy and leadership, an arena in which Ireland should use its valuable influence.

Environment Minister Eamon Ryan has said that business in highly polluting sectors - including aviation, shipping and fossil fuels - should be contributing more to tackle climate change. Mr Ryan also called for the reform of international financial institutions to allow developing countries access to better finance. He said there should be less spending on "mega super yachts" and more funding pumped into the basic provisions for people living in countries adversely effected by climate change. His comments came after he returned from the Cop27 conference in Egypt. Mr Ryan, the EU's lead negotiator in loss and damage talks at the climate summit, said the momentum is increasing for climate action. He said the last-minute deal at Cop27 will protect the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Mr Ryan said there is now more widespread support for the aviation and fossil fuels sector taking on part of the bill to address damage caused by climate change. "This is not easy - the aviation sector in general, because it's transboundary, doesn't pay the same taxes as other sectors on the likes of fuel, same as shipping. "The oil and gas sector, to take that one example, this year will make $3.9tn in net income, which is twice what it did last year, twice. Our message, and when I say our I mean European Union, is that we should be looking for contributions from those sectors. This will not be easy to do because tax is a national competency. But there is now 200 countries agreeing for us to look at how we could do it." \</doc>

Glaciers at many UNESCO World Heritage sites including Yellowstone and Kilimanjaro National Park will likely vanish by 2050, the UN agency has warned, urging leaders to act fast to save the rest. The warning followed a study of 18,600 glaciers at 50 World Heritage sites, covering around 66,000 sq/km, which found glaciers at a third of the sites were "condemned to disappear". The study "shows these glaciers have been retreating at an accelerated rate since 2000 due to CO2 emissions, which are warming temperatures", UNESCO said. The glaciers were losing 58 billion tonnes of ice every year, equivalent to the combined annual water use of France and Spain, and were responsible for nearly 5% of observed global sea-level rise, the agency explained. "But it is still possible to save the glaciers in the remaining two thirds of sites if the rise in temperatures does not exceed 1.5\'b0C compared to the pre-industrial period." Countries have pledged to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels -- a goal the world is set to miss on current emission trends. "This report is a call to action," said UNESCO head Audrey Azoulay, ahead of the COP27 climate summit in Egypt starting on Monday. "Only a rapid reduction in our CO2 emissions levels can save glaciers and the exceptional biodiversity that depends on them. COP27 will have a crucial role to help find solutions to this issue." In Africa, glaciers in all World Heritage sites will very likely be gone by 2050, including at Kilimanjaro National Park and Mount Kenya, UNESCO warned. In Europe, some glaciers in the Pyrenees and in the Dolomites will also probably have vanished in three decades' time. The same went for glaciers in the Yellowstone and Yosemite national parks in the United States. The melting of ice and snow is one of the ten key threats from climate change, an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report published in February said.

"In high latitudes, like near the Arctic, temperatures are warming faster than in regions near the Equator in a phenomenon known as Arctic amplication," Mr Silva said. Speaking on RT\'c9's Morning Ireland, he said people must be optimistic about the upcoming COP27 climate conference and it is now up to countries to take action based on the World Meteorologcal Organisation's recent report. \</doc>

Has business had it with net zero? Larry Fink, the boss of BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm, came to Glasgow and later predicted that every company and industry would be "transformed by the transition to a net zero world". One year on at Cop27 , in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, things looked very different. Corporate net zero vows had ballooned so much that more than a third of the largest companies now had one. But a lack of robust rules had left "loopholes wide enough to drive a diesel truck through", said UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres. Catherine McKenna, Canada's former environment minister, told Cop27 that too many pledges were "little more than empty slogans and hype". She chairs a group of experts the UN appointed to assess the mushrooming net zero promises from companies, cities and regions. And a bracing report the group released at Cop27 concluded "dishonest climate accounting" had to stop. That meant companies could not claim to be net zero while continuing to build or finance new supplies of fossil fuels. Instead of relying on cheap and often dodgy carbon credits to offset their carbon pollution, firms should focus on cutting their own emissions, including those generated by users of their products or services. Climate policies They should base their net zero plans on absolute emissions reductions, not lower carbon intensity, or emissions per unit of output. They shouldn't lobby against government climate policies and they should report annually on their decarbonising progress in disclosures that governments should make mandatory. This advice is in line with the need to nearly halve global emissions by 2030 to meet the Paris agreement's goal to keep temperatures at safer levels. So it was widely applauded at Cop27 , with one vivid exception. A lot of business executives were incensed. Some, especially those from the US, were used to hearing their net zero plans branded too weak (by climate campaigners) or too harsh and "woke" (by some politicians) or too legally fraught (by lawyers). But the UN message was painful, especially for sustainability executives who had spent years persuading sceptical bosses to make a net zero pledge in the first place. Internal support Here's a flavour of what I heard: some executives felt "exhausted and demoralised" at the idea of needing to win yet more internal support for onerous UN-backed rules. Others said it was "ludicrous" for the UN to back, say, mandatory disclosure of net zero plans that did not exist in many member countries. And did the UN even have the right to campaign for such rules "like an NGO"? It is important to say green energy businesses had very different views. The UN report delivered an "important cat among the pigeons", says Ben Backwell, chief executive of the Global Wind Energy Council. But others are asking if the report could unintentionally stall the growth of corporate net zero vows, says Huw van Steenis, a partner at the Oliver Wyman management consultancy who is steeped in corporate climate policymaking. This is possible. A South Pole climate consultancy survey of more than 1,200 large companies found a quarter did not plan to publicise their net zero achievements "beyond the bare minimum". The exact cause of this so-called green-hushing is unclear and worried South Pole. But it is also entirely predictable. Trying to cut emissions to nearly zero was always going to cause problems for businesses as the world enters the uncharted territory of trying to transform an energy system dominated by fossil fuels in a matter of years, not decades. The shift was bound to be messy and difficult, and it has only just begun. Stand by for much deeper disarray - especially if the net zero effort fails and emissions stay at the dangerous levels they are at today. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022 \</doc>

Greta's not going; neither is Prince Charles, China's Xi Jinping nor India's Narendra Modi. The red carpet at this year's Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Egypt will be decidedly threadbare this year as leaders of key global states snub the summit. Prospects for any kind of breakthrough remain slim, with observers forecasting anything from a diplomatic disaster over loss and damage, to a best-case scenario of a modest breakthrough on climate finance. None of this will seem like the appropriate reaction to the extreme weather events of 2022. If you are following the science and reading the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), you are probably terrified. You should be. There has been enough information about the risks of climate disaster to justify a swift and determined response by the international community for decades. But so far, progress has been incremental at best, and confined to policy commitments rather than actual emission reductions on the scale that is needed. And physics won't wait for us to catch up: climate-related disasters are happening everywhere with increasing severity and frequency. While Europe has seen extreme weather, it is countries in the global South that have experienced the worst impacts, with thousands dead due to record flooding in Pakistan, Nigeria and South Africa this year, and millions at risk of starvation in the Horn of Africa. It is only going to get worse: climate-induced disasters will bring about irrecoverable losses, civil conflict, food insecurity and forced migration on a scale we have yet to contemplate. Losing interest Yet at a time when we need a concerted and decisive global response to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support vulnerable developing countries, the G20 states are losing interest, and focusing their attention elsewhere. The US-China climate diplomacy has stalled, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine has caused an energy crisis across Europe. Global tensions are being used to justify new fossil fuel licencing and exploration, despite warnings from the International Energy Agency that no new fossil developments can be permitted if the world is to stay below 1.5 degrees. Decision-making is painfully bogged down by the strategically ambiguous language of the Paris Accord, consensus procedures, and spillover effects from other geopolitical agendas. The absence of "first mover" initiatives from the largest emitting nations - principally the US and China - makes it hard to generate momentum for action anywhere else. Anyone tuning into the COP live stream from Egypt next week will be shocked at the lack of urgency, the deference to tedious work programmes with more acronyms than actions, and the pettiness of powerful states and big emitters. Most developed countries, including Ireland, still seek to protect their chief exports from what are perceived as costly trade barriers. According to the Climate Action Tracker website, as of September 2022, not a single country is compliant with the Paris Agreement. The vast majority of OECD member states are categorised as "highly insufficient" or "insufficient" in their responses. The EU is not on track to meet its commitment as part of the global methane pledge signed at Glasgow COP26 last year, and Ireland's record is still woefully slow and inadequate. Yet the international climate regime, for all its faults, is still the only show in town. Global cooperation is essential to address a problem that, by its very nature, has incentives for individual states to free-ride or default on their commitments. It is also the only forum in which developing and vulnerable nations can leverage influence to ensure that the promises made in relation to climate finance are fulfilled, and that there is equity and fairness in the transition away from fossil fuels. It is not surprising therefore that the issue of loss and damage will loom large at this COP. Eighty per cent of all GHGs come from G20 countries and just 4 per cent of cumulative emissions came from the entire continent of Africa. If there is to be fairness in the climate regime it must acknowledge both historical responsibility and ultimately liability for climate damages. There is still no global financial facility that is specifically earmarked for this purpose, and big historical emitters are fiercely resisting any definition of loss and damage that might expose them to compensation claims in the future. Big shift What needs to be done? Reducing global emissions to 'net zero' by the middle of the century in turn demands ending the world's reliance on fossil fuels as soon as possible. There is an overwhelming case for introducing a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty as a protocol to the UNFCCC. Because we didn't act sooner, the emissions reductions required by developed countries are now in the order of 10-20 per cent per year, once equity is taken into account. That means scaling up existing plans and policies in a transformative, system-wide mobilisation of society and in all sectors of the economy. It won't be easy, but it is necessary. However, even a "bad" COP is not the end of the world. Close observers of the international process argue that climate action will always be messy and bottom-up in practice. International diplomacy may not deliver a concrete plan of action, but there are welcome signs of a big shift towards renewable energy penetration, a peaking in fossil fuel use and new partnerships and alliances for climate action that reach across territorial and sectoral boundaries. Climate action is supported by a strong majority of the Irish public in all surveys and opinion polls. Climate action will not happen because the UN forces our governments to do it. It is up to us, as free citizens in a country that permits freedom of expression, organisation, and protest to insist that our governments live up to their promises, implement their own laws, and deliver climate action on the ground. A strong climate movement is the key to unlocking political will. We should all be part of it, because all of our futures depend on its success.

They were stark words, warning of the clear and present danger of a new enemy facing the world, seen and unseen in equal measure. "What we are now doing to the world, by degrading the land surfaces, by polluting the waters, and by adding greenhouse gases to the air at an unprecedented rate, all this is new in the experience of the Earth. It is mankind and his activities which are changing the environment of our planet in damaging and dangerous ways," she said. She was referring to the "prospect of irretrievable damage to the atmosphere, to the oceans, to Earth itself", the "menacing" and "insidious danger" of global warming and climate change. What hysterical globalist -agenda tripe, the climate-change naysayers would say, reading these words. They undoubtedly were uttered by leftists like Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg or Ugandan climate-justice activist Vanessa Nakate. Those naysayers would be wrong. The words were those of the so-called Iron Lady, the darling of both the intellectual and populist right, Margaret Thatcher, at the UN in 1989. The champion of unfettered free markets, capitalism, and lax regulation was on board with trying to save the world's population from the ravages of climate change 33 years ago, but here we are at the 27th iteration of the Conference of the Parties (Cop) in Egypt, still way off target when it comes to a global consensus on what needs to be done to stave off the worst. You would think that mass wildfires, droughts, floods, and heatwaves as a now regular occurrence in the world's richest economies would be enough to call a halt to the worst excesses of fossil-fuel reliance, but greenhouse gas emissions are still rising, hitting record levels in 2021, and set to do something similar in 2022. If we think we have it bad in the wealthiest nations and political blocs such as the EU, we don't know how good we have it compared to small island nations and vulnerable countries that take battering after battering from relentless extremes of weather. Talk in political, scientific, and business circles is that the Cop27 event in Sharm-elSheikh will have less political razzmatazz than Cop26 in Glasgow, when Boris Johnson took centre stage to latch onto the likes of David Attenborough to say all the right things about the urgency of climate change. The Egypt event will be more workmanlike, policy-driven, evidence-led, and firmer in executing targets. In other words, there was a lot of lofty language in Glasgow, but now it is time for implementation and putting plans into real action after Sharm-el-Sheikh. The jury is out on that one. The week before Cop27 started, new British prime minister Rishi Sunak indicated he would give Egypt a skip because he had more pressing issues at home. Encouragingly, the political realisation that he would look rather silly if he was not in attendance seemed to focus the mind that this event is indeed consequential, or at least it should be. According to website Carbon Brief, there is "mounting pressure on developed countries to provide more climate finance, after they failed to hit the $ 100bn target originally set for 2020". These calls come alongside a push for a new finance facility to fund the loss and damage resulting from climate change, Carbon Brief adds. The UN defines climate finance as "local, national or transnational financing - drawn from public, private and alternative sources of financing - that seeks to support mitigation and adaptation actions that will address climate change", particularly for vulnerable countries. The top seven emitters China, the EU, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Russia, and the US - plus international transport, accounted for 55% of global emissions in 2020. Collectively, G20 members 19 of the world's biggest economies plus the EU bloc - are responsible for 75%, according to latest UN data. It seems incredible that vulnerable countries should have to lobby for more funding and assistance as giant economies exacerbate the problems. Loss and damage refers to the term the UN uses in climate negotiations regarding the consequences of climate change beyond what people can adapt to. Scientific experts say loss and damage simply must play a major part in Cop27 and it could end up being the Egyptian event's legacy if the hopes are realised. That is a big if. Currently, it is not even certain to be on the agenda, as last-minute negotiations are teased out. This would be a grave blow to world ambitions on climate change, a monumental failure of responsibility, and ammunition for the nay-sayers' stance that Cop events are little more than a talking shop. \</doc>

EUROPEAN Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic has suggested that EU-UK agreement on checks between Britain and Northern Ireland could happen within weeks, with the right "political will". It comes as British prime minister Rishi Sunak and Commission president Ursula von der Leyen agreed to "work together" to end the row over the Northern Ireland Protocol when they met for the first time at COP27 in Egypt. Mr Sefcovic, the EU's Brexit negotiator, made the comments in Westminster during a meeting of British and European parliamentarians. He said: "This is the area where we do not seek any political victory. We just want to solve the problem." Discussing EU proposals to reduce checks, he said: "Is it too much to do this? Can we not find pragmatic, technical solutions to make this thing work? I believe it could be done, if there is political will, I'm sure that we can sort it out really within a couple of weeks because really, both sides of our negotiating teams we know these topics from all angles." Earlier, Mr Sefcovic told parliamentarians that he did not believe the EU and the UK were "worlds apart" on the protocol, as he warned that unilateral action by the UK government would have "serious" consequences. COP27 climate conference yesterday, with the British prime minister stressing the need to "find solutions" to the "very real problems" caused by the post-Brexit arrangements in the region. Mr Sunak inherits from his predecessors Liz Truss and Boris Johnson the problem of the Northern Ireland Protocol, which is vocally opposed by unionists who claim it cuts off the region from the rest of the UK. The post-Brexit solution - designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland - is cited as the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) main reason for refusing to return to power-sharing. The instability in Northern Ireland has raised concerns in Dublin, Brussels and Washington, and the row between the UK and the EU shows few signs of coming to a rapid conclusion, despite indications of a more positive tone from the British side in recent weeks. Ms von der Leyen called it a "good first meeting". In London, Europe Minister Leo Docherty spoke for the British government at a meeting of the EU-UK parliamentary partnership assembly and told a roomful of European and British politicians that it remained the UK's "preference to resolve this through talks". \</doc>

THE past eight years are on track to be the hottest on record - bringing ever more dramatic and deadly impacts of climate change, the UN has said. Sea-level rise is accelerating, the melting of Europe's Alpine glaciers shattered records and devastating floods, drought and heatwaves hit in 2022, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said. As the latest international climate talks, COP27 , kicked off in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, yesterday, the UN's weather and climate body released its annual state of the global climate report with yet another warning that the target to limit temperature rises to 1.5C was "barely within reach". Countries agreed under the Paris climate treaty in 2015 to curb warming to "well below" 2C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, but a lack of action has led to warnings that the 1.5C goal is slipping away. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres described the latest report as a "chronicle of climate chaos" and called for governments at COP27 to answer the planet's "distress signal" with ambitious, credible climate action. The global average temperature in 2022 is estimated to be about 1.15C above levels seen in the 1850-1900 period, the WMO said. That puts 2022 on track to be the fifth or sixth warmest year on record, in the face of a rare triple-dip La Nina weather phenomenon in the Pacific which has naturally cooled global temperatures for the past two years. But the WMO warned that did not mean there was a reversal in the warming trend. The eight years since 2015 are likely to be the eight warmest years on record, and the impacts of global warming are becoming more pronounced, it said. Glacier melt records were shattered in the European Alps, with average loss of three to four metres of ice thickness throughout the mountain range - substantially more than the previous record year of 2003. In Switzerland, for the first time in history no snow lasted the summer, so there was no accumulation of fresh ice. Between 2001 and 2022, glacier ice in Switzerland has declined by more than a third. Below-average rainfall for the past four years in east Africa has fuelled drought and a food crisis in the region, while record-breaking rain caused devastating flooding in Pakistan. Meanwhile, China and Europe were hit by record heatwaves and damaging drought and wildfires. And there was no let-up in the greenhouse gases driving climate change, with the three main pollutants - carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide - reaching record levels in 2021 and monitoring shows they continued to rise in 2022, the WMO said. WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas said: "The greater the warming, the worse the impacts. We have such high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now that the lower 1.5C of the Paris Agreement is barely within reach." He warned it was "already too late for many glaciers" and that melting would continue for hundreds if not thousands of years, with major implications for water security. Sea-level rises would add up to half a metre over a century, proving a long-term and major threat to many millions of coastal dwellers and lowlying states. And he said that while, all too often, those least responsible for climate change suffer most, even "well-prepared societies this year have been ravaged by extremes". Responding to the report, Mr Guterres said: "We must answer the planet's distress signal with action - ambitious, credible climate action.

NO SOONER had the sun gone down than the dismantling of the COP27 venue began. Coils of cable lay like giant snakes on the artificial grass and towers of chairs were stacked perilously in corners. The last catering hut shut up shop despite pleas to think of the hungry hours ahead. Ministers and officials were interviewed for TV with the clattering and banging of stands and pavilions being disassembled in the background. Visitors, workers, the venue itself were packing up and moving on, leaving the leaders behind. That's how it felt on Friday as the scheduled end of the global climate summit passed without agreement. Governments have always been behind on climate action while the carbon-polluting world marched on ahead, looking back occasionally, reassuring itself that there was no real chance of being caught up. It's about causes and consequences, Catherine Abreu, of climate action organisation Destination Zero, said as the night wore on without progress. "The cause is fossil fuels, the consequence is climate dam- age and for 30 years they haven't addressed either." When Saturday morning arrived after all-night talks failed to reach consensus and the EU threatened to walk away rather than accept a poor outcome, it looked like year 31. Twenty-four hours and many red eyes later, there was a deal. Just as well - there was hardly a chair left to sit on. But does the deal shorten the distance between the world's leaders and the problems they have failed for so long to tackle in any meaningful way? On the consequences - climate damage - the commitment to set up a dedicated loss and damage fund is recognition after 30 years of turning a blind eye that the poorest countries are taking the hit from the climate disasters that result from the carbon emissions of the richest. 'Historic', 'landmark', 'victory' - all the words that infuse a moment with importance - were rolled out to try to capture the development. Small island developing states (Sids) rejoiced. Their low-lying lands will be swallowed by the rising seas under even the most optimistic of climate-change forecasts, yet historically they have received the least overseas aid. Donations tend to favour large groups of people hit suddenly by extreme weather events. The Sids, with their small populations and the slow onset of the disaster befalling them, traditionally get little help, but the loss and damage fund should address the imbalance. For all poor nations, the prospect of a secure fund, always at the ready to dispense help, is far preferable to the ringaround pleas for piecemeal assistance that must be made whenever disaster strikes. "The historic outcome on loss and damage at COP27 shows international co-operation is possible, even in these testing times," said Mary Robinson, former Irish President and now chair of The Elders. The renewed commitment to try to limit global warming to 1.5C was also a relief, she said. At one point several countries indicated it was no longer relevant, with scientists warning it was unlikely to be achieved at the current pace of climate action. Observers felt that was an excuse for trying to wriggle out of climate action. However, Ms Robinson added: "None of this changes the fact that the world remains on the brink of climate catastrophe." That mixed assessment was shared by many civil society organisations. Clare O'Connor, from Friends of the Earth, said the loss and damage fund was a major step forward, but the summit was a letdown otherwise. "This gain in loss and damage is undermined by the failure of COP27 to call on countries to phase out fossil fuels, a reminder of the iron grip this polluting industry still has on negotiations," she said. Welcoming the loss and damage fund, Tr\'f3caire's Siobhan Curran said: "The failure to include a phase-out of all fossil fuels is deeply disappointing. If states don't deliver on emissions reductions, losses and damages will escalate beyond the scope of any fund." Teresa Anderson of Action- Aid said polluters had been let off the hook. "Climate-vulnerable communities who have been given hope through the establishing of a loss and damage fund are still being harmed by the actions of big polluters," she said. "The underlying cause of the climate crisis has not been addressed." The leaders have taken one step forward but their next move needs to be a leap. \</doc>

OUTSIDE the COP27 venue in the blazing Egyptian sun, a bare-armed Donegal man with a placard was beginning to feel the heat a little too intensely on his skin. Conor \'d3 Ma\'edrtin from Letterkenny was hoping his efforts would have the same effect on those inside. His bilingual placard - in Irish and English - read "climate change denial deserves the death penalty" and he said he was targeting politicians who he said are attending the summit to be seen rather than to act. The 45-year-old long-time activist said he didn't really want to see executions but felt the need for a strong statement. "If I can keep the deniers out of power, that's the main thing. There's no more time for their nonsense," he said. "Absolutely everything has to be done to prevent further climate change, whatever the amount of money that has to be spent, whatever the effort that has to be made." Indoors, as the opening speeches of the summit were made, the consensus was that there was also a gap there between the words used and the actions intended. The opening was delayed by almost two hours while heads of delegations argued over the final agenda. Finding a way to include "loss and damage" without making any commitments was the problem. The proposal that rich high-carbonpolluting nations pay for the climate-related catastrophes suffered by poor lowpolluter countries is hugely contentious. Eventually it was agreed the agenda would include "matters relating to funding arrangements responding to loss and damage", a breakthrough as it is the first time it has been on a COP agenda, but a vague reference matched by woolly mentions in the speeches. Ironically, this COP is billed as the "Sharm El Sheikh Implementation Summit", the Egyptian hosts stressing the time for talk is over. Sameh Shoukry - Egypt's foreign affairs minister, who assumed the role of COP27 president yesterday - said the political and economic crises of the past year must not derail progress. "We still have a chance to ensure a future where we can live without the existential threat of climate change," he said. Simon Stiell, head of the United Nations' climate change body, continued the theme, declaring: "Today a new era begins and we do things differently." "No one can be a passenger," he said of the need to drive home real outcomes over the course of the summit. "Let's not let positioning block progress." As they spoke, the World Meteorological Organisation released its annual State of the Global Climate report. It warned that the last eight years were on track to be the eight warmest on record, with sea-level rise accelerating, many glaciers beyond saving and the impacts likely to be felt for hundreds if not thousands of years. Whatever words they use, the world's leaders have a fortnight to act like they've heard those ones. \</doc>

Stalling and delaying tactics on climate change have to be consigned to the past because millions are suffering loss and damage on a daily basis because of it. Those were some of the emotive words of Kenyan president William Ruto, as he addressed the UN climate change summit Cop27 in Egypt. The two-week event has seen various world leaders coming together to what deals can be done to address spiralling global warming. The theme of loss and damage has loomed over the event in Sharm-el-Sheikh, with a tussle over who is responsible for what becoming a political football as the event kicked off. 'Loss and damage' refers to the consequences of climate change that go beyond what people can adapt to, or when options exist but a community does not have the resources to access or utilise them. Typically, poorer nations, islands, and low-lying lands bear the brunt of the impact, even though it is the richest economies in the world that are most responsible for causing the worst human-induced damage. The top seven emitters China, the EU, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Russia, and the US - plus international transport, accounted for 55% of global emissions in 2020. Collectively, G20 members - 19 of the world's biggest economies plus the EU - are responsible for 75%, according to latest UN data. Mr Ruto said the time has come to end delay and obfuscation through negotiations. "We cannot afford to spend more time skirting around the real issues and we must break out of the open-ended discussions we are trapped in," he said. "Further delay will make us busy spectators as calamity wipes out lives and livelihoods." Loss and damage are now a daily experience for hundreds of millions of Africans, he added. French president Emmanuel Macron said using the Ukraine war as an excuse for lack of action on climate change is invalid. Countries must stick to the targets set out in their plans to reduce emissions, he said. They must do what they committed to 12 years ago commit to $ 100bn ( 99.8bn) a year to more vulnerable nations to help them adapt to climate change. UN countries are currently closer to the $ 50bn mark, he added. British prime minister Rishi Sunak, after a u-turn last week on attending Cop27 , said he is committed to the \£311.6bn ( 13.3bn) international climate fund pledged by Boris Johnson's government last year. However, he warned that the plan could take longer than the five years originally pledged. Meanwhile, more than two dozen countries have formed a partnership committed to halting and reversing forest loss this decade as part of the climate fight. The partnership is aimed at building on the commitment made by more than 140 countries at last year's Cop26 summit in Glasgow to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030. \</doc>

E VERY morning, a lone figure in a suit sat on a chair in a dusty square on the edge of a road and waited for protests that never came. The "demonstration zone" the Egyptian government had designated for protests and rallies related to COP27 The hosts had required that any group wishing to assemble for the purposes of having their collective voices heard give 36 hours' notice, detail participants and stick to the zone, which lies well out of shouting distance of the summit venue. A Friends of the Earth International organiser said there was no way they would even consider such a "fish in a barrel" arrangement. Asked how many, if any, organisations had submitted notice that they would like to gather in the official zone, the hosts said they would be back with an answer, but have not yet provided one. Protests, parades, pageantry, marches, placards and chants have long added a vibrant dimension to the annual global climate summit, allowing activists and ordinary people to feel part of the discussions about the future of the planet. As Ireland's first official youth delegate, Oile\'e1n Carter Stritch, said this week, they spurred her on during her time at COP26 in Glasgow last year. "On the way in, you'd have to go through 10 minutes of protesters and by the time you got to the gate you were like, OK, this is why we're here, and you'd feel so motivated," she said. In Sharm El Sheikh, the walk from the shuttle bus drop-off to the venue entrance was largely a protester-free experience. Across from the main entrance, a small group of Korean advocates for veganism held a polite daily gathering, distributing leaflets and prayers for the conversion of carnivores. Within the venue, a small corner of a meeting square was generally occupied for a short time at 9am each morning by a dozen or so activists from various NGO coalitions, urging greater climate action, an end to fossil fuels or protection for indigenous people from oil and gas land-grabs. It was all very organised, predictable, constrained and non-disruptive. The only moment that came close to a real protest was when the sister of jailed pro-democracy activist Alaa The slogan "Free them all" was chanted, a reference to the estimated 60,000 activists behind bars in Egypt. Participants said the UN security officials present had given them permission for the demonstration, which took the decision out of Egypt's hands. Otherwise, Egyptian influence was clear. There were excessive passport inspections and a COP27 app that all participants were encouraged to download required updating every day yet rarely worked, adding to suspicions it was merely a tracking mechanism - something the hosts denied. Mary Robinson expressed her anger that the communications officer from The Elders who accompanied her to COP27 was told to open her camera for inspection by security staff. "If I had come through at the same time, I'd have read them the riot act," Mrs Robinson said. One morning, the Alliance of Civil Forces for Climate Change occupied the 9am slot, the unusual feature being that they were Egyptian. A young man approached initially was happy to have the NGO he worked for named as part of the alliance, but then changed his mind. He was happy for his name to be used, but then asked for it not to be connected to the alliance at all. "We are here for climate, not politics," he said. "For all, not for one person." It was hard to know how heartfelt those statements were and the caution in the young man was evident. For obvious reasons, he is not being named. Then, on the penultimate day, the morning gathering was a group with posters branding El-Fattah a terrorist. Their messages read "Don't obligate us with your human rights agenda" and " COP27 is for climate solutions". Dutch Green MEP Bas Eickhout was vocal about the squeeze on civil society groups at this year's COP. "When we are doing climate negotiations, one of the most important things is to give voice to the civil society," he said. "That's the people, the world out there, and what I see is a shrinking space for civil society, and I find that a big problem. "The prices of the hotels for NGOs, the raising of the prices on the day before they arrived, the checks at the entrance - these are all elements that are not good." He pointed to the "Free them all" badge pinned to his jacket. "You see this badge?" he said. "The NGOs were being questioned about it and told to take it off." Egyptian security were also taking photos of civil society events, he claimed. Mr Eickhout is even more concerned that COP28 is to be held in the United Arab Emirates, another country with limited political freedoms and a poor human rights record. "The UN need to evaluate how this COP went and there should be consequences for how we organise it next year," he said. "I expect the UN to address this with the organisers and that when we decide on a country to host a COP there should be clear rules on this subject. "Otherwise, you see an even more shrinking space for civil society, which is not a direction COP should go." That's the people, the world, out there. I see a shrinking space for civil society \</doc>

What happened at Cop27 ? Parties to the Paris Agreement, almost 200 of them including the EU, gathered in Sharm El Sheikh, agreed a historic move to scale up payments for climate-vulnerable countries under a "loss and damage" fund. In short, after a tortuous two weeks and often bitter final 48 hours, they agreed on a way forward on the key agenda item. This was apposite as it was held in Egypt; an "African cop" on a continent already being ravaged by climate-driven extreme weather events. If a deal had not been secured, Cop27 would have been deemed a failure, marking a fundamental falling out between rich and developing countries, thereby fuelling mistrust already evident around the negotiating tables. What has been agreed? In short, they have agreed that the world's biggest emitters in the form of spewing carbon into the atmosphere will have to make payments to the poorest states. That means the wealthy countries of the global north (including Ireland) helping the poorest countries of the global south. This is a landmark recognition of the historical emissions generated by big economies that got rich on the back of fossil fuels. And they must support in a major ongoing way those least responsible for a worsening climate crisis. It is the culmination of a 30-year campaign by developing countries. Not only that, they have to pay for the inevitable impacts - economic and non-economic - into the future because of their emissions that are responsible for an overheating Planet Earth. It even takes into account impacts that will be inevitable even if the world manages to peak its emissions in coming years. That includes funds to help with disasters in the form of extreme weather events including storms, droughts and floods made worse by climate disruption. Make no mistake this is big; a warning shot to polluters they can no longer go scot-free with their climate destruction. "A stunning breakthrough," is how Jean Su of Climate Action Network International put it. In a tweet, she called the brokered deal "a testament to the incredible mobilisation of vulnerable countries and civil society ... A dam has broken." What hasn't been agreed? The question of who pays will be ironed out next year, while "vulnerable developing countries" - as proposed by the EU - will benefit. Who falls into that category, however, is based on criteria of 30 years ago, ie criteria that would not stand up in real terms now. So expect big tensions over who benefits and who pays at Cop28. Will China, India and petrostates such as Qatar now have to contribute? Loss and damage dominated so progress under other headings was modest and falls short of what is needed. "Too many parties are not ready to make more progress today in the fight against the climate crisis," concluded EU climate chief Frans Timmermans. Last year's key outcomes came under sustained attack by some countries. Commitments were removed at the behest of laggard countries and fossil fuel producers. Peaking emissions by 2025 is not in the text. Follow-through on the phasedown of coal is not in this text. The phasedown of all fossil fuels is not in this text. Undertakings on energy were weakened but are at least in and renewable energy is singled out as the route to addressing the energy crisis. A proposal from India to stipulate the phasing down of all fossil fuels, backed by the EU, was also mauled by oil-producing countries at the talks, and watered down to a phasing down of coal, reflecting exactly the commitment made in Glasgow - no increased ambition here. The wording was the subject of furious discussions in the early hours of yesterday morning. Is it enough to meet Paris targets? Everyone now recognises we must address the impacts already visible and hitting hardest among communities that have contributed the least. There remains a critical need to raise ambition by reducing emissions, especially up to 2030, and this Cop does not deliver on that front. All told, the sum of actions and commitments don't add up to keeping 1.5 degrees alive. And that matters because going beyond this warming means reaching climate tipping points, irreversible impacts across the planet and great uncertainty over the extent of livability on Earth. Every increment of global warming matters to save lives and livelihoods and, therefore, is critical to keeping global temperatures below the 1.5-degree limit. The Paris pact has stood the test of time and climate science delivered through the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change could not be clearer, especially on what cutting emissions will achieve by way of solutions. Cop27 helps in going down that road but does not catalyse the scale of actions, timelines and roadmaps to ensure key 2030 targets and net zero by 2050 will be met. All told, 1.5 degrees is at death's door. Who will be happy? Developing countries are the happiest. They won on an issue that has raged since the 1992 Rio summit. Sherry Rehman - climate change minister of Pakistan where suffering in record floods became emblematic of the devastation developing countries are facing - hailed the "historic" deal to applause in the conference hall. "This is not about accepting charity," she said. "This is a downpayment on investment in our futures and in climate justice." It is a big victory for civil society groups and international aid organisations - and especially those in Ireland as they have campaigned tirelessly on the issue and are already delivering loss and damage support on the ground. Those campaigning for a radical overhaul of the global financial system will mark down Cop27 as progress, especially prime minister of Barbados Mia Mottley, chairwoman of the Elders leaders group Mary Robinson and countries supporting what is known as the Bridgetown initiative. There were strong calls to reform international financial institutions to unlock more finance for developing countries. Who will be unhappy? Those campaigning for a much faster pace in responding to an existential threat to humans and nature will be deeply unhappy. Okay, the world has to address a multitude of compounding crises at present amid geopolitical instability, but the climate/nature problem trumps all that a thousand times and is far from being resolved. Among parties to Cop, the EU is probably the most unhappy. It had a radical plan to inject more urgency. It was the single most significant intervention but failed to get sufficient backing. Its lead negotiator, Timmermans, did not hide his upset and frustration. The advocates for stepped-up commitments and, most especially, timely delivery will be profoundly unhappy. It is blatantly clear the Cop process under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change - albeit the only mechanism for collective action globally - is unsuitable and needs a reboot. Even those leading negotiating teams say it is too cumbersome. The lack of urgency is palpable in the face of a climate emergency that will ultimately devastate not just poor developing countries but also the rich states of the western world - including Ireland - if business as usual, protecting self-interest, and undue influence of climate-denier states that block anything threatening their fossil fuel assets is allowed to hold back a large majority of participating countries. The global climate movement will have a lingering sense of dismay. Their collective voice was suppressed by staging Cop27 in an autocratic state. It is having a bad run of late, having been blunted by Covid, while its cause is being undermined by pursuing the wrong kind of protests. A rethink is needed to put a fire under the rear ends of overly cautious, slow-acting politicians stuck in fatal short-termism. That approach has worked in the past and is essential more than ever. The message has to change too, especially to a public distracted by current horrible realities of grossly expensive energy and food shortages. What does it mean for Ireland? Despite everything, Cop27 sets a clear direction of travel, particularly on embracing renewables as a means of addressing the current energy crisis and ending fossil fuel reliance that is tied into aggressive emission reductions. This should be the lighthouse for future direction of the Irish economy. As evident on the Cop27 floor, Ireland is among the more ambitious in pursuing this course and is getting recognition for that. This is the club of those wanting to go further and faster in delivering climate action. But credibility will be quickly undermined if as a rich country we do not peak our emissions sooner rather than later. On a happier note within the Cop process, there is a clear indication Ireland has the ability to contribute to the global effort to address the threat of climate breakdown with the blend of skills within its national delegation feeding in effectively at the highest level on the EU side. This was well illustrated in negotiations on loss and damage. The fact that Ireland is already delivering on this front in the developing world, reinforced by a record on climate justice, was a great enabler and trust builder with those countries already suffering enough from a blatantly unjust crisis which unfortunately will get worse before it potentially transitions into a sustainable world. \</doc>

The human toll of climate change has been laid bare, with new figures showing 15,000 heat-related deaths were recorded in Europe this year - and that figure is expected to rise significantly. Figures from the World Health Organization (WHO) reveal that 4,500 people died in Germany, 5,000 in Spain and Portugal, and more than 3,000 in the UK during the summer. Data released last week show that Europe is warming faster than other areas of the planet. As well as rising temperatures, severe droughts, and more storms, increasing rain downpours, and flooding are among what the UN has described as the "unequivocal signs of the unfolding climate emergency". The ever-increasing signs of climate change come as UN secretary general Antonio Guterres blasted the lack of progress on climate change as he spoke at the Cop27 summit in Egypt. The world is "on the highway to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator", Mr Guterres told world leaders in Sharm El-Sheikh. "We are in the fight of our lives - and we are losing... It is the defining issue of our age," he said. "It is the central challenge of our century. It is unacceptable, outrageous and self-defeating to put it on the back burner." The WHO warned that the 15,000 deaths were only the beginning of the story, with more countries still to report on excess deaths due to heat. It cited official French statistics showing that more than 11,000 more people died in France between June and August this year compared with the same period in 2019, most likely due to the extreme heat in the summer. The world's population will reach 8bn by the middle of this month, the UN said. Billions of people are expected to face yearly extreme weather hazards as global warming intensifies, with Kenyan president William Ruto telling Cop27 that millions of Africans are already experiencing the worst as a "daily experience". "Further delay will make us busy spectators as calamity wipes out lives and livelihoods," Mr Ruto said. Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin said a main aim for Ireland at Cop27 was to push for "tangible measures" to help vulnerable countries to stave off the worst of climate change effects, as well as speeding up emissions reduction. He is to attend a meeting hosted by German chancellor Olaf Scholz this morning between the G7 countries the world's most advanced economies - and the V20, which is made up of the most vulnerable nations. Mr Martin is set to speak to world leaders after 1pm today, with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen also scheduled, and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to speak via video message. University College Cork professor Hannah Daly, one of Ireland's foremost experts in climate change and energy transition, said Ireland needed to step up its efforts and obligations to vulnerable nations. At home, tidal flooding hit Cork City yesterday at around 4.48pm and within a short space of time, some low-lying quay areas around the city were suffering from some degree of flooding, especially around Morrison's Island in the city centre. Before the waters subsided, traffic was slow-moving with thoroughfares such as South Terrace and Lavitt's Quay down to single lane traffic. News: 5 \</doc>

Sir, - With Cop27 in full swing, the "loss and damage" approach has become a central issue, and one of the most contentious. The approach, whereby rich, polluting countries should compensate poor, non-polluting countries financially for the environmental and economic damage that they have caused by their carbon emissions, seems fair and laudable. However, it raises the question as to how this will stop or reduce the rate of climate change. Sadly, it could actually increase that rate, even if the financial compensation is used in the most sensible ways, for example by building pumping stations and reservoirs for clean water, constructing flood defence systems, and building roads, schools and hospitals. It's a fair assumption that very little of that work, if any, will be executed using so-called green energy; and most of the work will involve the use of concrete, a material whose use is estimated to be responsible for at least 8 per cent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions. The real elephant in the room, which most leaders and planners inexplicably overlook, is global population growth. Population growth was a hot topic in the 1950s and 1960s when the world's population was about three billion; now it's eight billion and currently growing at a rate of about 83 million a year, but few appear to give it serious consideration. That level of growth might have been sustainable if we had all continued to live as we did in the 1950s, but we haven't. In the West, our aspirations have grown to the extent that we now regard such luxuries as cars, central heating, washing machines, televisions, and even foreign travel, as essentials - luxuries that were available to only a few not so long ago. With globalisation, the developing world sees how the West lives and, not unnaturally, wishes to emulate it. A sad and perhaps surprising reflection of this is that, according to a study published in the journal the Lancet, those individuals in developing countries who can afford a western lifestyle now account for 62 per cent of obese individuals globally. Population growth and aspirations to a lifestyle that is simply not possible to achieve for the eight billion people on our planet combine to make a perfect storm of environmental destruction, accelerated climate change, human suffering and conflict over natural resources, all of which have been increasingly evident for several decades. Rather than arguing about who owes how much to whom for damage that has already been done, Cop27 delegates ought to be concentrating their efforts on means of limiting further population growth, and radically addressing western lifestyle expectations. Despite the rhetoric, it seems that most of the Cop27 delegates have not yet grasped the enormity and complexity of the drivers of climate change, or the extent to which population growth and lifestyle aspirations contribute to that change. - Yours, etc, SWITHUN GOODBODY, Cappaghglass, Co Cork. \</doc>

PA Reporters UK business secretary Grant Shapps has said he will not be voting for Matt Hancock as he competes in I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here The launch episode of the show on Sunday night saw a new batch of 10 celebrities enter the Australian jungle for the first time since 2019, as the past two years were shot at Gwrych Castle in North Wales due to Covid-19 travel restrictions. Hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly confirmed there will be two extra arrivals to the camp and poked fun at Hancock, who is MP for West Suffolk and is expected to join the camp in the coming days, as they said they would be "rolling out the welcome mat for them soon". Mr Shapps said he will be focusing on his Cabinet job and will be attending the Cop27 climate conference in Egypt this week too. Asked if he was looking forward to seeing the 44-year-old having to eat crocodile anus, Mr Shapps told Sky News: "Tempting as that is, I think I'll probably be focusing on my job as business secretary, and I'll be off at Cop27 later this week as well, so I fear I might miss him depending on how long he survives." He said he will not be voting for Mr Hancock to compete in the reality show's gruelling challenges, adding: "I just think he should be here looking after his constituents, rather than in the jungle somewhere. On Sunday, British prime minister Rishi Sunak was quoted as telling The Sun he was "very disappointed" in the former health secretary because "MPs should be working hard for their constituents". Mr Sunak, who was speaking on his way to Cop27 , when asked whether he would be watching the programme, told the newspaper: "I genuinely won't have the time is the honest answer." Following his decision to join the reality show, Hancock had the Tory whip suspended and came under fire from across the political divide after opting to join the show at a time when parliament is sitting. Meanwhile, Olivia Attwood has withdrawn from the show on medical grounds, after just one day in the jungle. ITV said the 31-year-old former Love Island contestant has been told by the pro-gramme's medical team that it is not safe for her to return to camp. Attwood becomes the first contestant to leave the show, which launched on Sunday night to an average audience of 9.1m, according to overnight ratings from ITV. A spokesman for the broadcaster said: "As a precautionary measure Olivia needed to leave the jungle to undergo some medical checks. "Unfortunately the medical team has advised it is not safe for Olivia to return to camp as there needs to be a further investigation. "She has been absolutely brilliant and she'll be very much missed on the show." \</doc>

RISHI SUNAK will not attend next month's Cop27 green summit, No 10 has said, after he downgraded the role of environment minister in his Cabinet reshuffle. Downing Street announced the prime minister will not head to the gathering in Egypt to which his predecessor Liz Truss had intended to go. A spokesman said he remains "absolutely committed" to tackling climate change but needs to tackle "pressing domestic commitments". Alok Sharma, who was the minister responsible for overseeing Cop26 last year, will negotiate for the UK at the summit in Sharm El-Sheikh. Mr Sunak will be working on plans for the Autumn Budget statement, which was delayed from its Halloween publication date until November 17. His decision not to attend was criticised by political opponents who said it demonstrated a "massive failure of leadership" on the world stage. Ed Miliband, Labour's shadow climate change secretary, accused the prime minister of not "even bothering to turn up" to the landmark conference. "What Rishi Sunak obviously fails to understand is that tackling the climate crisis isn't just about our reputation and standing abroad, but the opportunities for lower bills, jobs and energy security it can deliver at home," he said. The annual presidency of Cop, which has been held by Britain for the last year, will be formally handed over to Egypt at the meeting. Caroline Lucas, a Green MP, said the fact that Mr Sunak will not be there was "a shameful way" to end the UK's tenure in charge of the global green drive. "The new PM's decision not to attend Cop27 makes a mockery of any government claims on continued climate leadership," she said. This was echoed by Greenpeace, which said the decision suggested Mr Sunak does not take the environment "seriously enough". "The UK government is supposed to hand over the Cop presidency to their Egyptian counterparts at next month's summit," said Rebecca Newsom, its head of politics. "For Rishi Sunak not to show up is like a runner failing to turn up with the baton at a crucial stage of the relay." Downing Street said senior ministers would go to the summit, which will run from November 6 to 18. A spokesman said: "We remain committed to net zero and to leading international and domestic action to tackle climate change. The UK is forging ahead of many other countries on net zero. "We will obviously continue to work closely with Egypt as the hosts of Cop27 and to make sure that all countries are making progress on the historic commitments they made at the Glasgow climate pact." It came after No 10 confirmed Mr Sunak has reversed the decision of his predecessor to upgrade the role of environment minister to a cabinet position. Graham Stuart was reappointed to the job yesterday but was stripped of his entitlement to attend meetings of the top team. (\£9 Telegraph Media Group Ltd 2022) \</doc>

Newbies at Cop, which is in the throes of its 27th gathering and being attended by almost 30,000 people, can find its size overwhelming. But Nathan Gray has found his bearings and relishes the opportunity to have deep conversations about climate change with people from all over the world. He feels "Ireland is talking the talk, but at the moment we are not walking the walk" as its emissions are on track to rise this year. "The biggest contribution Ireland can make to Cop27 is working to meet our agreed upon emissions reduction targets," says Mr Gray, who is a postgraduate researcher on the carbon sustainability of advanced transport fuels at UCC. He says it's important to bear in mind that not every Cop will result in a Paris Agreement. Nonetheless, he hopes a meaningful result is possible, especially on financial compensation for countries already suffering from the climate crisis. The critical issue of loss-and-damage finance, billed as the litmus test for Cop27 , was added to the formal agenda at the last minute after 30 years of resistance from wealthy countries. That was a big early win for developing countries. "Even worse is the attempted sleight of hand by several countries, including Ireland, to package up pledges for loss and damage as new funding when instead they are coming out of existing contributions." The bottom line is "we are still not seeing the commitment to deliver crucial finance needed to support countries on the frontline of the climate crisis", Fitzpatrick says. The target of providing $100 billion (EUR 96.4 billion) per year to poor countries by 2020 has still not been met and negotiations on the new long-term finance target got off to a bad start with developed countries "seeking to drag down ambition". "Ultimately, wealthy, polluting countries largely responsible for the climate crisis have so far failed to deliver ambitious emissions reductions needed to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees - and pledges made by world leaders are insufficient and leave us facing climate disaster." Moreover, week one at Cop27 has seen wealthy countries like Ireland fall at the first hurdle to show real leadership on climate justice, he says. Unless they are fully prepared to acknowledge their ecological debt to those bearing the brunt of the worst impacts of the crisis, we are unlikely to see a just and equitable outcome, Fitzpatrick says. There is still time to change direction but it will require political leadership on a scale which has been sorely lacking so far. "As we get to the end of the first week the tensions rise in the negotiating rooms and the trade-offs between agenda items begin," says Cop veteran Dr Tara Shine of Change By Degrees. Outside that cauldron Cop27 is the busiest she has been to. "Pavilions and meeting rooms are full of events sharing solutions and making new commitments. The challenge will be making sure all these commitments are met in a transparent way. We need more show and less tell," she says. Ireland is undoubtedly making a real contribution and is well represented by Government, NGOs, business and academia, Shine says. "Collectively we are good networkers and that helps Ireland punch above its weight. Ireland is proactively engaging in the negotiations on key issues for this Cop like loss and damage and the global stock take. But we need to match our efforts here with emission reductions at home to be credible leaders." Is she hopeful for a meaningful outcome? "Yes and no. It is positive so many actors are now involved in Cop and pushing for action. But we need so much more to change to keep the 1.5-degree goal from slipping away. That is the most important action for humanity." Loss and damage will be a key outcome but it only arises "because we have failed to honour our commitments and reduce emissions", she says. "The most vulnerable people and communities need 1.5 and loss and damage [support] to survive. Every sector, business and town can play its part in keeping 1.5 alive." Climate policy specialist Sadhbh O'Neill says finance has dominated so far. "Carbon money" is everywhere - specialised intermediaries, consultancies, investment funds, banks, lenders, accountancy firms. It crops up in the climate finance and loss and damage debates, with "new announcements on carbon markets every other day", she says. "But it's mostly private finance. There's tonnes of money floating around, even the fossil fuel industry are here hunting for 'sustainable' projects to invest in - and developing countries meanwhile are verging on bankruptcy. "It is galling." There is no magic money tree for poor countries at Cop: "if you want finance, you have to pay for it, with your land, your own mitigation plans and business opportunities". Carbon credits ultimately allow rich countries and companies to continue business as usual instead of investing in radical decarbonisation efforts, O'Neill says. A lot has happened in building up voluntary carbon markets since she first started coming to Cops in 2016. "Bilateral agreements are starting to shape up and some developing countries are being enticed into hosting projects, which will deprive them of the mitigation outcomes on their own inventories," she warns - so they won't benefit in terms of their carbon accounting. "Having said all that, it is quite something to be here. A sample of the people of planet Earth are here, in all our variety and glory - though not representative. I've seen hardly anyone from southeast Asia or China." With Ireland the EU's second highest per capita emitter of greenhouse gases, "to make a substantial contribution to a meaningful Cop27 outcome, a strong plan for implementation of [its] existing mitigation plan should also be presented", Pizzichetti says. \</doc>

COP27 is taking place in Egypt in less than a month's time, but there has been surprisingly little discussion about it. To jog readers' memories from last year: 'COP' stands for 'Conference of the Parties', and it is a global climate summit that happens every year. It lasts for two weeks, bringing together world leaders, policymakers, scientists, activists, businesses and NGOs. Some readers may remember the build-up and momentum around COP26 last November, when leaders gathered in Glasgow, but COP27 has not received as much media attention nor piqued the public's interest in the same way. This could be down to a few factors: geopolitical tensions, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the energy crisis, and a UK Government in flux - as well as the unstable political situation in Egypt, the host country. COP27 , and Liz Truss determined to implement environmentally damaging policies that only move us further away from our net-zero target (which was also a Conservative Party manifesto commitment in 2019). It may have slipped some people's minds, but the UK still holds the COP26 presidency until next month's handover in Egypt. Is it therefore not reasonable to expect a stronger level of engagement and leadership from media and government alike? The UK Government, effectively the custodian of this UN climate process until November, doesn't appear to understand that countries are required to strengthen climate commitments as time goes on - not weaken them. It is decisions like these, and the colossal gap between dialogue and delivery that make me feel like we are literally going backwards. Nothing is changing - except the temperature of the planet, of course. The '27' part of COP27 refers to the fact that this is the 27th time that these talks are happening. I find it just slightly depressing that there have been more COPs than years that I have been alive, and it is the repetitive nature of COPs which has led to disillusionment and cynicism about the entire process. Are we really meeting for the 27th time to discuss the same topics that have been unsolved since 1995? No wonder youth activists, like Greta Thunberg, accuse politicians of £ll talk, no action'. The first ever COP took place in Berlin in 1995, and when I read through the opening speech of Dr Helmut Kohl, the German Chancellor at the time, I was struck by the unchanged, unchanging nature of his words. You could almost copy and paste his speech, and re-insert it in our modern context because the same topics - climate change, biodiversity loss and climate finance - are all covered. Chancellor Kohl uses the same language that we hear from some politicians today: "We are concerned about the future of our planet", "we are ready for ground-breaking decisions and measures" and the question at the end of his speech, "One day our children and grandchildren will ask us, 'Did you make the right decisions in Berlin to secure our future?'" aged particularly badly. So, what makes this COP different to all those 26 others that came before? What will be some of the key concepts and issues? As an African COP, the focus in Egypt comprises of three main strands: adaptation, climate finance and loss and damage. Adaptation is about finding solutions to adapt to climate change. Africa is the continent most affected by the climate breakdown, and African countries face some of the worst impacts of climate change, like severe droughts and floods. Policymakers will be thinking about adaptation solutions which deal with issues, like water scarcity and food insecurity, and which both protect and empower vulnerable communities. Climate finance is, literally, the million-dollar question which has been pushed to the margins of the negotiations for more than a decade. In 2009, at COP15 in Copenhagen, rich nations pledged to pay $100bn a year in climate finance to countries worst affected by climate breakdown by 2020. Payment is two years overdue. Finally, loss and damage refers to what happens when it is no longer impossible to adapt to the impacts of climate change. To put it frankly: loss of land, livelihoods and death. It raises the question of historical responsibility: those who have contributed most to the climate crisis should take responsibility for tackling it. The 54 countries in Africa combined contribute less than 4% greenhouse gas emissions. Rich nations have been resistant to demands for loss and damage compensation, and last year at COP26, the UK and the EU blocked the demands from 138 developing countries for loss and damage reparations. After another year of local and global climate catastrophes (London was on fire this summer and a third of Pakistan is currently underwater), it would not only be tone deaf, but also deeply wrong, to not put climate finance and justice at the top of the political agenda. I, like many others, am concerned that the UK Government will not take messages at COP27 seriously. Let's hope they can be 'trusted to deliver'. Graphic Policies: Prime Minister Liz Truss \</doc>

British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has defended Home Secretary Suella Braverman amid calls for her to be fired. Labour MP Meg Hillier said that Ms Braverman has "leaked information, is overseeing chaos in the Home Office and has broken the law". "What will she actually have to do to get the sack?" He said Ms Braverman has set out "transparently, in detail a full sequence of events". "She is now getting on with the job, cracking down on crime, defending our borders, something I know the party opposite has no interest in supporting," Mr Sunak said. Mr Sunak said the migrant crisis is a "serious and escalating problem" and admitted that "not enough" asylum claims are being processed. He insisted the UK government is getting a grip on the situation and backed Ms Braverman's handling of the issue. He said she has taken "significant steps" to address the problem of overcrowding at a migrant processing facility in Kent. Listing her actions, he told MPs at Prime Minister's Questions: "Since 30 September, more hotels with 4,500 new beds, appointing a senior general to control the situation at Manston and, indeed, increasing the number of staff there by almost a half. "These are significant steps that demonstrate that we are getting a grip of this system. "But this is a serious and escalating problem. We will make sure that we control our borders and we will always do it fairly and compassionately, because that is the right thing." Sunak in COP27 This morning, Mr Sunak reversed his decision to skip COP27 and will attend the climate summit in Egypt next week, he has announced. He wrote on Twitter that there was "no long-term prosperity without action on climate change", and no energy security without investing in renewables, as he confirmed he would attend this year's UN talks. The Conservative leader was initially not planning to attend, with Downing Street saying he was focusing on "depressing domestic challenges". There is no long-term prosperity without action on climate change.There is no energy security without investing in renewables.That is why I will attend HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/COP27P @COP27P next week: to deliver on Glasgow's legacy of building a secure and sustainable future./n Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/RishiSunak/status/1587746521457500160 November 2, 2022 However, the announcement by his predecessor Boris Johnson he was going to the talks piled further pressure on the prime minister to backtrack on his decision. He had also faced widespread calls to attend, including from his own climate chief Alok Sharma, who presided over the COP26 summit in Glasgow last year. Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney welcomed Mr Sunak's decision to attend COP27 . British Green MP Caroline Lucas wrote on Twitter: "Glad to see Sunak's screeching U-turn on # COP27 , but what an embarrassing mis-step on the world stage. "Let this be a lesson to him - climate leadership matters. "Now he urgently needs to increase UK ambition on emission reduction targets & pay what we owe to global climate funds." UK support for EU membership rising - pollster At a briefing for Westminster journalists, Prof Curtice said support for EU membership had been rising since the middle of last year and particularly since last autumn when there were shortages of lorry drivers and food deliveries. He said it looks as if the 2016 referendum will be just as unsuccessful as the 1975 referendum - in which Britain voted to remain - in providing a permanent settlement of the debate. "We are as a country divided down the middle on this subject and it looks as if we are going to continue to be so for the foreseeable future," Prof Curtice said. He said that the parliamentary opposition did not want to talk about Brexit, despite the debate going on among the public, and he did not see it being raised as a political issue until after the next election. \</doc>

Irish minister Eamon Ryan has been appointed as the EU's lead in talks on climate damage reparation, an issue that has proven contentious at Cop27 . Cop27 summit in Egypt. Mr Ryan, Ireland's minister for transport and the environment, is attending the UN climate conference in Sharm El-Sheikh this week. Among the biggest issues is whether a global fund should be set up where rich, polluting nations would compensate poorer nations for the damage they are suffering. Small island nations, particularly vulnerable to the threat of rising sea levels, have accused developed countries of stalling progress on establishing such a fund. Mr Ryan, leader of Ireland's Green Party, will be working alongside European Commission Vice-President Franz Timmermans and his team. The EU team considered a proposal on Wednesday morning on loss and damage from the G-77, a collective of over 130 developing countries. ``We need a solution for a 2022 world, not a 1992 world,'' Mr Ryan said, referring the year when the first COP gathering took place. ``We must have a focus on the most vulnerable, and flexible ways to reach them with finance and support. It must be demand driven and targeted - to get support to those who need it most. ``There is no silver bullet, no one solution. We need a mosaic or ecosystem of solutions that suit different needs and circumstances. ``Above all, we need to listen and respond to the voices of those most exposed to climate destruction. We also need unprecedented financing, from a variety of sources, exploring taxes, levies and debt forgiveness, for example.'' In the coming weeks, Mr Ryan is to publish an update of the government's Climate Action Plan, which many will watch keenly to see if it contains details of the actions key sectors of the Irish economy need to take to dramatically reduce their carbon emissions in the coming years. end \</doc>

Death rates from extreme heatwaves will be "staggeringly high" in the future - comparable to all cancers or all infectious diseases by 2100. That's according to a new joint UN and Red Cross report which warned that climate change will cause humanitarian catastrophe on a massive scale without aggressive mitigation and defensive measures to combat the effects of global warming. Ahead of the forthcoming Cop27 climate change summit in Egypt next month, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) painted a bleak picture of things to come. The most vulnerable communities in the poorest countries will disproportionately bear the brunt of the wrath of extreme heat, despite the fact richer countries are responsible for the majority of human-induced global warming, the report warned. "There is compelling evidence that the world's lowest-income countries - those least responsible for climate change - are already experiencing disproportionate increases in extreme heat. "The combined effects of warming, ageing and urbanisation will cause a significant increase in the number of at-risk people in developing countries in the coming decades. "Projected future death rates from extreme heat are staggeringly high - comparable in magnitude by the end of the century to all cancers or all infectious diseases - and staggeringly unequal, with people in poorer countries seeing far greater levels of increase," the report said. An extreme heat event that would have occurred once in 50 years in a climate without human influence is now nearly five times as likely, it warned. "Under 2C of warming, an extreme heat event is projected to be nearly 14 times as likely and to bring heat and humidity levels that are far more dangerous." Cities are at the epicentre of vulnerability to heatwaves, the report warned. "Analysts project a 700% global increase in the number of urban poor people living in extreme-heat conditions by the 2050s. The largest increases are expected in West Africa and South-East Asia." There have been successful pilot systems to combat heatwaves, which must be built upon, the report said. "There can be no escaping the need to prepare for more and larger heat-related emergency responses in the future. "There is a growing body of knowledge and good practice around early warning and response systems to heatwaves. "The city of Ahmedabad, India, developed a ground-breaking heatwave action plan - the first in a developing country - that has helped it to avoid over 1,100 deaths annually." Secretary general of the IFRC, Jagan Chapagain, said Cop27 was pivotal. "To avert its most devastating impacts, we must invest equally on adaptation and mitigation, particularly in the countries most at risk. "At Cop27 , we will urge world leaders to ensure that this investment reaches local communities that are on the frontline of the climate crisis. "If communities are prepared to anticipate climate risks and equipped to take action, we will prevent extreme weather events from becoming humanitarian disasters." \</doc>

KEVIN O'SULLIVAN In Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt Failing to address Ireland's carbon emissions problem quickly is not in the national interest and could affect foreign direct investment in the country, Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan has said. Mr Ryan acknowledged that it was taking time to reduce emissions, but said the latest report of the Climate Change Performance Index issued yesterday had found the right policies were being put in place by the Government. Speaking in Sharm el-Sheikh, where he is attending the Cop27 climate summit, he said these policies would have to be delivered. "Ignoring Irish climate law, ignoring EU climate law, telling the business community that invests in our country that we're not going to be 1.5 [and reduce emissions], that would not be in our interests. It's in our interests to make the cuts collectively as a people." With EU ambition being scaled up, not meeting targets was not an option. "If we say we cannot meet targets - the emissions reductions needed - we would be pilloried and exposed in Europe and the wider world," he said. He said it was important at Cop27 that people did not give up on the 1.5 degree target to contain global warming and to reduce emissions accordingly, as "that would be taking the foot off the level of ambition and we need all the ambition we can get" in addressing the climate crisis. Ireland negotiates under the EU umbrella but it was pushing for climate finance under the headings of adaptation, mitigation, and loss and damage from a diverse range of sources that takes into account the differing needs of the most vulnerable countries. That needs to happen now and not take up to 10 years to set up as had happened in the past, Mr Ryan said. "We need a strong loss and damage commitment this week and to apply the Irish experience." This meant ensuring strong local engagement, rather than providing top-down funds, he said. Greater urgency Speaking at a briefing, the Minister said there was a need for greater urgency. There was a need for new sources of climate funding and a mechanism targeting fossil fuel companies, shipping and aviation, he said. Mr Ryan said he agreed with the concept of fossil fuel anti-proliferation treaty. On fossil fuel subsidies, Ireland is "ahead of the curve" when it came to fracking, oil and gas exploration and peat extraction, he said. Chairwoman of the Climate Change Advisory Council Marie Donnelly expressed disappointment that some senior ranking countries were not present at Cop27 , which she said may indicate a softening of political commitment to achieve the necessary targets of the Paris Agreement. But she welcomed loss and damage being on the agenda, as well as the key issue of adaptation and resilience, which was "quite under developed", and affected countries differently, including Ireland. She was concerned about any move to weaken commitments to tackle climate change. "I'm the first to acknowledge that 1.5 is a very difficult objective. But what's the point of having a target that isn't a stretch target? You've got to aim for it. And if we miss it by a little bit, that's fine." Not to do so would weaken the ambition and mean 1.5 degrees would be exceeded, Ms Donnelly said. \</doc>

A rethink on hosting future UN climate change Cop summits is needed because of the huge emissions associated with delegates flying in from around the world, an expert has said. Brian Caulfield, Trinity College Dublin associate professor in the department of civil, structural, and environmental engineering, has extensively researched the environmental impacts of transport emissions. He told the Irish Examiner there had to be a better way of hammering out climate deals than thousands of people flying to the likes of Egypt or Scotland every year. Cop27 in the Egyptian resort of Sharm-el-Sheikh saw a historic agreement on so-called loss and damage, involving ostensibly richer countries paying a significant share to more vulnerable countries to compensate for climate change-related disasters. On the other hand, it has come under fire for failure to agree on greenhouse gas emissions reduction and the watering down of language surrounding fossil fuel usage in the future. Mr Caulfield said Environment Minister Eamon Ryan and the Irish delegation of negotiators deserved "many congratulations" for their part in securing the loss and damage deal, playing a lead role in brokering an agreement on behalf of the EU. However, he said the need for tens of thousands of delegates to attend should be questioned. "A return flight from Dublin to Cop would equate to approximately 1.3 tonnes of CO2, which in itself will be approximately the same as driving an SUV for 9,000km," said Mr Caulfield. "In my field, we all have to attend conferences and sometimes air travel is unavoidable - I am taking my first flight in three years to a conference soon. "But I do think that in the future the arrangement of Cop needs to be done in a more climate-friendly way." Last year's Cop26 event in Glasgow was calculated by Greenpeace to have generated over 100,000 tonnes of carbon emissions, with 60% of the total generated from delegates flying in from around the world. The Glasgow event was twice as high as the previous Cop25 in Madrid, which generated over 51,101 tonnes, according to consultants Arup. More than 39,000 participants attended Cop26 in Glasgow, compared to around 27,000 at Cop25 in Madrid. It is estimated that around 35,000 attended the two-week Cop27 in Egypt. The United Arab Emirates will host Cop28 next year. \</doc>

T HE gathering of world leaders in Egypt for COP27 prompts the question - what have they done for climate since COP28? When they gather for the traditional family photo, some will be keen to take the front spot while others may feel more comfortable hiding sheepishly at the back. Where will Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin fit in? A lookback at the year between Glasgow and Sharm El Sheikh shows a middle-row placing might suit best. Fossil fuels At the COP28 climate summit last year, Ireland joined the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA) of countries committed to putting an end date to global oil and gas exploration and extraction. Last Friday, Ireland granted a licence extension to Europa, an oil and gas company exploring off the Mayo coast. The Government did not pledge to refuse extensions to existing licence-holders, arguing it would be too costly to buy them out and the risk of a compensation claim would be too high. But there could hardly be a clearer example of how promises made in a fortnight of COP fervour can wane in the 50 weeks of political reality that follow. The greater dilemma will come if Europa strikes lucky. Then the Government would have to decide whether to grant a drilling licence and our commitment to BOGA would begin to look bogus. Methane Pledge at COP28, a pact aiming to reduce emissions by 30pc by 2030. The Government was quick to stress the aim was a global reduction and the 30pc would not apply individually. That's a lucky escape for Ireland because by far our main source of methane is cattle and it was hard enough to agree a 25pc emissions cut for all agricultural emissions during the year. Deforestation Ireland also signed a COP28 pledge to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. This pledge is also a collective global goal but it requires signatories to act decisively on the home front. The Government last week announced (EURO)1.3bn in forestry supports that will substantially boost incentives for farmers planting forestry. However, our tree-planting plans are very far behind and the Climate Change Advisory Council has warned that our forests are so depleted they are actually net emitters of carbon. If the pledge-makers are relying on countries like Ireland to make their ambition a reality, then 2030 will come too soon. Climate finance At COP28 Ireland pushed for increased funding for poor countries to help them pay for climate action measures. We pledged to increase our own contribution to (EURO)225m a year by 2025, more than doubling the current annual donation of (EURO)80-90m. But just (EURO)25m extra has been announced for 2023 so there is a long way to go. A bigger issue is 'loss and damage' funding - reliable, easily accessible money for poor countries that suffer now unpreventable climate catastrophes. Ireland was a keen backer of the 'Glasgow Dialogue' in which countries agreed to discuss creating such a funding mechanism during the year but we have yet to suggest a starting figure. Emissions reduction Ireland supported the Glasgow Pact by which all countries were to revise upwards their carbon-cutting goals by COP27 , but we had recently passed the Climate Act requiring a 51pc national reduction by 2030, and didn't revisit it during this year. We do back the EU's plan for collective cuts across the bloc totalling at least 55pc by 2030 but that plan has not been approved yet and we haven't offered to adopt 55pc as a national aim. Sadhbh O'Neill, a PhD researcher in climate policy who is attending COP27 , said the agreements on carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings over the year were progress for Ireland but not enough to allow for a triumphant return to the summit. "As long as we are giving in to any type of vested interest, whether it's agriculture or data centres or whatever, then it puts too much of a burden on other sectors to achieve more than is really possible. "Rhetoric, speeches, commitments, being on the right side of history - they're all very well. But if we can't bring emissions down in the manner that we've promised consistent with the carbon budgets and the 51pc emissions reduction target by 2030, none of those commitments mean anything. "Then we can't hold our head up high when we go face to face with those countries here in Sharm El Sheikh that are suffering devastating climate impacts," she said. Ross Fitzpatrick, policy officer with Christian Aid Ireland, said even the targets Ireland pledged to meet were not high enough. "Ireland is one of the highest emitters per capita in the EU so halving emissions is less than our fair share. "The sectoral emissions ceilings won't even deliver a 51pc reduction. The Climate Change Advisory Council says they will only deliver 43pc. "Our climate finance pledge is for (EURO)225m per year but we haven't seen evidence of it being delivered. We also argue it's only about half of our fair share so we're failing on a key global justice aspect of the Paris Agreement. "Signing up to things and making pledges is worthwhile and it indicates leadership but if we don't follow through on it, what's the point?" Even the targets we pledged to meet were not high enough \</doc>

The world's population passed eight billion this week, according to the United Nations. It was one billion in the 1750s, two billion in the 1930s and four billion in the 1980s. The rate of growth recently is phenomenal and many worry it is unsustainable. Nevertheless world population is calculated to peak and then decline in coming decades because of falling birthrates, caused mainly by the empowerment of women. Ageing due to radically improved medical care explains much of the recent growth. Present population growth centres are in the poorest regions most amenable to radical action on inequality and aid. Such contrasting perspectives on the figures underline how important it is not to panic over them but instead to explore their dynamics and potential for progressive change. Population numbers are closely connected to rapidly accumulating climate change, biodiversity loss, energy supply and urbanisation, all of which contribute to global ecological unsustainability. Yet most environmental damage is done by the world's richest regions, countries and people, whereas the poorest and most populous ones are responsible for far less of it - but will suffer the most from its consequences. Equality and inequality of power and resources cut across any simplistic assessment. Women's empowerment through birth control methods and life choices are central to the story in recent decades. Where they are available, birth rates decline. That is happening fast in China and in more developed parts of India, the most populous states and in most of the world's richer countries. Poorer parts of India and of Africa south of the Sahara, by contrast, are where most future population increase is projected to happen. This interconnectedness of world population, development and environmental issues is systematically highlighted in recent analyses, especially by the United Nations Global Development Goals and in those accompanying the Cop27 climate conference. Unequal distribution of wealth and resources must be tackled if these issues are to be addressed. That means agreeing equitable loss and damage measures at Cop27 to finance development policies that can address poverty. It means taxing rich minorities, closing financial havens and ensuring multinational corporations share the costs of reducing the escalating inequalities built up since the 1980s. These paths to a more sustainable future have been clearly identified and require urgent action. Otherwise current negative trends threaten to reinforce one another, including those towards large crisis-driven migrations fleeing climate breakdown, poverty and unsustainable population explosions. Against these, the positive countervailing trends visible in recent analysis deserve worldwide support. \</doc>

Environment Correspondent . That is according to a study from sustainable production organisations the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy and the Changing Markets Foundation, which unveiled the findings as negotiations intensified at the Cop27 climate change summit in Egypt . The analysis claimed that methane from 15 firms, including Nestle, Danone, Danish Crown, Saputo, and the Dairy Farmers of America, "rival that of the EU (83%) and Russia (115%) and far exceed Canada (377%), Australia (355%), and Germany (705%)" . Together they are responsible for 3.4% of global methane emissions from human activity, claimed the organisations They said that methane emissions of Brazilian meat company JBS exceed the combined livestock methane emissions of France, Germany, Canada, and New Zealand, while the methane footprint of the US multinational Tyson Foods is comparable to Russia's livestock . Methane from the New Zealand dairy giant Fonterra is comparable to Ireland's livestock, they said . When it comes to greenhouse gas emissions overall, the firms' output is greater than Germany, the world's fourth biggest economy, and exceed those of oil and gas giants such as ExxonMobil, BP, and Shell, the analysis claimed . Shefali Sharma, European director for the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, said: "The methane emissions of the big meat and dairy companies rival those of nation states, yet they hide their colossal climate footprint behind a veneer of greenwash and net-zero targets. These companies won't do what is needed voluntarily; governments must set rules to regulate their emissions and support farmers to transition away from industrial agriculture." A global methane pledge was launched at Cop26 in Glasgow last year aimed at reducing methane, with 130 countries committing to a 30% cut in global methane emissions by 2030 . Beef and dairy cattle are among the biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, with cows mainly generating methane through digestion and waste . Ireland's methane conundrum led to a political tussle on reduction targets for the so-called carbon budgets, with 25% agreed as negotiations came down to the wire . Agriculture remains by far the largest contributor to overall emissions in Ireland, at 37.5% of the total, according to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data in July . \</doc>

While there have been some positive outcomes from COP27 , the progress needed in terms of addressing the root causes of climate change has not been made, the Energy Policy Officer with Friends of the Earth has said. Clare O'Connor said the establishment of the loss and damage fund, where polluters pay for the irreversible losses caused, is welcome. Speaking on RT\'c9's Morning Ireland, Ms O\' Connor said that the need for the loss and damage facility in the first place is not being addressed. "We're seeing lots of celebrations on this from the Irish delegation and from civil society as well, but it's important to note that we haven't actually ironed out the detail on who's going to contribute to this fund, how much it's going to be, on what exactly losses is going to cover, so we would be hesitant to celebrate this just yet," she said. "As well as that, we haven't actually addressed the root causes of any of these losses and damages, which is burning fossil fuels extracting and burning fossil fuels, and we saw lots of countries - the EU, the US, Canada - calling for explicit reference to the phase-out of all fossil fuels, coal, oil and gas, in the overarching decision text, and that didn't happen." The details of the agreement "will be ironed out over the next year and we will hope to see this by the next COP," she said. "What is needed is clear commitment from polluters to see who exactly is going to pay but also the most important thing needs to be addressed, which is phasing out fossil fuels," she said. "We need to see that both internationally and on a domestic level." She said COP has itself been described as having become "lost and damaged". HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/eile/climate-change/ Latest Climate news Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan said the loss and damage deal agreed at COP27 will work by looking at a range of different funding and by broadening the countries that will contribute, as well as targeting funding to provide better debt relief and financial flows for countries that are in difficulty due to climate. Speaking on the same programme, he said there are other areas that will have to be looked at, such as shipping, aviation and fossil fuel industries and whether these could contribute to a fund. "We need to protect the most vulnerable, this is where the Irish team had a particular influence in making sure that the funds that are raised are targeted, and how we define that has to be worked out over the next year. It is very significant. It is historic," he said. The 'historic' deal reached at COP27 will mean 'the likes of China, Saudi Arabia and Qatar' will need to contribute more, Minister Eamon Ryan has said.He said the deal aims to protect the most vulnerable | Read more climate coverage: HYPERLINK https://t.co/dqnhoUqNFo https://t.co/dqnhoUqNFo \~ HYPERLINK https://t.co/V0EbPmX9pe pic.twitter.com/V0EbPmX9pe HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/rtenews/status/1594610303207018496 November 21, 2022 "It has the potential, if we get it right now and deliver on the political promise, the mandate that's been given to stitch climate justice into our entire response, and that was critical." Ireland has committed to a global shield, which provides an insurance mechanism particularly for farmers in Africa and Asia to give them protection. Mr Ryan said that Ireland has contributed \€ 10m to that fund, adding that in the past, the idea of one fund financing everything has historically proven a false promise, as it often takes up to ten years to establish a fund properly. The mosaic of solutions, a variety of different funding streams is what was agreed, he said. Mr Ryan said that the wording agreed at COP will see countries like China and Russia will contribute too. He said it is in everyone's interest that we get an agreement because "we get a safer planet". Speaking after a deal was made at the Sharm El-Sheikh summit, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said this COP has HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2022/1120/1337215-cop27-reaction/ "taken an important step towards justice" . "Clearly, this won't be enough... To have any hope of keeping to 1.5, we need to massively invest in renewables and end our addiction to fossil fuels," he added. When asked whether the goal of stronger climate-fighting ambition had been compromised for the deal, Mexico's chief climate negotiator Camila Zepeda summed up the mood among exhausted negotiators: "Probably. You take a win when you can." \</doc>

KEVIN O'SULLIVAN Environment and Science Editor The past eight years "are on track to be the eight warmest on record, fuelled by ever-rising greenhouse gas concentrations and accumulated heat", the latest assessment by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has found. The WMO warns that sea-level rises are accelerating and many glaciers have passed a tipping point, with melting set to continue for hundreds, if not thousands, of years with major implications for water security. The State of the Global Climate report, issued on the opening day of Cop27 in Egypt, is the definitive annual assessment of the Earth's climate. A series of other UN reports issued in the past fortnight confirmed the planet is heading for potentially catastrophic warming of 2.5 degrees this century and that all major greenhouse gases are at record levels in the atmosphere. The telltale signs and impacts of climate change are becoming more dramatic, the WMO adds. "The rate of sea level rise has doubled since 1993. It has risen by nearly 10mm since January 2020 to a new record high this year. The past two-and-a-half years alone account for 10 per cent of the overall rise in sea level since satellite measurements started nearly 30 years ago," it finds. The report shows the tipping point for some glaciers in the Alps has been passed; it is too late to save them and to prevent them adding to rising sea levels. The Greenland ice sheet lost mass for the 26th consecutive year, and it rained (rather than snowed) there for the first time in September. Some of the world's most famous glaciers - including in the Dolomites in Italy, the Yosemite and Yellowstone parks in the United States, and Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania - could disappear within 30 years due to global warming, whatever the temperature rise scenario, a Unesco report said on Friday. Disappear The UN cultural agency, which monitors 18,600 glaciers across 50 of its world heritage sites, said one-third of them were set to disappear by 2050 regardless of applied climate projections -because of current levels of warming. The global mean temperature in 2022 is estimated to be about 1.15 degrees above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average, the WMO confirms. A rare triple-dip cooling La Ni\'f1a means that 2022 is likely to "only" be fifth or sixth warmest. However, this does not reverse the long-term trend; it is only a matter of time until there is another warmest year on record. WMO secretary general Petteri Taalas said: "The greater the warming, the worse the impacts. We have such high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now that the lower 1.5 degree [target] of the Paris Agreement is barely within reach." UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said in response to the WMO findings: "As Cop27 gets under way, our planet is sending a distress signal. The latest State of the Global Climate report is a chronicle of climate chaos." As the WMO shows so clearly, he noted, "change is happening with catastrophic speed - devastating lives and livelihoods on every continent". "The past eight years have been the warmest on record, making every heatwave more intense and life-threatening, especially for vulnerable populations," he added. Sea levels are rising at twice the speed of the 1990s - posing an existential threat for low-lying island states, and threatening billions of people in coastal regions, Mr Guterres noted, adding he believed glacier melt was jeopardising water security for whole continents. "We must answer the planet's distress signal with action - ambitious, credible climate action. Cop27 \</doc>

The next UN climate chief will be Simon Stiell, the environment minister of Grenada, a surprise appointment that will cement the importance of holding global temperature rises to 1.5C. Mr Stiell will face the task of putting countries back on track to meet international climate goals at a time of rising geopolitical tensions and a global energy price crisis. Nations will meet for what is likely to be a fractious UN climate summit in Egypt, called Cop27 , in under three months. However, prospects of success are slim. Almost all countries agreed at last year's Cop26 meeting to focus on cutting greenhouse gas emissions in line with the 1.5C limit. Since then, though, the global consensus has fallen apart as Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sent gas prices soaring, adding to pressure on food prices and provoking a cost-of-living crisis around the world. Tensions between the world's two biggest emitters, China and the US, have also risen sharply in recent weeks. Beijing reacted to a visit to Taiwan by the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, by withdrawing co-operation with the US on climate issues. London School of Economics Grantham Institute director of policy Bob Ward said: "It is very good to have Simon Stiell's appointment confirmed well ahead of Cop27 , and the world will hope he can prevent further momentum from ebbing out of the international negotiations. He arrives at a critical moment, with the goal of limiting warming to 1.5C almost slipping from the world's grasp."  The Guardian \</doc>

A food system that "actually respects" every player in it must be reimagined, COP27 in Egypt heard in recent days. Speaking during a session on helping women and youth in agriculture build resilience against climate change, Nicoline de Haan, director of the CGIAR Gender Platform said that we must "reimagine our systems, we cannot continue as we are at the moment". "We need to start including everybody's voices and we need to continue listening and reflecting the voices and the needs of a whole group of people that have been silenced up to now," she told the event. "If we need to change our food system, we need to change how we value our food system - the norms and the values around our food system. "This brings us to gender, where we need to start reimagining our relationships between men and women and what men and women can do in this space. "The norms and values are often what keep gender issues from moving forward, so at the same time as climate change, at the same time as reimaging our food system, reimagine how we work between men and women in that space." She added that internationally, "we do still need more funding on even understanding gender in agriculture, and then the next step is youth". Closer to home, speaking in recent weeks on the vision for the future of farming in Ireland, Macra na Feirme national president John Keane said that dealing with climate change "provides an opportunity" for young farmers, "who will adopt the practices and the best solutions science has to offer". Mr Keane said that changes around age and gender in agriculture start "at the kitchen table". "The idea that the son or grandson or whoever might be the person automatically assumed to take over [the farm] is where the first part of the conversation needs to start," he said, "We need to create the narrative at home as much as anywhere else that we have equal opportunities for our sons or daughters coming after us." Mr Keane said that it must be ensured that more young women are being encouraged into agricultural education, "and providing opportunities for them to take on those opportunities more widely in agriculture", he told an Oireachtas committee meeting. "The membership of our agricultural affairs committee is nearly half and half. Our young women representatives on that are constantly coming forward and saying, £ddress the barriers that are there for young farmers and more of us will come through'. "Break down the barriers to young people and more of us young people and young women will see the opportunity that it creates in the sector." Developing role models for young people, particularly women, is also important, Mr Keane said. "It does not matter what farming enterprise you are in or what gender you are, the more young role models in the sector, the more opportunities are provided for somebody to say, 'I want to be like that. That is something I can pursue', alongside supports." Mr Keane acknowledged that the age profile of farmers "has been continually increasing" over the years. "If this continues unabated, we will experience what the church has experienced in recent years in its demise," he told politicians. "The lack of supports for young entrant farmers is tantamount to actively restricting access for new entrants to the industry. "If we continue on this path, we will in effect clear the land. The land will go back to being unproductive. "Allowing land to go fallow will increase our risk of food insecurity and not ensure that food is produced in the most sustainable way possible." With the number of farmers under the age of 35 standing currently at less than 5%, "fundamental change and targeted supports" are required to address the decreasing numbers of young farmers. "A mere 20 years ago, the percentage of farmers under 35 stood at 13%," Mr Keane said. "Bearing this in mind, can we really justify continuing with more of the same to address the issue of generational renewal? "This figure significantly increases when we look at those in more disadvantaged areas, especially those on uplands and peat soils." \</doc>

Each of the last eight years, if projections for 2022 hold, will be hotter than any prior to 2015, the UN has said, detailing a dramatic increase in the rate of global warming. Sea level rise, glacier melt, torrential rains, heat waves - and the deadly disasters they cause - have all accelerated, the World Meteorological Organization said in a report as the HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/news/2022/1106/1333447-cop27/ COP27 UN climate summit opened in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. "As COP27 gets under way, our planet is sending a distress signal," said UN chief Antonio Guterres, describing the report as "a chronicle of climate chaos". The UN's weather and climate body released its annual state of the global climate report with yet another warning that the target to limit temperature rises to 1.5C was "barely within reach". Countries agreed under the Paris climate treaty in 2015 to curb warming to "well below" 2C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, but a lack of action has led to warnings that the 1.5C goal is slipping away. The global average temperature in 2022 is estimated to be about 1.15C above levels seen in the 1850-1900 period, the WMO said. That puts 2022 on track to be the fifth or sixth warmest year on record, in the face of a rare triple-dip La Nina weather phenomenon in the Pacific which has naturally cooled global temperatures for the past two years. But the WMO warned that did not mean there was a reversal in the warming trend. The eight years since 2015 are likely to be the eight warmest years on record, and the impacts of global warming are becoming more pronounced. Glacier melt records were shattered in the European Alps, with average loss of three to four metres of ice thickness throughout the mountain range - substantially more than the previous record year of 2003. In Switzerland, 6% of the glace ice volume was lost between 2021 and 2022 and for the first time in history no snow lasted the summer, so there was no accumulation of fresh ice. Between 2001 and 2022, glacier ice in Switzerland has declined by more than a third. The report said a low snowpack at the end of winter, and repeated coverings of Saharan dust - which darkens the surface and encourages more melting - set the scene for unprecedented ice loss between May and September this year as a result of the heatwaves that hit Europe. The rate at which sea levels are rising has doubled since 1993, with the acceleration due to increasing ice melt, the WMO report said. Just since January 2020, sea levels have risen by nearly 10mm to a new record high this year. Ocean heat was at record levels in 2021, the last year assessed, while this year Arctic sea ice extent was below the long term average for most of the year, and Antarctic sea ice dropped to its lowest level on record in February. Below average rainfall for the past four years in East Africa has fuelled drought and a food crisis in the region, record breaking rain cause devastating flooding in Pakistan - and China and Europe, including the UK, were hit by record heatwaves and damaging drought and wildfires. And there was no let up in the greenhouse gases driving climate change, with the three main pollutants, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide reaching record levels in 2021 and monitoring shows they continued to rise in 2022, the WMO said. WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas said: "The greater the warming, the worse the impacts. "We have such high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now that the lower 1.5C of the Paris Agreement is barely within reach." He warned it was "already too late for many glaciers" and melting would continue for hundreds if not thousands of years, with major implications for water security. Sea level rises would add up to half a metre over a century, proving a long-term and major threat to many millions of coastal dwellers and low-lying states. And he said that while, all too often, those least responsible for climate change suffer most, even "well-prepared societies this year have been ravaged by extremes". Responding to the report, Mr Guterres said: "We must answer the planet's distress signal with action - ambitious, credible climate action. COP27 must be the place - and now must be the time."

IT WOULDN'T happen if women were in charge. That may be a slight over-simplification of how the forces of ruin were unleashed on the climate but Mary Robinson wasn't hiding her frustration at the gender imbalance among the world's heads of state. "I'm annoyed just seeing that photo from the opening day of the leaders here. Come on, 21st century?" she said of the almost exclusively male line-up at the world leaders' segment of COP27 . "I genuinely think if we had more women at the top table, we would have more empathy and understanding of why we need to fix a broken system that isn't prioritising the right things." As Ireland's first woman president, Ms Robinson is well qualified to speak on such matters. Since then she has been UN High Commissioner for Refugees and is now a global climate champion and chair of The Elders. She also runs an impressive spy network. Spy movies have it all wrong, you see. Key characters aren't all muscled males with hi-tech gadgets. In real life some of them are women of nearly 80 with a WhatsApp account. While busy at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt yesterday with multiple engagements and interviews, Ms Robinson was also keeping an eye on the G20 gathering of the world's richest economies in Bali. The news out of Indonesia was worrying in terms of the pledge the world's nations took in 2015 to cut greenhouse gas emissions sufficiently to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C. Rumblings that some big hitters were seeking to water down or drop the commitment in the "cover decision" that will emerge from COP27 have pushed anxiety levels among civil society groups and observers into overdrive. "I'm getting WhatsApps from the G20 where my spies are present and they're telling me that there's similar murmuring there as well so that worries me," Ms Robinson said. It has been a recurring theme at the summit. It started with warnings that 1.5C was barely alive, on life support, had a weak pulse. To continue the medical drama motif, there's talk that the pledge may not even be in the hospital but could be stuck on the roadside trying to flag down passing ambulances. Senior figures did little to settle nerves yesterday, with the host country's climate envoy, Wael Aboulmagd, answering questions about the condition of the patient with expert levels of evasion. Frans Timmerman, the EU's head of climate, was little clearer, telling reporters: "The EU is here to look forward, not backwards." Ms Robinson said she did not think 1.5C would necessarily disappear from the summit's closing decision but she was concerned about how watery the language might be and who might be diluting it. "We have a very big oil and gas and coal lobby here. It would be helpful to them obviously if 1.5 was no longer a target," she said. "They have been doing dangerous things to the world for years. Why wouldn't they do them here?" Not all industry is trying to maintain the status quo. Earlier in the day, Ms Robinson and Ireland's Climate Minister Eamon Ryan attended a session on business and climate and said she found many entrepreneurs fired up to progress the green economy. Mr Ryan found another beacon of positivity a while later in the renewable energy pavilion where ministers took the stage to announce plans for offshore wind farms under the Global Offshore Wind Alliance. One turn of one turbine produced the same energy as the solar panels on a house for a day, said the ebullient Australian minister. Three rotations would power the battery electric car, said the even more excited Belgian. It's like the offshore wind Olympics, remarked an aide, bemused at the competitive optimism. Sadly, the cheery vibes did not reach into every corner of the expansive venue. At the only open Russian event of the summit so far, protesters among the security-checked audience rose from their seats, shouting at the six ministers and officials, calling them war criminals. "Your climate commitments mean nothing," they shouted. "You're despicable. Your fossil fuels are killing people. You're killing my people." Some, but not all, of them were Ukrainians. UN security staff swiftly removed them and it is expected their accreditation will be revoked. The top table sat more stony-faced than the Easter Island sculptures and then resumed their presentations on melting permafrost and their strong belief in the use of nuclear energy as a clean energy. Given Ms Robinson's remarks earlier, it was hard not to notice that all six were men. Their president is not here, of course, but another absentee, newly elected Brazilian president Lula da Silva, has brought his prodigal country back into the COP fold after the Bolsonaro years and is due to give an address today. Lula's election had been generally welcomed by climate campaigners as, unlike his predecessor, he has some appreciation of the need to maintain what's left of that great global lung, the Amazon rainforest. He has even put in a pitch to host COP29 after the United Arab Emirates do the honours next year. But at the same time, he is one of the leaders widely reported to be upsetting the negotiations on the cover decision that is meant to be agreed by close of business on Friday. Some are arguing for exclusion of references to 1.5C, some for a softening of existing commitments on climate finance for poor countries, and some for a very fuzzy position on the proposed new loss and damage fund for nations hit by climate-related disasters. Lula was reported to be questioning the need for a cover decision at all this year. That's men for you. 'They have been doing dangerous things for years. Why wouldn't they do them here?' \</doc>

Turning food waste, sewage, and livestock manure and slurries into biogas and biofertilisers could rapidly deliver 50% of the Global Methane Pledge, the World Biogas Association (WBA) said at Cop27 this week. Reducing methane from oil and g as, agriculture, and waste is regarded as the single most effective strategy to limit global warming to 1.5C. Producing enough green gas at the same time to replace one third of natural gas consumption looks like a nobrainer, especially for the 100 countries who signed the Global Methane Pledge at Cop26, among them Ireland, agreeing to reduce manmade methane by at least 30% in 10 years. Biogas is a carbon-neutral renewable g as made from farm produce and effluent, and any organic waste, through anaerobic digestion (AD). About 3% of Ireland's agricultural area, and 20% of all cattle slurry, could be needed if the biogas industry takes off in Ireland, according to Teagasc energy specialist Barry Caslin. There is interest among landowners, with Gas Networks Ireland (GNI) revealing it has received over 130 expressions of interest from Ireland's dozen or so current and future biogas producers. They would be enough to generate eight Terawatt-hours (TWh) of biomethane. However, the Government's target for biomethane production is only 5.7 TWh (which would satisfy about 10% of current Irish natural gas demand). With pressure coming on Ireland's dairy and livestock farmers from climate action plans, biogas is an obvious alternative enterprise of interest to landowners. However, the biogas industry throughout Europe has depended on government support for its establishment. So far, our Government has allocated only 3m, in Budget 2023, but it has a target of 150 to 200 operational anaerobic digestion (AD) plants by 2030. They won't be springing up overnight; on average, an AD plant has a lead-in time of three to four years. On the demand side, GNI wants to replace its natural gas fossil fuel with biome-thane made from biogas, from farm and food materials. Biomethane can seamlessly replace natural gas on the network. GNI already has biomethane in the network, but it's less than 1% of its gas. It already has planning permission to build a large central gas injection point. GNI has launched a Request for Information process to help identify new and feasible biomethane production projects. An information event on November 29 at the Clayton Hotel, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4, will be hosted by GNI. Most commercial biogas plants in Europe are larger than 200 cubic metres per hour, the estimated output required to be economically viable. They also produce biodigestate fertiliser, which can replace artificial fertiliser on farms. Pressure to get going with biogas is also coming from the EU, where the REPowerEU strategy calls for nearly a 12-fold increase from three trillion to 35trn cubic meters of biomethane annually by the year 2030, to help replace Russian gas. The European Commission has said Ireland has the best agri-feedstock per capita in Europe for biogas. Environment Minister Eamonn Ryan believes in agricultural biogas. "The agriculture sector in this country is very much geared towards grass growth. However, they could take half of that grass growth and feed it into anaerobic digestion, mixed with waste products, and the slurry from the remaining herd on the other side of the farm. "That process, if adopted by our agricultural sector on a wide scale, can give us a source of gas which is potentially sustainable. You could have a farm producing its own gas, running it sown machinery, running a combined heat and power plant off it for its own use, and still have an export capability. With that, you still have a real potential to use the digestate to fertilise the land, rather than synthetic, artificial, fossil-based fertilisers. From that, you can then start to get a circular, sustainable solution which delivers on climate, helps with biodiversity, and helps with pollution." Industrial sources point to biogas being the only non-intermittent renewable fuel source, unlike wind, solar, or hydrogen from renewable electricity (a blend of biomethane and green hydrogen is set to be an important future fuel). Conversion of residues from cattle farming into energy in biogas plants is a standout option for reducing methane from livestock, while also delivering renewable energy. One of the advantages is that storing the slurry gastight in a biogas plant can hugely reduce emissions compared to conventional slurry storage. It is somewhat ironic in view of these advantages for biogas that some environmentalists oppose this new industry. In Germany, the World Wide Fund for Nature, which works to reduce human impacts on the environment, opreplace poses biogas expansion because it sees a risk of farmers focusing too much on energy crop monocultures at the expense of food production. This is one of the lessons Ireland can take on board, by virtue of it being a biogas laggard, watching on as the industry expands rapidly in other EU member states. Does Ireland want to follow the example of biogas leader Germany, which has almost 9,800 of the EU's 20,000 biogas plants? An estimated 1.3m of Germany's 16.6m hectares of farmland produces material for biogas, the vast majority from maize. But investment has slowed, with developers citing "excessive legal requirements" and long waits for building permits. They often fear that a new market or political framework two years down the road can leave them stranded. In Denmark, the EU's No 2 biogas producer, biogas is part of a plan for a fully decarbonised gas grid by 2035, even though it began as a way of minimising landspreading of slurry. Denmark has over 200 operating production plants, more than 85% of which are farmbased. Biogas is 25% of the natural gas market, but on some days, 100% of its gas use is renewable. Energy crops are not used. Instead, 25% of manure from farms goes through a biogas plant, with a 2030 target of 60%, and plans to ban land spreading of raw slurry from 2035. France could produce 130 TWh of biogas (more than a third of its gas consumption) from its 160m tonnes of livestock effluent per year. Small digesters have been installed on French farms for 10 years without much resistance, but bigger infrastructures have met systematic pushback from residents. France has a rule that crops for anaerobic digestion cannot exceed 15% on any farm. WBA's chief executive Charlotte Morton said at Cop27 : "AD is a mature technology that can be deployed within a few years. It takes two years to build a plant if the right regulatory framework is in place. What is urgently needed now is for countries to put in place that regulatory framework, including the organic waste collection infrastructure necessary to ensure these wastes go to AD for treatment." The WBA estimates that 19% of global man-made methane emissions come from rotting wastes; 49% from livestock, rice farms and industrial processes; and 20% from the oil and gas sector. It says full deployment of AD and biogas would create 11m to 15m jobs worldwide. \</doc>

IRELAND has no excuse not to live up to its climate action promises, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney has said. He said, unlike many other countries, Ireland had the wealth and resources to make the changes necessary to cut greenhouse gas emissions. People would be right to be critical if that did not happen, he added. Mr Coveney was speaking after a day-long visit to the COP27 climate summit in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Ireland has come to the summit with strong climate commitments but a failure to cut emissions which have grown over the past year. Mr Coveney accepted the country had to do better. "The Government is under no illusions in terms of the challenge that we face in that. But we do have a very credible plan to get us where we need to be which is reducing emissions year after year. "I think in the future you will see COPs effectively holding countries like Ireland to account in terms of delivering on what we promised to do. "In Ireland we don't even need a COP to remind us of that because we have legislation. We have a legal obligation to deliver on those targets. "I think if Ireland doesn't manage to achieve delivery of those targets, then people will be rightly critical. "When you compare us to the challenge that many other less developed countries face and the resources that they have to meet those challenges, really there's no excuse for Ireland not to act with urgency and to be effective." Earlier in the day, the minister met with senior figures from one such country when he held talks with the prime minister of Somalia. Ireland has given an extra (EURO)30m in aid to the country where prolonged drought has left millions facing famine. "When you look at the pressures some countries are under, whether they're small island developing states where people are having to be relocated away from rising sea levels, or whether it's a country like Somalia where people are seeing a fifth season in a row with no rain, you begin to realise that this is not an academic discussion. It's one that is brutal in its impact," he said. Mr Coveney also met with Egyptian foreign minister, COP27 president. They discussed progress to date at the summit, where the issue of "loss and damage" compensation payments by rich carbon-polluting countries to poor climate-damaged nations is contentious. He said this was a "legitimate ask" and Ireland was working with its EU partners to try to respond. "I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement on that by the end of next week," Mr Coveney added. \</doc>

THE COP27 summit cannot be a "talking shop", junior minister for Overseas Development Aid Colm Brophy said. Mr Brophy, who is due to arrive at the climate talks in Sharm El Sheikh today, said it would be "wholly unacceptable" if it ended without concrete action. "The drought in the Horn of Africa is climate change in action," he said. "I visited Kenya recently and saw first-hand how climate change is condemning millions of people to suffering and hunger. "It would be wholly unacceptable for Governments around the world to descend on COP and not take concrete and practical action to alleviate the tragedy that is being played out in the Horn of Africa, and also in places like Pakistan that have experienced devastating flooding this year. "We can't afford a talking shop. The people I met in Kenya deserve more. They deserve climate change finally being given the political attention it so urgently needs." During his two-day trip, Mr Brophy will hold meetings with delegations from the Horn of Africa, including Somalia, where the drought has hit hardest. He will also meet officials from Senegal, one of Ireland's priority countries for development aid in West Africa. Tomorrow he will join former president Mary Robinson for a roundtable discussion with climate activists hosted by the International Federation of the Red Cross. He will also meet his counterparts from Malawi and attend events on climate and security, climate finance and agriculture in developing countries. He arrives as discussions over "loss and damage" funding for climate-harmed developing countries is gaining momentum. Scientists and campaigners behind the "Climate Clock" project released analysis yesterday that showed the debt owned by carbon-polluting rich nations to climate-damaged poorer countries was more than $30trn ((EURO)29.5trn) and growing. "The Climate Clock's loss and damage calculation is far larger than what is currently being discussed at COP27 negotiations," said Ian Mitchell, senior fellow at the Centre for Global Development and lead author of the research underpinning the figures. "Traditional figures tend to focus only on the damage from individual extreme weather events, or relate only to annual climate finance commitments from developed countries. But our new estimates take into account the full scale of the damage that emissions will cause." The campaign group has erected a "lighthouse" at the summit venue with its now famous climate clock counting down to 2030 - the deadline by which countries pledged in 2015 to take action that would limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. Activists from other NGOs also staged a short demonstration at the summit, calling for decisive action on the loss and damage issue. Loss and damage is on a COP agenda for the first time - an indication of the strengthening voices of African countries and other states from the global south. However, expectations of a major breakthrough in terms of commitments from wealthy countries remain low. \</doc>

10 of the world's largest dairy firms pledge to cut emissions, writes Kathleen O'Sullivan For the dairy industry, sustainability is a "pre-competitive issue", and countries must share information so that there can be a global benefit from the knowledge that is generated, COP27 heard in recent days. The dairy sector informed the conference of the progress underway as part of the global Pathways to Dairy Net Zero effort, the first of its kind in agriculture in terms of size and scope. More than 140 org anisations and governments, including the 10 largest dairy companies in the world, have pledged support to Pathways to Dairy Net Zero, which was launched in September last year. These supporters comprise more than 40% of global dairy production. The movement is dedicated to reducing dairy's greenhouse gas emissions over the next 30 years. Dairy Industry Ireland, Dairygold, and Glanbia are among those supporting the initiative. "Dairy is a major force for good in the world, especially when you consider how the sector helps provide important nutrition to the hungry and malnourished and helps build strong, resilient economies," according to Global Dairy Platform chair Hein Schumacher. "By systematically introducing and enhancing climate action in global dairy systems, dairy is tackling the challenge and making progress in reducing our impact on the planet." Research commissioned as part of Pathways to Dairy Net Zero has identified six primary dairy production systems throughout the world, along with potential mitigation options and their estimated impact on emissions reduction. The research is led by the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases in close collaboration with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). They have defined the composition of greenhouse gas emissions emitted by the various dairy production systems around the world and learned there is variability by system. For instance, methane is a large proportion of greenhouse gas emissions in pastoral and agropastoral systems, driven largely by enteric fermentation. However, high-input, highoutput production emits a different mix of greenhouse gases from not only enteric fermentation but also manure management, animal feed, and energy use. According to the initiative, this work is critical because each gas has a different effect and unique longevity in the atmosphere. For instance, methane is a highly potent gas that breaks down in the atmosphere in 12 years. Other gases, such as carbon dioxide, can remain in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. Although mitigation options will vary by each dairy production system, some of the primary pathways include improving animal health, increasing feed digestibility, enhanced manure storage and treatment, more efficient fertiliser use, and the potential adoption of methane-inhibiting feed additives. Brian Lindsay of the Dairy Sustainability Framework, during a panel discussion at COP27 , said that the dairy sector is "very ambitious" with its sustainability targets. "It's about demonstrating progress, monitoring, and reporting," he said. "We need to know the progress we're making, but we also need to know if we're not making progress. "Therefore we can collaborate as an industry looking at the diverse systems we have around the world, monitoring those, looking at how we can support each other." The Dairy Sustainability Framework is "pre-competitive and collaborative", Mr Lindsay said, and it invites members to share knowledge "so we can all move faster forward in our sustainability credentials". "We monitor over 11 sustainability criteria in the three pillars of sustainability, not just the environmental, we do the social and the economic as well. "It's really important we understand the interactions between the different criteria to make sure that solving one doesn't cause unintended consequences in another. "The monitoring and reporting enable us to make informed decisions, engage in dialogue about those who want to have policy decisions about dairy around the world, we have the data. "We're now reporting on over 30% of global milk production, which equates to over 52% of global formal milk production, recognising that not all milk does go through formal channels." The framework's aggregating members include Bord Bia, while its implementing members include Glanbia and Lakeland Dairies. Affiliate members include Herdwatch and Ornua. "A water project in Egypt may just help a Californian dairy farmer and an Australian dairy farmer, it's about sharing that knowledge." While companies are "fiercely competitive" in the marketplace, Mr Lindsay said, for the dairy industry, sustainability is a "pre-competitive issue, we share this information so we can all benefit from knowledge that we generate". The FAO reports that during the period from 2005 to 2015, the global dairy sector's emission intensity declined by 11%. \</doc>

FOR almost three decades the United Nations has called together the leaders of near enough every nation on Earth to discuss the growing realisation that our planet is literally burning and we are all on borrowed time. The good news is that over that time the issue has gone from a peripheral one, seized on only by zealots, to a central matter for global debate, with fewer and fewer "climate deniers" wielding a dwindling amount of influence. The better news is that many leading nations have signed up to a series of ambitious measures to tackle this urgent crisis. Against that, the harsh reality is that too many key emitter nations of harmful carbon have hung back from the process. Worse again, the keenness with which some governments have endorsed emissions reduction targets has not been matched by real action. The process is known as COP, short for Conference of the Parties, and yesterday the 27th such conference formally began at the Egyptian luxury resort of Sharm El Sheikh. The sumptuous venue is juxtaposed with the human-created destruction being wrought a little further south on the continent of Africa, and elsewhere in parts of Asia. The crude reality is that the countries, which by and large contributed least to this crisis, are already suffering most via drought, extreme weather leading to flooding, and other problems like rapidly rising sea levels. The heavy toll on animal and plant life also is hard to overstate. This 13-day COP27 At the last gathering in Glasgow, participating nations agreed that they would submit more ambitious carbon-reduction targets for this conference. But it has emerged that only 24 nations have submitted these revised higher targets. Neither is the backdrop to this gathering in Egypt very encouraging in other respects. The northern and more developed nations - which in effect created this crisis via ill-conceived industrial and agriculture developments - are stricken by an energy crisis largely driven by Vladimir Putin's illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine. This is coupled with spiralling inflation which began with post-Covid disruption of the global goods supply chain. Nations in the global south have grounds for arguing that these "first world problems" pale when compared with the problems they are continually struggling against. These countries will ramp up their arguments for funding to cope with loss and damage. All this brings us to question what role, if any, smaller nations - including Ireland - can have at such a potentially discordant meeting of global leaders. The simple answer is that Ireland and the others must also show moral leadership on tackling climate change. More significantly, despite those extra difficulties caused by a war-driven energy crisis, we must as a nation act on promises made. That is the unavoidable challenge for us all. Amid the likely discord at COP27 , these countries can exert a moral influence Load-Date: \~November 7, 2022 \</doc>

ON Monday, 20,000 delegates arrived in Montreal for COP15: the UN biodiversity summit. 'Another one?' I can already hear people asking, 'Didn't we just have a COP?' It's easy to see why some would be confused: COP15 comes just two weeks after COP27 , but the two are not to be conflated. The acronym COP stands for Conference of the Parties, and the COP that most people are familiar with is organised by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The climate COP is, unsurprisingly, all about countries tackling climate change and global warming. Not to be confused with COP27 , COP15 is organised by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD). The CBD COP, as it is also called, focuses on biodiversity decline and protection. Unlike the annual COPs focused on climate change (hosted in Egypt this year and Glasgow last year, for example), the biodiversity COP only takes place every two years. This year is the second phase of COP15, as the first phase took place online last year. The overall aim is to make progress with 'The Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework': to reverse biodiversity loss by 2030. Other big issues on the agenda include drilling into the 30 pledge: to protect 30% of the world's land and seas by 2030, and mobilising climate finance for biodiversity. This money would come from wealthy countries, responsible for current and historic land use, and Brazil has already called for high-income nations to establish a global biodiversity fund. Lastly, the biodiversity COP provides an opportunity to privilege and platform the voices of indigenous peoples, who comprise 5% of the global population and safeguard 85% of the planet's biodiversity. Hopefully, the biodiversity COP will also build on funding packages and agreements from the climate COP. In Sharm el-Sheikh last month, the term "nature-based solutions" was included for the first time in the final text, having been removed from the Glasgow Climate Pact the year before. Nature-based solutions involve working with nature to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change (think tree planting, living walls, green roofs and peatland restoration). Given that 18% land mass in Northern Ireland is covered by peatland, we are in a unique position to champion these kinds of nature-based solutions. Our politicians should therefore pay close attention to COP15, because nature recovery will be crucial if we are to meet our own climate targets. Beyond thinking about what key issues will be raised at COP15, it is interesting to think about whether having two separate COPs is worthwhile. Having only attended climate COPs and never a biodiversity COP, I feel less able to make an informed judgment, but when I asked others in the environmental movement, it was clear that opinion was divided. The media often talk about the climate crisis without mentioning the nature crisis, and there is a strong argument for having a conference solely focused on biodiversity, as nature rarely gets a mention in climate COPs. Each COP tends to focus on one 'cover' issue, and having two COPs therefore creates more of an opportunity to effectively 'cover' multiple issues. There are certainly some more technical, but important, issues which would not have gained prominence if it were not for a separate biodiversity COP, such as plastic pollution and invasive species. Even topics that should be mainstream, like agriculture and land use, get overlooked at climate COPs, and a separate COP allows these issues to be elevated. In terms of decision making, a combined climate and biodiversity COP could dilute the processes and aims of each. We already know how challenging it is for 196 countries to reach consensus at COPs, and perhaps adding more issues to the agenda would complicate this further. This feels especially true for this year, as COP15 has already been postponed several times due to the pandemic, and there is concern that if there was no separate conference for biodiversity, we would have no chance of meeting biodiversity targets. On the other hand, it feels obvious to point out that both COPs are intricately connected. The opening line of the Biodiversity COP15 cover note literally reads 'In delivering on biodiversity, we deliver on climate'. Having two UN conferences can make it feel like climate and biodiversity are two different issues, but really biodiversity cannot be considered in isolation to climate adaptation and resilience. The soil, oceans and forests are valuable carbon sinks, which help us achieve our emission reduction goals and limit global warming. Restoring just 15% converted lands in priority areas could also sequester 300 gigatonnes of CO2 - that's 14% of all CO2 emissions released since industrial revolution. Simply put, we won't be able to achieve our climate goals without protecting and restoring biodiversity. Taking place two years later than planned, it feels like a separate COP for biodiversity is much needed this year, although it is unfortunate timing for the organisers - overshadowed by the World Cup, and off the back of a disappointing COP27 . Going forward, there is clearly a need for more formalised links between the two COPs, but in some ways, whether we have two separate or one combined feels irrelevant when neither COP is working in its current format. Both climate COP and biodiversity COP are failing to achieve their objectives, and what we need is a complete revision of COP processes. Without this change, there is no way that either COP will reach the outcomes needed. \</doc>

CORMAC McQUINN Political Correspondent Almost a quarter of the measures in the Government's Climate Action Plan have been delayed, according to the latest update on Ireland's attempts to tackle climate change. Coalition leaders said efforts must be accelerated after the latest update showed that targets for 23 per cent of the actions due for completion by the end of September were missed. Delayed "high-impact" measures include developing plans for managing the environmental footprint of the beef and dairy sectors and the rollout of a strategy to increase uptake of electric vehicles. A Government statement said 77 per cent of measures were implemented, but it added there was a need to overcome delays: "not least against the backdrop of severe climate change impacts witnessed" in the third quarter of this year. The Climate Action Plan Progress Report highlights extreme weather events that occurred across the world this year including devastating floods in Pakistan and heatwaves in Europe that drove up excess deaths by 53,000 people. Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin responded to the report saying he had highlighted the need for urgency during his address to the recent Cop27 climate summit in Egypt. "Every delay makes our task that bit bigger, and we need to translate our ambition into rapid action," he said. T\'e1naiste Leo Varadkar said significant progress was made in implementing the Climate Action Plan in the third quarter of the year but that "it's clear we need to accelerate action in order to achieve our ambitious climate goals". Solutions Green Party leader and Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan said Ireland had played a "huge role" at the Cop27 summit and that "here at home we need to focus on high-impact climate solutions that urgently address mitigation". He said the report demonstrated clearly that "we still have a lot of work to do". Mr Ryan said the recently approved programme of carbon budgets and sectoral emission ceilings provided a strong pathway for efforts to meet Ireland's 2030 and 2050 climate action targets. The Government is developing an updated climate action plan which is due to be published before the end of the year. Further "high-impact" measures delayed as of the end of September included publishing a 10-year strategy for the haulage sector; developing an approach to retrofitting commercial buildings; and determining the appropriate model for the development and ownership of district heating systems. In total there are 166 delayed measures. "Delays in climate action must be overcome to meet national and EU emissions reduction obligations," the report says. Key reasons for delays cited by Government departments include capacity and capability constraints across the public sector; lengthy stakeholder consultation processes; and the complexity of climate action delivery. By department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had the lowest delivery rate at 56 per cent, completing nine of 16 measures. The Department of the Environment had a lower than average delivery rate of 68 per cent, with 139 of 204 measures completed. A source said the department had the most actions and biggest targets to meet and was dealing with issues of the most complexity in the midst of trying to respond to the energy crisis. The Departments of Education; Higher Education; Foreign Affairs; Rural Development; and Social Protection all had a 100 per cent delivery rate. The Departments of the Taoiseach and Agriculture were both on 81 per cent. \</doc>

BRITISH prime minister Rishi Sunak has reversed his decision to skip the COP27 climate summit in Egypt next week, bowing to pressure from activists, his own environment adviser, and even from Boris Johnson. Mr Sunak accepted there is "no long-term prosperity without action on climate change" as he confirmed he will attend the UN talks in Sharm El Sheikh that start on Sunday. Mr Sunak had been declining to go, arguing that he needed to focus on the "depressing domestic challenges" as he worked on the autumn budget with UK finance minister Jeremy Hunt. Downing Street said he changed his mind after making "good progress" ahead of the financial statement - but the UK Labour Party accused him of having been "dragged kicking and screaming into doing the right thing". Mr Sunak announced his attendance the morning after Mr Johnson, one of his predecessors in No 10, confirmed he will be going to Egypt. "I was invited by the Egyptians so I'm very happy to go," Mr Johnson told Sky News. "There is no long-term prosperity without action on climate change," Mr Sunak tweeted. "There is no energy security without investing in renewables. That is why I will attend @COP27P next week: to deliver on Glasgow's legacy of building a secure and sustainable future." Mr Johnson chose not to publicly criticise Mr Sunak's initial refusal to attend, but said in an interview broadcast on Tuesday that he would attend, to discuss "how we see things in the UK" given he has a "particular interest". Mr Sunak's official spokesman insisted the decision to go was only made after making good progress on the November 17 autumn budget. "We wanted to be sure we were making good progress on the domestic agenda." COP26 president Alok Sharma, who presided over the event in Glasgow last year, welcomed Mr Sunak's reversal, saying he "completely" agrees with his comments that climate action is required to secure long-term prosperity. Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said the U-turn was "embarrassing", adding Mr Sunak had to be "dragged kicking and screaming into doing the right thing". Shadow climate secretary Ed Miliband said Mr Sunak had agreed to go "to avoid embarrassment, not to provide leadership" and added: "The guy is a phoney." Despite No 10's U-turn, King Charles is still not planning to attend COP27 . Buckingham Palace said that there was "unanimous agreement" with the government that it is not right for Charles - a long-standing environmental campaigner - to go. \</doc>

Campaigners hoping biodiversity summit can produce 'Paris Agreement for nature' Environment Correspondent Mary Robinson is among four former heads of state who have criticised the failure of world leaders to attend a major UN biodiversity summit in Canada next month. The campaign has called on world leaders to "protect at least 30% of the planet by 2030" in a bid to stave off even more biodiversity loss. Up to a million wild species f ace extinction, many within decades, leaving billions of people who rely on them for food and income exposed as the biodiversity crisis worsens, a report from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services revealed earlier this year. A separate study in one of the world's foremost scientific journals found that almost a third of species are either gone or have been threatened with extinction in the last 500 years. Campaign for Nature has called on world leaders to attend the Montreal event, the same as they did at the cur re nt Cop27 climate change summit in Egypt. Ms Robinson, a member of the advisory committee of the Campaign for Nature, joined other former presidents, prime ministers, and UN figures in the call. "Cop15 is the most important global summit for nature this decade," a joint statement from the Campaign for Nature advisors read. "A 10-year global biodiversity framework should be agreed, but negotiations are way off track and there are serious concerns about the capacity of officials to find common ground without a clear indication from the highest level that it is a priority. "Having government leaders there is essential to elevate this crisis to the level it deserves with officials, the media, the public, and importantly to send a clear signal to investors and shareholders that the world is united in an ambition to end the devastating business as usual." They said the Cop15 summit should be akin to the Paris Agreement for nature. The 2015 agreement set the 1.5C temperature increase limit goal. "The Paris Agreement was achieved because, despite great differences between nations, leaders came from every continent, understanding the political significance and importance of finding compromises through decisions that only they can make on very short timelines," they stated. "As ex heads of state and ministers and UN leaders, we know how important the leaders' presence can make to these summits." Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin has previously said that climate change and biodiversity are intrinsically linked, and must be tackled simultaneously. Political leaders have not taken the biodiversity crisis seriously enough despite ample warnings from environmental experts, he said in June. Giving the keynote address at the National Biodiversity Conference in Dublin Castle, Mr Martin said it was a "great mistake of our species to think that we are separate from nature". "I do sense a deepening acceptance, a growing realisation, that our fortunes as a species and as a society, are inseparable from the fortunes of the natural world," he said. \</doc>

TALKS at COP27 aimed at forging global agreement on climate action have run into overtime after stalemate on key issues. Negotiations went on late last night and were due to resume early this morning but with little expectation of conclusion before the end of the day at the earliest. Climate Minister Eamon Ryan is representing Ireland at the summit and is also leading talks on behalf of the EU on one of the deadlocked issues - loss and damage funding for climate-harmed countries. He said last night he could not predict the result. The talks are stuck on a number of issues. There is disagreement on the wording around fossil fuels, with many of the 197 countries present wanting a strengthening of the commitment at COP26 last year to "phase down" coal use. They want the wording changed to "phase out" and for it to also cover oil and gas. A draft text of the "cover decision" or end agreement circulated by COP27 's Egyptian presidency yesterday morning did not reflect this. The addition of a clause that a phase down should be "in line with national circumstances" weakened the COP26 pledge, critics said. Loss and damage is the most divisive issue. The G77 group of 134 developing countries wants a new fund set up to pay for damage caused by sudden and slow-onset climate-related destruction. The largest, wealthiest nations balked at this proposal for 30 years and kept it off the formal agenda until this year. The EU presented what was intended to be a compromise, agreeing to set up a fund with several conditions, including that it be used primarily for the most vulnerable countries. That quickly drew objections. The EU proposal also seeks to pull in finance from a wide variety of sources for the fund, including from imposing levies on fossil fuel companies, aviation and shipping. That proposal surprised many, and critics described it as a distraction or an attempt to wriggle out of taking full financial responsibility - a claim Mr Ryan denied. The EU is also seeking to tie the loss and damage fund to a greater ambition on cutting greenhouse gas emissions on the basis that the faster emissions fall, the slower climate change happens and the less losses and damages occur. That too faced objections given the failure of most countries to improve on their emission cuts targets despite committing to do so a year ago. After initial strong words about taking firm action, the US stance has been weakened by the victory of the anticlimate action Republican party in the mid-term elections. A US response to the proposals is expected this morning. \</doc>

MARIE DONNELLY, chair of the Climate Change Advisory Council, has concerns about the slow pace of climate action after attending COP27 . A switch to electric cookers could happen much faster. "We should switch out of gas cooking sooner rather than later and move to electric because gas cooking is emitting emissions - and moisture," Ms Donnelly said. "It's not actually very healthy. It is replaceable. There is an alternative that everybody has access to. So maybe we could start with gas cookers, and then think about gas boilers." Jump into the shallows "Retrofit is hugely important. But right now, even the shallow retrofit is important. "If you haven't put the insulation in your attic by now, please go out there and get the insulation. "Check your doors and windows for drafts. Think about it in terms of how you can save yourself money." Reduce your use Using electricity more efficiently would help with emissions and costs. "At least we have communication about 'reduce your use' but we could do an awful lot more," she said. "We really need to crank up things like smart meters and the tariffs that go with smart meters so that people have a choice and they can use electricity at the cheapest point in time." Embrace renewables "I'm 100pc a supporter of offshore wind, but we have onshore wind and we have onshore solar. A lot more of both are needed now." Reallocate road space "We need to shift demand in the transport sector. Even if every part of the country was electric, we cannot have 2.5 million cars on our roads. "So number one, reallocation of road space. Give the streets back to people would be my message in the transport space." Stop funding fossil fuels "If I had my way, the first, the middle and the last item on the agenda would be to stop all funding of fossil fuel exploration. We've found enough. We don't need any more. My message to Irish banks is 'come clean on what you invest in and then be able to stand over it'." Stick with 1.5C There are murmurings at COP27 about countries backtracking on the pledge to keeping global temperature rise to 1.5C. "1.5 is a very difficult objective. But what's the point of having a target that isn't a stretch target? We have got to aim for it. If we miss it by a little, that's fine. But if (we) weaken it at this stage we'll definitely miss it." Remember the reason "I was at an event for the Marshall Islands. 1.5 is extinction for them. 1.5 for us is a warm summer. We have to put it into perspective. Understand it's not just your own little patch." \</doc>

W E are coming to the end of the second week of COP27 , but we haven't seen much progress and the mood surrounding the conference feels relatively low. Unlike Glasgow, we haven't heard many big announcements, although this isn't necessarily a bad thing, as COP27 should be about less words, more action. COP27 has been coined the 'Implementation COP', and what implementation really means is money. This COP is about mobilising flows of finance to support countries most impacted by the climate crisis, helping them to adapt to the impacts of climate breakdown, and invest in the infrastructure and resources that they need. Despite its name, though, we haven't seen much implementation at COP, which has led to disappointment and frustration. As the conference draws to a close, one of the central questions on people's minds is whether this COP process is actually working? Are COPs sufficient to meet the urgency of the crisis? Do they truly elicit the best collective outcome for the whole community? Or is there a more effective method of achieving public good? Changing the rules of the UN decision-making system is a huge ask and thinking about its origins would be a good place to start. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is its body focused on facilitating international collaboration between countries to tackle climate change. It was born of a treaty signed by the UN member states at the 1992 Earth Summit and the early work of the organisation was about establishing international agreement on mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Until 2015, the Kyoto Protocol provided the framework for much of the UNFCCC's work, and this included legally binding emissions reduction targets - but the Kyoto Protocol proved to be largely insufficient. The 2016 Paris Agreement then tried to push countries to raise ambition levels and move faster by including the introduction of a ratcheting up mechanism for emissions reductions. A key element of this was also differing responsibilities for developed and developing nations and enabling financing structures for countries that are experiencing the worst effects of climate change. The unifying thread to COPs has been the principle of consensus, and unanimity is considered a hugely important part of the COP process. The assumption is that unanimity between countries makes the process democratic, but this seems true in theory rather than practice. For instance, the blocking powers of wealthy nations consistently stall negotiations or veto proposals, like what is currently happening in Egypt over the issue of loss and damage. Is unanimity, then, really enabling democracy? Take last year as an example, when over 130 countries pushed for the creation of a loss and damage finance facility in Glasgow. This demand was blocked by the EU, UK and USA. That's 15% of the global population making decisions that determine the futures of 85% of the global population. Again, is this truly democratic? Thinking about the composition of COP delegations also suggests that the process is inequality by design. For instance, wealthier G7 nations have much larger delegations and some of their negotiators are better resourced because the countries have more funding to train their negotiators. By contrast, poorer nations have much smaller delegations, some of whom have not attended many COPs before, and are less familiar with how the process works. It goes without saying that this is not the case for every delegation, but when the objective of each country is to make their voice heard in the final text (whether it be the Paris Agreement, Glasgow Pact or whatever the Sharm El Sheikh text will ultimately be called), levers of power will shape what is ultimately communicated. The question of who the United 'Nations' (UN) and Conference of the 'Parties' (COP) represents and benefits has been around for years, but it is certainly making itself felt in Egypt. Some 25% of the world lives on less than $3.65 a day, and they don't have a say in any of this. I'm not arguing for the COP process to be scrapped - they can be a mechanism for change and have a unique ability to bring together 196 countries - but it's the 27th year of trying the same thing. A system which was designed at a different period, for different purposes and which does not currently match up to the scale and speed of action required. A better method which could achieve better outcomes faster exists, and we need to move towards it. Where there is no neat and unified suggestion or solution, one thing is clear: if we are to modify or rethink the way COPs work, some dilution of the power of the 'party' in service of the goal of survival is essential. Progress has been achieved with the current system, but we must acknowledge that we no longer have the luxury of time. High-level diplomacy and negotiations have their place, but the clock is ticking, and we're on a "highway to hell with our foot on the accelerator", as the UN secretary general Antonio Guterres put it. You can't negotiate with climate breakdown. \</doc>

RISHI Sunak's whistle-stop visit to the Cop27 climate summit in Egypt marked his first outing on the international stage since he entered No 10 a fortnight ago. For a new Prime Minister who is relatively untested in diplomatic matters, the trip, speeches and string of meetings, all squeezed into one hectic day, appeared to go smoothly. Here is a look at his notable moments at the major UN summit. \£6 Chummy chat with Macron Mr Sunak's first in-person tete-atete with French President Emmanuel Macron started with a warm embrace, wide grins and convivial back slaps. "Very nice to see you," Mr Sunak told the French leader. "Lots for us to talk about, right?" he added as the pair prepared for a full bilateral meeting. Mr Macron jogged towards Mr Sunak when he first saw him, appearing pleased to have left the more strained "friend or foe" era of Anglo-French relations under Liz Truss behind. Mr Sunak's predecessor in No 10 caused controversy when she said "the jury's out" when asked which one the French president represented. \£6 National statement Mr Sunak struck an optimistic tone as he took to the world stage for the first time at the UN summit. In his key speech to the gathering of world leaders, the Prime Minister told a cavernous hall from the stage: "By honouring the promises we made in Glasgow and by directing public and private finance towards the protection of our planet, we can turn our struggle against climate change into a global mission for new jobs and clean growth. "And we can bequeath our children a greener planet and a more prosperous future. "That's a legacy we could be proud of. So as we come together once again in common cause today, there really is room for hope." \£6 Refusing to be upstaged by Boris Johnson Mr Sunak said it was "great" that Mr Johnson was also at the summit. Mr Johnson saying he would attend Cop27 added pressure on the PM to reverse his widely-criticised decision to skip it to focus on domestic issues. Mr Johnson used a conference fringe event to warn Tories against going soft on climate change targets as he suggested that rising temperatures in Westminster may have contributed to his ousting. "Oh, it's great that the former prime minister is here," Mr Sunak told broadcasters at the conference afterwards. \£6 Questions over detained activist One issue that dogged Mr Sunak during his Egypt trip was the plight of jailed British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist Alaa Abd El-Fattah, whose family fears for his life as he is on hunger strike. The PM was under pressure to raise the case with Egypt's President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, and honoured his pledge to do so. A Downing Street readout of their meeting said he "raised the case of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, stressing the UK's deep concern on this issue. "The Prime Minister said he hoped to see this resolved as soon as possible and would continue to press for progress." \</doc>

SOME of the world's most famous glaciers, including in the Dolomites in Italy, the Yosemite and Yellowstone parks in the US and Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, could disappear within 30 years due to global warming, whatever the temperature rise scenario, a new report has warned. UN cultural agency Unesco, which monitors 18,600 glaciers across 50 of its world heritage sites, said glaciers in one-third of them will disappear by 2050 regardless of the applied climate projections. While the rest can be saved by keeping global temperature rise below 1.5C relative to pre-industrial levels, in a business-as-usual emissions scenario about half of these World Heritage glaciers could almost entirely disappear by 2100. "This report is a call to action. Only a rapid reduction in our CO2 emissions levels can save glaciers and the exceptional biodiversity that depends on them," Audrey Azoulay, Unesco's director-general, said in a statement. She added that the UN's COP27 climate conference in Egypt will have a crucial role in helping to find solutions to this issue. World Heritage glaciers as defined by Unesco represent about 10pc of the world's glacier areas and include some of the world's bestknown, whose loss is highly visible as they are focal points for global tourism. The report's lead author Tales Carvalho said world heritage glaciers lose on average about 58 billion tons of ice every year - equivalent to the total annual volume of water used in France and Spain together - and contribute to almost 5pc of global observed sea-level rise. Unesco recommends that given the inevitable further shrinking of many of these glaciers in the near future, local authorities should make them a focus of policy by improving monitoring and research and implementing disaster risk reduction measures. "As glacier lakes fill up, they can burst and cause catastrophic floods downstream," Mr Carvalho said. Meanwhile, countries must dramatically and urgently increase efforts to adapt to climate change as it lands "blow after blow upon humanity", the UN has warned. Ahead of COP27 The money needed to help the developing world implement changes is set to increase to as much as (EURO)350bn a year by the end of the decade. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres called for a "global surge in adaptation investment to save millions of lives from climate carnage". Climate risks are rising, with a multi-year drought in the Horn of Africa, unprecedented flooding in Pakistan and record heatwaves across the northern hemisphere all hitting at 1.1C of warming above pre-industrial temperatures. The UN Environment Programme warned last week that based on countries' plans to tackle climate-warming emissions, there was no credible pathway in place to limit temperature rises to 1.5C, the threshold beyond which the worst impacts of global warming are expected. Instead, the world was on track for 2.4C to 2.6C of warming and climate catastrophe. \</doc>

The world's wealthier countries need to "step up" to help poorer nations transition away from fossil fuels and adapt to the impact of climate change, US envoy John Kerry has said. Speaking ahead of the COP27 international summit in Egypt, Mr Kerry said the greatest responsibility lay with those countries which have been the biggest users of fossil fuels. Speaking on BBC's Radio 4 Today programme, he said: "Obviously those countries with greater means across the board - and that includes some developing countries that have greater means - need to also step up and help in this transition. "We don't view it - and we're not going to view it - as compensation. We are going to view it as our efforts to try to help countries to adapt, to be able to become more resilient and obviously address the challenges that they face as a result of the losses and damages. "You have to work out the methodology by which you are going to assign a process that works for everybody." Wealthy nations have long promised to find $100 billion a year in climate finance for poor nations, with the target originally meant to have been hit in 2020. It was first promised in 2009 but has never been accomplished. A report last year suggested it would not come to fruition until 2023. Mr Kerry said that while it should be possible to reach agreement at the gathering at the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, the war in Ukraine had complicated the issue. "There are people within the fossil fuel industry who are using the crisis in Ukraine, frankly, as leverage to be able to say 'We need to be pumping a lot more. We're moving much too fast'. It's just not true, it's not an accurate narrative." Mr Kerry said, however, that countries were realising they needed to reduce their dependence on oil and gas as a source of energy. "Many countries in Europe - most of them in fact - have applied the lesson of this war, which is don't allow a petro-dictator to hold you hostage to energy, don't let them weaponise it against you," he said. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres warned the world is "doomed" unless nations gathered in Egypt are able to reach agreement. "There is no way we can avoid a catastrophic situation, if the two the developed and developing world are not able to establish a historic pact," he told the Guardian newspaper. He said the the world is approaching "tipping points" that will "make climate breakdown irreversible". "As we are approaching those tipping points, we need to increase the urgency, we need to increase the ambition and we need to rebuild trust, mainly trust between north and south," he said. "Because at the present level, we will be doomed. Present policies will be absolutely catastrophic." Yesterday, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke at a COP27 reception hosted by King Charles in anticipation of the conference. Mr Sunak is attending the event in Egypt next week after a U-turn but the king will miss the event. Speaking at a reception staged in the Buckingham Palace ballroom, Mr Sunak said: "As recent events have shown, delivering on the promise of Glasgow is more important than ever. "If we do not act today, we will risk leaving an ever more desperate inheritance for our children." \</doc>

Vanuatu is drawing up plans to relocate "dozens" of villages within the next two years, as they come under threat from rising seas, the Pacific nation's climate chief told AFP Thursday. Climate Change Minister Ralph Regenvanu said dealing with the impact of global warming was a major challenge facing Vanuatu's 300,000 inhabitants who live on a chain of islands strung out between Australia and Fiji. He said Vanuatu's government has identified "dozens" of villages in "at-risk areas" to be relocated "within the next 24 months" while other settlements have also been earmarked to move in the longer term. "Climate displacement of populations is the main feature of our future. We have to be ready for it and plan for it now," said Mr Regenvanu, who took over his ministerial portfolio after a snap election in October. Low-lying Pacific island nations, like Vanuatu, are already experiencing the impact of climate change. Half of Vanuatu's population was affected when Cyclone Pam battered the capital Port Vila in 2015, killing a dozen people, destroying crops and leaving thousands homeless. Vanuatu is ranked as one of the countries most susceptible to natural disasters like earthquakes, storm damage, flooding and tsunamis, according to the annual World Risk Report. Other Pacific nations are also looking to move under-threat communities, including Fiji where dozens of villages have been earmarked for relocation owing to the impacts of the climate crisis. Scientists predict sea levels in the Pacific will rise between 25-58cm by the middle of the century. That is a devastating prospect for Vanuatu, where around 60 percent of the population live within a kilometre of the coast. 'All sorts of threats' Mr Regenvanu wants coastal defences strengthened. "Our greatest challenge right now on Vanuatu is basically keeping our populations safe," he said. "We're finding more and more that our people are subject to all sorts of threats from volcanoes, flooding, cyclones and so on. "So we have to engage now in moving populations and building resilient infrastructure so that our people are safer in the coming years." Vanuatu already has experience of moving its people. In 2005, it was one of the first Pacific nations to move an entire community on the northern island of Tegua from a flood-prone coastal area to higher ground. And in 2017, all 11,000 people living on Ambae, an island in the country's north, were ferried by a rag-tag armada of boats to other isles after the Manaro Voui volcano erupted, raining down rock and ash on villagers. In May, Vanuatu's parliament declared a climate change emergency and its government is seeking to speed up global action by leading efforts to take the matter to the Hague-based International Court of Justice. COP27 The nations attending COP27 repeated a commitment to limit global warming to 1.5C from pre-industrial levels, but Mr Regenvanu said the pledges did not go far enough. "Basically, there's not enough commitment to reducing emissions," he said. "And so we're going to see temperatures increase beyond 1.5 degrees which we know will be disastrous for the Pacific -- we have to focus on adaptation and particularly loss and damage." \</doc>

Addressing the tolls issue after returning from Cop27 in Sharm El Sheikh Egypt, Minister for Transport, Eamon Ryan, said he would be  reluctant to take money from road maintenance and other transport priorities to reduce or defer toll increases. The minister said that private companies would be entitled to compensation if the government intervened to stop expected increases. T\'e1naiste Leo Varadkar mused that he would like to see a reduction or deferral of the planned increases on January 1. The price hikes are linked to the current rate of inflation, which has increased by 8.6 per cent between August 2021 and August 2022. It comes after Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) announced that it will increase tolls on nine out of 10 roads to their \' maximum level\' . There are 10 toll roads on the national road network. Eight are operated under a Public Private Partnership (PPP) model, while two \- the M50 and Dublin Port Tunnel \- are operated directly on behalf of TII. The Dublin Port Tunnel is the only route that will not be affected by price increases. TII said revenue is used for purposes including motorway maintenance, toll collection and operations, and for the maintenance of the wider national road network. Eamon Ryan said road maintenance and public transport could be impacted if toll rises are cut back. GERRY COUGHLAN Dublin 24 \</doc>

Greenhouse gas emissions are creeping downwards but remain far short of what is required this decade to adequately stay within the 1.5C target to limit the fallout from climate change. That is according to a newly-released assessment from the UN, which found that the combined climate pledges of 192 countries plus the EU under the Paris Agreement of 2015 could still put the world on track for around 2.5C of global warming by the end of the century. The historic Paris Agreement came at Cop21, the UNbacked event that brings commitments from world leaders to deal with climate change. Cop27 will take place in the Egyptian resort of Sharm-El-Sheikh next month, after the Cop26 event was held in Glasgow last November. The 1.5C figure in the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement refers to the limit of warming compared to the pre-industrial age that the world must adhere to in order to avoid catastrophic climate change, scientists have repeatedly said. The UN's latest report showed that current commitments made by various governments will actually increase emissions by 10.6% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels. This is an improvement over last year's assessment, which found countries were on a path to increase emissions by 13.7% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels, it said. Last year's analysis also showed that projected emissions would continue to increase beyond 2030. This year's analysis shows that emissions are no longer increasing after 2030. However, they are still not demonstrating the rapid downward trend that science says is necessary this decade, the UN said. Executive secretary of UN Climate Change, Simon Stiell, said: "The downward trend in emissions expected by 2030 shows that nations have made some progress this year. "But the science is clear and so are our climate goals under the Paris Agreement. We are still nowhere near the scale and pace of emission reductions required to put us on track toward a 1.5C world. To keep this goal alive, national governments need to strengthen their climate action plans now and implements them in the next eight years." The European Commission claimed the EU wants increased action at global level to tackle what it calls "the interconnected climate and biodiversity crises", following protracted tussling among various EU ministers as to what the bloc should push for at Cop27 . The event in Sharm-El-Sheikh has already been a lightning rod for controversy, with Human Rights Watch and other groups claiming the host country is stifling dissent from climate scientists. Egypt, which is seeing the likes of rising sea levels and water scarcity already having an impact, has silenced critics from inside the country, according to a report from the human rights organisation. The Egyptian government has severely curtailed environmental groups' ability to carry out independent policy, advocacy, and field work essential to protecting the country's natural environment, it claimed. \</doc>

Environment Minister Eamon Ryan has said Ireland's new climate plan will ``deliver the scale of change'' that is needed to hit its climate action targets. Mr Ryan warned that the measures contained in the plan will not be easy, adding that the scale of action needed to tackle climate change is ``beyond compare''. The Government's Climate Action Plan is set to be published in two weeks and will include measures Ireland must take to meet its targets. Mr Ryan made the comments after he returned from the Cop27 conference in Egypt. Mr Ryan, who was appointed as the European Union's lead negotiator in loss and damage talks at the climate summit, said the momentum is increasing for climate action. He said the last-minute deal reached at Cop27 will protect the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Speaking about Ireland's updated action plan, Mr Ryan said it will contain more than targets. ``It will have real measures to deliver the scale of change we need. This will not be easy. The scale is beyond compare, but it's going to be good for our country and it is what we have to do now,'' he told RTE's Morning Ireland. ``One good thing coming out of this weekend, even though we weren't happy that we got a strong enough deal on the mitigation side, but the momentum is increasing for climate action and for addressing the issue around the world because it's becoming ever more apparent that it's the great issue of our time. ``I'm confident we can get this country to the top of the table if we take climate action now.'' Mr Ryan said the agreement reached over the weekend has to work. The deal will create a fund for compensating poor nations that are victims of extreme weather worsened by rich countries' carbon pollution. Poorer nations have long called for funding because they are often the victims of climate-worsened floods, droughts, heatwaves, famines and storms despite having contributed little to the pollution that heats up the globe. ``A transition committee will look at the issue of how we get a range of different funding sources, how we reform perhaps most significantly the global financial system, the IMF, the World Bank, the multilateral development banks, so that they provide better debt relief and financial flows for countries that are in difficulty due to climate,'' Mr Ryan added. ``Secondly, that we broaden the base of countries who contribute, that the likes of China, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, countries that were back in 1992 designated as developing are now very wealthy and need to contribute. ``We need to make sure that the funds that are raised are targeted and how we define that has to be worked out over the next year. It is very significant. It is historic. ``It has the potential, if we get it right now and deliver on the political promise, the mandate that's been given to stitch climate justice into our entire response, and that was critical.'' He said the wording in the agreement will force countries like China, Saudi Arabia and Russia to pay their share. ``I believe the fund will be established under the Paris Agreement and the mechanisms there recognise that we're in a different world to where we were back in 1992,'' Mr Ryan added. ``Even if you start with the industrial revolution, and work through to the present day, China is one of the largest emitters.'' end \</doc>

The European Union has long been one of climate diplomacy's most important players. The bloc has arguably gone further than any other large emitter in actually implementing the goal of reaching climate neutrality by the middle of the century. In just the last month, it agreed on crucial bits of its landmark green deal regulation, including phasing out new combustion engines by 2035. But at this year's COP27 summit in Egypt the EU's role as a climate vanguard has been complicated by our energy crisis and need to replace Russian g as supplies as quickly as possible. Europe's member states have increased consumption of coal, the most harmful fossil fuel, and sought new gas supply contracts in the US, the Middle East and Africa, raising concern that it will lock in fossil fuel production for decades to come. When German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Sharm elSheikh last week, campaigners accused him of "energy colonialism" after looking for gas from Senegal. "Some of the investments are coming because, you know, the energy crisis in Europe," said Vanessa Nakate, a Ugandan climate activist. "It's for the interests of Europe, not for the interest of the people in Africa." EU policymakers concede the crisis has forced them into a short-term shift, but the overall trajectory remains clear. "Our trajectory toward net zero is clear, but we must acknowledge that some of this Russian gas needs to be replaced and imports reoriented," Kadri Simson, the EU's energy commissioner said on a panel Monday at the COP summit. We are "engaging with reliable suppliers around the world, like our host here Egypt. We want to have a relationship beyond natural gas." As well a looking for new supplies the EU has sought to accelerate investment in renewable projects. "We are not just cutting our dependency on Russian fossil fuels - that is good, but not good enough - but we are massively accelerating the roll-out of renewables," Ursula von der Leyen, Commission President, told delegates in Sharm el-Sheikh last week. "The global fossil fuel crisis must be a game changer." The Commission has called to boost its renewable and energy efficiency targets by the end of the decade and proposed plans to drastically cut permitting times for wind and solar, which can take as long as a decade. The test will be whether new direction from the top filters down into Europe's 27 member states. As this year's COP enters its second week and the serious horse-trading to get an agreement everyone can sign, the EU delegation will feel added pressure to play a constructive role. The bloc's positive track record may help. The EU is one of the few industrialized economies to be paying its fair share of an elusive $ 100 billion per year pledge to provide developing countries with climate finance. And on loss and damage - the key issue of climate compensation at this year's talks - it's movement in the months before COP27 helped secure an agenda item for the first time. "They have a huge role," Mohamed Nasr, chief climate negotiator for Egypt, this year's COP president. "We are hoping this materializes in the agreements." The commission's deputy president and climate chief, Frans Timmermans, was crucial in ensuring that there was an agreement to "phase down" unabated coal use at last year's summit in Glasgow. And with official talks between the US and China on ice ahead of a key Group of 20 meeting between President Joe Biden and Premier Xi Jinping this week, the EU could find itself as the liaison between the two sides to reach a deal.

Activists yesterday urged the government to reflect on Ireland's history of famine, as they called for more action to help countries facing food shortages exacerbated by climate change. Campaigners held a protest at the Irish Famine Memorial on the Dublin Quays during yesterday's Global Day of Climate Action. The action was organised as governments continue to debate how they tackle global warming at the Cop27 summit in Egypt. The event, pictured left, was organised by the Stop Climate Chaos coalition. They urged Miche\'e1l Martin to tackle the issue and support the establishment of an international loss and damage finance facility to help the countries worst affected by climate change not of their making. Campaigners appealed to the government to stand with countries such as Somalia and Ethiopia that are experiencing food shortages brought on by the effects of climate change. "Given our history of colonisation and famine, we have a unique opportunity to show solidarity with some of the poorest countries in the world who are experiencing massive losses and damage due to the climate crisis," Siobh\'e1n Curran, head of policy and advocacy at Tr\'f3caire, said. "These people cannot be left to pay the price for a crisis not of their making." See page 14 \</doc>

WITH all eyes on COP27 in Egypt, the climate crisis received much-needed attention. But after all the extensive deliberations in Sharm El Sheikh, and at the G20 summit in Bali, which ran parallel to the COP process, those on the front line of the climate crisis still seem to be forgotten. A prolonged drought in the Horn of Africa has already pushed 22 million people to the edge of starvation, yet we have received little clarity on how global leaders will respond on the massive scale that is so urgently needed to stem a widespread famine. We need to be very frank about this. This drought - the result of a fourth successive failed rainy season - is already resulting in excruciating deaths. BBC reports have described, in agonising detail, the slow, painful, silent death that young children are experiencing and the suffering of parents who can only watch. Can there be any doubt that this devastation - fuelled by a climate crisis rooted in western consumption - is the most urgent issue of our time? We need to recognise that none of this is inevitable. The collaboration and extraordinary action shown during the Covid-19 pandemic, although uneven, resulted in a massive reduction of suffering and saved countless lives, and we urgently need that now. History will not be kind to us if we fail. Dominic MacSorley CEO, Concern Worldwide, Camden Street, Dublin 2 \</doc>

S OMETIMES when money goes scarce, it is the smaller things which can enrage the public, largely because these things are often more immediately visible. Transport Minister Eamon Ryan was locked in COP27 climate negotiations in Egypt last week when the announcement was made that road tolls were to rise next January in line with the rapid increase in inflation. The Greens leader was not the only one in Government wrong-footed because it seems to have taken many ministers by surprise. This is of itself remarkable as Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), which oversees the system, is a State body, and one would have expected information to be passed on. There was always going to be controversy here because the plans are for big increases, including a 9pc rise in tolls on the M50 around Dublin. You don't have to be a genius to know the increases are a spin-off from the pushpull of inflation generally as it spreads across the economy. Materials to repair our motorways, which are funded by the toll booths' take, and the general rise in operation costs, were cited as reasons for the upcoming increases. The operational deals involving the private operators, indexed-linked to a rising cost of living, were framed when few expected a return of inflation hovering around 10pc. The rises will irk the occasional user who will fume and largely forget the issue. It's quite a different matter for regular longrange commuters and those engaged in transport and other work which involve a lot of motorway use. The timing of such increases is rarely ideal but in this case it could hardly be worse. It sits amid the cost-of-living crisis, and the fluctuating rise in diesel and petrol prices, which have remained stubbornly high. There is surely a case to examine whether these increases can somehow be lessened or delayed. It is cold comfort to say that the M50 toll has not been increased in many years. There are official indicators that the Government's hands are tied by contracts which appear beneficial to the motorway operators. There was considerable disquiet in Fianna F\'e1il and Fine Gael on this one as it plays to their rural support bases and feeds their opponents' arguments about this Government being "Dublin-centric" and indifferent to country communities. There were calls from both parties to do something here. Since it seems the motorway operators are entitled to their inflationlinked increases, the most likely way out seemed to be making the hard-pressed taxpayer pick up the tab. A figure of (EURO)25m to substitute for increased tolls has been cited here. And while it goes with all the other tens and hundreds of millions demanded for all sorts, it would seem to both bigger government parties to be money well spent. Fianna F\'e1il and Fine Gael have coped well with the guilt of not achieving ambitious targets in the battle against climate change. For the Greens, climate is central to their reason for being in coalition. A key goal of that policy is to get people out of their cars, onto bikes, walking and using public transport. This entails higher charges for motorists across a range of areas in the years to come - from parking to polluting fuels, to road tolls. Eamon Ryan, rightly lauded by many for conciliation successes at COP27 talks, could hardly jet back from Egypt and announce on Monday that he was subsidising road tolls. So, his initial response was rather dismissive with a comment about "robbing Peter to pay Paul". But now all three parties - including the Greens - are playing for time on this one. They say there will be talks. Eamon Ryan is talking about doing something to ease the motorists' burden. This one does not look like it will be fatal to the Coalition - but there is no doubt it will be very awkward. Load-Date: \~November 23, 2022 \</doc>

KEVIN O'SULLIVAN Environment and Science Editor Rich countries must agree a "historic pact" to help the poor address the climate crisis, or "we will be doomed", UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres has warned in advance of 120 world leaders gathering for COP27 , the UN climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. His warning came with indications of a deepening gulf between the developed and developing world, which has already cast doubt over the ability of COP27 to secure a significant breakthrough. Mr Guterres acknowledged yesterday it was taking place amid the worst geopolitical tensions for years arising from the Ukraine war, a cost-of-living crisis and deepening economic gloom. But the gulf must be bridged if humanity was to have a hope of avoiding the worst ravages of climate breakdown, he said. "There is no way we can avoid a catastrophic situation, if the two [the developed and developing world] are not able to establish a historic pact," he said. "Because at the present level, we will be doomed." His warning came as the Egyptian diplomat in charge of running the negotiations over the next two weeks accused governments of making positive climate action commitments in public but rowing back on them later behind closed doors in negotiating rooms. Echoing Mr Guterres's words, Wael Aboulmagd said urgently needed progress would not be achieved if countries continued to adopt adversarial positions. "Political statements and pledges are made in front of the cameras, but in the negotiating rooms it's back to the adversarial approach. These will not be of value until translated into the negotiating rooms, and that has not been the case so far," he added. Egypt has been frustrated by countries making positive statements in public that do not reflect blockages that have appeared in the negotiations on vital issues such as climate finance, loss and damage, cuts to greenhouse gas emissions and commitments to keep global warming to within 1.5 degrees. Carbon emissions A series of UN scientific reports issued in the past 10 days indicate the world is unlikely to contain warming to 1.5 degrees based on current levels of carbon emissions - with the planet set for a rise of more than 2.5 degrees this century, which would lead to increasingly catastrophic impacts. "We can't continue on this adversarial path," Mr Aboulmagd said yesterday. "The separation between what is happening in the public sphere and what is happening in the negotiating rooms cannot continue. We all need to show a spirit of compromise." The talks begin formally tomorrow when heads of delegation meet to agree the agenda, but many delegations have already arrived, and countries have been meeting online and in person in various alliances over recent months. On Monday, heads of state and government including Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin will gather for two days of intensive discussions, to thrash out positions to be taken by their negotiators over the following days of talks. US president Joe Biden will not be at the leaders' summit owing to the US midterm elections but is expected to attend at the midway point. China's Xi Jinping, India's Narendra Modi of India and Russia's Vladimir Putin are not expected to attend. Few governments of rich countries are planning to set major new goals on cutting carbon emissions, or on providing new financial help to developing countries struggling with the climate emergency. Climate finance will be a key bone of contention, along with the vexed question of loss and damage, which refers to assistance for the severe impacts that vulnerable countries are increasingly facing from extreme weather. \</doc>

WHEN African leaders gathered in the Dutch city of Rotterdam this week to find solutions and money for climate change adaptation, only one European head of state joined them in person. Senegalese President Macky Sall said richer nations' failure to come to the table and discuss how to pay for climate damage they have caused was disappointing - an issue set to be high on the agenda in upcoming UN climate talks in November in Egypt. "I cannot help but note with some bitterness the absence of leaders from the industrial world," he said at the Africa Adaptation Summit, adding he had thought the meeting being held in Europe would make it "easier" for them to attend. "They are the main polluters on this planet, and they are the ones who should be financing adaptation," Mr Sall added. A lack of climate finance will be among the main topics at UN Cop27 climate talks in Sharm el-Sheikh, as African leaders demand rich nations support their need to adapt to growing climate risks. Africa has about a fifth of the world's population, but produces less than 3pc of global carbon dioxide emissions, the major driver of climate change, according to the International Energy Agency. Despite this, the continent is disproportionately affected by climate impacts like droughts and floods, underlining the need for countries to invest in projects like updating infrastructure and making agriculture more resilient. At last year's UN climate talks in Glasgow, developed nations pledged to double funding for adaptation projects in developing countries to about $40bn ((EURO)40bn) per year by 2025. Whether that will materialise remains unclear, with the $100bn per year promised to vulnerable states by 2020 to adapt to climate change and green their energy systems still unmet. Meanwhile, the African Development Bank and Global Centre on Adaptation aim to raise $25bn for their Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP) by 2025 to accelerate and scale up climate adaptation efforts across the continent. The bank has committed half the total for the African-led scheme, and is seeking investment from developed nations. Pledges of $55m towards the AAAP from Britain, Norway, France, and Denmark were announced at the summit on Monday. Ghana's President Nana Akufo-Addo said he would push richer nations at the COP talks to contribute to the AAAP and deliver on climate funding promises, including the longstanding $100bn pledge. "With the world in flames and under flood waters, the eyes of people everywhere will be on the decision makers at COP27 ," Akufo-Addo, who also chairs the Climate Vulnerable Forum group of countries, told the Africa Adaptation Summit. "If we want our continent to thrive, we have to adapt to climate change - and to achieve this, adaptation financing needs to start flowing at scale." The level of finance needed for Africa to prepare for climate impacts and greener economies is well beyond current funding. Reuters 'They are the ones who should be financing adaptation' \</doc>

Heatwaves will become so extreme in certain regions of the world within decades that human life there will be unsustainable, the United Nations and the Red Cross have warned in a new report. Heatwaves are predicted to "exceed human physiological and social limits" in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and south and southwest Asia, with extreme events triggering "large-scale suffering and loss of life", the organisations said. Heatwave catastrophes this year in countries like Somalia and Pakistan foreshadow a future with deadlier, more frequent, and more intense heat-related humanitarian emergencies, they warned in the joint report. COP27 climate change summit in Egypt. "We don't want to dramatise it, but clearly the data shows that it does lead towards a very bleak future," said IFRC secretary-general Jagan Chapagain. They said aggressive steps needed to be taken immediately to avert potentially recurrent heat disasters, listing steps that could mitigate the worst effects of extreme heat. "There are clear limits beyond which people exposed to extreme heat and humidity cannot survive," the report said. "There are also likely to be levels of extreme heat beyond which societies may find it practically impossible to deliver effective adaptation for all. "On current trajectories, heatwaves could meet and exceed these physiological and social limits in the coming decades, including in regions such as the Sahel and south and southwest Asia." It warned that the impact of this would be "large-scale suffering and loss of life, population movements and further entrenched inequality." The report said extreme heat was a "silent killer", claiming thousands of lives each year as the deadliest weather-related hazard - and the dangers were set to grow at an "alarming rate" due to climate change. Read more: HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/eile/climate-change/ More climate change stories According to a study cited by the report, the number of poor people living in extreme heat conditions in urban areas will jump by 700% by 2050, particularly in west Africa and southeast Asia. "Projected future death rates from extreme heat are staggeringly high - comparable in magnitude by the end of the century to all cancers or all infectious diseases - and staggeringly unequal," the report said. "As the climate crisis goes unchecked, extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and floods, are hitting the most vulnerable people the hardest," said UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths. "The humanitarian system is not equipped to handle crisis of this scale on our own." Mr Chapagain urged countries at COP27 to invest in climate adaptation and mitigation in the regions most at risk. OCHA and the IFRC suggested five main steps to help combat the impact of extreme heatwaves, including providing early information to help people and authorities react in time, and finding new ways of financing local-level action. They also included humanitarian organisations testing more "thermally-appropriate" emergency shelter and "cooling centres", while getting communities to alter their development planning to take account of likely extreme heat impacts. OCHA and the IFRC said there were limits to extreme heat adaptation measures. Some, such as increasing energy-intensive air conditioning, are costly, environmentally unsustainable and contribute to climate change. If emissions of the greenhouse gases which cause climate change are not aggressively reduced, the world will face "previously unimaginable levels of extreme heat". \</doc>

In a country that spends so much of the year encased in a cool grey murk, a few days of blazing sunshine can seem like a welcome novelty. Temperatures of 33 degrees were recorded in Ireland in the last 48 hours, breaking records in some places. But novelty should not obscure the alarming truths that such abnormal heat suggests. In Ireland and elsewhere, more frequently occurring extreme weather is showing us how a rapidly heating planet is playing havoc with lives and livelihoods. It will leave many places more dangerous. Some will become unliveable. Wildfires are raging across Europe and north America. Extreme heat has smashed records around the world in recent months, with heatwaves striking India and south Asia, droughts devastating parts of Africa and unprecedented heatwaves at both poles in March. Extreme heat warnings have been issued in France and Britain, where temperatures were set to exceed 40 degrees in some places. Yet the gap between the reality of man-made climate change and political action to contain it or mitigate its effects have seldom been more apparent. As ministers from 40 countries gathered in Berlin yesterday for a two-day climate conference to discuss extreme weather, United Nations Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres said the wildfires and heatwaves showed humanity was facing "collective suicide" unless it acted with the required urgency. "Half of humanity is in the danger zone, from floods, droughts, extreme storms and wildfires. No nation is immune. Yet we continue to feed our fossil fuel addiction," he told the conference, which is one of the last opportunities to find agreement among key countries before the Cop27 climate summit in Egypt in November. Hopes for progress at Cop27 have waned recently, as the war in Ukraine and the emergence from the Covid pandemic have contributed to energy and food price rises, causing soaring inflation and a cost-of-living crisis. In the UK, the extreme heat has given an air of unreality to the Conservative Party leadership election, where climate policy has barely featured in debate. There is a similar disconnect in Ireland, where slow-moving Government talks on planned reductions to agricultural emissions have pitted Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan against Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue, who appears to see his role as defending the case for more limited action by farmers. The extreme heat has shown that countries such as Ireland are horribly unprepared for the dangerous extremes that are becoming the new normal. Housing here is not built for high temperatures. Flood plains are being built on. Water and energy infrastructure is not keeping pace. The sense is of a political system that is looking disaster in the face but cannot muster the response needed to avert the worst. \</doc>

REAKFAST at Sharm El Sheikh yesterday was an unsettling affair. B Sitting at the meticulously laid table with its neat rows of fruit bowls and identically angled spoons were leaders of countries in climate disarray. Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin sat among them, and he found the experience affecting. "We heard some really horrific presentations from the Sri Lankan president, from the prime minister of Pakistan, of extraordinary devastation, millions and millions of people with no homes, entire regions devastated," he said of the early-morning gathering. "When you're close up and the prime minister of Pakistan lays out the utter devastation to the people there and the president of Sri Lanka, and the leaders of the Maldives and Palau..." he paused. "They are living it now and living it at a level and scale that maybe we don't often appreciate until we get up close and talk to them." Later when the Taoiseach took his turn to deliver an address to the gathering of world leaders that kicks off the COP27 climate summit, he spoke of the catastrophic effects the changing climate was having on many parts of the world. "Temperatures in Ireland have been so mild this autumn that trees are producing new growth before they have even shed their leaves." If there was ever an illustration of how uneven the impacts of climate change are, it's in the juxtaposition of 33 million people homeless in Pakistan and tree growth gone awry in Ireland. The comfort that comes with our lucky location on this planet was reinforced during the leaders' addresses that followed. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, president of Somalia, spoke of the starvation in his droughtstricken country. Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, told of her island nation's fear of a "wipe-out event". She said countries should not have to choose between funding education and health, and financing the reconstruction of storm-ravaged societies. Ireland is showing solidarity with vulnerable island nations at COP27 , in particular "SIDS" (small island developing states). Our climate envoy, Dr Sin\'e9ad Walsh, spoke at an event to mark collaboration between SIDS and richer nations on a programme aimed at supporting the biodiversity of the oceans but also the resilience of coastal communities threatened by rising sea levels. Some of Ireland's contribution is by way of funding to Irish universities to carry out research on practical solutions to help. Mona Ainu'u, environment minister of the island nation of Niue, told of how respect for the ocean had been handed down from her ancestors who relied on it for their food and way of life. But that respect was turning to fear because of the havoc it could now cause in the turmoil whipped up by climate change. Back with the world leaders, the speeches and day ended with a video address by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. He took aim at those who don't take climate change seriously and at politicians who spoke of climate action in public but laughed at genuine activists behind closed doors. Mr Zelensky talked about the environmental destruction caused by Russia's war on his country. "The Russian war destroyed five million acres of forest in Ukraine in less than six months," he said. "We have to check every day the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, for radiation leaks." Russian tampering with the running of the plant and shelling and gunfire in the area has put nuclear experts on high alert. "There is a direct risk of a radiation disaster," Mr Zelensky said. Europe, or the Middle East or Northern Africa are covered by a radiation cloud?" If breakfast was unsettling, it was nothing to the cold knot in the stomach the day ended with. \</doc>

KEVIN O'SULLIVAN Environment and Science Editor In one of his most blistering attacks on the failure of global leadership to confront the climate crisis, UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres has told world leaders gathered at Cop27 humanity is on a "highway to climate hell". Speaking in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, at the opening of a two-day meeting of more than 110 leaders, including Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin, he warned the fight for a liveable planet would be won or lost in this decade - on their watch. "Humanity has a choice: co-operate or perish. It is either a climate solidarity pact - or a collective suicide pact," he told leaders whose representatives were facing into 11 days of difficult negotiations. The pact would require all countries to make an extra effort to reduce emissions this decade in line with the critical 1.5-degree goal in the Paris Agreement, Mr Guterres added. With the eight billionth member of "our human family" due to be born in coming days, the milestone put into perspective what Cop27 was all about, he said. "How will we answer when 'Baby 8 Billion' is old enough to ask: what did you do for our world - and for our planet - when you had the chance? "The planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible," he said. "We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator." Many of today's conflicts, he said, "are linked with growing climate chaos" - a view echoed by Mr Martin during a round-table discussion with leaders on food security. Developed countries must take the lead but emerging economies were also critical to bending the global emissions curve in transitioning towards renewables, Mr Guterres said. The two largest economies - the United States and China - had a particular responsibility to join efforts to make a pact between developed and emerging economies a reality, he added. "This is our only hope of meeting our climate goals." The US is working on a plan to harness cash from the world's largest companies to help developing countries cut their use of fossil fuels, an idea it aims to unveil at the summit this week, US climate envoy John Kerry confirmed. He told the Financial Times he was trying to marshal support from other governments, companies and climate experts to develop a new framework for carbon credits to be sold to business. The proceeds could then fund new clean energy projects. Under the potentially transformational plans, regional governments or state bodies would earn carbon credits by reducing their power sector's emissions as fossil fuel infrastructure such as coal-fired plants were cut and renewable energy increased. The credits would be certified by an independent, as-yet unspecified, accreditation body. Companies would then be able to buy the credits to offset their own carbon emissions. Separately, Mr Kerry said he understood "why poorer nations may feel richer countries aren't doing enough to tackle climate change", including loss and damage. He confirmed he was working "to keep 1.5 degrees alive", and had forged an alliance with Norway challenging countries to make transition to green shipping and align with the target. At an event with Mr Guterres, the prime minister of Pakistan, Shehbaz Sharif said: "If there is any doubt about loss and damage, go to Pakistan... And this Cop needs to recognise it, and needs to define a clear roadmap to deal with it. This should include the creation of an institutional framework and financing in order to address the problems of loss and damage." The world must "not let helplessness become a death sentence in this race against time", he added. Ireland is prepared to go further than the EUR 225 million it has promised under international climate finance and to step up commitments on the critical "loss and damage issues", Mr Martin said at a briefing. \</doc>

As COP27 rolls into its second week, many of us who have been following developments at the United Nations climate conference may be feeling a little bit overwhelmed. "We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator," UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres told attendees in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, at the start of the week. This starkest of warnings has been followed by plenty of talk and detail on the human and financial cost of climate change, as world leaders continue with their crunch negotiations. The climate crisis, clearly, is no laughing matter. Some climate communicators believe comedy can help to bring people together around what Guterres described as "the defining issue of our age and the central challenge of our century". That's what stand-up comedian Diane O'Connor was aiming to do when she took to the stage in Ballymun earlier this week. She was performing her show 'The Accidental Activist' at the Axis Ballymun arts centre. "'The Accidental Activist' name came to me because I never really intended to be an activist. But I was always vocal about causes that I was really passionate about and one of those was the environment. "Then I started to think that's actually a funny narrative for a comedy show. Me, as a person, who is an activist but she hasn't even quite realised it". Diane's show doesn't pull any punches. "As we might know, COP27 , is on at the moment," she tells the audience. "And it was COP26 last year. So, at this stage, they are starting to feel a bit like the Fast & Furious films, aren't they? You know, the only clear winner is diesel". As a comedian, Diane likes to "play with social awkwardness". "I like to break down barriers and have conversations in a different format. When I was pregnant, I had a show about pregnancy and then another show about breast feeding and the social awkwardness that can come with breast feeding in public. "I think why the climate emergency, the climate crisis really lends itself to comedy is because it's really difficult to talk about. Even though we are all aware of it, it's not being responded to in the way you'd imagine a catastrophe to be responded to and I think there's a lot of comedy in that". But Diane also aims to provide hope for anyone "worried, angry or eager to do more" about the climate crisis. "Comedy can really help us talk about the climate crisis. It diffuses that tension. It helps us feel a bit more relaxed. So, I think comedy helps us to breathe through it a bit better. "I've been angry at everybody," she tells the audience. "I've been angry at my friends, my family, Derek the postman. But I've been angry at the wrong people. I have to remember who I'm angry at. And it's not Bernadette from work for making a balls out of the recycling. "I'm not saying she doesn't need a good word or two for emptying her half-full carton of potato and onion soup in on top of clean recycling. But she's not the big problem. None of us are". Ultimately, Diane wants to use her activism through comedy to make a change. "The capitalist system isn't set up to be the friend of the environment. That's not the system I want. I want a fairer, better system that allows people and our environment to flourish" The show was supported by the Axis Assemble Artist Support Programme and directed by Kelly Shatter. HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/news/climate-heroes/ In our 'Climate Heroes' series of reports , we shine a light on the people who are stepping up to protect the environment and tackle climate change.

COP27 - is it about saving the planet or saving the blushes of leading public figures? Boris Johnson is going. Being seen at a climate change conference looks good, he could do with some favourable press coverage and, let's be fair, he has some history of interest in matters environmental. As does King Charles, although Rishi may not allow him to go. What a break it would be for King Charles to escape from stress over Harry's new book with a few days in sunny Egypt. The COP27 retreat. Anybody who's anybody will be there. Private jets optional. \</doc>

WHEN it comes to football, cross border trips to Killarney by Cork teams have, more often than not, ended in heartbreak. But when it's Oireachtas na Samhna time in the Kerry GAA crucible and prizes in competitions such as sean n\'f3s singing, agallaimh beirte and l\'faib\'edn\'ed are up for grabs raiders from across the bounds in Gaeltacht Mh\'fascra\'ed have made very rewarding forays into Killarney. Two of the last three winners of Corn U\'ed Riada, the blue riband prize of sean n\'f3s singing, have hailed from Gaeltacht Mh\'fascra\'ed and numerous other prizes have been secured, both at 'Daoine F\'e1sta' level and among 'Iomaitheoir\'ed \'d3ga'. So after three long and dry years due to the pandemic, the Oireachtas festival returned to Killarney last week and the M\'fascra\'ed raiders were more than prepared to repeat their former successes. The foray got off to a good start on Wednesday when local poets Fin\'edn and M\'e9adhbh N\'ed Chonaill won first prizes in their respective age catergories - Under 18 and Under 21 - for their poems at the Gradaim Liteartha/Literary Awards of the Oireachtas. Later that night, Doireann N\'ed Ghlaca\'edn, whose mother Sorcha N\'ed Riada is from C\'fail Aodha, was on stage at the Gradaim Cumars\'e1ide/Communication Awards to receive the award for Television Programme of the Year for Se\'e1n \'d3 Riada - Mo Shean \'c1thair. Doireann was the presenter and researcher of this acclaimed film about her grandfather, a man she never met.

The schools in M\'fascra\'ed had prepared their students well and there was an array of outstanding performances and results from competitors from Scoil N\'e1isi\'fanta Ch\'fail Aodha/Barr d'\'cdnse, Scoil Ab\'e1n Naofa in Baile Mh\'fairne, Scoil N\'e1isi\'fanta R\'e9idh na nDoir\'ed and Scoil Lacta\'edn Naofa in Cill na Martra. Thanks to support from Comharchumann Forbartha Mh\'fascra\'ed and Tuismitheoir\'ed na Gaeltachta, experienced Oireachtas competitors such as \'c9ibhl\'edn N\'ed Lion\'e1ird, Esther N\'ed Dhuinn\'edn Siobh\'e1n N\'ed Mhuimhneach\'e1in and Seosamh \'d3 Cr\'edod\'e1in. Indeed Siobh\'e1n, Eibhl\'edn and Joe proved their credentials yet again when they won the 'Sceits/Sketch' competition on Thursday afternoon. Juliemae N\'ed Cheallaigh agus Vivienne N\'ed Chionnfhaolaidh were silver medals in the Under 9 Agallaimh Beirte and were closely followed in the bronze medal winners position by brothers Daniel and P\'e1draig \'d3 Cu\'edll. C\'fail Aodha and the M\'fascra\'ed Gaeltacht has a long tradition of success in the L\'faib\'edn\'ed competition. A l\'faib\'edn is a debate set to traditional song airs as Gaeilge and they often have a very contemporary twist. Se\'e1n \'d3 Muimhneach\'e1in and Joe \'d3 Cr\'edod\'e1in are among the best in the country at the l\'faib\'edn and this reporter's late father, D\'f3nal \'d3 Liath\'e1in, had considerable success in the competition too with his singing partner Cathal \'d3 Riada. The winners of the Under 15 L\'faib\'edn\'ed competition receive Corn D\'f3nal \'d3 Liath\'e1in and while that trophy will not be coming to M\'fascra\'ed this year, Caoimhe N\'ed Maolchiar\'e1in and Aoibhinn Nic Donnch\'fa won the bronze medal in the competition. Competition isn't the point of the Oireachtas. It's getting together and keeping old traditions alive and passing them on to future generations. That seems to be well in hand in M\'fascra\'ed going by this year's performances. When the Oireachtas returns to Killarney next year, we'll do better again!

KEVIN O'SULLIVAN Environment & Science Editor US climate envoy John Kerry has announced a new global carbon credit trading initiative which he predicted would be "critical" in helping developing countries transition to cleaner forms of energy. The Energy Transition Accelerator (ETA) is intended as a mechanism to scale up climate finance, by acting as a catalyst for private capital to accelerate the clean energy transition in developing countries. It will use carbon credits to help decommission coal and to roll out wind, solar and geothermal energy, Mr Kerry said. The proposal is a US attempt to scale up large quantities of finance for climate-vulnerable countries, but it has met with mixed reaction from some developing countries and climate campaigners. Mr Kerry confirmed the US would develop the programme with the Bezos Earth Fund and Rockefeller Foundation, with input from the public and private sectors. It will operate up to 2030, possibly being extended to 2035. "We need to break the mould on this," Mr Kerry said during an event at the US pavilion of the Cop27 While the details of the programme have yet to be fully fleshed out, he said it was important to mobilise private capital to help deliver trillions of dollars in investment to boost renewable energy in developing countries that often struggle to secure funding for such projects. Mr Kerry said that Chile and Nigeria were among the developing countries expressing early interest in the ETA, and that Bank of America, Microsoft, PepsiCo and Standard Chartered Bank indicating interest in "informing the ETA's development". He noted that UN secretary-general Ant\'f3nio Guterres was supportive of a US-led carbon market initiative, provided there were safeguards to it. Seeking to tap private money for a transition that wealthy governments have refused to finance, the group hopes to lure more than $100 billion by the end of the decade, cutting as much as 1.3 billion to 2.3 billion tons of climate pollution, according to consulting firm Climate Advisers. However, Mohamed Adow, director of climate and energy think tank, Power Shift Africa, said Mr Kerry "wants to monetise the global commons" with the plan. "We need to see deep emissions reductions in both the global north and south, not rich polluting companies in the north paying for the privilege of continuing to destroy the planet," Mr Adow said. "Allowing the dirtiest industries to pay their way out of decarbonisation is a disaster for the world." Research manager at E3G clean energy think-tank Leo Roberts said there was a clear need for significantly scaled up energy transition finance, "but it's hard to see how voluntary carbon credits fit into this". Meanwhile Mr Kerry confirmed he has spoken with his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua, rekindling contact between countries that are pivotal in the global effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions. "We need to be talking to each other because we're the two biggest economies in the world and the two biggest emitters," he said. Mr Xie said that although China and the US had not started official talks, he met with Mr Kerry for promoting Cop27 goals as a joint effort. Carbon offsets are actions intended to compensate for the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as a result of industrial or other human activity - especially when quantified and traded as part of a commercial scheme. They are a mechanism to channel funds to sustainable development and conservation while reducing climate emissions. But, if done badly, detractors say they are a greenwashing tool. They are increasingly controversial because of lack of transparency. With offsetting, you are paying someone else to undo the damage done by carbon-intensive products and services such as air travel, manufacturing or burning fossil fuels. Credits are generated by projects such as tree-planting, bog and forest restoration, renewable energy or carbon capture and storage. Projects are evaluated to work out how much emission savings they are able to generate, and these savings are certified as saleable commodities known as carbon credits. \</doc>

JAMES POLITI Rich countries led by the United States and European Union were accused of betraying poorer nations over finance to combat climate change, after two weeks of tense United Nations climate talks in the German city of Bonn ended acrimoniously. The fraught discussions marked the first major UN climate meeting since the Cop26 summit in Glasgow last year, with global negotiators laying the groundwork for an agreement at the Cop27 in Sharm el-Sheikh this November. But observers said the meeting, characterised by infighting, stalling and political game-playing, had rendered the talks disappointing. The unsatisfactory outcome ratcheted up pressure on the Egyptian host country to engender consensus in the five months ahead of Cop27 , they said. "We left Glasgow with a real sense of political urgency" but talks in Bonn were "divorced from that political reality", said Alex Scott, from environmental think tank E3G. "The result is a huge agenda left for the Egyptian presidency to take forward." Frustration The frustration of UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres with the lack of progress in Bonn was evident as he lashed out at the fossil fuel industry for deploying "the same scandalous tactics as Big Tobacco". It had invested in "pseudoscience and public relations - with a false narrative to minimise their responsibility for climate change", he said yesterday. The deflating conclusion to the talks comes in the context of rising inflation and the food and energy crises that have been driven by the Ukraine war. The war has sparked a scramble by countries to source fossil fuels from countries other than Russia, igniting concerns that climate objectives may be placed in jeopardy. Wide-ranging agenda The wide-ranging agenda for negotiators in Bonn included how to cut emissions faster, adapt to climate change impacts that are already occurring and international finance to combat and compensate for the effects of climate change. One of the most prominent and fiery debates was over financial support for "loss and damage", or the devastation caused to developing countries by hazards such as sea-level rise. "There are not many times when you have every major global south country group unanimously united in a fight, and this is one of those times," said Rachel Rose Jackson, director of climate research and policy at campaign group Corporate Accountability. Countries including the US and EU pushed back against calls for a new loss and damage financing facility - something they also rejected in Glasgow. The EU and US "talk about urgency but don't recognise their responsibility to have a frank discussion about what needs to be fixed to truly tackle loss and damage", said Eddy P\'e9rez, international climate diplomacy manager at Climate Action Network Canada.

SHAUNA BOWERS The Cop27 agreement to establish a fund to provide support to developing countries affected by climate change is an "historic outcome", aid organisations and climate experts said. The fund will be available to the world's least developed countries and small island states to receive support for damage already done but also future disasters such as storms, floods and droughts made worse by climate disruption. Siobh\'e1n Curran, of Tr\'f3caire, said it was a "landmark moment" achieved after "years of demands from communities who have been suffering the damaging impacts of the climate crisis". "However, the failure to include a phase-out of all fossil fuels in the final decision is deeply disappointing and if states don't deliver on emissions reductions, losses and damages will escalate beyond the scope of any fund." Teresa Anderson, of ActionAid, said the agreement for the fund was a "real pinch-me moment". "This fund is long overdue, and it's truly shocking that it has taken rich countries so long to finally agree to help those harmed by climate impacts," she said. Mary Robinson, chairwoman of the Elders, said the "historic outcome" on loss and damage showed international co-operation was possible. "However, none of this changes the fact that the world remains on the brink of climate catastrophe," she said. Ois\'edn Coghlan, of Friends of the Earth Ireland, said the fund was a "critical victory" but one that would be "hollow unless wealthy countries step up and cut emissions". "The biggest failure was the unwillingness to tackle fossil fuels. There was no improvement in the text on fossil fuels. It's like talking about lung cancer, without talking about smoking. It's delusional," he added. \</doc>

E AMON Ryan was only in the desert a dry weekend and already he was threatening to upset the Saudis. Much of the talk at COP27 is about who should pay for the climate-related losses suffered by vulnerable countries. Poor countries point the finger at rich countries and rich countries produce large books of excuses, saying they'll need the next two years to read to the end but they'll get back with a response in 2024. Climate Minister Ryan has been dipping into the excuse book too, citing the complexity of setting up the kind of dedicated loss and damage fund developing nations demand. But he had another take on the issue, arguing the need not just to examine who should pay up but where the sources of funding should come from. He said fossil fuel companies needed to start playing their part by contributing to the pot. It sounds obvious but, as he pointed out, the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, which had the world's countries pledge to curb emissions and limit global temperature rise to 1.5C, doesn't even mention fossil fuels. "At this stage we do need to have mechanisms where they are held to account and make a contribution," Mr Ryan said. He went further, saying airlines and shipping firms, both largely exempt from carbon taxes, should also pay up. "The question I'll be asking this week and pushing with my colleagues is, in global aviation and shipping and fossil fuel companies, are there ways in which they can make a contribution towards a loss and damage fund." "It's very hard when you have 200 countries to agree something. I'd imagine Saudi Arabia mightn't be too pleased, but I don't think we should ignore it as an unspoken truth." Unspoken truths abound at this summit. In the weeks running up to it, scientific report after scientific report warned that the 1.5C limit was in deadly peril and that those who pledged to fight for it had no strategy in place to ensure its survival. That appalling truth has not yet been spoken loudly or often enough at the summit to provide any real assurance that leaders are hearing it, accepting it and are genuinely going to act on it. A comparison of the world's highest greenhouse gas emitting countries published yesterday, found none were on a 1.5C pathway. Those 59 countries, plus the European Union between them, account for more than 90pc of the world's green- house gas emissions and so they need to reduce the most, the fastest, yet seven years after Paris, none have 1.5C in the bag. Ireland climbed nine places in the Climate Change Performance Index this year, reaching the dizzy heights of 37th place. Clare O'Connor, of Friends of the Earth, which partners with Germanwatch in producing the annual analysis, said the ascent was down to policy improvements such as carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings. "In terms of actual implementation of these policies, we're really not getting anywhere so far," she said. "We're still building new fossil fuel infrastructure. We're still making new gas connections every day." That kind of climate inaction suits the Saudis. They've come to COP27 sneering at western countries for talking the talk on reducing fossil fuels while rushing to do deals with their desert cousins as soon as the war in Ukraine put Russian supplies out of bounds. The planet's largest oil producer might even forgive Mr Ryan his audacious suggestion of finding a good home for some of its loose change. What the Saudis won't do, however, is accept a strong wording on loss and damage in the text of the 'cover decision' that all countries must agree before the summit ends to enshrine the matters they have agreed on. They added however: "The objective is to conclude our work on time on Friday." Every host says that every year, until Friday becomes Saturday - or Sunday. The unspoken truth is that nobody believes it. \</doc>

The first conference of the parties (Cop) to the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) took place in Berlin in March 1995. Its purpose was to give clear scientific understanding of climate change and its consequences for our planet. Not everyone agreed with the conference. People in the fossil fuel industry denied the negative consequences of carbon dioxide, while some farmers in Ireland claim that the methane produced by their cows is not a serious greenhouse gas. They reject any reduction in cattle numbers, even though 35 per cent of greenhouse gases comes from agriculture. In her address to the Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity in September 2022, Laura Burke, the director general of the Environment Protection Agency (EPA), stated that there was a gap between climate action and the implementation of actions to deliver on climate action plans. According to her, current sectoral climate budgets will not add up to the 51 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions promised by 2030. Cop27 will take place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, from November 6th-18th, 2022. The return of the conference to Africa stresses two very important dimensions of global climate change. First, Africa is responsible for just 4 per cent of global emissions in 2022, as against 32.4 per cent for China and 12.6 per cent for the United States. Overall G20 countries are responsible for 80 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable people in the planet will suffer the most from climate change. Towards famine Second, Africa bears the brunt of the effect of climate change, especially with droughts and famine affecting countries in the Horn of Africa. Somalia has endured a three-decade-long civil war, big political instability, climate change and Covid-19. This has pushed the country towards famine. In Kenya and Ethiopia, years of insufficient rainfall has caused the worst drought in 40 years. This severe weather has had a devastating effect on farming, with millions of livestock dying and a significant drop in food production due to failed harvests. Cop26 in Glasgow urged rich developed countries to dramatically increase funding for poor countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia. Just a fraction of the $100 billion promised by 2020 to help poor countries deals with damages due to climate change. Despite all the promises to reduce greenhouse gases, in 2022 concentrations have returned to pre-pandemic levels. The pledges about greenhouse gases in the run-up to 2030 need to be seven times higher to be in line with the 1.5 degree goal of the Paris Agreement in 2015. Will Cop27 in Egypt deal with these issues in a systematic and just way? The failure of countries to keep global warming below 1.5 will mean more and more losses in future. The average temperature of the world is 1.2 degrees above pre-industrial level. In 2022, we have experienced multiple forest fires in Australia, Siberia, California, Alaska and the Amazon. We have watched the monsoon caused by heavy rain and melting glaciers devastate three provinces in Pakistan, wrecking the lives of 33 million people in that country. In Pakistan the average citizen of the country is responsible for producing just one tonne of greenhouse gases annually, whereas the average Irish citizen is responsible for producing 12 tonnes of greenhouse gas per year. Earlier in September 2022, a group of climate scientists published a report stating the world was increasing the risk of creating environment "tipping points" which would be catastrophic for our planet. Johan Rockstrom, a co-chair of the Earth Commission and a director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, stated that "the world is heading toward a 2 or 3 degree increase in global warming". Responding to this bleak prediction, the UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said "that climate impacts are heading into uncharted territories of destruction". Climate change is a huge problem globally which, at the moment, we are unwilling to address honestly. Fr Se\'e1n McDonagh is a Columban missionary and president of An Taisce \</doc>

Sir, - As the Cop27 climate talks start, we're once again faced with earnest declarations from our political leaders about the need to rapidly reduce our emissions ("Leaders have 'special responsibility' to help tackle climate change, says Taoiseach", News, November 6th). It's about time that journalists and voters started ignoring declarations such as these and to focus on the underlying actions (or lack thereof). The data from the Environmental Protection Agency show that Ireland's emissions are currently moving in the wrong direction, particularly in the areas of transport and agriculture, and it doesn't take too much analysis to figure out why this might be the case. On transport, for example, many members of the Taoiseach and T\'e1naiste's parties continually oppose and dilute cheap and easy measures in their local areas that support reductions in car use in our cities, often also supporting road-building measures that we know will increase emissions. A lot is made in the media of the anxiety felt by younger people about the climate crisis, and it's hard to think of something more likely to induce these kinds of feelings than the spectacle of political leaders declaring in lofty terms the seriousness of the situation while being seemingly incapable or unwilling to support many of the easiest steps along the path to lowering emissions. We're lucky to live in a country where outright climate denial is politically largely untenable, and that has, in the Climate Act, a legislative framework agreed by all Government parties that sets out the pathway for reductions. We just need our leaders to show the political courage to do, rather than say, the right things. - Yours, etc, DAVE MATHIESON, Salthill, Galway. \</doc>

The Government is dropping its target of having one million electric vehicles (EVs) on the roads by 2030, as Green Party leader Eamon Ryan warned Ireland faces a "wartime situation for the next 25 years to stop our planet burning". The Environment and Transport Minister is finalising a new Climate Action Plan that will shift government policy to delivering more public transport and walking and cycling infrastructure in a bid to reduce overall car journeys. Asked about the target of one million EVs, he said: "I think a lesser number, it hasn't been finalised yet. "At the moment, everything is designed around the presumption that people are going to use a car, and we're not providing the alternative infrastructure to allow people not to use it. People want to use public transport, they don't want to be stuck in traffic." The Climate Action Plan for 2023 will now aim to make just over 30pc of the national fleet EVs by 2030. However, (EURO)100m will be allocated over three years for more EV-charging infrastructure, including (EURO)15m for points at sports clubs. Before he flew to Egypt to attend the Cop27 summit, he warned that parts of Ireland are already becoming uninhabitable and the country's five cities could end up the same by the end of the century without action. "We're starting to see it already in some locations, like along the Shannon - areas that have been subject to flooding in recent years. There are areas that can't take another flood," he said.

Climate activists have called on the Government to provide aid for countries facing famine because of climate change. The Stop Climate Chaos Coalition made its appeal at the Irish Famine Memorial on Custom House Quay calling for the Government to commit to a loss and damage fund at COP27 in Egypt. Deirdre Duff of Friends of the Earth Ireland said: "We're here today to remember Ireland's history of famine and to make a plea to the Government to remember that too and to stand with communities that are being impacted by climate exacerbated drought which is leading to famine." She pointed "in particular to countries in the horn of Africa, Somalia, Ethiopia who are on the brink of famine as result of drought that is being fuelled by climate change". The activists want the Irish Government to pledge finance for a loss and damage fund and say the commitments made by Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin are not sufficient. Ms Duff added: "We were disappointed by it because he was taking money from a pre-existing promise which we'd already made, it wasn't new and additional finance for loss and damage and we really need to see finance that is specifically for loss and damage, that's additional to climate finance for mitigation and adaptation." The five places highlighted by the activists were Somalia, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Pacific Islands. While the horn of Africa is hit by drought, Pakistan and Bangladesh have seen increasing impacts from floods and the Pacific Islands are already losing fertile land because of rising sea levels. \</doc>

The term "biodiversity", a contraction of "biological diversity", was coined in the late 1980s - just when it was becoming clear that human impacts were erasing the myriad variety of life on Earth at an alarming rate. As the Joni Mitchell song says, "you don't know what you've got 'till it's gone." When the influential biologist EO Wilson used the word as the title of a book he edited in 1988, it entered the conservation science mainstream. Wilson had already devised the term "biophilia" to describe an intense human love for nature, which he hoped was universal. He linked this explicitly to the pleasure we take in variety. He argued that, as infants, we "concentrate happily on other organisms ... novelty and diversity are particularly esteemed." This certainly captures the experience of those of us who are innately drawn into a passionate fascination with other species. But it is sadly clear that this fascination is not sufficiently widespread to halt the slide towards mass extinctions. Perhaps mindful of this, Wilson's essay collection gave substantial space to demonstrating biodiversity's value to all humanity, to showing that our very survival depends on protecting - and now restoring - the ecosystems that sustain the diversity of life. "Biodiversity", therefore, has contained from the outset a much stronger appeal to our self-interest than "nature", the rather more attractive word that it has, in several ways, supplanted. The UN Environment Programme seized on the term almost immediately, and focused on this human-centred emphasis, linking biodiversity to sustainability: "the Earth's biological resources are vital to humanity's economic and social development". This linkage had enough momentum to ensure biodiversity advocates a prominent place at the historic Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. The outcome, alongside the much better known UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, was the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), whose 15th Conference of the Parties (Cop15) opens in Montreal on December 7th. There are very high hopes riding on making this meeting a "Paris moment" for biodiversity, with an agreement comparable to the one reached at the ground-breaking climate conference in the French capital in 2015. The Montreal discussions come 12 years after the last high profile CBD Cop, in Japan, which set the ambitious "Aichi targets" for the past decade. The Montreal meeting is particularly important because it is mandated to set the global biodiversity agenda for the coming 10 years. If science and conservation practice were all that counted, the arguments for treating biodiversity as a front-rank global issue have grown ever stronger over the past decade. The CBD was long considered the poor relation of the climate agenda. But the evidence that flourishing biodiversity, and the healthy ecosystems essential to that flourishing, are key elements in mitigating the climate crisis has become much clearer in recent years. It's now widely understood that degraded landscapes emit greenhouse gases, and that biodiverse landscapes, whether peatlands, forests or grasslands, sequester them. Conversely, climate change is itself a major factor in accelerating the biodiversity collapse. At the recent Cop27 climate conference in Egypt, the architects of the Paris agreement highlighted the contribution of nature-based solutions to alleviating the climate crisis: "There is no pathway to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees without taking action on protecting and restoring nature," they said. " And as with climate change, it is the most vulnerable communities who bear the greatest impacts of biodiversity loss." The relatively new lens of natural capital accounting has also done much in recent years to bring into focus the range of vital values in thriving ecosystems, which conventional economics has, disastrously, usually ignored. This approach has been embraced in the UN's System of Environmental Economic Accounting. This system demonstrates biodiversity's contribution to economic and social development in irrefutable detail. Similarly, ideas that were once dismissed as nebulous, like the ways in which biodiverse "green" elements in our environment benefit physical and mental health, are now widely accepted. Ecosystem Restoration Meanwhile, ecological restoration - with its hopeful message that we have developed the skills to heal many of the wounds we have inflicted on nature, given appropriate investment - has moved from the margins to the centre as a key conservation strategy. Indeed, the UN has declared the 2020s the "Decade on Ecosystem Restoration". But despite all these encouraging developments, the Montreal meeting opens under several dark clouds. It has been delayed for two years due to the pandemic. The official host country, China, has displayed very little dynamic leadership in preparing the event; the conference has finally been shifted to Canada due to Beijing's Covid restrictions. But China remains the formal host, and its decision not to invite heads of state risks downgrading the event, especially in the wake of the markedly presidential climate Cop27 . Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine makes it harder to focus the international community on the biodiversity crisis. On a different level, it doesn't help that Cop15 coincides with the World Cup. Above all, a review of the Aichi targets in 2020 starkly revealed the great gulf between aspiration and achievement by the signatories to the CBD, including Ireland. Not one of the targets has been reached. There has been progress on some, with significant increases in protected areas, for example. But the overall picture remains one of rapidly collapsing global biodiversity, with key insect populations vanishing and two of five plants at risk of extinction. Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, executive secretary of the CBD, who spoke at Ireland's National Biodiversity Conference in June, summarised that review: "Earth's living systems as a whole are being compromised." Her deputy, David Cooper, noted national policies still point in the wrong direction: "We are still seeing so much more public money invested in things that harm biodiversity than in things that support biodiversity." 'Perverse subsidies' Eliminating $500 billion per year of these "perverse subsidies", whether to unsustainable agriculture, which severely degrades 40 per cent of the world's land, or to toxic industries, is one of the most ambitious of 20 targets set out in the draft framework for the next decade. Another target will be at least equally contentious and reveals the rift between developed and developing worlds so evident at Cop27 . This concerns sharing benefits of digitising genetic sequence information, where high-tech countries and corporations synthesise medically useful elements from wild plants and animals, very often sourced in poor countries. The Africa group has made agreement on this issue a condition of support for all other elements of any deal. A third key target is '30x30?, aiming to protect 30 per cent of land and sea by 2030, though there are fears that indigenous rights might be undermined unless there is appropriate consultation on this measure on the ground. The targets are certainly commendable, indeed essential, but one has to wonder how, even if they are agreed, they can be implemented. As we know all too well in Ireland, the multiple layers of protection our biodiversity already enjoys on paper have done little to halt its decline. The same politicians and policymakers who laud our "green" credentials at convenient moments fail to enforce our existing biodiversity protection laws. Some of our most precious ecosystems, like Killarney's oak forests, remain degraded by invasive species, even on State-owned land. Our governments actually promote biodiversity loss by intensifying agriculture. Indeed, the Department of Agriculture has just imposed an agri-environmental scheme that undermines the biodiversity elements in our most successful farming and conservation initiative, the Burren Programme. So while it's critically important for our future that Cop15 meets the challenge of agreeing the proposed framework, translating it into our landscapes will be a greater challenge still. \</doc>

'Tis the season of overconsumption, as Christmas brings a shopping frenzy like no other. From festive jumpers to fast fashion t-shirts, tonnes of mass-produced clothing items will be finding their way into Christmas stockings and under Christmas trees. With all the resources, carbon emissions and waste associated with the holiday, it's little wonder that some environmentalists describe it as "the world's greatest annual environmental disaster". This year, as the cost-of-living crisis bites, an increasing number of people are looking at ways to waste less and spend less, while still enjoying the festivities. In Dublin, the Change Clothes Crumlin project has been running a series of swaps and workshops to show how clothing and fashion doesn't have to cost the earth. Founder Mary Fleming said: "Change Clothes Crumlin is a creative clothing reuse hub here in the Crumlin area. We offer swap shops, creative upcycling workshops, and generally, just a social space for people in the area to come and learn a bit more and have fun." The fashion industry is responsible for up to 10% of global emissions. Three out of five fashion garments end up in landfill within a year. Swap shops allow people to share and reuse unwanted clothes rather than discarding them. "I'm 32 now and when I was around 25 or 26 I would have consumed an awful lot of fast fashion. I was lucky enough to go on a trip to Kenya with my mam. And I saw the textile mountains there myself first-hand. I made the link between what I was doing at home and the impact that was having on countries abroad and people." With our large swap shops that we are running at the moment, you bring an item of clothing, you receive one token for that and you take an item back and it's simple as that," Ms Fleming explained. The project is one of seven climate action projects which have taken place in Crumlin this year as part of the Crumlin Taking Action Together programme. Local residents were encouraged to participate in creative and innovative climate initiatives. Ms Fleming said: "During our three pilot events, we had nearly 200 people attend. We had over 860 swaps made as well in the first week of existing. So, when you think about the amount of carbon that saves, the amount of stuff that's not gone to landfill because of that. It's just amazing." Oile\'e1n Carter-Stritch works with Change Clothes Crumlin. The 22-year-old was Ireland's official youth delegate at last month's UN climate summit, COP27 . She believes communities have an essential role to play in climate action. " COP27 "You're feeling demoralised. It's scary and it's sad. That's why initiatives like this are really important. "The system is there and the governments are there and they will do what they are going to do. And it's our job to put pressure on them but it's also our job to keep ourselves motivated in the bigger picture. "While initiatives like this have many, many good aspects, to me, the most important one would be that it keeps motivation going for the fight for climate justice." Change Clothes Crumlin has been operating out of a garden shed at Ms Fleming's parent's home. They are running their pre-Christmas swap shop today on the grounds of Scoil \'cdosag\'e1in in Crumlin. However, Mary hopes the success of the project will ultimately result in it becoming a more permanent enterprise. "Activities like Change Clothes Crumlin can actually drive huge change. In 2025, we actually have a new directive coming in from EU level. We won't be able to dispose of textiles anymore. So, we really need to think about alternatives to that and how we're going to manage when that directive comes in. Perhaps, having a network of swap shops across Ireland might be one of the answers." In our ' HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/news/climate-heroes/ Climate Heroes' series of reports , we shine a light on the people who are stepping up to protect the environment and tackle climate change. While these people come from all walks of life, they share a common purpose to improve the world around us. \</doc>

KEVIN O'SULLIVAN Environment and Science Editor Poor countries will need $2 trillion (EUR 1.98 trillion) a year in funding by 2030 to cope with climate breakdown, a new report has warned, as financial issues came into sharper focus at Cop27 . The cash will be needed so climate-vulnerable states can switch away from fossil fuels, invest in renewable energy and other low-carbon technology, and cope with the impacts of extreme weather, according to the report. Commissioned jointly by the UK and Egyptian governments, it was published at the UN climate talks at Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt yesterday. Its projections detail the needs of all of the world's developing economies except China, and has led to demands that wealthy countries move urgently to scale up international finance for climate front lines, and embark on big reforms to free up capital, especially for the Global South. The authors, including climate economist Nicholas Stern, acknowledge their figures "are far higher than any climate finance that has yet been forthcoming to help poor countries". They conclude half of the money could come from local sources, but that "external finance, as well as the World Bank and other multilateral development banks, must also play a key role". The report comes after Barbados's prime minister, Mia Mottley called on governments from the Global North to back proposals for a new climate mitigation trust that would allow climaterelated projects to access the special drawing rights of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Climate justice campaigner Mary Robinson, who is chair of independent global leaders' group the Elders, yesterday backed the Mottley proposals. France is the first developed country to explicitly back the Mottley initiative. \</doc>

T HE run-up to COP27 was remarkably different to last year's COP26 in Glasgow. COP26 received unprecedented media attention. The messaging was compelling and engaged the public. A key focus was keeping 1.5C alive. The media attention for COP27 is more muted. There are many reasons for this - the war in Ukraine, energy and food crises, economic inflation, migration and housing issues. Indeed, some UN messaging on the lack of a credible pathway to limit global warming to 1.5C and the consequences of runaway climate change, add to the muted tone. The current crises, along with the Covid-19 pandemic, weave into the climate change narrative for this century. How these are managed - and their lessons - can inform more effective responses to climate change. It is immensely difficult to do but perhaps too early to comment on its credibility. Science and innovation, as well as people and governments, still have the opportunity to do this. From a scientific perspective, it is relatively easy to outline the key requirements. At its simplest, global warming is all about energy and in particular, how to manage the Earth's energy balance - that is the balance of warming and cooling. Since the industrial revolution, the atmosphere has been loaded up with additional greenhouse gases which trap additional energy, causing global warming. Carbon dioxide is by far the greenhouse gas (GHG) most responsible for global warming. Increased atmospheric levels are trapping more heat than the other main GHGs combined. Increasing atmospheric CO2 levels must be stopped as soon as possible. For this to happen globally, we must get back to the situation that existed for most of human history, in which CO2 emissions and removals were balanced. COP26 stated that CO2 emissions should be reduced by 40pc by 2030, relative to 2010 levels, and reduced to that pre-industrial revolution balance or net-zero by 2050 - if we are to limit warming to 1.5C. Methane is the second most important GHG. It is a strong GHG, but its contribution to global warming is currently about 25pc of that of CO2. Its key feature is that its atmospheric lifetime is about 12 years. Actions on methane can have a relatively quick, positive effect on reducing its atmospheric levels and therefore its contribution to global warming. If the voluntary agreement by more than 100 countries in Glasgow to reduce methane emissions by 30pc relative to 2020 levels by 2030 is achieved, it will be a major contribution to limiting warming to 1.5C. However, a difficulty exists if the actions to reduce methane emissions are seen to create "space" for further carbon dioxide emissions. Equivalence and trading of gases needs to be managed carefully. Globally, much of the required methane reductions can be met by stopping leaks from fossil energy production and distribution. This has been known for years - but such leaks have, if anything, increased. Global food production is also a major source of methane. The solutions to reduce emissions from food production are more complex and on a global level may take some time to implement. It is also recognised that such emissions will not be reduced to zero. The third part of the climate solution is active atmospheric carbon dioxide removal (CDR). We already have CDR through afforestation and some soil management. These are positive developments but much more is needed and urgently. Large-scale CDR is needed in two situations - one, if the carbon dioxide budget for limiting warming in line with the Paris Agreement temperature goal is exceeded, and two, to offset residual emissions of non-CO2 GHGs which cannot be reduced to zero. The scale of CDR required is not yet known. It depends on how fast we can de-fossilise our energy systems and how much we can reduce non-CO2 GHGs. However, it will be large and these solutions are not yet emerging at the required scale. The benefits of CDR for climate and for ocean acidification are immense, but it will require investments and will be costly. Hence the question, who pays? The bill be will be large one way or another. However, paying for mitigation actions now has immense returns for those investments. Realising that return is essential.

British Home Secretary Suella Braverman has said she was "sorry for the errors of judgment" made in the use of her personal email to send a draft government statement to an ally as she faced further questions over her conduct. The Home Secretary set out details of the email blunder which led to her resignation under Liz Truss, revealing that although the message was sent at 7.25am it was hours later before she confessed to officials what had happened. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is under pressure over his decision to reappoint Ms Braverman as Home Secretary just days after she had been forced to quit for breaching the ministerial code. In a letter to the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee's chairwoman Diana Johnson, Ms Braverman revealed a Home Office review had found she forwarded official documents to her personal email on six occasions, although Ms Braverman insisted she had not sent them on to anyone outside the Government. Ms Braverman resigned from the Truss government on 19 October after sending a draft written ministerial statement (WMS) on immigration policy to Tory backbencher John Hayes and, inadvertently, a staff member of Conservative MP Andrew Percy. Ms Braverman insisted there was nothing market-sensitive in the WMS, although it had been intended to help the Office for Budget Responsibility draw up their economic forecasts. The draft WMS consisted of "high-level proposals for liberalising our migration rules", including "increasing the number of low-skilled foreign workers, as well as general plans for controlling illegal migration". Much of the document had already been briefed to MPs, including Mr Hayes, "at the request" of Ms Truss, although Ms Braverman acknowledged that "some sentences" had not been fully agreed by all departments. Ms Braverman said: "The draft WMS did not contain any information relating to national security, the intelligence agencies, cyber security or law enforcement. "It did not contain details of any particular casework. It did not contain any market-sensitive data as all the data contained in the document was already in the public domain. It was not classified as SECRET or TOP SECRET." She said the Home Office review of her email use found six other occasions where she had sent government documents to her personal address between 6 September, when she was appointed, and 19 October. She said that was on occasions when she was conducting meetings virtually or "related to public lines to take in interviews" when she would need to use her personal phone. "None of the documents in question concerned national security, intelligence agency or cyber security matters, and did not pose any risk to national security," she said. Other than on 19 October, "I have not used my personal email account to send official Home Office documents to other people outside of government". She said she had apologised to Mr Sunak when she was reappointed as Home Secretary. "In my appointment discussion with the new Prime Minister, I raised this mistake and apologised to him, and would like to do so again here," she said. She said she had been "transparent about my mistakes" adding: "I am sorry for the errors of judgment set out above and I reiterated my apology to Mr Percy MP yesterday." "I hold myself as Home Secretary to the highest possible standards and I am glad to be able to serve again. I am grateful to the Prime Minister for his ongoing confidence following my reappointment." Ms Braverman is due to face MPs this afternoon to discuss the chaos at the Manston migrant processing facility but opponents are also likely to seize on her personal conduct. Liberal Democrat chief whip Wendy Chamberlain said the Home Secretary "has admitted breaking the rules on an industrial scale" and "must resign now". "Unless Suella Braverman resigns for the second time, the Conservatives will be putting their own party ahead of this country's security." Sunak under pressure over COP27 snub Meanwhile, Mr Sunak is considering reversing his decision not to attend the United Nations climate conference in Egypt next week, with environment minister Mark Spencer saying Mr Sunak would go "if his diary allows". While Mr Sunak is focusing on domestic issues, including preparations for the 17 November autumn statement, he also faces political challenges including the backlash over the reappointment of Ms Braverman. The government's climate tsar Alok Sharma said he was "disappointed" by the decision not to attend the COP27 summit, while Tory former chancellor George Osborne asked why Mr Sunak would "trash" the party's record on the environment. With US President Joe Biden expected to attend, and reports suggesting Mr Sunak's arch-rival Boris Johnson could go to the summit, the prime minister is weighing up whether to go. Mr Spencer said the possibility of Mr Johnson going was not a "consideration" for the prime minister. "I think, actually, he'll be looking at how much he's got in his inbox," he told LBC. "But I think the fact that Boris is thinking of going is a demonstration of how seriously the Conservative Party and the Conservative Government takes these things." Mr Spencer told Sky News he would like to see the prime minister go to COP27 "if he's got time" but "he'll make that call and I'm sure it'll be the right one". Concern at hacking of Truss phone In another information security issue, it emerged in the Mail on Sunday that Ms Truss' personal mobile phone was hacked by Russian agents while she was foreign secretary. Mr Spencer said Ms Truss "clearly was hacked" but suggested all ministers used personal phones even if there was "some little man in China" listening in. "We all talk on personal phones, don't we, you know? I ring my wife, maybe there's some little man in China listening to the conversations between me and my wife. "But, you know, you've just got to be careful about what information you use on which phone and you get a lot of help and support from the security services on that." Meanwhile, Labour will seek to question Ms Braverman about her conduct and issues relating to national security in the Commons, while the Home Secretary is also in the spotlight over conditions at the Manston migrant processing centre in Kent. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said full details around the breach of the ministerial code that led to Ms Braverman's initial resignation needed to be set out to MPs. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "There is a blunt immediate question, which is how many other security breaches have there been? How many other security lapses has she been involved in? And that's the most important question." Another issue dating to Ms Truss' chaotic seven-week period in charge could also come back to cause trouble in Tory ranks, with Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle expected to receive a report on the stormy scenes in parliament on the evening before her resignation. Tory MPs were reportedly manhandled in the voting lobbies as Ms Truss' administration forced them to oppose a Labour motion on fracking, events which contributed to the collapse in support for the prime minister. \</doc>

G REEN Party stalwarts have many reasons to be cheerful as they head to their members' convention in Athlone today. Party leader Eamon Ryan won kudos in Ireland and internationally for taking a lead in difficult COP27 The party can point to a solid achievements since entering coalition on June 27, 2000. It managed to dial down the internal fractiousness which dogged its entry into government and the months after. But deep internal party tensions persist. And while a collaborative relationship has emerged with its two government partners, Fine Gael and Fianna F\'e1il, relations with Leo Varadkar and some within his party can be difficult at times. Let's run the rule over the party based on several key headings. :: THE LEADER Eamon Ryan has regained authority and composure after a rocky period in the middle of coalition negotiations in summer 2020. He had to face a leadership challenge in July 2020, after 76pc of members had backed his coalition deal. When he won that contest with fewer than 50 votes to spare over his rival and deputy Catherine Martin, there was speculation about his future. But he has battled internal tensions and built a good relationship with Fianna F\'e1il especially, and to a lesser extent with Fine Gael. Ryan takes the conference stage in Athlone with deserved kudos from recent COP27 negotiations and some other recent successes. :: PERSONNEL There is plenty of talent besides Eamon Ryan. Catherine Martin has a diverse range of ministerial responsibilities in tourism, culture and other sectors that have posed difficulties for her at times. But Children's and Equality Minister Roderic O'Gorman has coped well as a first-time TD appointed to the most difficult post with an influx of almost 60,000 Ukrainian refugees, and 17,000 others seeking refuge, at a time of major housing crisis. Others to impress are juniors Ossian Smyth and Malcolm Noonan. :: COHESION The Green Party that first entered government in June 2007 was more united than the current line-up. The return of Costello and Hourigan is welcome after their failure to vote with the Government over the National Maternity Hospital. But the pair have indicated they cannot vote for a legislative fix for a dispute resolution mechanism in the EU-Canada trade deal that was struck down by the Supreme Court recently. Costello successfully took that legal challenge. This and other issues show the party is an uneasy coalition of leftism and ecology. :: ACHIEVEMENTS The list is more impressive than the party is often given credit. Climate change legislation is in place since summer 2021 and a series of action plans are being put in place. Other wins it can claim at least some credit for include: a 20pc cut in public transport fares; 25pc reduction in childcare fees since January; generous insulation retrofitting grants; the (EURO)600 electricity credit; a pilot scheme for an artists' basic income; abolition of planning permission for solar panels; improvements on microgeneration allowing sale of excess energy to the grid; legalised use of CCTV to prosecute fly-tippers. :: FAILURES The Green Party in government has not always managed to nail its name onto these achievements. That twins with other parties often managing to steal its "political clothes" on environmental issues. The party struggles in areas outside Dublin, where the bulk of TDs reside, having good TDs in Limerick and Waterford, in Brian Leddin and Marc \'d3 Cathasaigh. They also have credible politicians in Galway, Clare and Offaly and should be able to do better. :: OUTLOOK Maintaining unity will remain a key problem, with the return of the EU-Canada issue, and other matters such as subsidising road tolls. The leadership switcheroo on December 17 will pose issues on relations with a Fine Gael Taoiseach. The Greens must prepare for difficult elections likely to deliver reverses locally and at European level in May 2024, and possibly a tough general election after that. But the core issue of the environment that it serves is not going away. The Green Party fought back from electoral oblivion in 2011 returning to government in 2020. This and the experience of sister parties in Germany, Belgium, and elsewhere suggest these Greens will persist. \</doc>

Political Correspondent Price caps to tackle the energy issue will be a priority on the agenda when Energy Ministers meet today. Minister for the Environment, Climate, and Communications, Eamon Ryan, will meet his EU counterparts across Europe as another round of talks on energy measures are discussed. "There is no agreement across the bloc on how price caps may or may not work," said one Government source, and no decision is expected on the matter following the meeting. It is understood the meeting should narrow down options so the EC can propose another deal to tackle high energy costs. Energy ministers are also to discuss joint gas buying among countries and other measures to try get energy prices under control. Mr Ryan is also to hold more meetings in the coming days and weeks with energy suppliers in Ireland to discuss customer protection. It comes as the Government has said it aims to give people on pay-as-you-go energy meters the same protection against being cut off as customers on bill pay schemes. Government sources have said energy suppliers' hardship funds coupled with State supports should ensure no one is disconnected this winter. Yesterday, Mr Ryan met with British secretary of state for business, energy, and industrial strategy, Jacob Rees-Mogg. Discussions included the prospect of the UK rejoining the North Seas Energy Cooperation agreement under Ireland's co-presidency before the end of the year. The UK will join Norway and eight EU countries working to expand the offshore infrastructure supply chains and to co-ordinate trading rules, grid development, and the location of new wind farms. They also discussed the wider response to the crisis resulting from the war in Ukraine and preparations for Cop27 . \</doc>

The Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin is expected to meet with the British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at the British Irish Council Summit, which gets underway tomorrow and concludes on Friday. The two leaders spoke briefly at the COP27 Summit in recent days but this next meeting is expected to be more comprehensive and could run for up to half an hour. The discussions in Blackpool in the UK will take place against the backdrop of what's being described as a "welcome change of tone" in both Anglo-Irish relations and EU- Britain relations. It comes after Northern Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris announced plans to defer hanged an Northern Ireland Assembly election by six weeks, with an option to extend by a further six weeks, earlier today. Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney welcomed the announcement saying that the people of Northern Ireland need functioning institution Meanwhile Sinn F\'e9in vice-president Michelle O'Neill said the uncertainty over an election was not good enough. "What we now have are new deadlines, multiple deadlines, in which he may or may not call an election," she told reporters at Stormont. "So this is not a good enough space for people to be in and I think the fundamental question today has to be around what's next? What do the British Government intend to do to find an agreed way forward on the protocol?". She said tomorrow's meeting involving the Taoiseach and the British prime minister afforded an opportunity to find out. The new Stormont deadlines are now 8 December with the potential for a further six week extension to 19 January if necessary. That would mean an election would need to be held by either 2 March or 13 April next year if an Assembly is not formed. \</doc>

A series of recent reports provide a shuddering warning that current global carbon emission levels have pushed the planet close to irreversible climate breakdown this century. Their findings are a dire backdrop to the UN climate negotiations - Cop27 - in Egypt opening next weekend. "A 2.5-degree world" where vast areas of Earth become unliveable is an increasingly likely outcome. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) "emissions gap" report, which puts commitments by governments, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), up against the reality of current emissions, and a "synthesis" report by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, came to similar conclusions. The UNEP found "no credible path to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees", and 2022 has been a year of "woefully inadequate progress" towards achieving that critical Paris Agreement target. Meanwhile, the World Meteorological Organization confirmed global levels of the worst heating gases - carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane - all hit record highs in 2021 with an alarming surge in emissions of methane. The one glimmer of hope has been the International Energy Agency's finding in a yearly review that CO2 from fossil fuels could peak by 2025 as renewable energy is increased amid geopolitical instability. Ireland has the kind of ambition now being called for. It has committed to a 51 per cent cut in emissions by 2030 based on 2018 levels and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. This is on a par with scaled-up EU targets under its green transition "Fit for 55". However, Ireland's problem is too much "business as usual". It is already using up too much of its legally binding carbon budget, with no indication when emissions will peak, never mind fall. Compounding matters is poor delivery of climate actions; lack of co-ordination across Government departments and State agencies; and ineffective direction of civil society. Adopting an emergency mindset would help, for starters. \</doc>

Cop27 presents a "once-in-ageneration opportunity" to save the planet, delegates at the climate conference have heard . The event opened in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt yesterday . In an opening speech, the head of the UN's panel of climate scientists highlighted the urgency of cutting greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the effects of global warming . "This is a once-in-ageneration opportunity to save our planet and our livelihoods," said Hoesung Lee, chair of the intergovernmental panel on climate change . The outgoing chair of the talks, Cop26 president Alok Sharma, said countries had made considerable progress at their last meeting in Glasgow, including on setting more ambitious targets for cutting emissions, finalising the rules of the 2015 Paris agreement, and pledging to begin phasing out the use of coal, the most heavily-polluting fossil fuel . "We kept 1.5 degrees alive," Mr Sharma said, referring to the most ambitious goal of the Paris pact, to keep temperature increase since pre-industrial times under that threshold . Yet now those efforts were being "buffeted by global headwinds", he warned . However even the most optimistic scenarios, assuming countries do everything they have pledged, put the world on course for 1.7C of warming, he warned . "As challenging as our current moment is, inaction is myopic and can only defer climate catastrophe," said Mr Sharma . "How many more wake-up calls do world leaders actually need?" he asked, citing recent devastating floods in Pakistan and Nigeria, and historic droughts in Europe, the United States, and China His successor, Egyptian foreign minister Sameh Shoukry, said his office would "spare no effort" to achieve the goals ofthe Paris accord . More than 40,000 participants have been registered for this year's talks, reflecting the sense of urgency as major weather events around the world impact many people and cost billions in repairs. More than 120 world leaders, including US president Joe Biden, will attend, but key figures, including China's president Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, were not planning to come . \</doc>

THREE women came to Egypt for COP27 from very different backgrounds, with very different experiences - but they have one shared message: stop financing fossil fuels. Cut the money. Kill the projects. Save the planet. The project at Capo Delgado is spearheaded by French oil company TotalEnergies, and is backed by other European and US fossil fuel firms, with money from the British government and other countries. Currently under construction, it will provide a fresh supply of gas that will be converted to liquefied natural gas (LNG), which will then be shipped to rich countries in Northern Europe. As Dipti sees it, this is a fresh supply of carbon emissions. She is aware of the LNG controversy in Ireland, and pleads for us not to go the same route. "We need to fight back against it everywhere, in Ireland and Mozambique and everywhere. We do not have any more space to pollute anymore," she says. Apart from the obvious emissions issue, she says the project has caused nothing but grief for Mozambique. "More than 500 families have been displaced, and people dependent on the sea for survival have lost access to it. The fisherfolk can not access the sea. It has provoked an insurgency - and one million people are refugees. "Everywhere that fossil fuels have been found in Africa, it has provoked conflict, militarisation and insurgency. We know the pattern. That is why say no. That is why we fight it." Ayumi Fukakusa from Japan sees the problem from a different angle - her country is one of those financing new gas projects in developing nations - but she views the outcome in the same way. "These projects, which the Japanese government is saying is supporting developing countries, is not helping them. It's fuelling the climate crisis - which harms these countries, but it's profiting Japanese companies. Sharon Lavigne from St James, in the southern US state of Louisiana, has another perspective. Her own country's investments in fossil fuels on its own lands has turned the high-school teacher of 38 years' service into a full-time campaigner. Sharon's community lies in so-called 'Cancer Alley' - an area dominated by the petrochemical industry, where there is growing evidence of major public health impacts. "There are 100 oil refineries within a 10-mile radius of where I live," she says. But when she was a child, the area was lush - with small farms, vegetable patches and sugarcane fields. The existing industries are one problem, but the oil companies see a day when renewables will diminish their value - and they are seeking new outlets for their product. Sharon was prompted into activism by plans for new plants to turn the raw fuel into single-use plastics. "These fuels are hurting the planet and they're killing our people. Our government sees jobs but we see life. This is not just our fight, it's a global fight. That's why I'm here to tell what's going on." Climate campaigner and former US vice-president Al Gore highlighted the problem in a speech on Monday, condemning rich countries' "dash for gas" in Africa and other parts of the global south. Jacob Werksman, Europe's chief negotiator at the climate talks, was asked about the issue yesterday. "It's a very sensitive issue," he said. "Obviously the European Union has a responsibility to make sure we have access to the energy supplies that are necessary for our population - and we have to do this in the context where we have seen our supplies from Russia turned off. "This requires us to go out into the world and find new supplies - with partners that we haven't reached out to before, and some of them are in Africa," he said. He added that this would be done in an "environmentally and socially responsible" way. He said Europe would encourage the developing countries it buys fuel from to also plan for a transition away from fossil fuels and towards renewables. Dipti Bhatnagar said: "The action is going in the opposite direction. Europe is pushing Africa to produce more gas, because of the geopolitics going on there. "It's this lie of gas as a transition fuel, this lie of gas for development - it's all rubbish. They need to stop funding fossil fuels and stop using fossil fuels in their own land. "The countries in Africa say the US and Europe are going to go on using fossil fuels while they're telling us not to - and it's just not right. So it's this hypocrisy of the north is what we're trying to expose." \</doc>

Rishi Sunak has reversed his decision to skip the Cop27 climate summit in Egypt next week, bowing to pressure from activists, his own environment adviser, and the news former UK prime minister Boris Johnson would be attending. New prime minister Mr Sunak accepted there is "no long-term prosperity without action on climate change" as he confirmed he will attend the UN talks in Sharm El Sheikh that start on Sunday. Mr Sunak had been declining to go, arguing that he needed to focus on the "depressing domestic challenges" as he worked on the autumn budget with chancellor Jeremy Hunt. \</doc>

The gathering of world leaders in Sharm el-Sheikh for the Cop27 climate summit should have been an opportunity to showcase Egyptian diplomacy and regional leadership. Instead, almost overshadowing the vital discussions on global warming, the plight of a 40-year-old hunger-striking blogger has pushed Egypt's appalling human rights record and its imprisonment of tens of thousands of opposition figures into centre stage. Alaa Abd El-Fattah, a British-Egyptian national and figurehead of the successful 2011 Egyptian uprisings against Hosni Mubarak, has been on a full hunger and thirst strike in jail since the beginning of the summit. His family and lawyer, who have been denied access to him, say he is close to death and worry the authorities may have started to force-feed him or use intravenous rehydration without his consent, a form of torture. Abd El-Fattah has been imprisoned for most of the past nine years over peaceful activism and criticism of Egypt's government. He was sentenced last year for "spreading false news" after sharing a social media post about torture. He was again detained recently by military prosecutors with 11 others after protesting at the deaths on October 9th of 25 people, mostly Coptic Christians. They were killed when military police tried to disperse thousands of protesters in Cairo angered at an attack by Muslim zealots against a church in the south of the country. Human rights defenders who are calling for Abd El-Fattah's immediate release also protest at the use of military rather than civil courts to try peaceful protesters under the pretext that they are terrorists. Their calls have been widely backed, among others by the UN commissioner for human rights, Volker T\'fcrk, and world leaders from Joe Biden to Rishi Sunak, Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz. Egypt's president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a former general who overthrew his elected Islamist predecessor Mohamed Morsi in a 2013 coup, has presided over one of the harshest crackdowns on dissent in modern Egyptian history. \</doc>

Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan has rejected claims by Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary that environmental levies are unfairly targeting airlines. The Green Party leader appeared at the Transport Committee a week after the budget airline boss attacked taxes on fossil fuels across the EU. Minister Ryan restated his support for higher levies and denied that Ireland was being "punitively taxed". "I stand by my comments at the COP27 ," Mr Ryan said, "which were backed up and supported by the vice-president of the European Commission." He was responding to questions from Fianna F\'e1il TD Cathal Crowe at the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications. "Irish passengers are paying the highest environmental taxes of any passenger group in Europe," Mr O'Leary told the committee last week. While he supported "fair and balanced" charges, as "aviation does have a damaging impact", the Ryanair CEO called for an end to "indefensible" exemptions. Read more: HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2022/1207/1340581-eu-strikes-deal-on-law-to-increase-airline-carbon-taxes/ EU strikes deal on law to increase airline carbon taxes Today, Mr Crowe said that Minister Ryan's push for "increased levies" would "instill some fear in those who work and depend on aviation". "I find that hard to reconcile with aviation growth," he said, "and particularly as an island nation." "Ireland is in need of a taxation carve-out," he insisted, "because at the moment, the long haul-flights and connecting flights are exempt from environmental taxes." "But point-to-point short haul - which is exactly what we have coming out of Ireland - that is being punitively taxed," Mr Crowe said, echoing Mr O'Leary's concerns. "We agreed in unison that this is the right approach," Minister Ryan insisted, pointing to a unified European approach. "Sectors like aviation, shipping and the fossil fuels industry would need to make a contribution to some of the climate damage funds," he said. It was, he claimed, "absolutely the right thing to propose. Europe as a whole proposed it." The minister said that the proposed levy of \€ 1 a ticket would lead to \€ 4.5bn per annum being pumped into a global Climate Damage Fund and would do so without damaging Ireland's connectivity. "I expect it will be brought up in the ongoing negotiations, I hope it will be introduced," he said. \</doc>

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has shared his disappointment in former cabinet member Matt Hancock\' s decision to take part in ITV series \' I\' m a Celebrity Get Me Out Here!\' . The PM gave his thoughts on the way to the COP27 summit in Egypt. The new series began on Sunday November 6 and former health secretary Hancock is one of 12 celebrities to be dropped into the Australian jungle. Mr Hancock\' s inclusion has had a huge reaction with plenty of controversy giving his position as health minister during the height of the coronavirus pandemic. He chose to go into the jungle to "deliver important messages to the masses" and "go where the people are" rather than "sit in ivory towers in Westminster". However, Mr Sunak told a national newspaper: "I think politics is a noble profession, at its best - it can and should be - but it\' s incumbent on politicians to earn people\' s respect and trust. "They do that by working hard for their constituents, as the vast majority of MPs do - that is why I was very disappointed with Matt\' s decision. When asked if he will be watching the show, Mr Sunak said: "I genuinely won\' t have the time\' \' is the honest answer." Mr Hancock will be able to have his mobile phone and laptop with him in quarantine before entering the jungle. This is something that is usually not allowed with campers. On Good Morning Britain this morning (November 7) presenters Ed Balls and Suzanna Reid were talking about the involvement of the former health secretary in the show. For the first episode, Mr Hancock was not shown in the jungle. Ed responded to Suzanna asking about Mr Hancock\' s absence by saying: \' I know, he\' s in quarantine, apparently on his phone!\' Suzanna replied with: \' That\' s not allowed!\' \</doc>

amous artworks doused in soup. F Football matches halted. Traffic brought to a standstill on the busiest motorway. If the goal of Just Stop Oil's month of protests and civil disobedience was to get people talking about the climate crisis, they can consider it a job well done. The group's British arm has since announced that if their demands for change go unmet and Rishi Sunak's government continues to issue new oil and gas licenses, they will escalate their protests. Anna Holland (20) is one of the Just Stop Oil protesters who last month threw soup on Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers at the National Gallery in London and glued themselves to the wall beside the painting, which was not damaged. Bob Geldof called the act "clever". "They're not killing anyone," he said." Climate change will." "It's been really crazy, in a good way," Holland says of the fallout. "Obviously we received some hate for it, and there's been controversy. But we knew that it was going to happen." A recent poll by the Guardian found that 66pc of respondents support civil resistance focusing on climate, but the public response to Just Stop Oil's protests during October has been divided. "We take our inspiration from examples in the past - the suffragette movement, the civil rights movement, the queer liberation movements," Holland says. "They all used non-violent direct action. Even though they were controversial at the time, they worked. They were successful. Now we look back on them as people who broke the system and stood on the right side of history." She joined Just Stop Oil after getting frustrated with the lack of progress from conventional protests such as marches and petitions. "It was like yelling at a brick wall," she says. "Now, I finally feel like what I'm doing for the climate is making a difference." Closer to home, Extinction Rebellion Ireland (XRI) have undertaken protests across the country this year and are pledging to resume civil disobedience in 2023. In June, XRI protesters took part in a demonstration at Dublin Castle during the National Biodiversity Conference, wearing hard hats and headlamps as part of what they called the "dead canaries in the coalmine" stunt, referencing 30 years of inaction on biodiversity. The protest, they said, led directly to conversations with Malcolm Noonan, the Green minister of state for heritage. A month earlier, they protested outside the annual meeting of Smurfit Kappa in Dublin, accusing the packaging company of using commercial plantations in Colombia that displace the indigenous Misak people and harm the regional ecosystem. Within weeks, the issue had been raised in the D\'e1il. So far, so civilised. What "resuming civil disobedience" might look like for XRI's Irish activists remains anyone's guess. Members of the movement's Dutch arm and Greenpeace caused disruption at Schiphol airport last week by cycling across the runway and sitting in front of private jets. It might not be far-fetched to predict a similar protest here. There is a sense among protesters globally that the time for lip service has long passed. Greta Thunberg is skipping Cop27 in Egypt, describing the climate summit as little more than "an opportunity for leaders and people in power to get attention". Such scepticism is not unfounded. One of the main goals of last year's Cop conference in Glasgow was to stay "within reach" of keeping global warming no higher than 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Yet the UN's environment agency reported last month that there was "no credible pathway to 1.5C in place". Current pledges for action by 2030, if delivered, would mean a rise of about 2.5C and catastrophic extreme weather, it warned. Against this backdrop, XRI's climate action Continued on Page 4 Continued from Page 3 campaign co-ordinator Manuel Salazar says its aims are simple: to "raise the alarm"; to challenge government, corporations and employers to take more action to protect the environment. He admires Just Stop Oil's month of back-toback protests in the UK. "I think they have been fantastic, for many reasons," he says. "They are bringing the conversation back into the media. They're completely highlighting what is damaging or detrimental to the environment. I think there's going to be a backlash to that, but at the same time, it will trigger the question of why we are doing this - and how urgent is it." He makes an interesting point about the subtext of this civil disobedience: if you think that stopped traffic or a defaced car showroom is an inconvenience, wait until the climate catastrophe really kicks in. The Irish group is unlikely to do something similar, however, he suggests. "People [in Ireland] don't like much confrontation in that sense," he explains. "Instead of blocking roads, we are just going to target those companies or the government or the bodies that are actually creating this crisis." FIRES AND FLOODS Salazar, who works in Dublin as a tech consultant, joined XRI in 2019 and is part of a 500-strong membership that is diverse in age, origin and gender. Originally from Venezuela, he says he was "quite surprised" by the apathy towards the climate crisis in Ireland, both by individuals and government. "I guess there are several reasons for that: climate change hasn't impacted Ireland so much as other countries, so around eight out of 20 people think that climate change is not affecting them directly, which is worrying," he says. "At the same time, 85pc of Irish people think that climate change needs to be addressed. But as long as it's business as usual, and fires aren't happening, or flooding is happening in our house, we won't act on that. And that's human nature. We are more reactive than proactive." Claire (not her real name) is a Dublin-born activist and academic who has sought to analyse the public's apathy towards climate protesters and the crisis in general. Often, she says, apathy is a defence mechanism, a way to avoid facing up to the gravity of a situation. "There's this conception that protesters are in some ways going too far," she says. "Many people would just prefer that there's a lane and you stay in it." Naomi Sheehan has witnessed first-hand the devastating effects of climate change more than once. In 2019, the Dubliner was caught in the California wildfires, in a horrifying situation where she did not have access to food or water. Until recently, she lived in Switzerland and witnessed some of the extreme flooding that swept through Europe last summer, which killed at least 243 people. There was also a huge mudslide near her home. Afterwards, she talked about the mudslide with her nine-year-old godchild and her young friends. "She said, 'Did you know this was going to happen?', and I had to say to her, 'Yes, I knew'," says Sheehan. "She looked at me with apologise explain to we're in a such hatred. She then said, 'We need you to be the adults. We're children. You're supposed to be protecting us, not the other way around'. They were crying their eyes out because their lives were about to end over this, and that's not OK. "It's why I changed my life. As soon as I knew how bad the climate crisis was, I did everything I could in terms of trying to change things." She believes the Irish government is not doing enough to warn the public about the urgency of the crisis. "They put a load of numbers out there, but a lot of people don't speak in numbers," she says. "Now, I ask people, 'Where are you going to be in 30 years' time and how old will you be? Because I'll be 70 and I'm not prepared to fight anybody for food or water, which we will have to do'. And I've yet to meet someone who is prepared." Sheehan left her well-paid executive role to do a master's in sustainable development. Now a sustainable development scientist, she is also a member of Scientist Rebellion, an environmentalist group populated mainly by scientists. Ian Coleman from Wexford joined the group after doing a master's in bioinformatics at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. He too has been heavily involved in staging protests, including at the World Health Summit in Berlin last month. "For Scientist Rebellion particularly, I think and them crisis' it's good to get through to people that this isn't just a bunch of people you can dismiss as hippies or radicals," he says. "These are real scientists, getting arrested on the streets because they're so worried about this." Speaking of dismissing activists as radicals, Sheehan says Just Stop Oil's recent protests have been unfairly maligned. "There's a lot of heavy criticism coming in for JSO, and people are saying, 'This is not the way to do it, you've lost me' kind of thing," she says. "I'll be honest, 10 years ago I'd probably have said the same thing. But when you've seen the climate collapse events that I've witnessed, all you can think of is, 'I should have been doing way more'. "If a group of people are being ostracised for trying to save their own lives, as well as yours and mine, well I think we really need to take a look at our collective morals and values." It's not just younger people who are feeling disaffected enough to get out and protest. After retiring, Dubliner Louis Heath joined Extinction Rebellion in 2019. Within a year, he had hit the headlines with a protest at Killiney Bay over rising sea levels, dressing as a 'sea god' alongside fellow activist Ceara Carney. Heath is a vegan and decided some years ago not to take any flights but something bigger started to shift within him in 2018. "I started getting feelings about the urgency of climate, and I think it was the first time I considered extinction as a possibility with climate change," he says. Why does he believe that civil disobedience and protests work? "Politicians are vote-orientated," he says. "I remember we were chasing Richard Bruton [then minister for the environment] in all the places he was giving speeches and addresses. He was hounded by us. You could see the expression in his face, 'No, not them again'. One time he was coming out of a talk in Malahide and we sat down at the front of the car and back of the car, but we stopped the car from moving. He was so frustrated and he was ranting and raving, and went off to get a taxi. At that time in 2019, it got into the newspapers. That definitely had an impact." Heath has also been involved in demonstrations where traffic has been stopped. "We always inform the guards that we're doing it, because you're limited to seven minutes - it's not disrupting traffic too much. We usually have biscuits or buns and we hand them to people and have a leaflet. We'd apologise and explain to them we're in a crisis, and they're generally fine. You'd meet the odd person in a mad rush, but they're few and far between, actually. It's sort of acceptable here. If we were in the UK, I would surely have been arrested several times." Heath says that stopping public transport can run the risk of "alienating" people: his own activism in the future, he says, is likely to involve "getting into more detail and easily digestible ways of bringing the message across in a more informed and detailed way". The task of prompting corporations and governments to enact meaningful change continues. Asked what measures individuals can take to make even a small difference in the face of looming catastrophe, Heath says: "People can find carbon footprint calculators online. Friends of the Earth have a good one. Firstly, people should be aware of their own carbon footprint and the ways to reduce this. If everyone in Ireland reduced their output by one tonne of CO2, it would reduce Ireland's total emissions by approximately 12pc. That would make a phenomenal difference." Coleman of Scientist Rebellion suggest emailing TDs to ask: "Are we still subsiding fossil fuels years after Ireland has declared a climate emergency? And if so, can we move that subsidy into some other way to make people's lives easier, without funding the murder of our youth and the next generations?" He adds: "There is so much despair around this [issue] and if you look at the scientific literature on the psychology of all of this, it's really devastating. The burnout rates in activism are so high, but then, when people actually participate and get on the streets, it sort of lifts the despair a bit."

Exactly 30 years ago, in 1992, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child was ratified here in Ireland. Within that, Article 12 states that every child has the right to freely express their views in all matters affecting them, depending on the child's maturity. But it's still somewhat of a novelty to see young people meaningfully involved in decisions that affect us directly. In the last few years, Ireland has taken great steps in including young people in decision making, but there is much more work to be done. Young people have been fighting for this for years none more so than youth activists on climate change. Even beyond the particular problems and solutions of the climate crisis, there is a fundamental principle we have to face up to as a country, which will strengthen our ability to meet the challenges that lie ahead with the inclusion of young people's voices in decision making. If I asked you to picture someone who is a board member for a national organisation, who do you think of? What about someone who hosts national events, who is interviewed on national television, or gives speeches at academic conferences? If I told you that person was me, would you be surprised? When you're a young person, you're somewhat in this grey area of not being a child but not being considered an adult either. We are deemed capable enough to make big decisions about our future, like what we want to spend the rest of our lives doing as a career. We can get jobs, pay taxes, and apply for a driving licence. But on the other hand we are not considered mature enough when it comes to other decisions that also affect our future, like who we want leading our country, or to have a real say in how issues that are really important to us are addressed like the environment and climate action. Young people today live in this paradox, not understanding what role to play. I think that if you gradually introduce young people to decision making earlier it would enable us to engage and become active citizens in our own country, and to grow into understanding how the world works. There are 18-year-olds today who are completely lost because they went from being seen as too young to have a say, to being considered a fully grown adult overnight with all the responsibilities that brings. It's a huge transition to make and we are not properly prepared for it. We so often hear that young people will be the next generation of leaders shaping this country in the future, which is true. But we are also citizens now, and we are important for what we can bring to the table today. Being able to vote at 16 would bring issues like the climate crisis much more sharply into focus. After all, it was young people who stood outside in all weathers protesting about climate change, before it was actually taken seriously and finally put at the top of the world agenda. But still, the voices of young people like Greta Thunberg are all too often swept aside. If we don't feel listened to, we won't engage - and Greta herself isn't attending Cop27 this year for that very reason. However, it's not as if young people are ignorant about what we're saying. We do our research and we look into things, particularly those issues that we care about deeply, like climate action. We are willing to learn and to share our learnings with others. Even though we might be young, when we are passionate about something we put in the work. I'm not saying young people are all knowing - no one is. However we are a whole sector of diverse opinions. All of us keep learning throughout our lives, whether we are 16 or 60. Having more diverse opinions and different perspectives represented in our decision-making would lead to more informed decisions, more open communication, and positive change - for all of us. Youth climate activists today are primarily driven by the principle of bringing people with us and not leaving anyone behind. This means focusing on education, raising awareness, collaboration and bringing people into the conversation rather than being in conflict. And it also means including everyone no matter our background. It's about focusing on climate justice - how we can make sure that tackling the climate crisis does not impact certain groups or communities unfairly. I started off with the fact that it has been 30 years since the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child was ratified in Ireland. Thirty years and we're only now beginning to see the impact of young people being meaningfully involved. Now think ahead to 30 years from now. In 30 years, I and my peers will be the same age as many of the people leading this country now. Thirty years from now will also take us beyond 2050 - the year that all our climate commitments are aiming at. Just think about what that world might look like. That's a whole three decades of possibility ahead. Let's make it count.  Mary Osubor Kennedy from Cork City, 17, is a member of youth development organisation For\'f3ige. \</doc>

The world's poorest countries say they will insist that the UN's upcoming climate talks push ahead with proposals for a fund to compensate vulnerable nations for climate-inflicted damage. Ministers and experts from the 46-nation Least Developed Countries (LDC) bloc, meeting in Dakar, said their countries were most exposed to climate impact but least to blame for the carbon emissions that cause it. They also reiterated a call for "all parties, particularly major emitters" to make swift and deep cuts in carbon emissions, and for rich economies to honour past pledges on climate aid. COP27 - the 27th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) - runs in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh from 6 to 18 November. The annual talks are dominated by often fierce debate on national pledges on emissions curbs and on funding. Wealthy countries have previously promised billions of dollars to help poorer nations avert carbon emissions and build resilience against climate change. The LDC bloc, gathering countries mainly from Africa and Asia, is campaigning in particular for compensation for vulnerable countries which suffer from climate-related damage such as floods and rising seas. It wants the upcoming talks to establish a mechanism to provide funding. "Countries are being left to fend for themselves" in the face of climate damage, Senegalese Environment Minister Abdou Karim Sall told reporters. "It is imperative for a fund to be set up which takes care of loss and damage, especially for least developed countries." The pre-COP meeting among LDC representatives in the Senegalese capital was to be followed by talks among African environment ministers, attended by US climate envoy John Kerry. \</doc>

SEAN\'cdN GRAHAM Northern Correspondent The vice-president of the European Commission has said he does not believe the EU and Britain are "worlds apart" on the Northern Ireland protocol - and urged the British government to "abandon" a Bill that would scrap parts of the post-Brexit trade deal. Maros Sefcovic told a group of UK and European parliamentarians yesterday that "where there's a will, there's a way" to find solutions to the "outstanding issues" around the implementation of the protocol, and break the North's political deadlock. Addressing a Westminster plenary session, he said he wanted to ensure the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland was "as seamless as possible" with "almost all checks and controls effectively invisible". "I believe it could be done, if there is political will. I'm sure that we can sort it out really within a couple of weeks because really both sides of our negotiating teams, we know these topics from all angles." British prime minister Rishi Sunak yesterday met European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen for the first time at the Cop27 climate conference in Egypt, where they agreed to "work together" to resolve the row over the protocol. Mr Sunak stressed the need to "find solutions" to the "very real problems" caused by the post-Brexit arrangements. Northern Ireland has had no functioning government since May as the DUP refuses to enter Stormont's powersharing executive until its concerns about the protocol are dealt with. The UK government's controversial protocol Bill - which would give ministers powers to override parts of the deal - is currently before the House of Lords for scrutiny, having passed through the final stage in the House of Commons in July despite attempts by the SDLP, Alliance and Labour MPs to dilute it. During his address to the EU-UK Parliamentary Partnership Assembly, Mr Sefcovic warned of "serious consequences" if the Bill was enacted into law. He described a spirit of "partnership and trust" between the UK and EU in negotiating the withdrawal agreement, adding it was "most evident" this spirit was needed now. \</doc>

Ireland is to be the location for a new International Sustainable Finance Centre of Excellence. The centre will act as an international hub from which the finance community based in Ireland will help develop a response to sustainability. It will conduct research, help develop talent and conduct leadership activities. Its aim will be to help finance firms to design and implement new financial mechanisms that will help with the movement to a net-zero economy. The centre is one of the targets of the Government's Sustainable Finance Roadmap and will help deliver the Ireland for Finance Strategy 2025. The venture is backed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Skillnet. "Sustainable finance is critical for Ireland\' s future growth in financial services ensuring the industry has the strategies and skills needed to take action," said Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science Simon Harris. "The collaboration between my Department and the Department of Finance through Skillnet Ireland, Sustainable Finance Ireland, the UNDP and EU Climate-KIC to develop the Centre will support the sector\' s future talent development needs and inspire new people to enter this growing new area of work." The centre was launched at the start of Climate Finance Week Ireland. "The reorientation of the financial system towards sustainability is only beginning but has a clear trajectory with real opportunities for countries, companies and communities that show leadership," said Paschal Donohoe, Minister for Finance. "The moment is right for leading financial centres to take a quantum leap to transition in this direction; in doing so, serve the needs of the real economy and support efforts at limiting climate change and biodiversity loss." It is hoped that it will be operational by the middle of January next year. "The International Sustainable Finance Centre of Excellence will help in addressing the challenge of the current finance model not working for both the people and the planet," said Marcus Netto, Director, UNDP Sustainable Finance Hub. "In advance of the upcoming climate talks \- COP27 , its establishment is to be welcomed." \</doc>

COP27 , currently under way in Egypt, is taking place against a backdrop of extreme weather events, with multiple scientific reports over many years stating clearly that the world is not doing enough to tackle rising carbon emissions and the consequences are often felt most severely by those nations and peoples least able to cope. Was any consideration at all given to the carbon emissions accrued in setting up this conference and then having most of the world's political leaders, associated civil servants, global media and others make the journey to Egypt and home again? Will anything new actually emerge from this climate gathering? As wealthy nations compete to choreograph announcements of huge financial aid packages for the nations most affected by climate-related disasters, it will not be lost on many that these announcements could be made remotely.

A rise in greenhouse gas emissions by EU states is largely blamed on a post-Covid economic rebound as countries' GDP bounced back from the impacts of the pandemic. Emissions rose 3% in the second quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2021. The rise comes at a critical time in the battle against climate change, amid warnings that global climate targets and reductions in emissions are being missed. Greenhous gas emissions amounted to 905m tonnes of CO2 equivalents in spring of this year according to Eurostat, the statistics hub for the European Commission. However, emissions remain below pre-pandemic levels of 914m tonnes of CO2 in the second quarter of 2019, and levels have been steadily decreasing in the last decade. Manufacturing (23%), electricity, g as supply (19%), households (17%), transportation and storage (14%), and agriculture (13%) were the sectors blamed for being the greatest emitters. Transport and storage recorded the largest hike in emissions compared to the previous year, surging 22%; while households and agriculture fell by 8% and 1% respectively. Senior research fellow at University College Cork's MaREI environmental institute Paul Deane said the data is "disappointing but not surprising". "We are seeing similar trends in Ireland with preliminary data showing Ireland's greenhouse g as emissions are increasing at a time when they need to be decreasing," he said. "Similar to Europe, strong economic bounceback from Covid has led to more driving and more emissions while increased coal burning to generate electricity is driving up emissions in Ireland. Mr Deane said emission trends are going in the wrong direction and "are at odds with our political ambition and climate needs." Cop27 , the annual global climate summit, has put pressure on the world's largest carbon emitters to detail their decarbonisation plans and contribute financially to countries disproportionately affected by climate change they did little to contribute to. Last week, Met \'c9ireann confirmed the country saw its highest-ever minimum temperature for a November night. At Shannon Airport in Co Clare, the temperature did not fall below 15.5C on Thursday. Daytime temperatures hit 17.5C in west Mayo. In recent weeks, parts of Ireland have experienced up to 2.5 times the average rainfall for this time of year and the World Meteorological Org anisation said weather patterns of up to 35C in Spain were "hard to believe". \</doc>

KEVIN O'SULLIVAN Science & Environment Editor Global carbon emissions in 2022 remain at record levels - with no sign of the decrease that is urgently needed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees, according to the Global Carbon Project science team. If current emissions levels persist, there is now a 50 per cent chance that global warming of 1.5 degrees will be exceeded in nine years, it warns in its latest assessment. The one positive from this year's "carbon budget" is that it shows the long-term rate of increase in fossil emissions has slowed. The researchers for the Global Carbon Project are from the University of Exeter; University of East Anglia; Center for International Climate Research; and Ludwig-Maximilian-University Munich. The findings confirm heightened risk of irreversible climate impacts occurring within a decade due to rising temperatures, and worsening by mid-century as overheating continues. They underline the difficult task facing governments at COP27 in Egypt as they attempt over the coming days to agree actions to address the worsening emissions scenario. The report projects total global CO2 emissions of 40.6 billion tonnes (GtCO2) in 2022. This is fuelled by fossil CO2 emissions which are projected to rise by 1 per cent compared to 2021, reaching 36.6 GtCO2 - slightly above the 2019 pre-Covid-19 level. Emissions from land-use change (such as deforestation) are projected to be 3.9 GtCO2 in 2022. Projected emissions from coal and oil are above their 2021 levels, with oil being the largest contributor to total emissions growth. The growth in oil emissions can largely be explained by the delayed rebound of international aviation following Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, it concludes. Budgets The Global Carbon Budget report, produced by an international team of more than 100 scientists, examines both carbon sources and sinks. It provides an annual, peer-reviewed update, building on established methodologies in a fully transparent manner. It is regarded as the definitive indication of emissions patterns and their implications for carbon budgets. The 2022 picture among large emitters is mixed: emissions are projected to fall in China (0.9 per cent) and the EU (0.8 per cent), and increase in the US (1.5 per cent) and India (6 per cent), with a 1.7 per cent rise in the rest of the world combined. The remaining carbon budget for a 50 per cent likelihood to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees has reduced to 380 GtCO2 (exceeded after nine years if emissions remain at 2022 levels) and 1,230 GtCO2 to limit to 2 degrees (30 years at 2022 emissions levels). These projections are based on current levels of global emissions. To reach zero CO2 emissions by 2050 would now require a decrease of about 1.4 GtCO2 each year, comparable to the observed fall in 2020 emissions resulting from Covid-19 lockdowns, it notes. Ocean Land and ocean, which absorb and store carbon, continue to take up about half of the emissions. The ocean and land carbon sinks are still increasing in response to the atmospheric CO2 increase, although climate change reduced this growth by an estimated 4 per cent (ocean sink) and 17 per cent (land sink) over the 2012-2021 decade. This year's carbon budget shows the long-term rate of increasing fossil emissions has slowed - a significant positive. The average rise peaked at +3 per cent per year during the 2000s, while growth in the last decade has been about +0.5% per year. The researchers welcomed the slowdown but said it was "far from the emissions decrease we need". "This year we see yet another rise in global fossil CO2 emissions, when we need a rapid decline," said Prof Pierre Friedlingstein, of Exeter's Global Systems Institute, who led the study. "There are some positive signs, but leaders meeting at COP27 will have to take meaningful action if we are to have any chance of limiting global warming close to 1.5 degrees. The Global Carbon Budget numbers monitor the progress on climate action and right now we are not seeing the action required." Prof Corinne Le Qu\'e9r\'e9, of the UEA, said: "Our findings reveal turbulence in emissions patterns this year resulting from the pandemic and global energy crises. If governments respond by turbo-charging clean energy investments and planting, not cutting, trees, global emissions could rapidly start to fall. Urgent "We are at a turning point and must not allow world events to distract us from the urgent and sustained need to cut our emissions to stabilise the global climate and reduce cascading risks." The Global Carbon Budget report projects that atmospheric CO2 concentrations will reach an average of 417.2 parts per million in 2022, more than 50 per cent above pre-industrial levels. In a global atlas published with it, Ireland is the 66th biggest emitter in the world (based on 2021 figures) - with total emissions of 38 million tonnes of CO2. The global projection of 40.6 GtCO2 emissions in 2022 is close to the 40.9 GtCO2 in 2019, which is the highest annual total ever. Land-use changes, especially deforestation, are a significant source of emissions, accounting for about a tenth of the amount from fossil emissions. Indonesia, Brazil and DR Congo contribute 58 per cent of global land-use-change emissions. Carbon removal via reforestation or new forests counterbalance half of the deforestation emissions. The researchers say that stopping deforestation and increasing efforts to restore and expand forests is a large opportunity to reduce emissions and increase removals in forests. \</doc>

The introduction of a new carbon sub-index in the EBI will be used to futureproof against a potential tax on agri emissions, according to the head of Teagasc's animal and grassland research and innovation programme, Dr Laurence Shalloo. The comments came at the launch of the newly updated EBI in Corrin Mart, Co Cork last week, in response to scrutiny from farmers present. "We're not being paid on carbon reductions at the moment and all we need to do is look at what has happened in New Zealand in the last month - farmers are going to be taxed on carbon," Dr Shalloo said. "So there's no monetary value on carbon at the moment in four or five years' time that probably won't be the case. "We need to get ahead of it, and what we're doing now by bringing this into the index is getting ahead of it. "All of our data tells us we're reducing our emissions intensity with EBI, and that's brilliant - unfortunately that's not what we're counting. So what we're doing with this adjustment is trying to get us to do both." "For farmers the maintenance, beef index and production are very easy to see and to understand," he said. "Carbon is a little bit of an abstract term and all we've done is reduce the various components to add in a carbon index. So effectively have we done anything? ICBF's Margaret Kelleher responded: "By doing nothing we're actually getting worse. So by having this carbon index there, from what Teagasc has shown us, we can reduce it even more, due to efficiencies in fertility and in terms of less replacements and all those kinds of traits." The farmer retorted: "Yeah but our figures are going up as gross figures because we have increased cows doing increased production. But all we've done is tweaked the balance within." Meanwhile, Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue described the carbon sub-index as extremely significant and "a real milestone in the continued development of livestock breeding across Ireland, particularly in the context of delivering on climate change commitments. "This carbon sub-index is a world first and highlights that Irish farmers are leading the way in terms of their commitment to climate action. "This is exactly the type of forward thinking the Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin was referring to when he spoke at COP 27 and said £s leaders we must lead'. Our farmers and agri sectors are leading, and you very much have been and will be the leaders of change." Minister McConalogue also drew attention to a new trait aimed at reducing the age of slaughter, highlighting the "important role" it has to play in the breeding of more feed-efficient and faster-growing animals, and its "great potential" to decrease the lifetime emissions of beef animals "Ultimately all these initiatives are good for the environment and good for the pocket as well," he said. "We're standing as a sector, facing into an exciting future, with a real sense of optimism despite our many challenges." 'By having this carbon index we can reduce it even more, due to efficiencies in fertility and in terms of less replacements and all those kinds of traits' 'This is exactly the type of forward thinking Miche\'e1l Martin was referring to when he spoke at COP 27 and said £s leaders we must lead' \</doc>

In the days racing up to the final outcome of a UN climate summit the mood swings between despair and modest hope. The "cover decision" is fought over right down to the placing of a comma. It can go either way in securing a better global response to climate breakdown. Cop27 in Egypt is no different with most angst around the loss and damage issue - how the wealthy global north compensates the vulnerable global south for climate havoc. It has been a subdued Cop. There may be 25,000 people on site daily but there is a reduced civil society presence and protest is almost a whimper under the watch of an autocratic regime where one has to register to raise a dissenting voice. Some of the highlights include Australia strutting around with some of the most ambitious climate targets anywhere - when they used to be laggards - and Brazil returning to the fold. Reform The mood enhancer of the week was newly elected president Luiz In\'e1cio Lula da Silva declaring to chants of his name: "I'm here to tell you that Brazil is back!" He promised to save the Amazon, the world's largest tropical forest. Backing for reform of multilateral development banks and international financial institutions such as the World Bank is clearly reaching a tipping point. Their business model needs to change to accept more risk and to leverage, in a systematic way, private finance for developing countries at a reasonable cost for climate action. Prime minister of Barbados Mia Motley and chairwoman of the Elders leaders' group Mary Robinson consistently banged that drum with significant support from French president Emmanuel Marcon. More than 150 countries have now joined the Global Methane Pledge, promising a 30 per cent cut in the most powerful greenhouse gas by 2030 with a firm push from US climate envoy John Kerry. Stephen Prendiville, head of sustainability with Ernst & Young, believes the traditional talking shop approach has gone, with the process maturing since Cop26 in Glasgow. There is a franker acknowledgement of challenges and greater collaboration on climate solutions ranging across mitigation (cutting emissions) and adaptation to make countries more resilient for what is to come. Having participated in a wide range of "dialogues", he says Cop27 "has gone quite well actually", although he accepts his definition of success might differ from that of others. The depth of discussions means niceties are being dropped sooner, he adds. "The layers of challenge are picked at" and "the dialogue is maturing" in how best to address the climate crisis, and not just from a business perspective. "This is massively accelerating the way the UN normally does business," he said. He predicts this outside momentum will build into Cop28 in Dubai and resolve many issues at pace. Prendiville commends the approach to innovation showcased by hosts Egypt by featuring partnerships on mitigation (cutting emissions) and adaptation in start-up hubs, "a mechanism to diagnose the problem, generate solutions and bring hope". There are numerous coalitions of the willing that are sharing insights. A typical example is clothing and fashion marrying up with data analytics and gaming "to make a product last longer in a fashion sense . . . so you gamify it to make it last longer". The First Movers Coalition is pooling capital with a view to tackling industries as a whole, realising no one can take climate action alone. Businesses are by their nature hopeful but applying that ingenuity will enable them contribute to solutions, although he acknowledges they can be accused of being myopically focused on positives. They have to recognise decarbonising is not only an opportunity, he adds, but need to face up to the reality that if 1.5 degrees of warming is exceeded "an awful lot of them are not going to be in business". He participated in good discussions on agriculture with big ramifications for Ireland. Food systems have moved centre stage, especially regarding healthy soils as carbon sinks and key agents for sustainable food production. "This is in a scenario where 23 hectares of soil are degraded every minute - an area the size of Greece in a year." Regenerative farming Not only can you not grow anything, he notes, land becomes a huge generator of carbon, underlining the need for regenerative farming and soil management across the planet. Noting how the Irish delegation is already contributing at the highest level of Cop, he believes a lot of Irish businesses could add to this process, and play a pivotal role in the flow of funds from the EU to the US because of its test bed environment, and a stable economy with an ability to trial and test at scale innovations for worldwide deployment. "We have a good reputation, being solution sharers," Prendiville believes. This is reinforced by having "powerhouses" in food and agriculture, renewables and tech with the prospect of "endless opportunities" in helping a green transformation. Optimism has to be tempered, however, by the reality of a worsening, less controllable climate crisis that makes Cop veteran Sadhbh O'Neill despondent about this year's conference. "The scientific warnings and clear evidence of climate breakdown have never been more emphatic," she said. The time for incremental action is over. "And yet incremental progress - at best - is all we're getting at this Cop. There's no sign of a big move on a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty or steps to make the 30 per cent methane cut pledge legally binding," she said. "Private and public investment is still pouring into fossil fuels, and developing countries are still waiting for the climate finance that was promised 13 years ago in Copenhagen." Emissions Events she attended suggest a huge shift towards market-based instruments and a transactional approach to mitigation, adaptation and even loss and damage. The sense of urgency on cutting emissions using technologies and policy tools "seems to be lost in the fog of credits and partnerships and bilateral agreements yet to deliver any serious emission reductions. I haven't heard any of the think tank experts or financiers mention global justice or climate justice once. I'm not optimistic for an outcome from this Cop that reflects in any way the seriousness of the crisis we are in." On a more positive note, she attended an event on sustainable mobility and active travel - walking, cycling, public transport and railways. "It was wonderful to hear Ireland's own Transport Minister Eamon Ryan hailed as a global leader in the financing of active travel." The message was to dedicate 10 per cent of the transport budget to active travel and shift investment priority from roads to public transport. "While the delivery is slow and piecemeal, as a policy approach Ireland's transport financing is world-leading," she said. Cop27 was characterised by a recognition by industry that the old ways of working are becoming increasingly obsolete, according to observer Prof John Sweeney of Maynooth University. "Of course, it was important to read between the lines of what was meant by glossy schemes promoting 'sustainable aviation' and other projects that wrapped the status quo in a greenwashed aura but there was also much to learn about how the more progressive elements in the private sector were adjusting to a post-carbon world," he said. Foremost in innovative thinking is increasing the use of green hydrogen to power transport systems that do not lend themselves to electrification. "German plans were particularly impressive here with an intention to use hydrogen generated from solar or wind for space heating and transport." It was also intriguing to learn, said Sweeney, that they are investigating the possibility of converting conventional gas-powered electricity generating stations to run on hydrogen. For new stations, this could be achieved after a few years depending on how fast wind and other renewables come onstream to fill any energy gap. "This is something that at least should be considered in Ireland," he added. Japan displayed a neat bank of hydrogen fuel cells powered by solar panels. "Here was a store that could be used in times of peak demand or to improve fuel security. But what was striking was the compact stand-alone aspect. No need to connect to large grid infrastructure was evident. Surely something that could be suitable for Ireland's island communities," said Sweeney. There was a palpable sense the business world is gaining pace on decarbonisation, a trend being thrown in the face of over-cautious politicians. There was even a whole day dedicated to solutions with the hope it would encourage negotiators to take the necessary leap in ambition. Hundreds of proven ways to progress were showcased from climate-resilient buildings (critical throughout the developing world) to remarkable advances in renewables technology. A lot of them were not yet ready to be scaled up to ensure global impact but had a clear pathway to getting there. \</doc>

THE industrial revolution began in Britain, fuelled (pun intended) by the widespread use of coal-powered steam generation. Cop27 . Was this a case of "we started it, you finish it"? Or was it simply British obstinacy? Rishi Sunak may now attend following a public outcry, but it should not have come to this. British global influence is waning rapidly and they can't afford to miss such big opportunities to have a real say. David Ryan Drumree, Co Meath \</doc>

KEVIN O'SULLIVAN US president Joe Biden has underlined the role of the United States in driving unprecedented levels of climate action in an address to Cop27 in Egypt yesterday. Bolstered by the inflation reduction act, the US was investing record amounts domestically on climate actions, he said in Sharm el-Sheik. "This will unleash a new era of clean energy and economic growth," Mr Biden predicted. "It's going to spark a cycle of innovation to improve performance of clean energy technology that will be available to nations worldwide, not just in the US. It will accelerate decarbonisation beyond our borders. It will shift the paradigm from the US to the rest of the world. Let's build on global climate progress. The science is devastatingly clear, we need to make vital progress by the end of this decade," he said. 'Human security' "The climate crisis is about human security, economic security, environmental security, national security, and the very life of the planet," Mr Biden said. Countries in a position to help should be supporting developing countries "so they can make decisive climate decisions facilitating their energy transitions, build a path to prosperity compatible with our climate imperative", he said. "If we are to win this fight, we can no longer plead ignorance to consequence of actions and repeat our mistakes," he said. "If we can accelerate actions on these game-changers, we can reach our goal. But to permanently bend [the] emissions curve, every nation must step up. The US has acted, everyone has to act, it's a duty and responsibility of global leadership." The war in Ukraine made it more urgent to double down on climate commitments, Mr Biden said, calling on every country to align with targets to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. "Russia's war only enhances the urgency of the need to transition the world off its dependence on fossil fuels," he added. Cutting methane by at least 30 per cent by 2030 could be the best chance for the US to keep in reach of the 1.5 degree target, he said. Protesters stood up briefly in the conference hall where Mr Biden was speaking at one point and were removed. His speech received frequent rounds of warm applause from the audience, however - notably when he apologised for the US leaving the Paris Agreement. Mr Biden announced $100 million (EUR 97 million) for adaptation programmes in Africa and, with the support of the EU, special funding to help Egypt transition to clean energy. \</doc>

Reality TV has much in common with the Victorian novel. Themes of life, death and property provide edification as well as entertainment. So it is with the reality TV show that the Tory government has become. Months of blunders and broken promise, betrayals and political assassinations have provided a cross between the gothic horrors of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here - something which may indeed come back to haunt Rishi Sunak sooner than he thinks. The entertainment value of watching the machinations of Tory politics is undeniable but we in Ireland (who are equally gripped) have discovered - consciously or unconsciously - something else. The Tories are a mirror of the party which unsettles all political calculations - Sinn F\'e9in. This should not really surprise since elements of both parties are now dabbling with populist nationalism, even where it is at odds with stated party policy. Last week the language used by UK home secretary Suella Braverman had a similar level of toxicity to that used by Sinn F\'e9in councillor Michael Mulligan of Roscommon. Asylum seekers are "an invasion", said Braverman. "Nobody believes" they are all fleeing oppression, she said. "A dumping ground" for refugees by the Government and "do-gooders", is how Michael Mulligan described his town in an apparent break with the party's stated policies. Yes, anxiety about numbers exists - according to last week's Irish Times/Ipsos poll 61 per cent of voters worry about accepting too many refugees - but that anxiety is clearly rooted in accommodation problems as nearly three-quarters support Ukraine even if it means hardship for ourselves. Mulligan is a public representative. Does he realise Ireland acceded to the 1951 Refugee Convention and has a legal obligation to provide safe haven for those fleeing oppression? Given that "non-re-foulment," the core principle of the 1951 convention, forbids returning refugees to a persecuting country, the phrase "a dumping ground" is particularly obscene. Tarnished reputation The UK, where Braverman has presided over shameful conditions for asylum seekers in a processing centre, is a signatory too. Which makes it all the more surprising that Sunak tolerates her tarnishing of the UK's reputation in this regard. A massive three-quarters of those seeking asylum in Britain are successful. We sometimes forget that only 51 per cent of the British voted for Brexit, and that despite the "borders" obsession of those who did, Britain institutionally is a decent civilised place. Nobody wishes this winter of discontent on them - even if it was self-inflicted. Britain is in recession because an ill-conceived plan for unfunded tax cuts caused their economy - already severely tested by Brexit - to implode. Everything, pensions, government bond yields, mortgages, were affected. It is difficult to decipher policies amid the Sinn F\'e9in rhetoric but capricious unfunded tax cuts are in there. Its plans to abolish property tax will leave a hole in the exchequer - especially since corporation tax will be a declining commodity. Then there's the faint euro-scepticism which can be detected between the lines of its tax statement; "the debt and deficit targets set up by the EU are designed to reduce the deficit, but carry a significant economic and human cost". Is it seriously suggesting flouting the European Stability and Growth Pact which ensures fiscal responsibility? At a time like this? With the reality of our near neighbours' experience under our noses? And what about Mary Lou McDonald's announcement at the ardfheis that Ireland under Sinn F\'e9in will be "energy independent". Whether she means energy nationalism or energy independence as spelled out in the EU plans for Green Deal targets is not clear. But the signs are not good. Sinn F\'e9in's climate change policy is to oppose the carbon tax. In this - energy and climate change - the party is yet again in step with the Tories. Last year Boris Johnson's cabinet rejected Sunak's proposal of a "green tax" on road transportation, shipping, building heating and diesel trains which form 40 per cent of the UK's carbon emissions. Perhaps this is why Sunak flip-flopped so damagingly on Cop27 - first declining, then acquiescing and finally robbing Keir Starmer's policies. Only his sheer elegance as a person rescued his eco-reputation: he moved through the Buckingham Palace Cop27 reception as smoothly as if he shared King Charles's passion for prioritising climate change. Cerebral Sunak replaces visceral Johnson but little changes. As Starmer has already found, for all his manners Sunak can strike below the belt. Former health secretary Hancock, having supported Sunak in all his leadership contests, waited in line to congratulate him on his victory. Sunak, in a lightning quickstep, ghosted him and was several ranks ahead before the hapless Hancock could blink. Why? Certainly Hancock transgressed in lockdown - yes, but so did Sunak. Scott Fitzgerald would have a plausible explanation. Sunak is rich and the rich, as Fitzgerald said, are different. "They possess and enjoy early . . . and even when they enter deep into our world or sink below us, they think they are better than we are." Forty-eight hours later Hancock signed up for I'm a Celebrity Get me Out of Here. Sunak has ensured the reality TV plays on. \</doc>

The priority of Cop27 in Sharm el-Sheikh is to ensure a continuation of life on this planet as we know it. Yet some argue that the goal of limiting the increase in temperatures above pre-industrial levels to the recommended 1.5 degrees should be declared dead: it is no longer realistic. Adapting our goals to our failures is a defeat. If we fail to reduce emissions faster, we will end up having to spend far more on adaptation. We will also have to discover ways of removing vast quantities of carbon from the atmosphere. We may even have to adopt the fraught option of geoengineering. True, some, perhaps even much, of this might become inescapable in the end. Indeed, adaptation already is, as Pakistan's flood disaster shows. Yet we must stop pouring greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This remains a priority. Again, some argue that those who have made free use of the global carbon sink for up to two centuries owe reparations to those who have not. The disparity in cumulative emissions per head is stark indeed. Yet once again, diverting attention from the priorities of today to compensation for injustices in the past will lead not to action but to endless and unproductive disputes. So, what needs to happen if we are to hope even to stay close to the agreed temperature ceiling? The Energy Transitions Commission presents a sobering picture: by 2030, annual CO2 emissions need to be 22 gigatonnes lower than under "business as usual"; only some 40 per cent of this shortfall is covered by (doubtful) commitments; progress towards making new net zero commitments and putting them in law has slowed; and the likely cumulative emissions of China, India and the high-income countries over the next half century will more than exhaust the residual global carbon budget, rendering large-scale carbon removal inescapable. Politics and policy We are in sum all too likely to fail. The biggest difficulty of all lies in emerging and developing countries. How is the development their populations need to be combined with containing and ultimately eliminating emissions of greenhouse gases? Solving that challenge is not a sufficient condition for global success, but it is certainly a necessary one. In the high-income countries and China, the challenge, albeit huge, is one of politics and policy. In developing countries, it is also one of access to technology and finance. This is discussed in the report of the Energy Transitions Commission. It is also laid out in detail in Finance for Climate Action, which comes from a high-level expert group. The problem is soberingly clear. We have a global challenge that can only be solved with huge investments, notably in new energy systems. But our capital markets are fragmented by country risk. The only solution is for rich countries to underwrite a substantial part of that risk by providing concessional finance, both bilaterally and multilaterally, thereby promoting the desperately needed flows of private capital. In brief, to achieve the necessary transformation in emerging and developing countries, there must be a huge acceleration in investment, a parallel surge in external private finance, a revamped and greatly enhanced role for multilateral development banks (MDBs), a doubling of concessional finance from high-income countries by 2025 over 2019 levels, and imaginative ways of managing the debt problems of developing countries. In round numbers, the world will need to mobilise $1 trillion a year in external finance for emerging and developing countries, other than China. This is not about the $100 billion a year that the high-income countries promised and have so far failed to deliver. This is about something far bigger than that. Without all this, the targets laid out in the Paris agreement and Glasgow pact will not be achieved: they will be unaffordable. Some in the high-income group, frightened by these sums, may hope that these countries will spend less and grow less. But, quite apart from being unconscionable, this would mean continuing growth along today's destructive path of high emissions and large-scale deforestation. The more transformative and more generous path is that of rational self-interest. The needs are indeed huge. Emerging and developing countries, other than China, will need to spend some 4.1 per cent of GDP on a "big-push" investment strategy in sustainable infrastructure by 2025 and then 6.5 per cent of GDP in 2030, up from 2.2 per cent in 2019. This will demand radical policy reforms, notably elimination of distorting subsidies to fossil fuels and carbon pricing. One way to achieve the latter might be to maintain domestic prices of fossil fuels at today's high level as and when world prices fall. A substantial part of the needed additional financing, perhaps as much as half, would, it is hoped, come from domestic resources. But a big part must come from external sources, via public and private partnerships that make the needed flows available. Yet, as soon as all this is spelt out, people are likely to conclude that it is unrealistic. It is not. The bulk of the additional external finance will come from the private sector and more imaginative use of the balance sheets of MDBs. The high-level group does recommend that annual bilateral concessional finance for climate should rise by $30 billion by 2025. But this would be a mere 0.05 per cent of the GDP of all rich countries. Nobody can reasonably argue this would be unaffordable. Rather, it is not doing so that would be unaffordable. We are required to fight a war we just have to win. We cannot afford, practically or morally, to leave a world with an irreversibly destabilised climate to the future, possibly even the near future. We should not give up without trying. At Cop27 , we must do so, in earnest. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022 \</doc>

The Taoiseach has said the Government is to consult tech giants whose Ireland-based employees are at risk of redundancy. Micheal Martin said there are issues within the digital sector and he is concerned over the potential job losses in the state. He made the comments as Tanaiste Leo Varadkar meets officials from the Industrial Development Agency (IDA) over job losses at Twitter. It is understood that Mr Varadkar is meeting IDA representatives on Monday evening as Twitter begins to lay off members of its Irish workforce. The social media giant told Ireland-based staff that it will comply with Irish company law that requires it to engage with the Minister for Enterprise about its redundancy plans. It is expected to enter a 30-day consultation period with staff, during which time they are not required to work or attend the office. Speaking in Egypt at the Cop27 conference, Mr Martin said: ``We will consult with all the various companies. I have been concerned for some time in terms of the global economic situation because of the war in Ukraine and the implications across Europe and the world, the migration and so on. ``But that said, we have bounced back strongly from Covid-19, we do export heavily on what we produce so what happens globally has an impact on Ireland. So our challenge is to make sure that we will engage with the IDA and companies. ``We have faced this situation before, where we consolidate, we look for new opportunities in times when it picks up again in those particular sectors. ``There are issues clearly in the digital area, we are always concerned whether there is potential job losses. ``But we always tend to look at it with a view of, OK, there are realities out there that we can't change globally, how do we deal with this domestically and how do we regroup, what new opportunities are out there in these sectors?'' Employees at Twitter received an email on Friday morning advising them not to go into the office as their badge access was being suspended. Ireland is host to several tech giants' European headquarters, including Twitter, Google and Facebook. It has also emerged that Meta, the Facebook parent group, is planning layoffs this week that will affect thousands of staff. The announcement is expected to be made on Wednesday. \</doc>

A week ago Rishi Sunak became the third British prime minister and Tory leader this year, his elevation in large part due to his reputation for fiscal competence. Compared to the economically disastrous Liz Truss and the scandal-ridden Boris Johnson, just about any reasonably capable and organised politician would manage to look good. But Mr Sunak is clearly trying to portray himself as something better, a leader determined to move on from chaos and division, pledging to bring \' integrity and accountability\' to his government. All laudable aims, of course, which every prime minister should aspire to. However his reappointment of Suella Braverman as home secretary just six days after she resigned from Liz Truss\' s cabinet raised concerns that have only deepened during the past week. Ms Braverman stepped down on October 19 after admitting breaching the ministerial code by sending confidential material from her private email address. Questions have intensified about her actions, particularly around her insistence that as soon as she realised her mistake, she \' rapidly reported this on official channels\' . It has been reported that some hours passed before she was in contact with the cabinet secretary. Then yesterday, in a letter to the chair of the home affairs committee, Ms Braverman admitted sending government documents to her personal email address six times during her short spell as Liz Truss\' s home secretary. This is in addition to the breach that led to her resignation. Ms Braverman was also forced to defend herself in the House of Commons over her policy on asylum seekers, amid disturbing reports of overcrowding and an outbreak of diptheria at the Manston migrant centre in Kent. The prime minister is also facing his own pressures over his decision not to attend the COP27 conference in Egypt this month. While the value of such events can be debated, there is a danger that failing to show up to a major summit on climate change sends out entirely the wrong message about his government\' s commitment to tackling this global emergency. With party colleagues voicing criticism and even Boris Johnson said to be planning an appearance, there are signs that Mr Sunak\' s position may yet change. It would be the right move but will again raise questions about his judgment. \</doc>

HARRY McGEE Political Correspondent Coalition divisions over the recently announced increases in road tolls are expected to come to a head at tomorrow's Cabinet meeting. Last week, Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) announced it was increasing motorway tolls across the State to "maximum levels". The decision was condemned by Opposition parties and was also criticised by Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin and T\'e1naiste Leo Varadkar. However, Green Party leader and Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan, in interviews over the weekend, indicated he had accepted the increases and argued that they could be as little as 10c per toll in some instances. It comes as Sinn F\'e9in has tabled a Private Member's motion in the D\'e1il for this week calling for the increases to be scrapped. They are due to be activated from next January. The motion will be debated in the D\'e1il tomorrow. Government response The timing of the motion has put pressure on the Cabinet to give a formal Government response to the decision and to indicate what action, if any, it will take to address the cost implications of the increase for motorists. There is a strong possibility that the motion will force the Government's hand to either subsidise some of the increases or to ask TII to reverse its decision. Sinn F\'e9in's transport spokesman Darren O'Rourke said yesterday: "The price hikes will hit people's pockets at a time when their finances are already under unprecedented pressure due to the cost-of-living crisis. These price hikes must not go ahead. "Eamon Ryan has made it absolutely clear that he has no interest in bringing toll operators to heel and is abdicating his responsibilities. He needs to take his head out of the clouds and he must bring all possible pressure to bear on toll road operators and to scrap price hikes," he said. Private operators Mr O'Rourke argued that the private operators of the tolls were making millions of euro in profit. He said the operator of the M3 toll had reported EUR 11 million in profit from the previous year. Cop27 in Egypt and travelled to Paris later in the week for the formal signing of the contract for the Celtic Energy interconnector. The Taoiseach was also in Paris on Thursday and Friday. "The Sinn F\'e9in Private Member's motion will likely flush out the overall view [of Government] in the next couple of days," said the source. \</doc>

From RT\'c9 Radio 1's Today With Claire Byrne, Adam Maguire on what is greenwashing and how to spot it While the term has featured more increasingly in mainstream media over the past few years, it is worth bringing further attention to and unpacking different types of greenwashing, how to identify greenwash and how we can respond. A useful way of understanding greenwashing is via the ' HYPERLINK https://www.ul.com/insights/sins-greenwashing 7 sins of greenwashing' HYPERLINK http://www.ul.com/insights/sins-greenwashing identified by Terrachoice in 2007 The sin of the hidden trade-off This sin focuses on one narrow pro-environmental attribute whilst neglecting to bring attention to more important and wider environmental issues of relevance. This sin, essentially the \' tree hiding the forest\' is the most used. Examples include technology promoting energy efficiency without disclosing hazardous materials used in manufacturing or paper straws promoted as the sustainable option without acknowledging the large water used in manufacturing. From RT\'c9 Radio 1's Drivetime, Green Party MEP Grace O'Sullivan on greenwashing and EU rules around how companies report on their environmental impact The sin of no proof As the name suggests, this sin is committed if environmental claims are made without any credible evidence to support them. TV adverts by companies such as HYPERLINK https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/ryanair-ltd-cas-571089-p1w6b2.html Ryanair and HYPERLINK https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/innocent-ltd-g21-1111827-innocent-ltd.html Innocent smoothies have been banned by the HYPERLINK https://www.asa.org.uk/ Advertising Standards Authority The sin of vagueness This sin relates to claims that are broad and not clearly defined, which are consequently likely to be misunderstood by consumers. An example of such is 'natural' being used to claim environmental benefits of a product or service. Arsenic and uranium are both \' natural\' ingredients, but they are also poisonous. Sins #2 and #3 can overlap with each other given that terms such as \' green\' , \' sustainable\' , and \' ethically sourced\' are vague and meaningless if they are not supported with evidence. The sin of worshiping false labels This sin is committed by companies who create \' sustainability\' certifications or labels that are simply false. These can mislead consumers by creating the illusion that a product or service has been independently certified as environmentally sustainable through a legitimate third-party screening process when this is not the case in reality. Certification by third parties such as HYPERLINK https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/ B-Corp , HYPERLINK Fairtrade , HYPERLINK https://www.energystar.gov/ Energy Star , HYPERLINK https://fsc.org/en FSC , HYPERLINK Organic Association From UCC, the 7 sins of greenwashing This relates to environmental claims that may be truthful but unimportant due to quite simply being irrelevant.

Products that claim to be \' CFC-free\' therefore commit sin # 5 as they imply that they are more environmentally friendly than competitors on this point when in fact they are not. The sin of the lesser of two evils This sin relates to environmental claims of products that are inherently damaging to the environment. While all products use natural resources and energy to some extent, some industries and products are more environmentally damaging than others. Earlier this year, the HYPERLINK https://www.asai.ie/ Advertising Standards Suthority of Ireland (ASAI) , HYPERLINK https://www.asai.ie/complaint/motor-vehicles-2/ banned a sponsored article "internal combustion engine that burned fossil fuels, which they (the complainants) considered was working against the environment" Calling out greenwash for what it is enables us to make informed judgments on the credibility of proposed solutions/n The sin of fibbing The final sin describes environmental claims that are false. An advert of oil giant Shell was banned by the ASA in 2008 for claiming that its oil sands project in northern Canada was \' sustainable\' . In this case, Shell was judged to have used the word \' sustainable\' in a HYPERLINK https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/7-382-9890?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true vague manner (Sin#3) and for making the HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/13/corporatesocialresponsibility.fossilfuels false claim that the project was \' helping provide a sustainable future\' (Sin#7).

MARIE O'HALLORAN, VIVIENNE CLARKE and CORMAC McQUINN T\'e1naiste Leo Varadkar said the increases in road tolls had come as a surprise to Government and "we're not happy about it". Motorists are to be hit with the highest-permitted toll charge hikes - up to 60c per journey - across the country's motorway network within weeks, following a decision to raise tolls in line with inflation. The State-owned M50 will increase its tolls by just over 9 per cent, while the public-private partnership (PPP) motorways have been allowed to bring in "maximum tolls" allowed under agreements with the State, The Irish Times has learned. The new prices come into effect on January 1st. Constituency Mr Varadkar, who noted the M50 toll was in his constituency, said the announcement of the increased tolls "came as a surprise to the Government, certainly came as a surprise to me, and we're not happy about it". Later, at a press conference in Dublin, he suggested: "just because the maximum toll is set at a certain rate doesn't mean it has to be imposed." He had been asked if the Government would be seeking a delay in the increased tolls. Mr Varadkar did not confirm this but said: "I think we have to look at options. Bear in mind the money is used to repair and upgrade the motorways and the cost of doing so has increased. That is the other side of the story." He said he had not discussed the matter with Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan who is at the Cop27 climate summit in Egypt. 'Gold-plated' contracts Sinn F\'e9in's David Cullinane, who raised the issue in the D\'e1il, said rural areas would be hardest hit by the tolls increase. Mr Cullinane blamed the increases on "gold-plated" contracts from the "Fianna F\'e1il era". Aont\'fa leader Peadar T\'f3ib\'edn described the increases as "an absolute disgrace". People are now paying extra tolls for the joy of sitting in traffic for three hours, he said. "The Government owns the M50 and Eastlink Bridge," Mr T\'f3ib\'edn said, adding the T\'e1naiste that "you could scrap those tolls right now if you wished". The president of the Irish Road Haulage Association, Eugene Drennan, expressed disbelief that toll companies would be "so audacious" to announce an increase in tolls at a time when there is a cost-of-living crisis. \</doc>

Even as extreme weather and climate disasters are multiplying, half of countries lack the advanced early warning systems needed to save lives, the United Nations has warned. In a fresh report, the UN agencies for weather and for disaster risk reduction found countries with poor early warning systems on average see eight times greater mortality from disasters than countries with strong measures. Proper early warning systems for floods, droughts, heatwaves, storms or other disasters allow for planning to minimise adverse impacts. "Extreme weather events will happen. But they do not need to become deadly disasters," UN chief Antonio Guterres said. As the impacts of climate change are increasingly felt, the world is seeing more disasters that have "compounding and cascading impacts", today's report said. Countries should therefore be equipped with multi-hazard early warning systems, but only half of the world's nations currently have such mechanisms in place, the report found. Poorer regions, often the most vulnerable to climate shocks and natural disasters, are the worst equipped with countries increasingly facing situations with multiple impacts. Fewer than half of the world's least developed countries and only one-third of small island developing states have multi-hazard early warning systems, it said. Mami Mizutori, head of the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, voiced alarm at the "significant gaps in protection". "This is a situation that needs to urgently change to save lives, livelihoods, and assets." As the threats rise, early warning systems have meanwhile contributed towards significantly reducing disaster-related mortality. The UN report showed the number of people affected by disasters had nearly doubled from an average of 1,147 per 100,000 per year between 2005 and 2014, to 2,066 from 2012 to 2021. At the same time though, the number of people killed by or missing after disasters annually fell from 1.77 per 100,000 people in the earlier period to 0.84 in the later one. Ms Mizutori pointed to the recent catastrophic monsoon floods in Pakistan, which submerged one-third of the country, and left nearly 1,700 people dead. "Despite this carnage, the death toll would have been much higher if not for early warning systems," she said. The UN wants all countries to put in place early warning systems within five years, and is due to present an action plan during November's COP27 climate summit in Egypt. "Those who have done the least to cause the climate crisis are paying the highest price," Mr Guterres said. \</doc>

Rishi Sunak has defied calls to sack Gavin Williamson despite conceding the senior minister's threatening and abusive texts to a colleague were "not acceptable". The British prime minister is under fire for bringing Sir Gavin back into the government when he knew he was under investigation for allegedly bullying former chief whip Wendy Morton. Downing Street said Sir Gavin maintained the full confidence of Mr Sunak, who insisted he would not act against the Cabinet Office minister until the outcome of a Tory party investigation. Labour leader Keir Starmer argued that the twice-sacked minister was "clearly not suitable" for the job and that Mr Sunak appointing his ally to government showed he was "weak". In a series of expletive-laden texts exposed over the weekend, Sir Gavin accused Ms Morton of seeking to "punish" MPs out of favour with then-premier Liz Truss by excluding them from Queen Elizabeth's funeral, warning: "There is a price for everything." Mr Sunak told broadcasters travelling with him to the Cop27 climate summit in Egypt that he would not be "passing judgment" until after an "independent complaints investigation", understood to be the internal investigation launched by the Conservative party. "I want to see the results of that, obviously, but I've been very clear that language is not right, it's not acceptable," he said. "And that's why I welcome the fact that Gavin Williamson has expressed regret about that and now wait to see what the investigation says. Former Conservative party chairman Jake Berry said he informed Mr Sunak on the day he took the reins as Tory leader that Ms Morton had lodged a formal complaint over the messages. But the prime ministr went ahead with the appointment the next day, with Downing Street citing his belief that Sir Gavin would make an "important contribution" to government. Mr Sunak has insisted he was unaware of the details of the exchange at the time he brought Sir Gavin back into government, in the vague role of "minister without portfolio". Asked yesterday if the prime minister had full confidence in the Cabinet Office minister, his official spokesman said: "Yes." Pressed on why Mr Sunak gave Sir Gavin the job, he added: "Obviously he thinks he has an important contribution to make to government." Sir Keir told broadcasters it was "disappointing" to be having a discussion about the Mr Sunak's judgment "yet again". "He's clearly got people around the cabinet table who are not fit to be there," he said during a visit to Imperial College London. "That is because he was so weak and wanted to avoid an election within his own party." - PA \</doc>

MICHAEL JANSEN Ahead of the global environment summit in Egypt, 15 Nobel literature laureates have urged world leaders to press Cairo to release dissidents and political prisoners incarcerated since the military took power in 2013. Among the estimated 60,000 detainees, there is specific mention of British-Egyptian dissident Alaa Abd El-Fattah, who has been in and out of prison for the past decade. Mr Abd El-Fattah (40), a staunch secular democrat, has been imprisoned on catch-all charges of "spreading false news" and "supporting terrorism", a euphemism for backing the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. The Nobel laureates called on leaders to "use your plenary address to speak the names of the imprisoned, to call for their freedom, and to invite Egypt to turn a page and become a true partner in a different future: a future that respects human life and dignity". Fostering dialogue The letter was signed by South Africa's JM Coetzee, France's Annie Ernaux, African-born Britain's Abdul Razak Gurnah, Japan's Kazuo Ishiguro, Turkey's Orhan Pamuk, Nigeria's Wole Soyinka and others. The UN climate change conference Cop27 , which meets from November 6th to 18th at Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh resort, is meant to prompt 200 participating countries to present their plans to cut carbon emissions and foster dialogue among politicians, environmental groups, community activists and businesses. Mr Abd El-Fattah, who assumed a prominent role in Egypt's 2011 uprising, had been on hunger strike since April, subsisting on 100 calories a day, instead of 2,500. He has ceased this regime and says he will stop drinking water when the conference meets, risking death before it concludes. Egyptian paranoia "I have decided to escalate, at the appropriate time, my struggle for my freedom and the freedom of all prisoners," he wrote. The British government has intervened since last December after he received citizenship from his UK-born mother. A foreign office spokesman told the Guardian: "We are working hard to secure [his] release, and we continue to raise his case at the highest levels of the Egyptian government." Efforts to free him have been mounted by his mother Leila Soueif, sisters Mona and Sana, who have been imprisoned, and aunt Ahdaf Soueif whose novel, The Map of Love, was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. \</doc>

WORLD leaders have been busy discussing climate change at the COP27 climate conference in Egypt for the last few days. However, there is an elephant in the room that nobody wants to talk about. I am referring to the pollution that comes out of jet planes. According to FlightAware, the world's largest flight-tracking and data platform, there are approximately 7,000 commercial aircraft in the air at any one time. If you look up at the sky on a "clear" day, what do you see? You will see pollution trails that have been emitted by all those aircraft, and it's just sitting there with nothing to absorb it (there are no rain forests at 35,000 feet). If that's not a major culprit in increasing global temperatures, I don't know what is. Of course, we can all close our eyes because it doesn't suit us to cut down on our air travel. However, when the likes of Environment Minister Eamon Ryan and his colleagues introduce a law that makes it illegal to burn a few humble sods of turf that keep people warm in their homes during the cold winter nights - which could result in a two-year prison sentence or a fine of (EURO)13,000 - it's time to draw the line.

Just Stop Oil activists have carried out a protest at Madame Tussauds in London with an attack on the wax work of King Charles III. Protestors recorded themselves hitting the waxwork of the new king with a chocolate cake. The protest is the latest in a series of incidents led by Just Stop Oil, which has also seen the group block traffic outside of London\' s famous Abbey Road studios and protestors stage a sit-in at the top of the Queen Elizabeth II bridge near Dartford. The group took to social media following the incident to explain the protest which took place on Monday morning. The group said:  Two supporters of Just Stop Oil have covered a Madame Tussauds waxwork model of King Charles III with chocolate cake, demanding that the Government halts all new oil and gas licences and consents. Eilidh McFadden, 20, from Glasgow, and Tom Johnson, 29, a painter/decorator from Sunderland, were the two members of the group involved in the protest at the world famous wax works. They said:  The science is clear. The demand is simple: just stop new oil and gas. It\' s a piece of cake. The spokesperson for the group said on social media:  The action takes place a few weeks ahead of COP 27 which King Charles III has reportedly abandoned plans to attend and deliver a speech at, on the advice of the then, now former Prime Minister Liz Truss. Both protestors were arrested by the Metropolitan Police. \</doc>

Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin will meet British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at the British-Irish Council Summit in Blackpool today. Discussions will focus on the importance of making progress in the negotiations between the UK and the EU on the Northern Ireland Protocol and the need to restore the Executive there. This will be the first comprehensive face to face meeting between Mr Martin and Mr Sunak after they spoke briefly at the COP27 summit in Egypt earlier in the week. Right now, the relationship between the Irish and British governments is described as steady, and both are united on the key issues and working well together. Discussions this evening will aim to build on that, but much too will hinge on discussions in Brussels and whether or not an agreement can be struck before Christmas to resolve the protocol issue. It is expected that the British Prime Minister will reiterate his commitment to restoring the Northern Ireland Executive, and he is likely to say he is determined this should happen as quickly as possible. The British-Irish Council is made of up Irish and UK government representatives along with those from Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey. The absence of a functioning Northern Ireland Executive means it will not have official representatives at the two-day event. It was established under Good Friday Agreement to promote positive relationships and it is the first time since 2007 that a British Prime Minister has attended. During his time in Blackpool, Mr Martin will also meet members of the Irish community in the north of England along with the Mayor of Liverpool City Region Steve Rotheram, and the Manchester Greater Authority Mayor, Andy Burnham. The Northern Ireland Secretary has said "today's meeting between the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach is part of hopefully a very positive reset in the relationship that we have with Ireland". Speaking to LBC's Nick Ferrari, Chris Heaton-Harris added: "And indeed, have a good reset of relationships between James Cleverly and a guy called Maro  ef ovi , who is the European Commission's negotiator for this matter." He went on: "The problems are that lots of goods now are not available in Northern Ireland that are available in England, Scotland, and Wales. And that's because the European Commission insisted on essentially types of potentially, in the future, customs checks, because they worry about goods flowing from the United Kingdom into the European single market. So we absolutely believe we can fix this by sharing of data." Asked whether we will still be talking about the Northern Ireland Protocol in six months, Mr Heaton-Harris said: "God, I hope not. I mean, it's a very important thing. It really genuinely is. I am a very good Eurosceptic and everything, but there are also many other important things to be talking about."

There have been some tentative signs that a breakthrough may be possible in the coming weeks on the continuing impasse around the Northern Ireland protocol. Speaking in Westminster on Monday, European Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said that the difficulties could be overcome "within a couple of weeks". Meeting on the margins of the Cop27 conference in Egypt, British prime minister Rishi Sunak and commission president Ursula von der Leyen restated their commitment to finding an agreed solution. Irish Government figures have commented favourably on a new tone from London since the departure of Boris Johnson, and the arrival of Sunak in Downing Street has further fuelled optimism that a change in the British approach, enabling an agreement to be reached which would essentially involve a light-touch implementation of the present protocol, is on the cards. It would be long past time. A sense of urgency on all sides would be good to see. Northern Ireland is without a government and on a countdown to another fruitless election that will solve nothing and only harden divisions. Despite the improved mood music, however, overcoming the current impasse will not be easy. Both Dublin and Brussels have signalled their willingness to compromise and there are signs of progress on one of the key issues - how to check goods moving from Britain into Northern Ireland. It remains to be seen if a way can be found around the red lines. Dublin requires that there is no hint of checks being needed at the Irish Border, or on goods leaving for Continental Europe. The EU is insistent on protecting the integrity of the Single Market. The DUP believes there should be no checks on goods entering from Britain. Meanwhile there is no immediately apparent solution to some other key difficulties, such as the role of the European Court of Justice in disputes. There is no reason why agreement cannot be hammered out on these issues. But unless London moderates its previous position, there will be no deal. If he is to make that move, it will require Sunak to face down some of the Brexit ultras within his own party. We have not yet had the opportunity to gauge his stomach for that fight. In addition, if it is to pave the way for the power-sharing institutions to be resuscitated, a deal will have to be acceptable to the DUP. But the DUP's demands may well be beyond the eventual UK government position, and certainly beyond what the EU could live with. Unless the DUP is willing to compromise, the party may be faced with the prospect of being utterly isolated, holding out for demands not supported by London, Dublin, Brussels - or by most of the other Northern parties. It would be hard to imagine how this approach could be in the best interests of all the people of Northern Ireland. \</doc>

IF THE UK does not push for access to a hunger-striking British Egyptian activist at risk of dying during COP27 this weekend it will be like giving Cairo a "green light" to kill him, his family have warned. Alaa Abdel Fattah is a political activist who has been on hunger strike in a Cairo prison for more than six months demanding his right to a consular visit from British diplomats. This week he began refusing all food, even the 100 calories daily that has been keeping him alive. Rishi Sunak, the British prime minister, and James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, are visiting Egypt this weekend for the climate change conference. On Thursday, Mr Fattah's sister Sanaa Seif called on Mr Sunak to use the opportunity to intervene in her brother's case. "You are going to be in the same land as a British citizen dying," she said at a tearful press conference in London. "And if you don't show that you care, it will be interpreted as a green light to kill him. My brother can be saved." Mr Abdel Fattah comes from a prominent family of Egyptian activists and played a leading role in Egypt's Arab Spring uprisings. He has spent most of the past decade behind bars, with his most recent conviction for "spreading fake news" by sharing a Facebook post about the torture of another prisoner. "The government should be using every opportunity at that conference to make clear to the Egyptians that they want proper access to a British national and they want to discuss his case in full," said Conservative MP David Jones. He was among 64 MPs and Lords who last week urged the foreign secretary to lobby harder for Mr Abdel Fattah. "I don't think the Egyptian authorities would be at all happy if there was a chorus of objection to the way that they're treating a British national in their prison system," said Mr Jones. After speaking with Mr Abdel Fattah's sisters, Mr Cleverly tweeted on Thursday: "We will continue to work tirelessly for his release." Ms Seif said it was not too late to save her brother, who has announced he will start refusing water tomorrow, the first day of the conference. "Alaa is not desperate to die," she said. "These are the actions of a man desperate to end this ordeal he has been sucked into for nine years and desperate to be reunited with his family." Egyptian authorities have so far ignored requests for a consular visit for Mr Abdel Fattah. (\£9 Telegraph Media Group Ltd 2022) \</doc>

Progress has halted in tackling world hunger, according to the latest annual research. A toxic combination of war, Covid and climate change has left millions of people exposed to food price shocks and vulnerable to further crises. The World Hunger Index, published by Concern Worldwide and the German organisation Welthungerhilfe, reaches these stark conclusions. Concern chief executive Dominic MacSorley says the war in Ukraine, with its knock-on effects on global supplies and prices for food, fertiliser and fuel, is turning a crisis into a catastrophe. Food security must be rebuilt. The report documents imminent famine in Somalia and Yemen, both cursed by long-standing domestic and regional conflict. Alarming levels of hunger are reported from Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, Syria, Burundi and South Sudan. Another 35 countries, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, are seriously afflicted. Overall South Asia and Africa below the Sahara are the regions worst affected. An estimated 828 million people are undernourished, many of them children, in the 136 countries in the report. Over three billion cannot afford or access good food in a world with sufficient supplies and capacity to tackle hunger and deprivation. This is a shocking picture of a crisis-laden and unequal world. The report's listings coincide and overlap with those that chronicle internal and external war, poverty and exploitation, climate emergency and breakdown. Their accumulating impact is displayed in the report's detailed findings on undernourishment and its harrowing details on the stunted and wasted growth of children or their levels of mortality. These are scrupulously based on United Nations statistics converted into an index. Some of the methodological issues are questioned by certain governments because they are put under political pressure by these findings. That confirms the research's international impact. The infrastructure of international and voluntary agencies which help alleviate world hunger and secure access to available food has been severely disrupted by the Ukraine war and mounting climatic events. Agreements to free up food exports through the Black Sea have paths to a wider peace process that must be kept open in an ever more dangerous escalation of that conflict. In the same way, this report should feed into the forthcoming Cop27 climate conference in Egypt planning world action to limit carbon emissions. Among their most dramatic effects this year have been the series of heatwaves afflicting some of the world's most populated countries where poverty, hunger and conflict are most endemic. In this World Hunger Index and in parallel research on climate we see a convergence of causes and effects hitting the most vulnerable the hardest. That is an intolerable injustice. \</doc>

A case taken by a tiny island nation to the UN could have profound legal implications for smaller nations under threat from climate change. Vanuatu in the South Pacific, backed by a number of countries such as Germany, Portugal, and New Zealand as well as figures such as former Irish president Mary Robinson, has asked the UN Assembly to consider whether the International Court of Justice (ICJ) can adjudicate a climate change case. The nation is one of several islands and low-lying countries around the world disproportionately affected induced global warming. Vanuatu said it was "requesting the ICJ to provide an advisory opinion on the obligations of states under international law to protect the rights of present and future generations against the adverse effects of climate change". If passed by a simple UN Assembly majority vote, due between December and February, it would mean the ICJ would then be able to clarify legal questions related to climate change, including states' obligations to other countries. Vanuatu's special envoy on climate change, Bakoa Kaltongga, said: "For too long we have waited for global leaders to take decisive action on climate change. To put words and treaties into action. To fully implement the Paris Agreement. To protect our children and grandchildren. We can no longer afford to wait." The case was taken to the UN just days before the Cop27 climate change summit in Egypt next month, where governments of the world will look to build on pledges made on climate action. The world is heading for "climate catastrophe", the UN warned earlier this week with "no credible pathway" in place to limit global warming to 1.5C at present. The 1.5C target, as outlined in the Paris Agreement of 2015, is the limit that scientists say is needed to stave off the very worst climate change fallout. The top seven emitters - China, the EU, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Russia, and the US - plus international transport, accounted for 55% of global emissions in 2020. Collectively, G20 members - 19 of the world's biggest economies plus the EU bloc - are responsible for 75%. Of the potential for the ICJ to adjudicate upon climate matters, Mr Kaltongga said: "Whilst Vanuatu has introduced the resolution, we are representing every citizen of every country. No one is immune to the effects of climate change, but neighbours in the Pacific, Africa, and the Caribbean are suffering the most from it. "We have committed to fully implementing the Paris Agreement, and we have contributed the least to carbon emissions but continue to see fundamental human rights violated as oceans rise, our land disappears and cyclones become more powerful and more deadly. "The world must come together as one to respect existing international legal obligations and slow global warming." \</doc>

The CEO of Ryanair has told an Oireachtas committee that environmental aviation charges are damaging the connectivity of peripheral states, including Ireland. "Irish passengers are paying the highest environmental taxes of any passenger group in Europe," Michael O'Leary told the Joint Committee on Transport and Communication. While he supports "fair and balanced" charges, as "aviation does have a damaging impact," he called for an end to "indefensible" exemptions, including for connecting flights. Around 80% - 90% of Ryanair passengers pay an environmental tax, he said, but only 16% of those on KLM flights through Amsterdam and Rotterdam do. This is disproportionate and "grossly inequitable", he said. That exemption is about protecting a national carrier and not the environment, Mr O'Leary said, adding that long-haul passengers should pay more than short-haul passengers, as they are producing higher emissions. The reforms he is suggesting should be at the heart of a new policy, he said. He expressed concern at calls from governments for "even more levies" on aviation which were made at COP27 at Sharm el-Sheikh. "We accept that aviation must pay its fair share," he said, but insisted that "it is not the cause of global warming". The aviation industry accounts for 2.8% of European CO2 emissions, he said, whereas marine transport contributes over 5%. The "shambles" of European air traffic control (ATC) accounts for a fifth of Ryanair's fuel consumption and emissions, and 90% of its delays, Mr O'Leary said. Reforming it could boost Irish air traffic by 50% over the next five years, and create 14,000 jobs, he claimed. Mr O'Leary said that forcing aircraft to go "zig-zagging" through 47 different air traffic control zones, so that each can get "a little piece of the pie", is "bizarre". Ryanair aims to grow passenger numbers by 60 million a year, and Mr O'Leary said that he wants 15 million of that to be routed through Ireland. But he insisted that this will require that the Government puts reform of European ATC at the heart of its aviation policy. Most of the growth would be in Dublin, he said, provided that its capacity is expanded, as "we need another low cost terminal". The airline is projected to carry 168 million passengers in the year up to next April, which would constitute a 13% rise on pre-Covid traffic. He claimed that Ireland is "massively over-airported", and sees "no viable future" for Donegal, Sligo, Galway or Waterford airports, with the "heroic sums" spent on these facilities being "completely wasted". These include aircraft which are more fuel efficient and 40% less noisy. \</doc>

The adoption of a British-style counselling system embedded in Irish schools could "almost eliminate" lengthy waiting lists in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs), the Ombudsman for Children has said. Niall Muldoon was referencing a model being trialled with much success in Dorset, England, which allocates about four dedicated mental health professionals per 7,500 schoolchildren. He said such a system was achievable if Ireland "established it slowly" and "create a system that is attractive for [counsellors] to join". He urged the Department of Health to aid the Department of Education in developing this model, which he said it has been reluctant to do thus far, and called for it to match the 5m spent by the department on counselling trials in secondary schools. Mr Muldoon was speaking at yesterday's sitting of the Oireachtas joint committee on education. He said there is a "window of opportunity opening now for our politicians and civil servants to create a world-class therapeutic service within our education system that is collaborative and integrated, not separate and in competition with our health system. Our children deserve no less." He warned the Department of Education not to distribute funds directly to schools to individually source counsellors, as this puts pressure on alreadystruggling principals. "We are living in a society that is high-pressured for children in which it never was before," he said. "You can catch up with your academics when you're 25 or 40, but you can't catch up on development of self-esteem." Suzanne Connolly, chief executive of children's charity Barnardos, said the pandemic had done little to help the crisis. She called for increased funding from the Government for early-intervention school programmes. The ombudsman added to this, suggesting that parents control and monitor children's internet usage. Chief executive of Grow it Yourself Michael Kelly said an increasing number of children are struggling with climate anxiety. He urged adults to "modulate our language" around children when talking about climate change, and headlines featuring terms such as "climate hell" and "doom" coming out of Cop27 can be difficult for adults to process - never mind children. Grow it Yourself has piloted school gardens in over 130 schools, at 2,000 for four raised beds and 14 types of vegetables to be grown throughout the school year. Mr Kelly argued not only do gardens have mental health benefits, with "happiness-boosting bugs in the soil", but it is "critical that we provide these students with the tools, knowledge, and life skills to support their wellbeing into the future" in the context of a worsening food crisis amid climate heating. He envisages rolling the project out to half of Irish schools by 2024, followed by every school by 2030. He urged the committee to support calls to obtain Government funding for the plans. \</doc>

Students and activists have accused the government of inaction on climate change at a protest outside Leinster House. The demonstration, organised by students at Trinity College Dublin, coincided with the Cop27 UN climate conference being held in the Egyptian city of Sharm El-Sheikh. Activists with homemade signs sat cross-legged on Molesworth Street while listening to speakers criticise world leaders attending the summit, as well as Egypt's human rights record. The words ``fossil fuel RIP'' were spray-painted on the pillars at the gates of Leinster House, and the crowd chanted ``system change not climate change'' as they moved outside the gates. One speaker told the crowd that Transport Minister Eamon Ryan had said previous climate protests had an impact on government, and appealed to Irish leaders to ``listen to the science and listen to young people''. Trinity student Lean, who did not give his surname, said that the current way of living ``should not be seen as normal''. ``It is a system of colonialism, extraction and massive inequality across countries and across classes. ``This is why our demand should be system change, not climate change,'' he told the protest. Secondary school student Kate Devitt told the crowd that ``the science is clear'' and ``we need to uproot the system which is killing our world''. ``In order to right these wrongs, we must come together. Governments, corporations and individuals, working together to achieve real change, radical change. ``This time must be different, our government needs to listen. We need more than just a photo opportunity for those in power. ``If they really cared, I wouldn't be here today. We wouldn't be here begging for action. ``We wouldn't be here skipping school and striking on the streets to demand action if they were actually listening. They hear us but they don't listen. ``Taoiseach, Tanaiste and Minister Ryan, your inaction speaks volumes and the world is listening.'' Professor Clare Kelly accused the government of thinking ``why do today what we can put off until tomorrow''. While addressing the crowd, she asked of Taoiseach Micheal Martin: ``Can you explain to me, a Thaoisigh, how being the EU's third highest per capita emitter of greenhouse gases is consistent with doing everything in our power to ensure a sustainable planet? ``Can you explain to me, a Thaoisigh, how setting sectoral emissions reductions targets that are neither consistent with our own climate legislation nor specify the level that will make them actionable or enforceable is consistent with doing everything in our power to ensure a sustainable planet? ``And can you explain to me, finally a Thaoisigh, how people having to decide between eating or heating while energy companies turn and report record profits is consistent with doing everything in our power to ensure a sustainable planet?'' Among the groups at the protest were the Climate Justice Coalition, Extinction Rebellion, Fridays For Future, One Planet For All, Oxfam Ireland, People Before Profit, and Rosa. end \</doc>

Last Thursday week Environment, Climate and Communications Minister Eamon Ryan was talking on RTE Radio 1's Claire Byrne Show before heading out to the COP27 conference in Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt. He spoke about how we are at the vanguard when it comes to wind generation. Two-thirds of our electricity is on occasions generated by wind, which is impressive. Mr Ryan made great sense and I got the impression he was on top of his brief. 44,000 family homes have solar panels on their roofs and they now have the facility to sell electricity back to the grid. But as he was speaking my mind wandered back to my experiences with Electric Ireland. On the previous Tuesday I dialled 1800 372 372 to obtain information on how to use my new smart meter. That is the telephone number that is printed on the top right-hand side of my Electric Ireland bill. I dialled the number three times. Each time I was told by an automatic answering machine: 'The number you have dialled has not been recognised, please check and try again'. Sometime later I tried it again and guess what, I got through to Electric Ireland. I spent an inordinate length of time waiting to get speaking to a human voice. When I asked about my new smart meter I was told I would be redirected to a different number and the wait time would be approximately 15 minutes. I terminated the call. I phoned the Commission for Regulations of Utilities (CRU), who told me, yes they were aware of the problem with that number. Sometimes it works, other times it doesn't and Electric Ireland is aware of the issue. Just as the Eamon Ryan interview was concluded I received this SMS from Electric Ireland: "Dear Customer, we are currently experiencing high call volumes. We apologise that you were not successful in speaking with a representative on your recent contact. You may find the answer to your query on our website HYPERLINK https://www.electricireland.ie/help/billing https://www.electricireland.ie/help/billing ." Some weeks ago I sent two queries via such a medium. So far they have not replied. On a subsequent call I was told that Electric Ireland would phone me within two working days to answer my queries about the smart meter. So far I have received no call back. Electric Ireland's customer care is shambolic. I sincerely hope the generation and distribution of our electricity is not in a similar shambles. \</doc>

Talks to reach a meaningful deal between wealthy and vulnerable nations on how to avert the worst of climate change are in danger because of a "clear breakdown in trust". That is according to UN Secretary General Antonio Guter res, who yesterday warned negotiators at the Cop27 summit in Egypt that the "world is watching" as they struggled to come to an agreement before the end of the event at the weekend. The US is among the nations reluctant to agree to the fund, fearing it would leave it open to a range of legal liabilities because of its traditionally high greenhouse gas emissions. Mr Guterres said: "The world is watching and has a simple message: Stand and deliver. Global emissions are at their highest level in history and rising. Climate impacts are decimating economies and societies - and growing. We know what we need to do, and we have the tools and resources to get it done. "There is clearly a breakdown in trust between north and south, and between developed and emerging economies. This is no time for finger pointing. No one can deny the scale of loss and damage we see around the globe. The world is burning and drowning before our eyes." Ireland's Environment Minister, Eamon Ryan, who was appointed EU ministerial representative on socalled 'loss and damage' to work alongside European Commission vice president Frans Timmermans, made an impassioned plea for a deal to be reached. "We hope and get an outcome we can all rally behind. We need this. We want it. We want it, but it can't be under what's been presented so far," he said. The perspective around loss and damage has been "turned into a yes or no on a fund" that will not get the job done, he added. Mr Ryan once again called on the oil and gas industry, as well as aviation and shipping, to be on the hook for compensation. "The global oil and gas industry will see net income revenues this year of $3.9trn, double what it was last year, and I believe it's fair that they make a contribution towards the funding that we will need for the scale of loss and damage we're going to need. "I heard Mary Robinson earlier this week, I was at an event with her, and she made simple points. There's some 4.9bn air tickets sold last year. If we had 1 for every ticket, that would give some 4.5bn towards the loss and damage fund. "That could give you a certainty in ongoing funding support to make the change. The same if we could do something similar on every shipping container. It's that variety of new in come streams that would help us bring up the scale of the funding we need to provide for loss and damage." \</doc>

Egyptian prison authorities have intervened medically after jailed British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist Alaa Abdel-Fattah escalated his hunger strike, his mother said yesterday. With relatives scrambling for details on Mr Abdel-Fattah's condition, officials at the prison refused to allow a lawyer for the family to visit him despite approval by the prosecutors' office. Khaled Ali that said Interior Ministry officials told him the approval was not valid because it was dated Wednesday, adding in a tweet that he was only notified of the approval yesterday morning. The nature of the medical intervention was not known but the family has expressed fears prison officials would force-feed Mr Abdel-Fattah, which they said would amount to torture. Mr Abdel-Fattah said in an earlier letter that he was prepared to die in prison if not freed. His mother, Leila Soueif, said she spoke to prison authorities by phone and asked them if her son was undergoing any medical procedure and they said he was. She asked "if it was by force, and they said no" and told her: "Alaa is good," she told the AP. Ms Soueif called for him to be transferred to a civilian hospital rather than a prison facility. "I need proof for this. I don't trust them," she said. She has been waiting outside the prison every day this week, asking for proof her son is alive. Mr Abdel-Fattah, who has been in prison for most of the past decade, is serving a five-year sentence on charges of disseminating false news, for retweeting a report in 2019 that another prisoner had died in custody. Cop27 climate summit held in the Egyptian Red Sea resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh. Egypt's hosting of the event has drawn intensified international attention to heavy suppression of speech and political activity. Since 2013, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's Government has cracked down on dissidents and critics. World leaders and activists have repeatedly called for Egyptian authorities to release the activist. Mr Abdel-Fattah rose to fame during the 2011 pro-democracy uprisings that swept through the Middle East, toppling Egypt's long-time president Hosni Mubarak. His long imprisonment since 2011 became a symbol of Egypt's sliding back to autocratic rule under Mr el-Sisi. Mr Abdel-Fattah's younger sister, Sanaa Seif, has been at the conference, aiming to increase public attention on his case. At the gathering, British prime minister Rishi Sunak, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz raised the activist's case in their talks with Mr el-Sisi. Mr Abdel-Fattah gained British citizenship through his mother, who was born in London. Speaking yesterday at the climate conference, Egypt's foreign minister Sameh Shukry declined to answer questions about Mr Abdel-Fattah, and suggested some countries were using the issue to distract from climate commitments. - Associated Press \</doc>

THERE is an old saying that we should listen twice and speak once. The climate change conversation has gone on for far too long with far too few paying any heed to it. For decades, it has been evident we need to stop talking and start doing - yet the missed targets and lost opportunities mount, while the bill for our carelessness is paid for in the suffering and ruined lives of the poorest people on our planet. It is easy to see why activists such as Greta Thunberg have grown impatient with the empty chatter. As Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin told COP27 yesterday: "This generation of leaders cannot say we didn't know." There is a rule in debating that holds if you cannot add to the discussion, do not subtract by talking HYPERLINK http://www.aimlessly.No www.aimlessly.No one can say there has not been too much aimless and diverting discourse. "Our citizens will become increasingly cynical, weary and hopeless if words are not urgently matched by deeds; if commitments do not generate new realities. We can already see and feel the world around us changing," Mr Martin told the climate conference in Egypt. Nowhere are the harshest effects of that decline being felt more than in the developing world. Witness the year of catastrophic flooding in Pakistan and Nigeria. This year, policy-makers agreed to start talking about poor countries' demands for more help, having seen the harm they are already suffering from global warming as farmland dries up, towns relocate to escape rising seas and conflicts increase over access to increasingly scarce resources. Mr Martin felt the situation is "urgent, not hopeless". Those whose lands or herds have been destroyed by drought or who have been deprived of a home or a country because of climate change-induced conflict see hope as an exorbitant commodity. Survival depends on immediate radical intervention. Climate justice must also inform decision-making. "Those who pollute the most should pay the most," Mr Sall added. Those most harmed, and least protected, deserve more than comforting platitudes. Putting a price on such losses is difficult as studies vary, but all are immense, ranging from $400bn ((EURO)397bn) a year by 2030 to more than $1tn a year by 2050. There is simply no way of calculating the human cost. They need reassurance, and in light of the harm done, it seems like little enough to ask. 'Those who pollute the most should have to pay the most' \</doc>

W ITH the curtain about to go up on the United Nations' COP27 climate talks in Egypt, there comes news that Europe has warmed more than twice as much as the rest of the world over the past 30 years. As Alpine glaciers disappear at unprecedented rates and the waters of the Mediterranean heated up this summer, we should scarcely be surprised. A large part of the continent is in the sub-Arctic and Arctic, which is the fastest-warming region on Earth, according to the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). It has resulted in Europe being dubbed "a heatwave hotspot" by scientists. Yet some improvements are being made. WMO secretary-general Professor Petteri Taalas said Europe is making good progress on cutting carbon emissions. Yet much more must be done. Frustration at the pace of change has led to a wave of attacks by climate activists who have been targeting art museums. Seeing some of the world's greatest art treasures being so treated has provoked outrage and caused many to wonder how such acts could connect with the greater good. They view it as entirely perverse, that the work of the world's greatest painters should pay the price for our dereliction toward the environment. After all, were these not the very people who celebrated the wonders of our planet the most? But others may counter: is it not even more perverse that we are at ease with sacrificing our entire planet, despoiling its beauty simply for material gain? Wherever one stands, the fact that such questions even arise speaks to failure and missed opportunities. Ireland is among a handful of countries that have repeatedly failed to present a long-term strategy on climate action to the European Commission. According to Friends of the Earth, the Government's climate credentials "are on the line, having been recently issued with a formal notice for failing to comply with a key element of EU climate law". Such a strategy would include details on expected emissions reductions across sectors in line with national plans. But already it is two-and-a-half years overdue. Such politicians have shown a penchant for spinning conspiracy theories and lies about climate change while robustly resisting the transition to a green-energy future. Yet we have just seen the stunning defeat of climate-change denier Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. Earlier this year, the US Congress passed a historically large response to climate change. Meanwhile, Russian leader Vladimir Putin's efforts to use his petro-dictatorship to impose energy challenges on western democracies have resulted in a stronger push toward a green-energy future. Democracies are finally mobilising, and we have a deep responsibility to be with them. Such politicians have a penchant for spinning conspiracy theories \</doc>

EUROPE has warmed more than twice as much as the rest of the world in the past three decades and experienced the greatest temperature increase of any continent, a report by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) shows. The report on the state of the climate in Europe follows a summer of extremes. A record-breaking heatwave scorched Britain, Ireland had its hottest temperature in 135 years, Alpine glaciers disappeared at an unprecedented rate and a long-lasting marine heatwave warmed the Mediterranean. "Europe presents a live picture of a warming world and reminds us that even well-prepared societies are not safe from impacts of extreme weather events," WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas said in a statement. From 1991 to 2021, temperatures across Europe warmed at an average of 0.5C per decade, the report said, while the global average was 0.2C. Last year, extreme weather events made worse by climate change - chiefly floods and storms - caused (EURO)50bn worth of damage across Europe. The reason the continent is warming faster than other continents has to do with the fact that a large part of it is in the sub-Arctic and Arctic - the fastest warming region on Earth - as well as changes in climate feedbacks, scientists said. Fewer clouds over Europe in the summer has meant more sunlight and heat now reaches the land, said Freja Vamborg, the Copernicus Climate Change Service's senior scientist. Some scientists have called Europe a "heatwave hotspot" as the number of heatwaves has risen faster than in other regions due to changes in atmospheric circulation. Although temperatures are rising, the EU managed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 31pc between 1990 and 2020, the report said, and aims to slash emissions by 55pc by 2030. On Sunday, delegates will arrive in Egypt for COP27 , the annual United Nations climate summit. Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin is to attend the event in the resort of Sharm El Sheikh. It is understood he will be accompanied by Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney. Their presence will be a demonstration of Ireland's commitment to meeting the Paris Agreement goals of reducing carbon emissions by 51pc within this decade and achieving net zero by 2050. The two men will visit the summit in the first week of its deliberations, with Climate Minister Eamon Ryan, the leader of the Green Party, taking over in the second week when the negotiations stage begins. Earlier this year, the Government finally agreed a set of emissions reductions targets for every sector, with controversy over the 25pc set for agriculture, which is one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases in Ireland. In updated comments added to a government website yesterday, Mr Ryan said: "We've seen this summer how temperatures across Europe have soared and tens of thousands of people have been evacuated because of wildfires. \</doc>

Environment Correspondent The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has warned that climate change is impacting all sorts of weather norms, including unseasonably high temperatures in Europe coming into the winter. The WMO pointed to "hard-to-believe" data from southern Spain that has seen temperatures of up to 35C, France experiencing nine days where the temperature was more than 4C above average for October, and more than 25 sites in the UK where the mercury reached 20C on October 27. Meanwhile, Met \'c9ireann has said the past seven days have been much wetter than average in Ireland, with some areas up to two-and-a-half times as wet as they normally would be at this time of year. There will be no respite from the rain, the forecaster added. Most areas can expect between one and two-and-a-half times the average amount of rainfall for at least another week although it has also been unseasonably milder. The now semi-regular weather warnings from Met \'c9ireann are set to continue, with a status yellow wind and rain warning for the south tomorrow, following intense rainfall yesterday that brought flood warnings for Cork. Connacht and the northwest are set for the worst of it tomorrow however, with "some severe and damaging gusts" and the "potential for localised waves overtopping along Atlantic coasts. A spell of heavy rain will occur, leading to flooding in places, Met \'c9ireann again warned. In Spain, the picture is vastly different. Its public meteorology agency Aemet said October will probably be the hottest ever on record, with data tracking the last 106 years. Aemet said temperatures reached above 30C in a number of provinces, while the rest of the country saw the mercury reach 25C. The data suggest the October monthly record will be beaten by 2C. The heat has led to yet another round of devastating wildfires in Spain, which has already been weary fighting such blazes throughout the summer months, which were the hottest on record. Figures released last week by the European Commission's data analysis wing Eurostat show that extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, and heatwaves have caused 145bn worth of economic losses in just a decade in Europe. Repeated heatwaves on the continent over the summer, coupled with drought conditions, led to scarring of large tranches of land in France and Portugal. According to the European Commission, 2022 has broken previous records. The UN has warned that the world is currently on track for global warming of 2.8C, which secretary general Antonio Guterres said is "economy-destroying levels of global heating". The Cop27 climate change summit meeting of world leaders, environmental scientists, and policymakers takes place in Egypt next week. It will look to build on pledges made to cut emissions at the Cop26 event in Glasgow last November, with the most vulnerable countries in the face of climate change demanding better protection from countries which have greater emissions.

IN Viktor Frankl's famous book Man's Search for Meaning he writes about concentration camp prisoners who smoke their own cigarettes. The psychiatrist and psychotherapist wrote this book in just nine days having survived three years in four different Nazi camps. "A man smoking his own cigarettes had given up faith in his ability to carry on," he wrote. Frankl and his friends knew that when they saw a fellow prisoner smoking his own cigarettes, carefully reserved for buying extra bowls of soup in service of survival, he had given up and would shortly die. "When a person can't find a deep sense of meaning, they distract themselves with pleasure," said Frankl. This week, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the leading global voice on the environment, published a 132-page report that said "inadequate progress on climate action makes rapid transformation of societies only option". The only thing we seem to do rapidly these days is in things like constant consumerism or fast fashion, which has now evolved into ultra-fast fashion. Channel 4 broadcast a documentary last week about one of these big ultra-fast fashion businesses, Shein. During the programme, it was revealed that workers in one Shein factory received a wage of 3p per item produced. If a mistake is made, the worker is fined up to three quarters of their average daily salary - 100 Chinese Yuan, or 13. Some workers were also doing 18-hour days and only got one day off a month. Terrible stuff. You'd think we'd be voting with our pockets. We're not. Popular social media influencers regularly regale followers with their "Shein haul". And it's not just individuals but investors patting their backs too. In April 2022, Shein achieved a valuation of 88bn ($100bn) following a successful investment round. It means the ultra-fast fashion company that adds 2,000 new items a day to its site, is worth more than the combined value of the world's two biggest retailers - Zara owner Inditex ( 60bn valuation) and H&M ( 17bn valuation). Fast fashion, never mind ultra-fast fashion, is detrimental to the climate. We've seen images from Chile's Atacama Desert of the mountains of unwanted clothes, from unworn jeans to our sequined Christmas jumpers. It's understandable. Pandemic. War. Inflation. Who doesn't want to seek refuge in comfort and pleasure? Pre-pandemic many of us seemed gung-ho to take action on these climate reports. We learned about the difference between recyclable and non-recyclable Christmas wrapping paper, some even made their own climate-friendly Christmas crackers, people were buying pre-loved clothes, and many were thinking twice about all those flights. And this was after we'd all morally moved on from disposable coffee cups and plastic water bottles. Greta Thunberg, the climate strikes and the actions of Extinction Rebellion made daily news. Then the pandemic happened. This week's UN climate report points out the current course we are on. As one big earth family we are all, in our individual nations, meant to be doing our best, to limit global warming to a 1.5C increase to avert the worst of climate disaster - drought, flooding, fires, and famine. There have been the Paris goals, adopted in 2015, at the Paris Climate Accord. There have been the annual Cop meetings, the UN Climate Change Conferences, where more goals were agreed. And yet, this week, seven years on from Paris, the UN report shows the world is on track for a temperature rise of 2.4C-2.6C. We are not just failing. The way we are going, we are actively achieving an astounding climate catastrophe. Many people's children, never mind grandchildren, will be in their late 70s when the reality of this is being lived out. We're no longer borrowing our children's future; we're burying it after cremation. At Cop26 in Glasgow last year, we all pledged to take less than 1% off projected 2030 greenhouse gas emissions. This week's UN report says we need to update that to 45% in order to limit global warming to 1.5C. World leaders, next week, once again meet for another climate conference. Cop27 takes place in Egypt. Guess who's not going? England's newly elected prime minister Rishi Sunak, who last year presented a large green briefcase budget at Cop26. There will be no passing on of the baton, from one presiding country to the next, as Sunak has excused himself due to "domestic commitments". "Fine," you might say, until you find out one of his first moves in power was to remove both his climate minister and his Cop26 minister from attending cabinet, as they had done under his predecessors. And tomorrow, millions of people across Brazil will vote in the final round of their presidential election. They will choose between right-wing incumbent Jair Bolsonaro and former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Scientists say, we, and the Amazon rainforest, cannot afford another term of Bolsonaro. The future of the world's largest rainforest is on the ballot. Under Bolsonaro, and in just four years, deforestation is up 70%. This is a rainforest that dutifully removes more than one billion tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year. At one point, just 20 to 30 years ago, it removed double that. Inger Andersen, executive director of UNEP, said this about the latest UN report: "We had our chance to make incremental changes, but that time is over. Only a root-and-branch transformation of our economies and societies can save us from accelerating climate disaster." The word "economies" is so important. It matters where big money gets invested, as in the case of Shein and funds following our buying habits of ultra-fast fashion. In Texas right now, a law has been passed (Senate Bill13) that prohibits any state retirement or investment funds ($300bn) from doing business with financial firms that consider environmental impact in their investments. The Lone Star state is boycotting green investments. Seven other states are considering following suit. To end on a note of hope, in 2014, there were $52bn divested from fossil fuels, according to the Global Fossil Fuel Divestment Commitment Database. That number, eight years later, now stands at $40.43 trillion divested. Cop27 starting next weekend in Egypt matters more than ever. Let's stub out our cigarette and summon the will to care about the climate again. \</doc>

ON a recent trip to East Africa, I witnessed life on the brink of famine where one person is likely to die of hunger every 36 seconds between now and the end of the year. One reason was clear in a parched landscape dotted with dead livestock. The way we live, particularly in rich, polluting countries, has pumped carbon into our overheated planet. In Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia, this has led to a devastating drought with over 23m people experiencing extreme hunger, and many dying. Imagine our shock as we drove just 60km from the arid, dusty landscape around Isiolo in Northern Kenya into the lush fertility of the Rift Valley. Polytunnels stretched as far as the horizon on huge industrial farms. Casual day labourers are bussed in and green beans, cherry tomatoes, and white and pink roses are bussed out to Nairobi airport and onto a supermarket shelf near you. The land holdings here are based on the colonial past. Some of these have been taken over by new elites and some have the names of famous food brands. This is big business with the sort of cash that can drill deep and keep water flowing. Ahead of the Cop27 Myth 1 : Farmers already produce enough food to feed the whole planet in 2022. Both expected harvests and current stock levels are more than enough to meet global demand. The problem is one of inequality, distribution and lack of access. Despite the UN setting out to eliminate world hunger as Strategic Development Goal 2, world hunger has been on the increase since 2017. Hundreds of millions of people do not have enough to eat. The reasons certainly involve climate change but also growing global inequalities and some old-fashioned profiteering. Let's look at that first. In May, Oxfam published a report, Profiting from Pain , that showed billionaires in the food and energy sectors were increasing their for fortunes by $1bn every two days - 62 new food billionaires were created in the past two-and-a-half years alone. Where there are big winners there are also big losers and we don't have to look past our own weekly grocery basket to feel some of the pain. But in a global context we're the lucky ones. This year, it is expected that 263m more people will fall into extreme poverty worldwide - with less income to spend on food that is getting more and more expensive due to the cost-of-living crisis. This means people are starving in places such as Somalia and Yemen. Nationally, it means the queue lengthens for Cork's Penny Dinners and for the Capuchins' food parcels in Dublin. There is plenty food - it's just that some people can't afford it. Myth 2 : We need to increase food production and turn to hi-tech solutions to feed ourselves into the future. Reality : We don't need to produce more food - we need to fix our broken food system. We can make a comparison with our water supply here in Ireland. We produce plenty of clean, drinkable water but our distribution system is Victorian and leaky. The solution isn't to produce more water. Producing more food using our current methods and distribution systems will only produce more profits for a select few. It won't contribute to less hungry people. The further industrialisation of current models of farming is not sustainable. About 21%-37% of total greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to the food system. This is bad news for all farmers. The solutions lie not so much in a utopian high-tech future but in sustainable approaches that can be implemented now. The experts here are small-scale family farmers. They provide more than 70% of the food supply in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. These farmers are increasingly marginalised by an industrial, globalised agriculture. These farmers, both in Ireland and around the world, need to be supported to make a transition to greater sustainability which will pay climate and food dividends. Myth 3 : The world is facing a new food crisis caused by the war in Ukraine. Reality : Before the war started, there were already an estimated 828m people around the world who suffered from hunger - almost a tenth of the global population. Food prices were rising rapidly for many months before the war, in part due to the disruption caused by Covid-19. For example, between April 2020 and December 2021, global wheat prices increased by 80%. Across the globe, existing vulnerabilities have already resulted in 193 million people facing acute hunger. The effects of the war in Ukraine are expected to push a further 47m people into acute hunger. The war in Ukraine may be fuelling the global food crisis but it is also showing it for what it is - an unequal, broken system. Market concentration is so severe that just 1% of the world's farms control 65% of the agricultural land, and four big traders carry out 70% of global trade in agricultural commodities by value. The rules favour the powerful and wealthy. A country such as Somalia relies on Ukraine and Russia for 90% of its grain. This simply wouldn't be allowed to happen in the EU. Myth 4 : The free market can be relied on to feed everyone. Reality : The war in Ukraine's impact on the global food crisis shows us this isn't true. Supporting local production to be more resilient is the solution. We also need to reign in speculation, break up monopolies and create fairer and more flexible trade rules for low- and middle-income countries. Remember the example of the Kenyan polytunnels? Green beans flown halfway around the world aren't good for anyone in the long run. Numerous studies have shown that shorter food chains are better all-round. : Funds are limited and therefore we need to make tough choices about where to direct support. Reality : There is more than enough money to respond to all crises if billionaires and big business are taxed properly. In the first half of 2022, just six fossil fuel companies made enough to cover the cost of major extreme weather- and climate-related events in developing countries and still have nearly $70bn left over in profit. Billionaires involved in the food and agribusiness sector globally have seen their collective wealth increase by $382bn (45%) over the past two years. At home, the nine Irish companies on the Forbes 2000 list, which include companies from the agri-food industry and tech sectors, record excess profits of 2bn. We are facing extreme weather, but let's not forget about extreme wealth. Taxing it and corporations' excess profits would enable governments worldwide to alleviate poverty and hunger and tackle the impact of the climate crisis. The introduction of an Irish wealth tax as well as a broad-based windfall tax across all industries generating extreme excess profits, not just the energy sector, could generate billions in new revenue. Cop27 begins against a backdrop of climate-fuelled hunger exacerbated by inequality. For the families I met facing famine in East Africa, the stakes have never been higher.

KEVIN O'SULLIVAN Environment and Science Editor Temperatures in Europe have increased at more than twice the global average over the past 30 years, and more than anywhere else in the world, according to a World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) report. Exceptional heat, wildfires, floods and other climate change impacts will affect society, economies and ecosystems across Europe, predicts the State of the Climate in Europe report, produced jointly with the EU Copernicus Climate Change Service (CCCS). The research published yesterday, and focusing on 2021 data, shows that temperatures over Europe have warmed significantly since 1991, up by 1.5 degrees. Alpine glaciers lost 30m in ice thickness from 1997 to 2021. Temperatures in Ireland are following a similar trajectory. The month of October 2022 will be the 17th consecutive month that was warmer than normal, and 1.2 to 2.2 degrees above the monthly mean at 25 of Met \'c9ireann's main weather stations. These temperatures are significantly above what is "usual" for this time of year, according to its head of climate services division Keith Lambkin. Clipping emissions Met \'c9ireann also confirmed it has been much wetter than average in Ireland over the past seven days, with some areas up to 2\'bd times as wet as they normally would be at this time of year. The WMO acknowledges some countries in Europe have reduced greenhouse gas emissions, which if achieved at scale would help reduce temperatures. EU emissions dropped 31 per cent between 1990 and 2020. But the challenges remain formidable, says the WMO. "Europe presents a live picture of a warming world and reminds us that even well-prepared societies are not safe from impacts of extreme weather events." A study earlier this year found atmospheric circulation, specifically the state of "the mid-latitude jet stream", has contributed to the accelerating heatwave trend in western Europe. Many parts of Europe saw temperatures of over 40 degrees this summer, while much of Europe is now seeing an exceptionally warm autumn. WMO secretary general Prof Petteri Taalas said Europe is making good progress on cutting carbon emissions, but more should be done. "Europe can play a key role towards achieving a carbon- neutral society by the middle of the century to meet the Paris Agreement," he said. CCCS director Dr Carlo Buontempo added: "European society is vulnerable to climate variability and change, but Europe is also at the forefront of the international effort to mitigate climate change and to develop innovative solutions to adapt to the new climate Europeans will have to live with." The report issued in advance of UN climate negotiations Cop27 in Sharm-El Sheikh, Egypt, includes information from national meteorological and hydrological services, climate experts, regional bodies and UN partner agencies. \</doc>

COP27 is well under way in Egypt and, as always, the conference has highlighted the need for all industries to play their part in working towards net-zero. Technology is of course no exception, and the climate tech sector has already proven itself more than capable of delivering solutions, boosted by investment which, according to a recent report from Tech Nation, is on course to double in 2022. Investment in UK climate tech start-ups has already reached \£36.54 billion during this year, compared to \£33.48bn in 2021. This rapid growth is not only expected to buck the trend of a wider tech investment downturn, but it is also estimated that climate tech firms will raise around \£317.4bn per year by 2030. It also means that the UK is now second only to the US in terms of the number of technology companies actively addressing the climate crisis. It is obviously encouraging to see the impressive growth of the UK\' s climate tech sector, and it is clear from the Tech Nation report that there is huge potential for the industry to play a major role in tackling the climate crisis, however there is no room for complacency. In the UK, the future growth and expansion of the entire technology sector is largely dependent on government policy and the level of funding directed towards research and development (R&D), something which has been somewhat uncertain in recent times. Statistics published by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) suggest the UK is lagging behind the leading nations in terms of R&D \- to the tune of \£362bn. The UK now places 11th in the OECD in terms of total R&D investment as a percentage of GDP, well behind countries including Austria, Switzerland and the USA. This decline in investment from 4.2 per cent to 3.4 per cent may come as a surprise to some, as science and innovation has formed an integral part of recent UK growth strategies. During his time as prime minister, Boris Johnson claimed that the UK had the potential to become a  science superpower , and if Rishi Sunak wants to fulfil this ambition, continued investment in R&D will be key. Investment in the development of climate tech solutions across energy, farming, food production, the circular economy, manufacturing and greenhouse gas removal will undoubtedly prove invaluable in terms of tackling global climate challenges and paving the way towards net-zero. Local organisations including applied technologies firm Artemis Technologies and emissions data company Catagen have made major steps towards the decarbonisation of the maritime and automotive industries respectively and provide just some examples of how investment in UK climate tech can produce innovative and sustainable solutions. Only last month, the United Nations\' Environment Programme highlighted the significant gaps between the level of action being taken to combat climate change and the level of action required \- with many nations expected to fail to reach their agreed targets. It is only through the combination of coherent and ambitious government policy and strategic investment that real change can be achieved. The UK is well on its way towards developing a truly forward-thinking technology sector, but investment will prove vitally important to maintaining momentum. \</doc>

A FEW notable points about the rise of electric vehicles came to mind this week. Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin emphasised at COP27 how hard Ireland is working towards creating a greener country. There was the official Irish launch of the Volkswagen ID. Buzz which coincided with a survey around EV ownership and public charging points. Mr Martin's positive projection of how we are shaping up was reassuring and open. However, his government can huff and puff all it likes about the "greening" of Ireland in the face of global warming - until they sort one major problem, we will lag behind events. The problem is that there are not enough public charging points to cater for, and encourage use of, EVs. The survey I mentioned found that people in rural areas still have major doubts about being able to fit an EV into their lives, and worry especially about the ease and degree of access to public charging points. And then there was the official launch of the ID. Buzz, the new battery electric vehicle from Volkswagen. This arrives as a people carrier and a commercial cargo "van". It is showing how quickly manufacturers are pushing ahead. The survey, which was carried out by the Northern and Western Regional Assembly (NWRA) and Ireland Thinks, found that publicly available charge points in rural areas are "notably low". It concluded that the Government's target of having nearly one million EVs on the road by 2030 is in serious doubt without a proper charging-point infrastructure, especially in rural Ireland. We need more action, quickly. But while the task is daunting, we shouldn't let it minimise developments such as the arrival of the ID. Buzz. This is tomorrow's world in many ways and it serves to underline how all concerned need to redouble efforts to make sure buyers of BEVs and PHEVs are properly taken care of when it comes to public charging access. The family MPV and Cargo van versions, unveiled here, have a 77kWh lithium-ion battery and 204 PS rearmounted electric motor (310Nm torque). They have a 425km charge. The entry-level ID. Buzz Cargo (no price yet) has cruise control, dual sliding doors and parking sensors as standard. The mid-tier Cargo Executive adds 19in alloys, adaptive cruise control, keyless entry and rear-view camera system. The Cargo Max has 20in alloys, and has Travel and Park assist with Discover Pro Navigation. The entry-level passenger version Life starts at (EURO)66,070. It has LED headlights, heated windscreen, Buzz box removable storage, Discover Pro navigation and 10in colour touchscreen. The Family version, from (EURO)70,640, adds IQ. Light LED matrix headlights, heated driver seat rear-view camera and Park Assist. The Tech version is priced from (EURO)72,235, and has 20in alloys, electric tailgate and 12in touchscreen. The ID. Buzz Max has 21in alloys. There is a 30-colour ambient lighting system and comfort seats in the front. It starts at (EURO)76,115. There are plenty of sustainable components used in the car. Battery housings and wheel rims are made from green aluminium while the tyres are made from lowemission production. \</doc>

M ORE than six months have passed since the UK hosted the international climate conference COP26. As political attentions turn towards COP27 , some questions feel particularly relevant: How can we address the climate crisis amid multiple compounding crises? How can we engage people to take environmental action at a time when they are dealing with unresolved issues, such as the cost of living? We already know that we cannot afford to rest on our laurels when it comes to climate change. Yet, with inflation spiralling and Russia's war against Ukraine threatening global peace, the geopolitical landscape looks dramatically different. It may sound odd, but perhaps the events of this year have revealed that talking about climate change is not always the best way to engage people or frame environmental activities. The environmental sector already has a reputation for being too technical and full of jargon. People feel like they are being lectured. Climate action is also often framed as a series of 'cuts'. We talk about what people must give up, such as cars and red meat, but we do not talk enough about what people have to gain, such as improved health and stronger communities. Thinking about climate change as a multiplier of benefits, rather than an act of sacrifice, would transform public apathy into empathy, moving people further towards taking climate action. However, more importantly, it would allow people to see how different issues interact, and to understand the cascading effects of one issue on another. To ensure our planet remains healthy and resilient, we must think and act in context. To take the context of the war against Ukraine as an example, the crisis has highlighted the clear links between the fossil fuel industry and geopolitical safety. It has demonstrated the importance of creating a world with decentralised supplies of energy and more sustainable, renewable energy. It has exposed the dangers of a dependence on fossil fuel supplies, providing both the security and climate imperative to move away from oil and gas. It has also arguably provided an ethical imperative: many claim that purchasing fossil fuels from Russia directly funds and supports aggression against Ukraine. This is just one example of how projects not explicitly focused on climate change can wield environmental impacts. If we were to apply this example in a local context, developing renewable energy sources in the UK would tackle security, economic and climate goals. An available supply of renewable energy would increase the resilience of communities to global economic shocks, reduce consumption of fossil fuels and push governments to offer more support on energy efficiency and home insulation. Northern Ireland has some of the most poorly insulated homes in western Europe, and insulating homes would reduce energy poverty, providing both a healthier living environment and natural environment. It is not only environmental and financial models that are rooted in interdependence. Climate change action sits within a broader ecosystem of social and economic issues, and a greater recognition of how these issues intertwine is the only way to generate transformational change. For example, more green space increases biodiversity while reducing social isolation and improving mental wellbeing. Promoting active travel, such as walking or cycling, improves physical health at the same time as it reduces carbon emissions and pollution. Creating more green jobs promotes social mobility and boosts the economy. Community gardens create opportunities for local people to build relationships at the same time as they tackle food poverty and insecurity. The list goes on. In my view, placing climate change action within a broader framework of improving community resilience and sustainability, as these examples demonstrate, is a more effective way of engaging people in environmentalism. This is especially true for people living in less affluent and more deprived areas where climate change is not a top concern or priority. If we are to deliver the necessary levels of global action and solidarity ahead of COP27 , we need to grow our capacity to move beyond isolated practices and ways of decision-making. Leaders need to embrace more regenerative and relational ways of problem-solving. There are direct links between climate change and social justice, and these links are not difficult to make. Yet, ironically, one of the greatest benefits of taking climate action is that the environment is not where the impact stops. By taking environmental action, we do much more than simply reduce carbon emissions and increase biodiversity. We improve civic pride, boost social cohesion, enhance health and wellbeing, foster skills development and instil in people a sense of agency and confidence to kick-start climate action projects. Sometimes, seeing things as interconnected feels overwhelming. It can make people feel powerless, like everything needs to be changed all at once. However, unlocking vision and empathy allows us into the gaps at the same time as we reimagine the full picture. Considering climate change in isolation is, therefore, not always the most helpful way of motivating people into action, and environmentalists need to do a better job of relating climate to everyday concerns. This will engage more people. It will show how tackling climate change and tackling inequality are not mutually exclusive. Lastly, it will mean climate action becomes something that not only addresses future concerns but also resonates in the here and now. \</doc>

THE amount of litter left on Northern Ireland's streets has dropped slightly, but discarded drinks packaging continues to be a major problem, a report has said. Rural roads are also disproportionately affected by rubbish, the study by environmental charity Keep Northern Ireland Beautiful found. The charity's 2021/22 Cleaner Neighbourhoods report identified drinks packaging on 90% of rural roads. By comparison, food and drinks packaging was found in 50% of all areas surveyed. However, the overall picture has slightly improved. Only 15% of areas were found to be below standard compared to 18% in the year before. Dog fouling has dropped back to pre-pandemic levels following a dramatic increase in 2020. Cigarette butts remain the most common litter item, having been found in 65% of areas surveyed. COP27 is under way, we are reminded that action is required globally and here in Northern Ireland. "The amount of litter we are now having to deal with is extremely concerning - it's not only unsightly but it has a real impact on council budgets, wasting money that could be spent on other public services and helping deal with the cost-of-living crisis." Keep Northern Ireland Beautiful has estimated that almost \£331.4m could have been spent on street cleaning in 2019/2020, the latest year for which cost estimates are available. "There's no evidence to suggest that human nature has fundamentally changed over the past number of decades, but what has changed is the amount of plastic packaging being produced, which has grown exponentially over the past 15 years, which is why it's misleading to lay the problem entirely at the feet of the public. "We need to have an honest conversation about this issue and that is why manufacturers and retailers need to step up and take their share of the cost of cleaning up the mess on our streets." Although the decrease in littering reflected in the report suggests that improvements are being made, the charity expressed disappointment that litter will not be included in UK-wide Extended Producer Responsibility legislation. "This means the loss of millions of pounds annually which would have funded clean-up operations and alleviated the pressure on ratepayers. We believe this is a missed opportunity to ensure that packaging producers take on their share of the responsibility for this societal problem," said Dr Humphreys. Charmaine Beer from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs said: "Whilst payments for ground litter by producers of packaging are not currently planned for Northern Ireland, they will pay costs for the management of packaging in street bins and will also pay for prevention activity for littered packaging such as communication campaigns targeting litterers. "Under the new Extended Producer Responsibility scheme payments will be made by packaging producers to NI councils for management of household packaging waste from 2024, which will amount to \£335m per year in NI.

Former Irish president Mary Robinson has said she will call out countries that do not stick to their climate objectives, but that ``a positive narrative'' is needed to motivate members of the public. The vocal climate change activist said she believes the world's best times are ahead, but that civilisation is currently on track for its ``worst, worst times''. ``I think very strong language may be necessary for governments, but actually it doesn't help motivate people,'' she said. ``I think what motivates people is thinking about our best times are there if we just move rapidly, and we're heading in the wrong direction but we can change, and we can do it with this moonshot mentality.'' ``I'm working at the moment with a lot of women leaders globally, and something that we learned from an indigenous member of our group... in her tribe in New Mexico, they say 'What if our best times are still ahead of us?', and they are,'' she told RTE Radio's Morning Ireland programme. ``Our best times are still ahead of us, and we're heading for our worst, worst times.'' Mrs Robinson is among those attending the Cop27 climate conference in Egypt, where world leaders are currently meeting to discuss climate change goals. Taoiseach Micheal Martin, who is due to speak about Ireland's climate ambition on Tuesday, said time is running out for governments to act. Mrs Robinson said switching to green energy globally is part of the positive change that is needed. ``That will be incredible in cities that will be full of green and gardens and even farms in cities. ``The 600 million in Africa will get access to green energy, it will be a whole sea change, and we're almost there, but we just don't have the political will.'' Mr Robinson said she and her colleagues in The Elders non-profit group of statesmen and activists will be ``calling out'' governments that do not stick to their climate commitments. ``We call out the United States if necessary, we call out Europe if necessary, but we also call out the ones who are supporting too much the fossil fuel lobby,'' she said. Mrs Robinson said she understands the anger of African countries that are being told not to invest in infrastructure to extract oil and gas. But she added that clean hydrogen has great potential to create jobs in Africa, and it is possible that countries' debts can be forgiven if they invest in adaptation. ``We have to understand the anger of African leaders, but, actually, those of us who have looked into it closely do not see that it makes sense. ``I don't think it is wise for African countries to have whole new infrastructure for oil and gas. It would take too long and they wouldn't be competitive, and probably they would be stranded assets by the time they come on stream.'' She said the goal of dramatically reducing global emissions will now be ``all-absorbing''. ``The truth is that emissions are still going up. And yet we have to cut them - in Ireland we have to cut them by 51% by 2030. In January, that will be seven years' time. This is really really going to be all-absorbing now.'' end \</doc>

For as long as people have been writing songs, music has been used to tackle society's biggest issues. You could put together a playlist of songs spanning centuries which deal with protest and struggle. Today's musicians are increasingly addressing the climate crisis in their lyrics and performances. One of them is the Irish hip-hop artist known as The Accidental Rapper. The Cork native's lyrics pull no punches. "Food shortage, extreme weather and societal tension. If you're not worried about the climate, you're not paying attention," he raps at the start of one track, Echo Chambers. However, as the name suggests, rapping is something that came about "by accident" for the 29-year-old activist. "I never had any intention of becoming a rapper," he explains. "It just kind of happened through my activism. At a particular event a few years ago, we reached out to a number of musicians to perform. But none of them came back to us, so a few of us organisers went off and prepared our own stuff. "I just wrote a rhyme about the topic we were campaigning about at the time, food sovereignty. I got up and did it and people seemed to enjoy it. After that, I was asked to do it at a few more events. "I found out that it was a good way of getting across serious messages to people in a short, digestible, entertaining format." The rapper tackles a number of topics in his music, including housing, mental health and the gambling industry. The climate crisis is one issue he feels very strongly about. "I do campaign on a lot of different issues, but for me and a lot of people, the climate crisis is becoming more and more imminent. It affects everybody and it also exacerbates all the existing resource and income inequalities. "However, a lot of people don't know what to do about it. It can be quite an abstract issue. But I can pick out the key points and give people a connection and understanding. I suppose I try to inform people without boring them to tears. "Most of the stuff I write about comes from frustration. A lot of the topics in modern-day hip-hop can be quite mundane and quite bland. But from its origins, hip-hop has been used as a tool to share knowledge within communities. I feel like some of that has been lost, but the format really does work for engaging people on these topics. " The Accidental Rapper has appeared at several climate action events in recent weeks, including the 'COPON' and 'Earth Rising' festivals in Dublin. Having attended COP26 in Glasgow last year, how does he feel about the UN climate summit currently taking place in Egypt? "In some ways, I think COP27 is about commitments and promises. And we need to push our government to make those promises. But the real action happens the week after COP, or the 365 days after COP, when they come back. That's when we need to hold them to those promises. "The discussions involving world leaders are great for meet and greets and photo opportunities. But the proof is in the execution of their pledges. And that's where people need to be engaged." \</doc>

HAVING read most of the news about the climate change conference in Sharm El Sheikh, I am wondering why all these people, heads of state and ministers, did not decide to do all these talks by Zoom or Skype instead of all of flying to Egypt and then having the audacity to complain about our carbon levels. Surely in this digital age, with so many people working from home, all these talking shops could have been done remotely instead of the participants going on quests that increase carbon emissions to get there in the first place, not to mention their return flights. I say practise what you preach. Colette Collins Friars Hill, Wicklow town \</doc>

ODAY the mid-term elections in the US take place and they will be dominated by someone whose name is not on any ballot. T The super-sized shadow of Donald Trump is everywhere. Even if he is not always visible, he is always present. If, as many are predicting, the political pendulum swings the way of Republicans, both House and Senate could be in their grasp. Such an eventuality would be pounced on by Mr Trump and much of his party as a ringing endorsement for a return to the ring in a no-holdsbarred bout to take the White House in 2024. How such a contest would go in a deeply divided United States is a subject of heated debate. The signs of strain in America's democratic system were signalled last week by Joe Biden who feared candidates who refuse to accept the results could set the nation on a "path to chaos". His remarks were set against a background of a growing number of major Republican candidates saying they may follow in Mr Trump's footsteps and refuse to concede should they lose. "It's unprecedented. It's unlawful. And it is un-American," Mr Biden said. "As I've said before, you can't love your country only when you win," he added. Having been warned off declaring so far, Mr Trump could only tantalise followers saying: "I'll very, very, very probably..." run. But there seems to be no "probably" about it, given his ubiquity flying all over the country to either endorse or trash-talk candidates. Most recognise that he's back and will make official his entrance to the race next Monday. Almost two years have lapsed since the Capitol uprising, and a whole world of legal troubles, but so far as Mr Trump and his entourage are concerned, nothing has changed. They see him as the unblemished saviour of their country. And perhaps that is why there is such trepidation surrounding the vote. For the world has indeed changed, and in many ways for the worst. Addressing COP27 yesterday the UN chief could not have been more graphic. The planet is on "a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator',' said Antonio Guterres. "Co-operate or perish," he warned world leaders. It ought not be forgotten that Mr Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Climate Agreement. The war in Ukraine has also plunged world peace into danger and altered the political climate, equally perilously. As most of the rest of the world gave Vladimir Putin the cold shoulder for his brutal and illegal invasion, Mr Trump was still prepared to offer him praise: "Is Putin smart? Yes, Putin was smart. And I actually thought he was going to be negotiating. I said, 'That's a hell of a way to negotiate, put 200,000 soldiers on the border'." He added that Putin made a "big mistake," but that "it looked like a great negotiation". So should the final polls reveal a very good night for Republicans, those to whom Mr Trump doled out 200-plus endorsements, they may well be justifiably exultant. But it's just as understandable why many others may feel far less than elated. They see him as the unblemished saviour of their country \</doc>

Global temperatures rise is set to hit 2.5 degrees by the end of this century, a level that would condemn the world to catastrophic climate breakdown, according to the United Nations. This level of global heating is a consequence of inadequate pledges by countries, including Ireland, to cut their greenhouse gas emissions, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) warns in its latest "synthesis report" - an assessment of commitments made under national plans known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Only a handful of countries have strengthened their commitments substantially in the past year despite having promised to do so at Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, last November, it confirms. Deeper cuts are needed to limit temperature rises to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, which would avoid the worst ravages of extreme weather, the report adds. Ireland, which has one of the most ambitious decarbonisation targets in the world by committing to a 51 per cent cut in emissions by 2030 based on 2018 levels and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, has not increased its ambition since Cop26. A spokesman for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications said the EU and member states jointly submitted an enhanced NDC in December 2020, which confirmed a commitment to a binding target of a net domestic reduction of at least 55 per cent in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. UNFCCC executive secretary Simon Stiell said: "This does not go far enough, fast enough. This is nowhere near the scale of reductions required to put us on track to 1.5 degrees. National governments must set new goals now and implement them in the next eight years." As plans for emissions cuts that countries submitted in Glasgow were inadequate to meet the 1.5-degree goal - a key Paris Agreement target - they agreed a "ratchet" mechanism to toughen their targets year-on-year. Marginal improvement Plans submitted by governments would lead to a temperature rise of between 2.1 and 2.9 degrees, with the best estimate about 2.5 degrees, the report finds. This represents a "marginal" improvement, Mr Stiell noted, on the 2.7-degree temperature rise that would have followed from the commitments made at Glasgow. Australia made a significant improvement to its national plan, but only 24 countries have submitted new NDCs since Cop26. Many of those countries - including the UK and Egypt, host of the Cop27 summit starting next month - submitted new NDCs that were not substantially stronger than their previous plans. Increase The report shows current NDCs would lead to an increase in emissions of about 10.6 per cent by 2030 compared with 2010 levels. This is an improvement over last year's assessment, which found countries were on a path to increase emissions by 13.7 per cent by 2030 compared with 2010 levels. But leading climate scientists under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have estimated emissions need to fall by about 45 per cent by 2030 compared with 2010 levels to give the world a chance of staying within 1.5 degrees. "What this shows is that some progress has been made [since Cop26] but that progress is highly insufficient. We are moving forward but every year is a critical year," Mr Stiell said. \</doc>

The countries of the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East (EMME) have become global hot spots and major sources of greenhouse gases. Cyprus-based climate experts have warned that the region is warming nearly twice as fast as the world average and that temperatures could rise 5 degrees by the end of the century. This rate is far above the maximum of 1.5 degrees set by the Paris climate change accords adopted by 195 parties in 2016. A study published in the US journal Reviews of Geophysics revealed that gas emissions in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East have increased six-fold since the 1950s and 1960s while the global rate was 2.5-fold. Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Iraq account for 73 per cent of the increase in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East. Scientists from the Cyprus Institute and the German Max Planck Institute said if the 17 countries in this region continue operating on "a business-as-usual pathway" there would be "unprecedented heatwaves" and "rainfall shortages that compromise water and food security." The result will be severe droughts, dust storms, advancing seas, torrential rains and flooding, fires, diminished snow on mountains, salination of coastal aquifers, and atmospheric pollution. The report said: "Virtually all socio-economic sectors are expected to be critically affected, with potentially devastating impacts on the health and livelihoods of the 400 million people of the EMME, with worldwide implications." Unless Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East climate change is addressed there could be "northward expansion of arid climate zones at the expense of the more temperate regions," said Dr George Zittis, overall co-ordinator of the project. Director of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry Jos Lilieveld said those most at risk would be "underprivileged communities, the elderly, children and pregnant women." An archaeologist in charge of dealing with the effects of climate change on cultural heritage, Dr Nikolas Bakirtzis, told The Irish Times that global warming affects historical sites and tourism. Deteriorating socio-economic conditions have already increased destruction and looting of antiquities from vulnerable ancient civilisations in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East. He said the project involved 13 task forces comprised of experts from the entire region and covering all aspects of global warming. He said "the region faces too many challenges - wars and socio-economic crises," and does not give climate change priority. The scientists argued "immediate and effective climate change action is urgent" and said meeting Paris climate change targets could stabilise the temperature rise to about 2 degrees, avoiding the worst-case scenario.

KEVIN O'SULLIVAN Companies "must stop funding coal, oil and gas if their claims to be aligned to net-zero emissions are anything more than greenwash", according to a UN report released at Cop27 . Thousands of big businesses and cities have declared commitments to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement climate targets, but the report finds claims often do not stand up to scrutiny, and there is a lack of transparency. Speaking at a launch event, UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres singled out "fossil fuel companies and their financial enablers". "So-called 'net-zero pledges' that exclude core products and activities are poisoning our planet. They must thoroughly review their pledges and align them with this new guidance," he said. Ms McKenna said: "Our roadmap provides clear standards and criteria that must be followed when developing net-zero commitments. Right now, the planet cannot afford delays, excuses, or more greenwashing." The report sets "new red lines intended to prevent greenwashing". It recommends non-state actors can no longer: Claim to be net zero while continuing to build or invest in new fossil fuel supply. Similarly, deforestation and other environmentally destructive activities are disqualifying; Buy cheap credits that often lack integrity instead of immediately cutting their own emissions across their value chain. High-quality credits should only be used to balance out all remaining emissions once a non-state actor is meeting its short and medium-term targets; Focus on reducing the intensity of their emissions rather than their absolute emissions or tackling only a part of their emissions rather than full emissions extending throughout their supply chains; Lobby to undermine ambitious government climate policies either directly or through trade associations or other bodies. "A growing number of governments and non-state actors are pledging to be carbon-free - and that's good news. The problem is that the criteria and benchmarks for these net-zero commitments have varying levels of rigour and loopholes wide enough to drive a diesel truck through," Mr Guterres said. On environmental integrity, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) "is our scientific north star", he said. "Net-zero pledges must be in line with IPCC scenarios limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. That means global emissions must decline by at least 45 per cent by 2030 - and reach net zero by 2050 . . . and these targets must cover all greenhouse gas emissions and all scopes of emissions. "For financial institutions, this means all financed activities. For businesses, it means all emissions - direct, indirect and those originating from supply chains. And for cities and regions, it means all territorial emissions," he said. "Using bogus 'net-zero' pledges to cover up massive fossil fuel expansion is reprehensible. It is rank deception. This toxic cover-up could push our world over the climate cliff. The sham must end." \</doc>

Who would have thought a veteran Portuguese politician would get more headlines than Greta Thunberg at this year's Cop27 ? Ant\'f3nio Guterres, the 73-year-old UN secretary general has set the tone of the climate conference in Sharm El-Sheikh with increasingly forthright language. Warning that "we are on a highway to climate hell" and at risk of "collective suicide", he said the scientific evidence was clear: "We are in the fight of our lives and we are losing." Guterres's foreboding is well justified but there are concerns that, despite his pleas for a redoubling of efforts, the world is tipping towards defeatism. Progress may have been made in some areas but Cop27 has largely showcased the failures of developed countries to meet previously agreed targets. All the while the clock is ticking on irreversible climate breakdown. Recent surveys have shown an alarming degree of fatalism about climate change. An international study last June from Peritia, a UCD-based project on trust in science, showed 30 per cent of people in Germany agreed that climate change is beyond control and "it's too late to do anything about it". In Ireland 18 per cent of people agreed with this. An Ipsos/Futerra poll last year found defeatism was highest among younger cohorts. Of the 20,000 people from 27 countries surveyed, a fifth of under 35s said they believed it was "too late to fix climate change". McKinnon, who is professor of political theory at University of Exeter, examines the case against fatalism in her book, arguing that even if we can't agree on the best outcome we can identify what is worse in any particular situation. If humanity was to dwindle to a small population on a ravaged island, perhaps the leaders would "make the biggest bonfire in human history, and dance around it naked". She asks: "Is this outcome worse than one in which the resources are shared in some way that enables at least some of the remaining thousands to survive?" In short, no matter how bad things get, there are always options. She explains further as this week's Unthinkable guest. If we take the climate science to be accurate - the consensus is some climate changes are inevitable and irreversible - then is the natural response to give up? By staying hopeful one seems to be betting against the science Catriona McKinnon: "The UN Environment Programme has said recently that there is now 'no credible pathway to 1.5 degrees'. It's awful . . . but let's be clear: we are in this position now because of a lack of political will to make and keep to aggressive emissions reduction targets. "This has been worsened by the machinations of the fossil fuel industry, and the continued willingness of banks to finance planet-killing extractive industries. None of this was written in the stars. It could have been otherwise. "While 1.5 degrees is beyond us now, we could still achieve the Paris target of staying below 2 degrees. And even if we fail on that, keeping temperature rise as low as we can still matters. Giving up because, say, we are on track for 2.7 degrees by 2100 rather than 2 degrees could mean that we end up with warming of closer to 4 degrees by 2100. This would not only make climate failure an even worse self-fulfilling prophecy, it would also be a moral disgrace in the face of what we owe to people in the future." Our existing model of democracy seems to be ill-equipped to deal with the climate emergency. Do we need to ditch democracy for effective action? "This model is ill equipped because of the short-termism baked into it. Democracy doesn't have to be that way. And the political and economic institutions of democratic societies don't have to treat the non-human natural world as nothing but material to fuel our addiction to consumption. "For example, democratic institutions could include spaces in which the interests of future people are represented. Or: democratic leaders could take seriously proposals for 'degrowth' to protect the planet, and so protect people - especially the most vulnerable. "The solution is not to throw away our democratic institutions but to strengthen them and prevent them from being abused and manipulated - for example, by climate denial think tanks channelling fossil fuel money into US politics under the guise of free speech. "All of this said, we are kidding ourselves if we think that political and economic elites with their hands on political power will voluntarily make these changes. We have to force them to do this. This starts with using your vote. It can also mean organising locally to challenge the status quo, protesting, or talking to your neighbours and friends about the changes that are needed." To return to a question you ask in the book "If we are already doomed, why bother?", what gives you hope? "Notice the 'if' at the start of that sentence! I don't think we are doomed. I think we are at an unprecedented moment in history but that the future remains unwritten. What gives me hope - hope in the sense of the courage to go on, rather than some dewy-eyed wishful thinking - is that I think the majority of people really don't want a future of climate catastrophe. "We don't want our descendants to be ashamed of our failure to rise to the moment in the climate crisis. What is blocking effective action on climate change are the special interests of a very few people who will benefit from the continued extraction of fossil fuels and who are not willing to give up their power and advantages. Our political and economic institutions serve to protect these interests. "The climate crisis is a product of the global capitalist economy and will - if we fail - ultimately cut away the ground from under it. I'm hopeful because I think it is impossible to deny this dirty connection between the way we have done politics since the industrial revolution and the accelerating climate crisis. Something has to give. I don't think most people want that to be the planet, our home." Does geoengineering offer the best grounds for being optimistic? "On geoengineering, I certainly don't see solar geoengineering as a cause for optimism. This is the proposition that we can artificially cool the planet by spraying reflective particles (eg sulphur) into the stratosphere. One proposal is that drones could continuously circle the planet releasing these materials into the atmosphere. Thus, we would have our hands on the global thermostat. "What a dire future that would be: what a disgusting spectacle humanity would be if we created such a world. We have to put emissions reductions first as the path to tackling climate change. And this means massive reform - if not revolution - of our political and economic systems, and the expectations they generate. That's a huge task - but why think that solar geoengineering presents less of a task, given that the technology is still imaginary? "We already know what we have to do to get ahead of the climate crisis. Solar geoengineering gives me no cause for hope at all." \</doc>

IT'S a bold claim, but one we've been hearing more and more - Ireland has the potential to be the green hydrogen capital of Europe. What's more, Cork can be the capital of Ireland when it comes to green hydrogen, according to industry leaders. Cork's geographical and marine advantages puts it squarely at the heart of the burgeoning offshore wind and green hydrogen revolution, but only if challenges such as planning red tape are overcome. That was one of the central themes from an event in September this year that saw the signing of a co-operation deal between Ireland and the Netherlands on offshore wind, with ministers from the respective governments promoting the potential for the region in the renewable field. Environment Minister Eamon Ryan is a convert. Representative body Hydrogen Mobility Ireland claimed it "has the capacity to fully eliminate CO2 emissions from heavy goods vehicles", and would provide energy security for the country. The body claimed it could provide "thousands of secure, clean energy jobs" through producing hydrogen at scale, while reducing Ireland's carbon emissions by 2.6% by 2030. A national strategy has long been implored by industry figures. However, its expected publication before July did not happen, with Mr Ryan saying he "hoped" it would now be published by the end of this year. Paul McCormack, board member at Hydrogen Ireland, told the Irish Examiner that the need to access alternative forms of energy which are secure, sustainable and affordable has sunk in with more of the population than ever before in 2022. "At Hydrogen Ireland, we raise awareness of green hydrogen's role in that equation. It is the most efficient and one of the cleanest fuels possible while also being potentially carbon neutral - a vital factor as Ireland works to reduce its emissions. "Hydrogen can be produced in a number of ways. Currently the most common is through the reforming of natural gas by applying heat. Green or clean hydrogen is produced using renewable energy via electrolysis, which produces hydrogen by passing an electrical current through water and separating it into its constituent elements." Development of the associated technology is accelerating and a wide range of parties are currently preparing sites which will facilitate the use of green hydrogen in energy production, he said. "The Government is preparing a new national strategy which will guide the process of weaving hydrogen-generated power into many aspects of our energy future. "At Hydrogen Ireland we don't just advocate for the use of hydrogen, we strongly believe this country can be the Green Hydrogen Capital of Europe. International leaders are discussing hydrogen's potential at Cop27 this month, but on the ground, the race towards clean energy is already well underway. "Considering our educated workforce, geographical location and natural resources, we know Ireland has the talent, capacity and opportunity to take pole position in that contest. Given the right policies and support, green hydrogen will deliver the solutions required to tackle the climate and energy crisis and provide a green economic boost for the country providing quality jobs and resilience." Hydrogen Ireland's annual conference in Dublin on November 22 and 23 will discuss this very potential, Mr McCormack said. "The transition to green energy will require us all to be open-minded. We're not going to be transforming the existing energy market. We will be changing the market altogether. As current events keep showing us, we must change the way we do things and hydrogen brings the necessary disruption," he added. Previous doubts about green hydrogen's viability are clearly dissipating at continent-level. Detractors say it is too cumbersome and costly to achieve on a mass scale, but even those skeptical voices are now getting onboard as the technology and costs become more viable. At Cop27 President von der Leyen said: "I am so glad to sign this agreement between the EU and Namibia for the development of raw materials value chains and renewable hydrogen. This is not only a huge step forward for the EU's climate ambitions but also an agreement beneficial to Namibia, a front-runner in the development of renewable hydrogen in Africa." It was the second such negotiation surrounding hydrogen agreed in two days. President von der Leyen and Alikhan Smailov, Prime Minister of Kazakhstan, signed a Memorandum of Understanding establishing a partnership between the EU and Kazakhstan. President von der Leyen said: "A secure and sustainable supply of raw materials, refined materials and renewable hydrogen is a key layer to help build a new, cleaner foundation for our economies, especially as we move away from our dependency on fossil fuels. This partnership with Kazakhstan shows Europe's commitment to work with partner countries on our shared commitments to a greener and more resilient future in line with the Global Gateway Strategy and the objectives of the REPowerEU Plan." According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), recent technology developments and policy actions suggest momentum is accelerating in the likes of hydrogen infrastructure. The pipelines for both hydrogen projects continue to expand, while a pilot project last year used hydrogen to produce fully fossil-free steel, it said. In its Global Hydrogen Review for 2022, the IEA said the energy crisis has further strengthened interest in hydrogen, but greater policy support is needed to drive new and cleaner uses of it in heavy industry and long-distance transport. "Momentum continues to build behind low-emissions hydrogen amid the global energy crisis, with electrolyser manufacturing expected to grow strongly and pilot projects proliferating in new applications such as steel and transport, a new IEA report says today. But these areas remain a small part of the overall hydrogen landscape, highlighting the need for greater policy support. "The encouraging developments in hydrogen technologies that can support the clean energy transition include an expected sixfold increase by 2025 in global manufacturing capacity of electrolysers, which are needed to produce low-emissions hydrogen from renewable electricity. Low-emissions hydrogen production worldwide in 2021 was less than 1 million tonnes - with practically all of it coming from plants using fossil fuels with carbon capture, utilisation and storage," the IEA said. IEA executive director Fatih Birol said there are growing signs that hydrogen will be an important element of the transition to an affordable, secure and clean energy system, but there are still major advances in technology, regulation and demand needed for it to fulfil its potential. "The strong flow of announcements we now see for low-emissions hydrogen projects are yet another indicator that a new energy economy is emerging. Governments now need to implement concrete policies to remove regulatory barriers and support shovel-ready projects." \</doc>

HARK back to your childhood for a moment - remember being brought to the playground or the beach or the zoo, the excitement palpable - but the agonising frustration of having to listen to groundrules and warnings, when you were just longing to get in amongst the fun? It turns out that it's not just a childhood frustration. Being involved in renewable energy, specifically wind, must be a bit like those days. There is a wind energy sector in Ireland that just wants to show what it can do, knowing the benefits are tantalisingly close, but being made to wait and wait and wait before it can act. Wind is the biggest potential show in town, with the burgeoning potential getting stronger with every month. Wind energy provided 47% of Ireland's electricity in October 2022, making it the country's chief source of electricity last month, according to Wind Energy Ireland's monthly report. The latest figures mean that wind energy has supplied 33% of Ireland's electricity demand this year to the end of October - the best October on record for the volume of electricity produced by Irish wind farms and the share of demand met by the country's main source of renewable energy, the body said. "As the average wholesale electricity price fell to its lowest level since August 2021, the report emphasised again the contribution wind energy is making to insulating Irish families and businesses from the worst effects of the fossil-fuel energy crisis," it added. Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin has extolled the virtues and potential for offshore wind from the UN Cop27 "We need to focus more on delivery measures...We all have work to do. Ireland has work to do. We achieved a lot with onshore wind. We need to ensure we can accelerate offshore," he said. Yet the levels of frustration are evident when talking to industry figures. TJ Hunter, a senior director with Onshore Ireland and UK, with global renewable energy company \'d8rsted, the Danish company which has offices in Cork, captured the current feelings around the pace of the transition. He told the Irish Examiner last month that greater urgency and state supports for offshore wind energy will be needed for the sector to deliver on its potential to help Ireland move towards renewables. "There are three primary roadblocks to growing the renewable energy sector in Ireland and meeting the 2030 targets for onshore wind, offshore wind, solar energy and storage as set out by Government. "First is the inefficiency of the current planning system. A recent analysis by Wind Energy Ireland found that An Bord Plean\'e1la has not been able to meet the 18-week statutory objective for processing strategic infrastructure development planning applications. The average decision-making time for this has in reality been 69 weeks. For planning appeals, the time is 60 weeks. In Ireland, the planning and permitting phase of an onshore wind farm and grid connection typically takes four years or more, not including appeal or judicial review. "The second roadblock is the speed of connection. Using a soccer analogy, renewables only have one 'transfer window' per year - one opportunity to connect to the national grid through an EirGrid connection. The annual nature of the 'connection window' means that unless you have planning received in advance, you have to wait a full year to apply again, which in turn leads to delays. "The third roadblock is the capacity of the electricity grid itself. For additional renewables to come on-stream, the electricity grid in Ireland needs further investment and innovation to substantially upgrade, enhancing capacity and project viability. Without additional grid capacity, renewables cannot grow," he said. The Taoiseach revealed at Cop27 that the EU is close to agreeing a clause that would allow governments to expedite major infrastructure projects in the name of the greater national interest, such as major offshore wind. At the same time, attorney general Paul Gallagher is currently reviewing planning legislation that would look to expedite the planning process for major projects of national importance such as offshore wind farms. The Taoiseach said he understood the "impatience", but said he wanted offshore wind to be a major part of this Government's legacy. It cannot come fast enough. Managing director of green energy supplier Statkraft Ireland, Kevin O'Donovan, said that since the early 1990s, when the first wind farm was built in Co Mayo, there has been tremendous strides in ambition and delivery. "Today, there are over 300 wind farms in the country - a reflection of the skills and expertise we've developed over the past three decades... Two decades ago, we doubted that we could reach our 2020 targets. But we persevered - and successfully met the challenge of reaching the target to provide 40% of Ireland's electricity from renewables. "Reaching these goals has only further driven our self-belief in meeting the 2030 deadline - to increase the share of electricity generated from renewable sources to up to 80 per cent. To achieve that, we will need to generate 1.5-2.5 GW from solar, 8 GW from onshore wind and 7 GW from offshore - up from the Government's original offshore target of 5 GW. Ireland's Atlantic-facing position, coupled with a maritime area seven times the size of its landmass, makes it ideal for large-scale, offshore wind energy production," he said. Despite this huge potential, there is just one offshore wind farm - Arklow Bank - currently operating in Irish waters, Mr O'Donovan said. "Statkraft itself is investing in offshore through its North Irish Sea Array, or NISA, project. NISA, which will be built off the coast of Dublin, Louth, and Meath, was one of seven offshore projects selected by the Government to be advanced through planning in order to hit the State's then 2030 target of 3.5 GW target for the sector. So far, however, this notion of 'fast-tracking' has failed to live up to its name, and we are still waiting to be able to submit an actual planning application for the proposal." Despite such delays, achieving the 2030 targets is doable, he said. "Still, the amount of work required between now and the end of the decade is substantial. Yet, such an important topic - the level of work needed for implementation, that is - is rarely communicated by politicians. For people who talk for a living, they tend to remain uncharacteristically quiet about the reality of what needs to happen and indeed what has been done so far. As a result, the public is left in the dark about the amount of effort these projects require." There is also a question around Irish ports and their capability to handle the workload for offshore infrastructure. A Europe-wide study is under way on how to bolster Irish ports that are currently woefully underequipped for the impending renewable energy revolution. Research this year has shown only Belfast is currently able to support the construction of an offshore wind farm, despite ambitious plans by the Government to ramp up renewable energy by 2030. Specialist geotechnical engineering consultancy Gavin & Doherty Geosolutions (GDG) is now tasked with identifying potential funding streams for Irish ports and will focus on several case studies across Europe where similar projects have been backed by EU states. GDG's recent National Ports Study, which was commissioned by renewable industry lobby group Wind Energy Ireland, found only one out of 13 major ports in the Republic and the North is ready to be used for constructing offshore wind farms. If 2030 is realistic, the next six months to a year are going to be crucial as to whether we make the remaining years of the decade count. \</doc>

The unseasonably warm weather has left Eamon Ryan with all sorts of mixed emotions. Sitting in his office in the Department of Transport last Thursday evening, it was 15C outside. "That's climate change, and it's scary," he said, while noting that over the last 60 days temperatures have been two degrees above average. Conversely, this has been good news for households staring into energy price increases this winter. "It's not good for Putin," Ryan said. He was speaking before his trip to the Cop27 summit in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, where representatives from more than 190 countries are discussing further measures to cut global greenhouse emissions. Scientists say the rise in global temperatures must be limited to 1.5C by the end of the century to avoid the worst effects, whereas current projections are for an increase of 2.7C. It is for this reason that the Environment and Transport Minister insists that, notwithstanding the benefits of warmer weather for household energy bills, climate change "is nothing but a bad thing". Ryan and all other Green ministers, including the juniors, will stay in their posts after next month's reshuffle, he confirmed. And he spoke not of short or medium-term political ambitions, but of a much bigger project. Ruling out any future election transfer pacts with Fine Gael - as floated by Leo Varadkar last week - he argued instead for working with any party that commits to drastic cuts in emissions. He was struck by the words of the US climate envoy John Kerry at Cop27 last week, which he paraphrased: "This is a wartime situation for the next 25 years - to stop our planet burning. This is not small. Therefore, it can't be stopstart. It has to be consistent. It's this change of scale that people don't realise yet, I think." It's not just the current weather that brings home the effects of climate change. Last week, Ryan was in Tipperary, where the first item on the council's agenda was roads washed away outside Cahir and sewage coming up through manholes in Thurles because of storm surges. How close are we to having climate migrants in Ireland, moving from their uninhabitable homes? "We're starting to see it already in some locations, like along the Shannon, areas that have been subject to flooding in recent years. There are areas that can't take another flood." By the end of the century, Ryan suggested, the country's five cities - Galway, Cork, Limerick, Dublin and Waterford - could become uninhabitable. "It creates an insecurity for our children and their future, that if you go beyond a certain tipping point it's irreversible and then it becomes really damaging and really catastrophic," he said. "Maybe people my age will be able to manage this. But their world and their future won't be manageable - and it's not fair for us to leave them that, and they want to play their part." For all his good intentions, Ryan is viewed by the public as the worst-performing cabinet minister, according to last weekend's Ireland Thinks/Sunday Independent poll. He said he does not know why this is the case. To the annoyance of some in the Green Party who believe their leader should be radical and perhaps militant when it comes to pursuing their agenda, Ryan prefers a more consultative approach to persuade people of the benefits. "If we just try to do this guilt-tripping, making people feel guilty, pointing the finger, it won't work," he said. "The changes we need to make in energy, in transport, in agriculture, in industry are going to be good for us." He believes it would be "insane" not to move away from reliance on imported fossil fuels to a cleaner, more sustainable energy supply. But he does not see congestion charges as a solution to the gridlock in cities. Next month, he will publish a revised Climate Action Plan (Cap) for 2023 that will effectively drop the previous headline-grabbing target of having one million electric vehicles on Irish roads by 2030. "I think one of the biggest changes is probably going to be in transport, recognising that it isn't just about switching to electric vehicles. It is also about reducing the amount of transport we do. One million EVs is not the key metric. "There are three key metrics - reducing the amount of transport we do; switching to active travel and public transport; and switching technology [to EVs]. All three together are needed." A spokesperson later said the Department of Transport is no longer focused on delivering one million EVs, but instead wants to create the infrastructure to encourage people to use public transport or cycle and walk instead. Consequently, this is likely to reduce the number of internal combustion engine vehicles on Irish roads. Cap 2023 will have an ambition that just over 30pc of the national fleet will be EVs by 2030. There will, however, be (EURO)100m allocated over three years for more EV charging infrastructure, including, (EURO)15m for charging points in sports clubs. "At the moment, everything is designed around the presumption that people are going to use a car - we're not providing the alternative infrastructure to allow people not to use it," Ryan said. "People want to use public transport, they don't want to be stuck in traffic." In this vein, he is anxious to roll out as many rural bus services as possible over the next two years. He complained that the rollout of BusConnects in Dublin and other cities is taking too long, and has told the National Transport Authority to speed up the overhaul of the real-time information system. "We've said there is no shortage of funding and we'll provide whatever support we can," he said. Cap 2023, Ryan said, will also be the first government climate plan that will be "presented with the strength of the law behind it, in the sense that you have to deliver - and if you're not delivering, as minister you have to adjust". Any citizen or any interested party will be able to take ministers to court if they fail to meet legally binding targets. "We would see citizens taking action," he said. So is he actually telling the public to take ministers to court if they are breaching their targets? "The law says that already - we've a very strong law," he said.

Earlier this week, the International Sustainable Finance Centre of Excellence was launched, tasked with delivering the skills for the financial services community to finance a net-zero future. The centre will be an international hub from which the Irish finance community will develop its response to sustainability demands. Launched on the opening day of Climate Finance Week Ireland, the centre is a key part of the sustainable finance roadmap, which has been developed by Sustainable Finance Ireland in partnership with Skillnet Ireland, and in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Department of Finance, and international partners. The centre will lead on research, talent development, and leadership activities to design innovative financial mechanisms that facilitate the transition to a net-zero economy in Ireland and internationally. Marcos Netto, director, UNDP sustainable finance hub, said: "The world now desperately needs an economic governance architecture, which is deliberately designed to support governments, development agencies, civil society, and the private sector to make decisions that prioritise investment in the sustainable development goals. The International Sustainable Finance Centre of Excellence will help in addressing the challenge of the current finance model not working for both the people and the planet. In advance of the upcoming climate talks, COP27 , its establishment is to be welcomed." The centre will play a critical role in delivering the sustainable finance roadmap and 'Ireland for Finance Strategy 2025', which aims to position Ireland as a global centre of sustainable finance by 2025. "The establishment of the International Sustainable Finance Centre of Excellence will help position Ireland as a world leader in sustainable finance by developing the talent, knowledge and expertise needed by businesses," said Paul Healy, CEO of Skillnet Ireland. "Skillnet Ireland is committed to delivering initiatives that support industries to adopt sustainable practices and this launch is also a key step in achieving Ireland's climate goals. We look forward to further research and international collaboration in the future to build on this vital step." Alongside Skillnet Ireland, some of the firms that are supporting the work of the centre include AIB, Bank of Ireland, Deloitte, Eirgrid, FD, Goodbody, IDA Ireland, Irish Life Investment Managers, KPMG, Maples Group, Mazars, PTSB, PwC and TD Securities. The centre will be fully operational by mid-January 2023 and is among several activities being delivered throughout Ireland's fifth Climate Finance Week - including the launch of Ireland's first sustainable finance fintech strategy. In addition, it is going live with the world's first postgraduate diploma in sustainable finance for compliance professionals, in partnership with Sustainable Finance Skillnet; and IFS Skillnet, supporting the development of Ireland's Sustainable Finance Roadmap Action Plan 2023. "Sustainable finance is critical for Ireland's future growth in financial services, ensuring the industry has the skills needed to meet our climate objectives," said Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science Simon Harris. "This centre of excellence will help the planet, but it is essential to the future-proofing of the economy. This centre will work with customers, colleagues, and communities to support their transition to a resilient, net-zero economy by 2050. The collaboration that has developed the centre is key. Those partnerships will support the sector's future talent development needs and inspire new people to enter this relatively new area of work." \</doc>

CIARA O'BRIEN and KEVIN O'SULLIVAN Twitter is set to enter consultation with Irish employees who are being affected by layoffs announced on Friday, it has emerged, days after locking staff out of systems amid "random and indiscriminate" job culls. In an email seen by The Irish Times, the social media network said it would enter into a 30-day consultation period with affected employees. Twitter said it would continue to pay staff for the duration of the consultation period, but staff would have to stay out of the office. The company employs about 500 people at its European headquarters in Dublin, with about 50 per cent of staff at risk. Twitter began large-scale job cuts last week following billionaire Elon Musk's acquisition of the social media platform, with about 50 per cent of its global workforce said to be affected. Twitter's Irish staff woke on Friday morning to find their offices had been closed and access to its IT systems had been shut off in "order to protect the security of our confidential information and user data". Personal emails Twitter employees here took to the platform throughout Friday saying that they were no longer working for the company. Sources described the process of selecting those jobs to be culled as "indiscriminate and random", calling it "carnage". The company sent communications to the personal emails of staff under threat of being made redundant. The notice stated that "does not mean that we have made any final decisions in relation to this process or your role", adding that workers would have the opportunity to "express their views" via "employee representatives" who would be elected by staff shortly. But questions have been raised about the legality of the process after it emerged the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Leo Varadkar had not been told of any decision to begin laying off Irish staff, which is a legal requirement for collective redundancies in Ireland. In its latest email sent to staff, Twitter said it would comply with the law and notify the Minister of its plans, along with the identity of the employee representatives, once elected. The Twitter lay-offs and fears over jobs at Meta in Ireland have sparked wider concern about the tech industry here. Facebook's parent company is expected to announce cutbacks tomorrow amid a slowdown in the global economy. Potential job losses Speaking at Cop27 in Egypt yesterday, Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin said the Government would consult with all Irish-based tech companies about potential job losses in the sector. "I have been concerned for some time in terms of the global economic situation because of the war in Ukraine and the implications for Europe and the world," he said. Ireland, he underlined, had always bounced back very strongly when similar difficulties arose in the past, as had happened post-Covid, Mr Martin added. "We will engage with the IDA and the companies. We faced this situation before, where we consolidated and we picked up again," he said. Mr Martin accepted there were issues in the digital area. Ireland, he said, had always looked at "how we deal with this domestically, how do we regroup, and what opportunities are out there in these sectors". \</doc>

Time is running out to act on the devastating consequences of climate change, Taoiseach Micheal Martin has warned. Mr Martin, who arrived at the Cop27 climate conference in Egypt on Monday, said that measures previously committed to need to be accelerated. He said that this includes Ireland's delivery of off-shore wind targets. Targets set by the Government under its Climate Action Plan 2021 seek to increase the proportion of renewable electricity by up to 80% by 2030, and for 5GW of offshore wind generation also by 2030. Mr Martin said that events like the climate summit in Sharm El-Sheikh ``concentrate the mind'' and create greater global awareness about the dangers, particularly for future generations, posed by climate change. He said that the country needs to move on its target for 2030. The Fianna Fail leader said that other measures Ireland has committed to include biodiversity, retrofitting of housing, environmentally friendly farming and public transport. ``The retrofitting and environmentally friendly farming is underpinned by the carbon tax funds and that's why the carbon tax is important because it allows us to deliver and it gives us the resources to make a difference,'' Mr Martin added. ``My focus at this conference is, let's look at the tangibles that we can do and get them done.'' The Taoiseach said that Ireland will commit to its pledged 225 million euro to help vulnerable countries to fight climate change and to help with the losses of climate change. He added that other countries needed to step up and deliver on their promises. He also said that Ireland is prepared to go further. ``I think what they are really looking for is delivery of the existing pledges that have been made by countries across the world,'' Mr Martin added. ``Ireland will deliver on what we have committed to and we are prepared to go further but we want to deliver on what we have promised. ``If developing countries saw that commitment from everybody, it would make a huge difference. ``Funding is to be announced on Tuesday as part of the loss and damage package.'' Mr Martin is attending the event with Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications Eamon Ryan, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Minister of State for Overseas Development Aid and Diaspora Colm Brophy. At the summit, the Taoiseach will take part in a number of high-level events and roundtables, including on food security and on the sustainability of vulnerable communities. Mr Martin said there needs to be a better focus on delivery of the measures that countries have committed to. ``We have real work to do, we have achieved a lot in terms of onshore wind and we need to make sure we can accelerate offshore wind, putting together all the various inputs that are required of different departments and agencies,'' he added. ``We are looking at a fundamental review of our planning code, which is about the whole renewable infrastructure as well as housing and other things. ``Those proposals will come forward in the next number of weeks. ``There is an urgency attached to it, it can't be business as usual.'' He added: ``There is a body of science that is now saying that people are making a difference and every step makes a difference. ``We don't want people becoming totally overwhelmed by the negativity and doomsday scenarios that get articulated, understandably, but can also depress people from taking action. ``We need to tell people you are making a difference, but we need to move faster.'' end \</doc>

CORMAC McQUINN Political Correspondent There could be "catastrophic" interruptions to Ireland's power supply unless natural gas - including liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructure - is used as the country transitions to renewable energy, a Minister has warned. Fine Gael Minister of State Patrick O'Donovan made the case for gas storage facilities to be developed in a submission to the Government's ongoing review of energy security. In contrast, environmental campaigners Friends of the Earth Ireland said the Government must "clearly reject" the gas supply mitigation options in the review "in particular LNG" given the "negative effect" they would have on carbon emissions. The review is taking place against a backdrop of pressure on Ireland's power system, the energy crisis sparked by Russia's war on Ukraine and this month's Cop27 climate summit in Egypt. A report compiled by consultants as part of the review shortlisted a series of mitigation options as responses to potential shocks to Irish energy supply. Among the options are non-commercial onshore gas storage facilities and floating LNG terminals. Commercial gas options were dismissed - the increased likelihood of the importation of fracked gas and the possibility that use of LNG could have an adverse impact on decarbonisation targets were given as the reasons. In his submission Mr O'Donovan says the expansion of renewable power deserved continued support from Government. However, he argues that a "lack of reliability" in the level of energy being produced by renewables "could lead to interruptions of supply unless the transitional element of natural gas is accepted, and the necessary investment is put in place to support the roll out of modern infrastructure like LNG terminals". He adds that this is happening in other EU countries like Germany. Concerns The use of LNG has been a contentious issue within Government. The Green Party has been resisting it amid concerns over the environmentally damaging fracking process used to extract gas by some LNG producers. In contrast, some TDs in Fine Gael and Fianna F\'e1il have been supportive of a proposed permanent commercial LNG facility for the Shannon Estuary. Mr O'Donovan, a Limerick County TD, told The Irish Times that the project was "going through an active planning process so I wouldn't like to comment on it." He said he was not "hung up" on locations for gas storage, and he said Ireland probably needed more than one facility. Mr O'Donovan said if gas storage was not brought in the potential interruption in energy supply would be "absolutely catastrophic", and he argued that commercial options should not be ruled out. Friends of the Earth used its submission to call on the Government to make the current moratorium on LNG and fracked gas imports permanent through legislation. The organisation says it "does not consider that Ireland should risk reliance on LNG given our climate obligations, given the risk of carbon leakage, given social and environmental impacts particularly of fracked gas, as well as human rights implications". It also suggests a moratorium on new data centres - they use high levels of energy - connecting to the grid until the pressure on the electricity system and gas demand risks are "comprehensively addressed". The organisation also suggest several additional options to improve Ireland's energy security. Among them is the Government prioritising the roll out of solar panels on the rooftops of one million homes by 2030, an action it says would produce 25 per cent of all residential electricity demand. \</doc>

The most detailed ever data about individual facility sources of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide has been unveiled at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. It has revealed the biggest individual greenhouse gas polluters in the world, including Ireland. It found Dublin Airport, and the aircraft operating in and out of there, was the largest polluter in the country. The independent data comes primarily from measurements collected by 300 EU, American and Chinese satellites, more than 11,000 land, air and sea-based sensors, as well as the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. According to the database, Dublin Airport was the specific source for just over one million tonnes of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions in 2021. Daa, which runs the airport, said it was "absolutely committed to playing our part to help Ireland meet its carbon emissions reduction targets". It added: "As a commercial semi-state company, daa has a firm target to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 51% by 2030, in-line with Government-set public sector targets. "Additionally we are working towards a commitment to achieve Net Zero emissions from our operations by 2050, or sooner. "As a vital economic enabler, daa has a clear sustainability strategy already in place to deliver key initiatives at Dublin Airport in terms of embracing new technologies, ensuring efficient aircraft operations and implementing smart environmental measures to play our part to reduce carbon emissions." The second biggest carbon polluter in Ireland is the Drogheda Cement Plant, which spewed out over 983,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases last year. Third is the cement plant at Ballyconnell in Co Cavan. That was the source of almost 955,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. All of these three facilities individually put more climate-changing pollution into the atmosphere than the traffic on Dublin's road network in 2021, which according to new data bank was fourth and the source of 773,000 tonnes of emissions. The fifth, sixth and seventh sources of Irish greenhouse gas emissions were the Limerick Cement plant, the Whitegate oil refinery in Cork and the Corrib gas field respectively. These were followed on the league table by the cement plant at Kinnegad, Co Westmeath and Shannon Airport. The new data bank which has pinpointed more than 70,000 sites was launched by former US vice president Al Gore. HYPERLINK It was put together by an organisation called Climate Trace , a non-profit organisation of artificial intelligence experts, data scientists, researchers, and non-government organisations. Speaking about the satellite monitoring project, the UN chief Antonio Guterres said it made it harder for countries or companies to "cheat" or "greenwash" their emission levels. "This should be a wake-up call to governments and the financial sector, especially those that continue to invest in and underwrite fossil fuel pollution," he said. Using artificial intelligence to analyse data from more than 300 satellites, as well as thousands of sensors on land and in the sea, the Climate TRACE monitor found that the top 14 largest emitters are all oil and gas extraction sites. Of those, the biggest emitter on the planet is the Permian Basin in Texas, one of the largest oilfields in the world. "With new data on methane and flaring, we now estimate that the actual emissions are three times higher than what they have reported," Mr Gore said. Flaring is the burning off of unwanted natural gas from oil and gas wells. Methane, emitted by leaks from fossil fuel installations as well as from other human-caused sources like livestock and landfills, is responsible for roughly 30% of the global rise in temperatures to date.

The Department of Education is to warn the Cabinet of significant spending pressures driven by construction inflation of 21 per cent and the impact of expanding services for special needs education and children fleeing the war in Ukraine. Minister for Education Norma Foley is to tell Cabinet colleagues today that expenditure at the end of September was EUR 314 million ahead of where it was expected to be - accounting for an overspend of 4.7 per cent. The information is contained in a quarterly expenditure report being brought to Cabinet this morning, which warns that the spending excess covers both current items like wages and capital projects such as new school construction. Ministers will be told that the department's basic building costs, based on tender outcomes, grew by 21 per cent in the year to June 2022. This is occurring while more building is under way to support a large cohort of special needs children, Cabinet will be told. Ms Foley will say that the department is also facing a pressing requirement to handle the significant numbers of children unexpectedly coming from Ukraine and elsewhere. Minister for Housing Darragh O'Brien will update the Cabinet on the Government's flagship Housing For All programme, which is also understood to recognise the impact of construction inflation, which it says is running at 17 per cent in the year to the end of September. It will say that a burden-sharing arrangement on Government projects which has seen the State take on 70 per cent of cost increases has supported activity. Mr O'Brien will also brief Cabinet on plans to appoint the Construction Industry Federation to oversee registration with the Construction Industry Register Ireland (CIRI). Ms Foley will tell colleagues that current expenditure is running EUR 144 million ahead of profile, driven by factors such as substitute teacher pay and transport costs, and capital expenditure is running EUR 170 million over. Overall, the department had spent EUR 7.04 billion at the end of September, 78.5 per cent of its allocation for 2022 of almost EUR 9 billion. Minister for Justice Helen McEntee will brief Ministers on the establishment of a new division of the High Court to deal with planning and environmental issues, which was agreed in the programme for government. The intention is that it should act on the same basis as the existing Commercial Court model. Legal sources argued that the establishment of a new court would require more judges to be hired in order to make an impact. Climate summit Meanwhile, Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan will brief Cabinet on plans to attend the COP27 Elsewhere, Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath is to seek Cabinet approval for new legislation revising thousands of laws dating back to before independence in an effort to remove obsolete legislation. The Statute Law Revision Bill is part of a process aiming to have a modern statute book, which has examined 114,000 laws to date. The proposed Bill arises from a review of secondary legislation from 1821-1860. Minister for Children Roderic O'Gorman is to brief Cabinet on already-announced plans for a once-off cost-of-living payment to foster carers from Tusla. Ministers will also consider appointments to the High and Supreme Courts. \</doc>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he was open to talks with Russia, but only "genuine" negotiations that would restore Ukraine's borders, grant it compensation for Russian attacks and punish those responsible for war crimes. The remarks, made in an overnight address, came days after a Washington Post report that the US wanted Ukraine to signal its willingness for talks, concerned that by appearing too intransigent Kyiv might harm its case for international support. Speaking before he was due to address world leaders at COP27 , Mr Zelensky said: "Anyone who is serious about the climate agenda should also be serious about the need to immediately stop Russian aggression, restore our territorial integrity, and force Russia into genuine peace negotiations." Ukraine has repeatedly proposed such talks, but "we always received insane Russian responses with new terrorist attacks, shelling or blackmail", he said. "Once again - restoration of territorial integrity, respect for the UN Charter, compensation for all damages caused by the war, punishment of every war criminal and guarantees that this will not happen again. These are completely understandable conditions." Since Russia announced the annexation of Ukrainian territory at the end of September, Mr Zelensky has decreed that Kyiv would never negotiate with Moscow as long as Vladimir Putin remains Russian president. Kyiv officials have repeated that position in recent days, while saying that Kyiv would be willing to negotiate with Mr Putin's future successor. HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/news/ukraine/ Latest Ukraine stories "Negotiating with Putin would mean giving up, and we would never give him this gift," Zelensky adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with Italy's La Repubblica newspaper published today. Russia was demanding Ukraine give up territory as a pre-condition for talks, which made them impossible for now, Mr Podolyak said: "Society will never accept this. The Russian army will leave Ukrainian territory, and then dialogue will come." Yesterday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov repeated Moscow's position that it is open to talks but that Kyiv is refusing them. Moscow has repeatedly said it will not negotiate over territory it claims to have annexed from Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have been on the offensive in recent months, while Russia is regrouping to defend areas of Ukraine it still occupies, having called up hundreds of thousands of reservists. Russia has been evacuating civilians from occupied areas, especially from southern Ukraine's Kherson region, in an operation that Ukraine says includes forced deportations, a war crime. Moscow says it is taking people to safety. The next big battle is expected to be over a small Russian-controlled pocket of land on the west bank of the Dnipro River, which includes Kherson city, the only regional capital Russia has captured since its invasion in February. A source yesterday confirmed reports that White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan had held talks with Russian officials about averting escalation of the conflict. Those talks were first reported by the Wall Street Journal. The Kremlin has declined to comment on them. The White House did not deny the talks but says it will not make diplomatic moves about Ukraine without Kyiv's involvement. "We reserve the right to speak directly at senior levels about issues of concern to the United States. That has happened over the course of the past few months. Our conversations have focused only on ... risk reduction and the US-Russia relationship," White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. The United States is holding mid-term elections for Congress. Although most candidates from both parties strongly support Ukraine, some right-wing Republican candidates have expressed doubt about the cost of US military aid. US support for Ukraine would be "unflinching and unwavering" regardless of the outcome of the congressional elections, Ms Jean-Pierre said. \</doc>

DEREK SCALLY As German climate negotiators entered the final round of Cop27 climate talks in Turkey, their colleagues in Berlin quietly raised the curtain on a new era of fossil fuels. As part of Berlin's race to free itself of Russian gas, the first of five planned liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals has been completed in Wilhelmshaven on Germany's North Sea coast. The terminal has come at warp speed by German standards, where major infrastructure projects are often held back by rigorous bureaucracy. Nine months after Russia invaded Ukraine and six months after construction began, the floating terminal has an annual capacity of five billion cubic metres of gas and can receive up to 170,000 cubic metres a week - about 8 per cent of Germany's natural gas consumption. For all involved, the LNG terminal is floating proof of necessity as the mother of invention. "The example of Wilhelmshaven shows that Germany can be fast and advance infrastructure projects with great determination," said Robert Habeck, federal economics minister. Exploding prices With a 26km stretch to be finished shortly to connect the terminal to the gas network, the first gas-carrying ship is expected in the new year. But shifting its energy sources at such short notice has come at a huge price. New figures suggest the cost of purchasing and maintaining Germany's new LNG terminals has exploded 123 per cent from a forecast EUR 2.94 billion to EUR 6.56 billion. Russia met more than 50 per cent of the Germany's total gas needs until February's invasion of Ukraine. After months of unstable deliveries, September's explosion of two undersea gas pipelines has seen Russia gas deliveries ended since September and Germany seeking alternative suppliers, primarily Norway. But as prices continue to rise, gas electricity production in Germany is down from 14.4 per cent of the total last year to 11.7 per cent at present. German industry is the biggest consumer of gas, 60 per cent of the total, but energy-saving measures and a drop in production have seen production firms using 30 per cent less gas than this time last year. The mild autumn - with temperatures only reaching November averages this week - has helped Germany reach its goal of 100 per cent full gas storage ahead of its December target. This would cover all gas needs until February but, with a campaign under way for 20 per cent energy savings in gas consumption, government officials hope the reserves will see the country through until April. Nuclear plants That is when Germany's three final nuclear power plants will close for good, after a four-month extension. Authorities hope the LNG deliveries in Wilhelmshaven will begin to flow long before then. As well as another facility in Wilhelmshaven, three other LNG terminals are expected to be completed along Germany's north and Baltic coasts in the coming months. Despite rapid infrastructure development, and a mild autumn, German energy importer Uniper says that getting through the winter is "all about the weather". "When it comes to next winter 2023/2024, storage will be quite empty after this winter, so the question is how do we refill the storages with no gas anticipated from Russia," said Tiina Tuomela, Uniper's chief financial officer. Uniper already imports LNG through long-term contracts in the Netherlands and UK, but is working to secure additional deliveries. As Germany closes its final nuclear plants for good in April, it has embraced fossil fuels to bridge the energy gap until it can boost further production from renewables. Wind and solar currently meet 49 per cent of Germany's energy needs, up five points in a year. Turbulence over Russian energy deliveries in 2022 has seen Germany also increase its dependency on coal-burning plants, now providing 31 per cent of the energy mix, up 17 points on last year. Compared to this time last year, German energy production from traditional sources has dropped seven points to 51 per cent. \</doc>

The Irish advertising industry has come together for a new climate-action push that calls on ad creatives to use their influence to promote more sustainable consumer choices and also sets a target of reaching net zero carbon emissions within its operations by 2030. The Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland (IAPI) will lead Ad Net Zero Ireland, the first international chapter of an industry-wide initiative that began in the UK in 2020. IAPI members will be joined by those of the Advertising Association of Ireland, the Marketing Institute of Ireland, Commercial Producers of Ireland and IAB Ireland in an "all-in" bid to help advertising respond to the climate crisis and make its work a force for positive change. As well as proposing steps to make business operations, including events and the production of advertisements, more sustainable, Ad Net Zero will urge the industry to #ChangeTheBrief - meaning look at its wider responsibilities to the planet when it creates advertisements that influence consumer behaviour. IAPI chief executive Charley Stoney said engagement with the plan and collaboration across the industry had been "very inspirational" to date. "The drive for sustainability is such an overriding priority for business," Ms Stoney said. "I truly believe that we can make a difference by joining Ad Net Zero and taking action to reduce carbon emissions." Independent marketing and sustainability specialist Elizabeth Sheehan is working with the industry to launch the Irish chapter of the initiative alongside IAPI board members Abi Moran, who is chief executive of Folk Wunderman Thompson, and Fiona Field, managing director of OMD. Ad Net Zero Ireland will participate in Ad Net Zero's next global summit, which will be held to coincide with the UN's Cop 27 climate change summit in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt in November. \</doc>

World hunger levels are reaching catastrophic proportions, with 44 countries suffering with serious or alarming levels of hunger, according to the 2022 Global Hunger Index. The study, which uses data from 136 countries, cites the Ukraine war as one of the reasons why nine nations, including Somalia where famine is imminent, and Yemen, have alarming levels of hunger. The other countries with "alarming" levels of hunger in 2022 are Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, Central African Republic, Syria, Burundi and South Sudan. An additional 35 countries, including Pakistan, India and Afghanistan, were found to have serious levels of hunger in the latest index jointly published by Irish humanitarian organisation Concern Worldwide and German charity Welthungerhilfe. The index shows south Asia has the world's highest levels of child stunting (low body weight to height) and child wasting (malnourished or emaciated), while areas of Africa south of the Sahara have the highest levels of undernourishment and child mortality rates. Progress made to tackle world hunger has largely halted," said Concern Worldwide chief executive Dominic MacSorley. "It's sobering that 828 million people are undernourished today and many of them are children ... "The toxic cocktail of conflict, climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic had already left millions exposed to food price shocks and vulnerable to further crises," he said. "The war in Ukraine - with its knock-on effects on global supplies and prices for food, fertiliser and fuel - is turning a crisis into a catastrophe. It is critical to act now to rebuild food security on a new and lasting basis. Failure to do so means sleepwalking into the catastrophic and systematic food crises of the future." The index recommendations include a call for governments to enshrine in law "the right to food" for all people. It also forecasts that by 2030 (the year that the UN has set as the target to end world hunger under its Sustainable Development Goal 2) there will still be hundreds of millions of people experiencing hunger. "While we may not be able to end hunger by then, we can stop it heading in the wrong direction," said Concern's head of advocacy R\'e9iseal N\'ed Ch\'e9illeachair. "The number of shocks people are experiencing means more effort is needed to increase global food, nutrition and livelihood security. The interdependency of the food system is evident in how shocks in one country can have a direct impact on the purchasing power and food consumption of families in another," she said. Record temperatures A separate report has found record high temperatures this year - which are fuelling catastrophes in Somalia, Pakistan and other parts of the planet - "foreshadow a future with deadlier, more frequent, and more intense heat-related humanitarian emergencies". Released ahead of the UN climate conference Cop27 , the Extreme Heat: Preparing for the Heatwaves of the Future report concludes with climate disruption making heatwaves ever more dangerous, "aggressive steps must be taken now to avert potentially recurrent heat disasters". "As the climate crisis goes unchecked, extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and floods, are hitting the most vulnerable people the hardest," says Martin Griffiths, UN undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs. "Nowhere is the impact more brutally felt than in countries already reeling from hunger, conflict and poverty." The report - published jointly by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies - offers concrete steps humanitarians and decision-makers can take to mitigate extreme heat's worst effects. \</doc>

KEVIN O'SULLIVAN Environment and Science Editor Better leadership is needed globally to address a worsening climate crisis and help ease a growing sense of doom among citizens, Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin has said in a forceful speech at Cop27 . "Our citizens will become increasingly cynical, weary and hopeless if words are not urgently matched by deeds; if commitments do not generate new realities. We can already see and feel the world around us changing," Mr Martin warned. "Across the world, we are witnessing the reality of a changing climate - record temperatures, wildfires, floods, and droughts. What were once exceptional events are now occurring with increased frequency and ferocity." "If this generation doesn't step up urgently, future generations will not forgive us. As leaders, it is our responsibility to drive the transformation necessary." Targets In Ireland, the Government had set legally-binding emission reduction targets of 51 per cent by 2030, and committed to climate neutrality by 2050, while fixed sectoral emissions ceilings had been set limiting emissions for each economic sector, he confirmed. "Achieving these targets will be challenging, so we have enacted a legal framework to guide and underpin our efforts." With the burden of climate change globally falling most heavily on those least responsible for "our predicament", he said Ireland had published an international climate finance roadmap, "reaffirming our commitment to supporting the world's most vulnerable people". This extended to enhancing loss and damage support for countries already affected by climate disasters, while Ireland was "more than doubling our finance to at least EUR 225m a year by 2025". But he believed the scale of change required would not be achieved without climate justice. With temperatures in Ireland being so mild this autumn, trees were producing new growth before they have even dropped their leaves, he said. The situation was urgent but not hopeless, Mr Martin said, as countries were bending the curve of emissions downwards: "Last year's UN projections showed emissions continuing to rise beyond 2030. This year, however, analysis shows them no longer rising after that date. It is progress, but it is far from enough." When he spoke at Cop26 last year he said he did not believe that it was too late, that the transition would be too costly or that it was inevitable that people would be left behind. "I believe it even more so now," he said at a plenary gathering of more than 100 global leaders. "It is realistic for our legacy to be a sustainable planet; a world alive with an abundance of plant and animal life; with cleaner water and healthier air; with liveable cities and sustainable rural communities. We will do everything in our power to bring it about," he said. "This generation of leaders cannot say that we didn't know. The science is clear. Every tonne of carbon warms the world. Every delay makes our task that bit bigger. Let us not waste a second more." Damage funding Earlier Mr Martin announced an allocation by Ireland of EUR 10 million in loss and damage funding under the "Global Shield" initiative to support poorer countries after experiencing climate-related disasters. Ross Fitzpatrick of Christian Aid Ireland welcomed Ireland's recognition of the issue. "But finance for loss and damage cannot be adequately addressed by the Global Shield; a largely insurance-based mechanism. Loss and damage finance needs to be new and additional so that poor countries are not left to pick up the tab," he said. \</doc>

Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels, the main driver of climate change, are on track to rise 1% in 2022 to reach an all-time high, scientists said at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt. Emissions from oil, fuelled by the continuing rebound in aviation, will likely rise more than 2% compared to last year, while emissions from coal - thought by some to have peaked in 2014 - will hit a new record. Global CO2 emissions from all sources - including deforestation and land use - will top out at 40.6 billion tonnes, just below the record level in 2019, the first peer-reviewed projections for 2022 showed. Despite the wild cards of pandemic recovery and an energy crisis provoked by war in Ukraine, the uptick in carbon pollution from burning oil, gas and coal is consistent with underlying trends, the data suggested. "Emissions are now 5% above what they were when the Paris Agreement was signed" in 2015, he noted. "You have to ask: When are they going to go down?" Carbon budget The new figures show just how dauntingly hard it will be to slash emissions fast enough to meet the Paris goal of capping global warming at 1.5C above preindustrial levels. Heating beyond that threshold, scientists warn, risks triggering dangerous tipping points in the climate system. Barely 1.2C of warming to date has unleashed a crescendo of deadly and costly extreme weather, from heat waves and drought to flooding and tropical storms made more destructive by rising seas. To achieve the ambitious Paris target, global greenhouse emissions must drop 45% by 2030, and be cut to net zero by mid-century, with any residual emissions compensated by removing CO2 from the atmosphere. To be on track for a net-zero world, emissions would have to plummet by 7% annually over the next eight years. To put that in perspective: in 2020, with much of the world's economy on lock down, emissions fell by only 6%. Over a longer time frame, the annual rise in CO2 from fossil fuel use has slowed, on average, to 0.5% per year over the last decade after climbing 3% annually from 2000 to 2010. To have a 50/50 chance of staying under the 1.5C limit, humanity's emissions allowance is 380 billion tonnes of CO2, according to the study in Earth System Science Data, authored by more than 100 scientists. On current emissions trends of 40 billion tonnes a year, that "carbon budget" would be used up in less than a decade. For a two-thirds chance, the budget shrivels by a quarter and would be exhausted in seven years. 'Deeply depressing' In recent decades, scientists could usually draw a straight line between CO2 trends and the economy of China, which has been the world's top carbon polluter for about 15 years. In 2022, however, China's CO2 output is set to drop by nearly 1% for the year, almost certainly reflecting an economic slowdown linked to Beijing's strict zero-covid policy. Despite having to scramble for alternate sources of energy, including carbon-intensive coal, the European Union is on track to see its emissions fall by almost as much, 0.8%. US emissions will likely go up by 1.5%, and India's by six percent. The annual update also revealed that the ability of oceans, forests and soil to continue soaking up more than half of CO2 emissions has slowed. "These 'sinks' are weaker than they would be if not for the impacts of a changing climate," said co-author Corinne Le Quere, a professor at the University of East Anglia. Scientists not involved in the findings said they were grim. "Global Carbon Budget for 2022 is deeply depressing," said Mark Maslin, a professor of Climatology at University College London. "To have any chance of staying below the international agreed 1.5C global warming target we need to have large annual cuts in emissions -which there is no sign of." \</doc>

Irish businesses are significantly underprepared when it comes to making the transformative changes required to transition to a net zero future, according to the new UCC Sustainable Futures report. "The Sustainability Transformation: Assessing the Readiness of Irish Businesses" was commissioned by Microsoft Ireland to understand the level of business preparedness for a sustainable, net zero future. There is strong evidence to suggest that businesses underestimate the scale of ambition and action that are required to build a path to net zero emissions by 2050. Just 22% have committed to a net zero target, despite Government setting out to reduce emissions nationally by 51% by 2030 and to become carbon neutral by 2050. The report found that one in five (19%) businesses has yet to start addressing sustainability issues, while less than one in ten (9%) consider themselves to be well-advanced or truly sustainable. Concerningly, even for those who are in the early stages of their sustainability journey, three in five businesses are yet to formulate a dedicated sustainability strategy or policy. 20% of businesses surveyed said they had no set commitments or targets relating to any critical sustainability issues. Anne Sheehan, General Manager, Microsoft Ireland, said the lack of progress is concerning given Government's overarching climate action commitments for 2030 and beyond. "In order for national targets to be met, every organisation must play its part and take action by making sustainability a business imperative and a leadership priority," she said. The research points to a concerning lack of sustainability leadership and suitable skills among Irish businesses when it comes to driving sustainable transformation. About seven in ten (69%) do not have someone tasked with developing and implementing a sustainability strategy. A similar proportion (69%) do not have someone tasked with identifying environmental sustainability priorities. When it comes to sustainability skills, approximately two-thirds of Irish businesses said they were either yet to develop the required skills or had basic competencies in this area. Larger businesses will be required to publicly disclose information on how they engage with environmental, social, and governance issues as part of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive from 1st January 2024. Four in five (81%) businesses said that digital technology was "important", "fairly important" or "very important" to their organisation's sustainability transition. However, almost two thirds (64%) of businesses said they had not adopted digital technologies to support their sustainability efforts or were in the early stages of adopting technology for this purpose. Only a very small proportion (6%) of businesses are either "well advanced and ahead of most others" or "an exemplar of best practice" in this area. "Irish businesses of all sizes see digital technology as a critical enabler of their sustainable transition, however, most are yet to leverage it to for this purpose," Ms Sheehan said. "From using data intelligence to monitor carbon emissions to harnessing AI to reduce energy consumption, technology can empower businesses on their journey whilst also opening up new business opportunities." Dr Marguerite Nyhan, Associate Professor in Future Sustainability & Environmental Engineering, University College Cork said global leaders are gathering to build significant momentum for climate action at COP27 this week. "It is absolutely certain that businesses will play an extremely important role in the sustainability transformation and their actions will be vitally important in our global and national efforts to rapidly reduce emissions and mitigate climate change. "Our research shows that although some businesses are embracing the sustainability transition, the majority are not and need to step up their sustainability and decarbonisation efforts immediately. "That begins by defining a sustainability strategy with firm net zero commitments and targets that are measured and monitored. Organisations urgently need to be aware of the new sustainability reporting obligations and address the challenges associated with sustainability reporting," Dr Nyhan said. "To drive meaningful change, leaders must look to understand the economic case for sustainability within their organisations and the competitive advantages it can gain in the years ahead. As digital technologies offer potential to drive systems change and manage, monitor and track progress, businesses should maximise the opportunities of the digital revolution to achieve their sustainability and net zero ambitions," she added. \</doc>

CLIMATE pledges by the world's governments have had virtually no impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions or calming global temperature rise over the last year. Three separate reports by international scientific bodies paint a grim picture of the failures to get to grips with the climate crisis. One from United Nations Climate Change shows the planet is heading for levels of warming that will be catastrophic for many countries. Another from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has recorded the highest greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere since records began. The third, also from UN Climate Change, looks at the "net zero" ambitions declared by many nations and found them lacking detail and set to massively under-deliver even where measures are identified. A fourth report, by NGOs including the World Resources Institute and Climate Action Tracker, assesses 40 indicators of change in the way the world sources and uses energy, travels, farms and finances climate action and says none match governments' promises. They are among a series of reports being released over the coming days and weeks as world leaders prepare to gather in Egypt for the annual UN climate summit, COP27 . Those from UN Climate Change show the quick dissipation of the sense of urgency generated at last year's summit in Glasgow, COP26. All countries were asked to revisit their national climate action plans at the summit and commit to higher goals. Only 24 did, and with these and the existing pledges, emissions of greenhouse gases are set to rise by 10.6pc by 2030. That is a slight improvement on last year when the outlook was for a 13.7pc rise in emissions by 2030. However, while scientists say that is evidence of "bending the curve" and represents "glimmers of hope", the task set for the world's governments was to reduce emissions by 43pc by 2030. That's what is needed to keep global warming to 1.5C, the target of the 193 countries that signed the 2015 Paris Agreement, and the level beyond which scientists warn climate change will spiral out of control. Temperature rise is currently 1.1C above pre-industrial times and has already brought climate change and extreme weather disasters to many parts of the world. "The downward trend in emissions expected by 2030 shows that nations have made some progress this year," said Simon Stiell, executive secretary of UN Climate Change. "But the science is clear and so are our climate goals under the Paris Agreement. "We are still nowhere near the scale and pace of emission reductions required to put us on track toward a 1.5C world." A second United Nations report shows there is a possibility of a 68pc reduction in emissions by 2050 but that is far short of the net-zero ambitions to which many countries claim to aspire. It also relies on the implementation of effective emissions-cutting measures, which are vague in many national climate action plans. "Many net-zero targets remain uncertain and postpone into the future critical action that needs to take place now," the report says. Meanwhile, the WMO says there is now more planet-heating carbon dioxide, methane and nitrogen in the atmosphere than at any time since records began. Concentrations of all three grew last year at a faster rate than in previous years and the jump in methane was "exceptional". The trend is continuing this year. Two factors are at work: increasing emissions but also the reduced ability of natural carbon sinks such as forests and oceans to capture and retain harmful gases because of their depleted condition. Professor Petteri Taalas, WMO secretary general, said all emissions must be cut urgently, but slashing carbon was the top priority. The jump in methane levels was 'exceptional', according to WMO \</doc>

Methane concentrations in the atmosphere made their biggest-ever registered increase in 2021, as all three main greenhouse gases extended their record high levels, the United Nations said today. The UN's World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said levels of climate-warming carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide all reached new records last year. Methane - which remains in the atmosphere for only about 10 years, but has a much more powerful warming impact than CO2 - had its biggest year-on-year jump in concentrations since systematic measurements began nearly 40 years ago. The WMO said the "reason for this exceptional increase is not clear, but seems to be a result of both biological and human-induced processes". The figures, released in the UN weather agency's Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, underlined "the enormous challenge - and the vital necessity - of urgent action to cut greenhouse gas emissions and prevent global temperatures rising even further in the future", said WMO chief Petteri Taalas. "The continuing rise in concentrations of the main heat-trapping gases, including the record acceleration in methane levels, shows that we are heading in the wrong direction." The bulletin comes shortly ahead of COP27 , the UN climate change conference, being held in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh from 7-18 November. Methane strategy Methane has been a hot topic of late, with leaks from the Nord Stream gas pipelines thought to have released some 70,000 tonnes, and farmers protesting in New Zealand against plans to tax greenhouse emissions from farm animals. And NASA scientists, using a tool designed to study how dust affects climate, announced yesterday they have so far identified more than 50 spots around the world emitting major levels of methane. Most are connected to the fossil-fuel, waste or agriculture sectors. Atmospheric methane is the second largest contributor to climate change. Since 2007, globally-averaged atmospheric methane concentrations have been increasing at an accelerating rate, the WMO said. The annual increases in 2020 and 2021 - 15 and 18 parts per billion (ppb) respectively - are the largest since systematic records began in 1983, the agency said. "There are cost-effective strategies available to tackle methane emissions, especially from the fossil fuel sector, and we should implement these without delay," said Taalas. The causes of last year's methane rise are still being investigated, but analysis indicates that the largest contribution to the increase since 2007 comes from sources such as wetlands or rice paddies. The record rises in 2020 and 2021 could represent a climate feedback loop: warmer temperatures leading to organic material decomposing faster, "thus, if tropical wetlands become wetter and warmer, more emissions are possible". The dramatic increase might also be due to natural variability: 2020 and 2021 saw La Nina weather events, which are associated with increased rainfall in tropical regions. CO2 'top priority' "As the top and most urgent priority, we have to slash carbon dioxide emissions, which are the main driver of climate change and associated extreme weather, and which will affect the climate for thousands of years through polar ice loss, ocean warming and sea level rise," he said. Carbon dioxide concentrations in 2021 were 415.7 parts per million, methane at 1,908 ppb and nitrous oxide at 334.5 ppb. These values constitute, respectively, 149%, 262% and 124% of the pre-industrial levels. Global CO2 emissions have rebounded since the Covid-19-related lockdowns in 2020, the bulletin said. Of the total emissions from human activities during the 2011-2020 period, about 48% accumulated in the atmosphere, 26% in the ocean and 29% on land. "There is concern that the ability of land ecosystems and oceans to act as 'sinks' may become less effective in the future, thus reducing their ability to absorb CO2 and act as a buffer against larger temperature increase," the WMO said. "In some parts of the world, the transition of the land sink into CO2 source is already happening." \</doc>

Who's afraid of the big bad wolf? The European People's Party, apparently. Fine Gael's political group successfully pushed a resolution through the European Parliament last week to demand the weakening of the protection of wildlife including grey wolves, lynxes and brown bears, due to farmers' concerns about predation on livestock. A non-binding resolution, the vote was aimed to apply pressure to the European Commission to alter habitat policies to allow large predators to be more easily killed. It's not an issue for Ireland, where the last native wolf was killed in the 1700s, and ideas about reintroduction have been greeted with hostility. But it is for continental Europe. Decades after wolves were hunted to extinction in many parts of the Continent, strict protections forbidding their killing have helped to reverse their dwindling numbers, bucking the trend of a 70 per cent collapse in global wildlife populations in the last 50 years. The resolution, which was also backed by Fianna F\'e1il while being opposed by Ireland's Green and Left-independent MEPs, suggested that the population of wolves in Europe had increased from 12,000 in 2012 to 19,000 today. 'Costs to pastoralists' The increasing range of wolf packs had brought them "into conflict with human activities", the resolution read, noting "costs to pastoralists caused by depredation of their herds". In one particularly vivid illustration this year, a wolf was blamed for the untimely demise of Dolly, the beloved pony of the European Commission President and EPP darling Ursula von der Leyen. German tabloid Bild reported the carcass had been discovered by her husband Heiko in a field near their house in bucolic Lower Saxony. The EPP celebrated the passing of the resolution by distributing promotional cartoons showing a salivating wolf, bear, and lynx advancing on a frightened sheep and shepherdess. But this is far from the picture painted by a study of the effect of wolves in an agricultural area of Denmark and Germany in a paper that was published this year. It focused on the area of Jutland, where 17 wolves were recorded in 2021, a decade since their presence was first noticed in 2007. Attacks on sheep were given the full CSI treatment, down to identifying the individual wolf responsible if possible by genetically testing the saliva left on the bite mark. The results of the study found that wolves try to live in forested areas where there are few humans, and contrary to popular belief, are not drawn towards large sheep populations. Rather, they turn to livestock in the absence of wildlife. "We found that wolves mainly eat sheep because they happen to be moving through areas with lots of farm animals and little natural prey," the authors wrote in a summary of the study, published in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution. "Killing such wolves only solves the problem temporarily, usually until the next wolf arrives. For a long-term solution, sheep must be better protected from attack in areas where wolves occur." They recommended making fences higher and adding electric wires, measures which were found to reduce attacks by 96 per cent in a project in the Italian Alps. The EPP's resolution dismissed such solutions as meaning "additional financial and labour burdens for farmers", and warned their effectiveness could vary. At the recent Cop27 , developing countries repeated their argument that they are asked to make sacrifices for the sake of the environment that richer countries are not prepared to make themselves. The EPP has previously called on Brazil to protect the Amazon rainforest, and for tighter rules on products such as soy, palm oil, coffee and chocolate to stop the destruction of forests and wildlife in South America and Asia. Its position paper on Africa similarly calls for the "protection of systemic forests and biodiversity". A figure cited by the European Commission in its response to the resolution illustrates how low the tolerance is in Europe for any cost associated with accommodating nature, despite the compromises the EU expects parts of the world with more wilderness to make. The number of sheep killed in Europe by wolves each year is estimated to be 20,000, Commissioner Janez Lenarcic told the chamber. "This is a big figure which can be drastically reduced with proper protection measures. But this figure, 20,000, represents 0.06 per cent of the sheep numbers in the concerned countries." He repeated it for effect: "0.06 per cent." \</doc>

People often ask me, how do climate activists "keep going" in the face of so much inaction and indifference? It's a good question. In Greek mythology, princess Cassandra was bestowed with the gift of being able to see the future, but she was cursed because her prophecies would always come to pass but no one would believe her. Climate advocates, scientists and activists perform this tragic role every day. "Seeing" the future means simply following the science and daring to think about the future transformed by global warming. Yet we encounter denial and disbelief every day. The stress this brings about is bad enough - think of Jennifer Lawrence in the film Don't Look Up yelling in anguish from a TV studio. One climate scientist I met at Cop27 openly admitted to feeling panic - but climate anxiety is much more prevalent than we realise. Ecological distress manifests itself in many ways - distress, apathy, grief and a profound sense of dread that is as much physical as psychological. I experience it as a lump in my chest, tears that are easily triggered by sometimes unrelated bad news, and a pervasive feeling of sadness for all that is being needlessly destroyed, and the human suffering that I cannot prevent. It probably amplifies depression in some people who are prone to this. But this condition is not pathological: this is a normal human reaction to crisis and loss. There is no "treatment" except the work of processing fear and sadness and channelling difficult emotions into empathic connection. It's a very first-world condition though since we are mostly at a remove from the unfolding catastrophes in far-flung places where lands, livelihoods and lives are being wiped out by climate and ecological breakdown. For Indigenous groups, in particular, wildfires, flooding, forced migration and ecological destruction cause deep psychological wounds that rupture identities. According to Australian academic Blanche Verlie, this is a distinct kind of ecological grief, and it is a violence that is further amplified by the intergenerational and ongoing trauma of dispossession and neglect. In western societies, there is little evidence of this type of communal grief over the sixth mass extinction or climate breakdown. But we do see unprecedented rates of anxiety among young people, often leading to unhealthy coping mechanisms and growing alienation. Surveys show high rates of eco-anxiety, but our individualistic culture dismisses this as a problem of our own making. Get therapy! See a doctor! Sort yourself out! We are not encouraged to think about it as a form of crisis that we must all learn to cope with together. It doesn't help that the scientific rationality that is appealed to as a justification for transformative action also distances us from our emotional pain. After all, we can't relate to statistical humans, only real ones. As Blanche Verlie points out, the scientific explanations have failed to engage the masses in part because they do not offer relatable, connective or inspiring accounts of human-climate relationships. And human-nature relationships are as intertwined as ever, it's just that we've unlearned them. Much of the distress we experience might be more noticeable as apathy. However, psychologists point out that what appears to be apathy can actually be feelings of grief and disempowerment that are too difficult to engage with, leading to denial as a mechanism for short-term emotional coping. Verlie says "if there is a lack of care, it is not that most of us do not care, but that we do not know how to care". This presents an interesting challenge. How can we encourage people to confront the frightening reality of climate breakdown without a supportive community? The work of caring, and building communities that care, is also a form of climate action. It is emotional work and also political work. The two need to go together. Caring requires a profound re-evaluation of the neoliberal ideology of growth and progress and the notion that moral agency rests with individuals only. The remedy for our distress is not hope of a miracle rescue, however, but courage. As climate scientist Kate Marvel points out, hope is a creature of privilege: it allows us to project responsibility on to others for fixing everything. "Grief", says Marvel, "is the cost of being alive . . . Courage is the resolve to do well without the assurance of a happy ending". Sadhbh O'Neill is a climate policy specialist \</doc>

AS towns and villages in the borough scoop armfuls of 'Best Kept' awards, a new report has revealed that fixed penalty notices for littering in Antrim and Newtownabbey are down by 90% from the same period last year. Environmental charity, Keep Northern Ireland Beautiful, has released its annual Cleaner Neighbourhoods report, which reveals a snapshot of the local environmental quality of the Antrim and Newtownabbey council area and how it compares to the rest of Northern Ireland. While the overall picture of the streets in Northern Ireland has slightly improved after a worrying spike during the lockdowns of 2020, drinks packaging, including plastic bottles and disposable coffee cups, continues to be a major problem, with rural roads being disproportionately affected. The report also recommends the use of nudge behaviour from councils to encourage the public to use bins where available. The number of fixed litter penalty notices issued within the Antrim and Newtownabbey council area is down to 4 compared to 94 issued in the previous year and the number of dog fouling notices issued down from 8 to 1 and as a result the overall cost of littering per rate payer is down \£32.36 this year. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council has implemented a number of initiatives to cut down on waste, including water refilling stations, solar compacting bins which do not overflow and need to be emptied less regularly, as well as a number of awareness campaigns around recycling and support of community litter-picks. Helen Boyd from Tidy Randalstown, who is also an Adopt a Spot Volunteer in the Antrim and Newtownabbey area said, "As a volunteer in the local area, I am more than proud to do my bit to keep our lovely community clean and safe and I would like to encourage even more people in the area to get involved so that we can continue to enjoy the many beautiful shared recreational community spaces in the wider Antrim and Newtownabbey area." Tidy Randalstown, the town itself, Antrim and other areas locally have all won awards in recent months for the cleanliness and upkeep of their respective areas. The findings from this year's survey took a close analysis of litter related to food packaging, particularly drinks, with plastic bottle, hot drinks cups, lids and straws found in 50% of the areas surveyed. Most surprisingly, 90% of rural roads featured littered drinks packaging and cigarette butts remained the top item of litter found in NI, with 65% of all areas surveyed having some form of cigarette litter present. Dr Ian Humphreys, CEO of Keep Northern Ireland Beautiful, said, "With the environment once again on the top of the agenda as COP27 is underway, we are reminded that action is required globally and here in Northern Ireland. "The amount of litter we are now having to deal with is extremely concerning - it's not only unsightly but it has a real impact on council budgets, wasting money that could be spent on other public services and helping deal with the cost-of-living crisis. "There's no evidence to suggest that human nature has fundamentally changed over the past number of decades, but what has changed is the amount of plastic packaging being produced, which grown exponentially over the past 15 years, which is why it's misleading to lay the problem entirely at the feet of the public. "We need to have an honest conversation about this issue and that is why manufacturers and retailers need to step up and take their share of the cost of cleaning up the mess on our streets." Although the report reflects the army of litter-picking volunteers across the Antrim and Newtownabbey area doing their best to keep our streets free from litter and a safe place for the public to come together, the charity CEO believes that more needs to be done to try and stop litter at the source. Ian added, "We are very disappointed in the recent announcement that litter will not be retained in UK wide Extended Producer Responsibility legislation. "This means the loss of millions of pounds annually which would have funded clean-up operations and alleviated the pressure on ratepayers. "We believe this is a missed opportunity to ensure that packaging producers take on their share of the responsibility for this societal problem."

The Tanaiste said he is confident technology companies operating in Ireland will comply with statutory requirements around the impending redundancies at Twitter and Facebook. Leo Varadkar said no big tech company has given any indication they intend to close their offices in Ireland. Mr Varadkar held meetings with officials from the Industrial Development Agency (IDA) and Enterprise Ireland over upcoming job losses within the tech sector. Twitter is preparing to lay off some of its Irish workforce after it was bought by Elon Musk, while Facebook parent group Meta is also planning redundancies that are expected to affect thousands of staff, with an announcement expected to be made on Wednesday. Following the meeting on Monday evening, Mr Varadkar said in a statement there is still ``high demand'' for tech workers in Ireland. ``Today senior IDA and Enterprise Ireland staff briefed me and Ministers of State Damien English and Dara Calleary on the current situation in the global tech sector,'' he said. ``This followed a series of direct contacts by my office and the agencies with the companies involved. ``My main concern is for the staff and their families who will be affected by downsizing in certain tech companies with a presence in Ireland. No company has given any indication that it is considering closing its Irish base. ``We will assist any employees affected as they seek alternative employment or other opportunities. ``As a country we are close to full employment, with high demand for tech, marketing and other skills across all sectors. ``There is a strong pipeline of new investments from overseas and within Ireland in a range of sectors including tech and in other sectors and we expect many positive announcements in the coming months. ``The economy is well diversified, with hundreds of thousands of people employed by indigenous SMEs, pharmaceuticals, agri-food, med-tech, and financial services. ``We have ongoing engagement with major tech employers through the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, and the Government has asked the agencies to intensify this engagement. ``There are well-established statutory processes to protect employees, and we are confident that all national employment rights requirements for consultation and notification of redundancies will be adhered to once decisions on any reductions in employment are made.'' Mr Varadkar said he has asked officials in the Department of Enterprise, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland to keep him informed of any developments. ``At Government-level we are focused on competitiveness and ensuring that Ireland is the best place in Europe to invest and grow for the future. We are acting on energy, skills, housing, access to water services, and planning,'' he added. ``We have never taken our economic prosperity for granted. ``In just over a month we will publish a white paper on enterprise which will set the strategic direction for job-creation and growth for the years ahead.'' Meanwhile, Taoiseach Micheal Martin said there are issues within the digital sector and he is concerned over potential job losses. Speaking in Egypt at the Cop27 conference, Mr Martin said: ``We will consult with all the various companies. I have been concerned for some time in terms of the global economic situation because of the war in Ukraine and the implications across Europe and the world, the migration and so on. ``But that said, we have bounced back strongly from Covid-19, we do export heavily on what we produce so what happens globally has an impact on Ireland. So our challenge is to make sure that we will engage with the IDA and companies. ``We have faced this situation before, where we consolidate, we look for new opportunities in times when it picks up again in those particular sectors. ``There are issues clearly in the digital area, we are always concerned whether there is potential job losses. ``But we always tend to look at it with a view of, OK, there are realities out there that we can't change globally, how do we deal with this domestically and how do we regroup, what new opportunities are out there in these sectors?'' Ireland is host to several tech giants' European headquarters, including Twitter, Google and Facebook. Meta employs around 3,000 people at its Dublin office. Twitter is expected to enter a 30-day consultation period with staff, during which time they are not required to work or attend the office. end \</doc>

Republicans have edged closer to securing a majority in the US House of Representatives while control of the Senate hinges on a few tight races, two days after Democrats staved off an anticipated "red wave" of Republican gains in midterm elections. Republicans have captured at least 210 House seats, Edison Research projected, eight short of the 218 needed to wrest the House away from Democrats and effectively halt President Joe Biden's legislative agenda. The fate of the Senate was far less certain. Either party could seize control by winning too-close-to-call races in Nevada and Arizona, where officials are tallying thousands of uncounted ballots. The party in power historically suffers heavy casualties in a president's first midterm election and Tuesday's results suggested voters were punishing Mr Biden for the steepest inflation in 40 years. But Democrats were able to avoid the major defeat that Republicans had anticipated and were holding on in the close Senate battles in Nevada and Arizona. Tuesday's results also suggested voters were lashing out against Republican efforts to ban abortion and to cast doubt on the nation's vote-counting process. President Biden had framed the election as a test of US democracy at a time when hundreds of Republican candidates embraced former President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker both failed to reach 50% on Tuesday, forcing them into a one-on-one battle on 6 December. Even a slim House majority would allow Republicans to shape the rest of Mr Biden's term, blocking priorities such as abortion rights and launching investigations into his administration and family. President Biden, who travels to Egypt today for the COP27 UN climate change summit, acknowledged that reality on Wednesday, saying he was prepared to work with Republicans. A White House official said Mr Biden spoke by phone with Republican House leader Kevin McCarthy, who announced earlier in the day his intention to run for speaker of the House if Republicans control the chamber. We lost fewer seats in the House of Representatives than any Democratic president's first midterm election in at least 40 years.And we had the best midterms for Governors since 1986.The American people spoke./n President Biden (@POTUS) HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1590492352761966592 November 9, 2022 If Mr McCarthy is the next House speaker, he may find it challenging to hold together his fractious caucus, with a hard-right wing that has little interest in compromise. Republicans are expected to demand spending cuts in exchange for raising the nation's borrowing limit next year, a showdown that could spook financial markets. Control of the Senate, meanwhile, would give Republicans the power to block President Biden's nominees for judicial and administrative posts. Thousands of votes still remained uncounted in the two closely competitive states of Arizona and Nevada. Election officials in Maricopa County, Arizona's most populous, said it could take until at least Friday to tally all votes there. A number of "election deniers", those who support Mr Trump's false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him, won on Tuesday but many who sought positions to oversee elections at the state level were defeated. "It was a good day, I think, for democracy," President Biden said. Mr Trump, who took an active role in recruiting Republican candidates, had mixed results. He notched a victory in Ohio, where "Hillbilly Elegy" author JD Vance won a Senate seat to keep it in Republican hands. But several other Trump-backed candidates suffered defeats, such as retired celebrity surgeon Mehmet Oz, who lost a crucial Senate race in Pennsylvania to Democrat John Fetterman. Meanwhile, Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who could challenge Mr Trump in 2024, won re-election by nearly 20 percentage points, adding to his growing national profile. \</doc>

Two years ago I was taken back in time. It was my first encounter with Katherine Rundell's natural history studies in the London Review of Books. The piece was called "Consider the Greenland Shark", and it began by placing me in the Jacobean era, when, conceivably, a Greenland shark that survived into our lifetime might already have lived a century of its own: the longest-lived vertebrate on earth. The Golden Mole: And Other Living Treasure, which collects these pieces along with a few additions, can be read as a sort of modern bestiary. There is a very real risk that, if we are not ambitiously careful, some of these creatures - the Borneo elephant, the sun bear, the bumblebee bat, the Hawaiian crow - will soon become myths themselves. Rundell, who is John Donne's Baillie Gifford Prize-winning biographer and a bestselling children's author, explores misunderstandings that persisted about certain creatures from ancient times onwards, and which may have done serious harm to the animals they celebrated. Narwhals were thought to be sea unicorns; their long, sensitive teeth were collected for supposedly magical properties. Giraffes were coveted as composites of other animals, like griffons. Rare seahorses are still dried and eaten for mythic value. Wolves get a bad deal: "the very first transformation scene in the work of the Roman poet Ovid is also the grisliest, and one of the earliest fictional accounts of lycanthropy". Rundell shows us that the human imagination often looks pedestrian next to nature's real ingenuity; our fairy tales can seem like mundane placeholders for more wonderful truths. It was once proposed that storks "wintered on the moon"; we couldn't have imagined that a mere two centuries later their wings would reveal the key to human flight. No Roman naturalist or German scholastic would have dared suggest swifts fly the equivalent of five times round the Earth every year. The US Navy models underwater missiles on the body shape of bluefin tuna. But biotech is yet to emulate the properties of the golden orb spider's web, which can last years. The titular golden mole is blind and can't see its own iridescent fur. But with gilt-edged pages and illustrations by Talya Baldwin, Rundell's book presents the wonderful things it contains with the tactile attractiveness of a children's book. Her own literary imagination, too, is sharp and distinctive. The eyes of one hermit crab are on stalks "striped like a barber's pole in red and white". Bears who hibernate "unfurl a powerful slowness within themselves". A pangolin has the face "of an unusually polite academic". Rundell's selection is rangy and personalised. There's bound to be animals one feels to have been unfairly overlooked, and I would have liked to see her on at least one bird of prey, or declining beetle, or endangered cat. The Bengal tiger would have been too much to ask: a whole book would be required to explore the references and resonances that accompany it. The lynx, though, is secretive and mysterious enough not to have already exhausted our cultural imaginations, and could fit snugly into one of these short entries. Some animals that would have most brilliantly galvanised Rundell in the telling and fit well into her format, rich as they are in folklore, misunderstanding and wild factoids, are doing just fine. The spotted hyena, much maligned and endlessly fascinating in terms of legend and science, by and large doesn't need the help of a book like this. Rundell's latest LRB piece has been published this month, and is on hummingbirds. As it's not included here, maybe there's a second edition of this golden treasury being planned. We've always been attracted by animals' rarity, whether we've expressed our attraction as curiosity for its own sake or the collector's impulse to keep and own. Rundell quotes Pliny the Elder: "the proof of wealth is 'to possess something that might be absolutely destroyed in a moment.'" Reading Rundell's book, you know the feeling. I googled the endangered Gooty tarantula, which is an otherworldly ultramarine, and immediately thought: want one. In terms of consumption, human-created scarcity often increases demand - pangolin scales, bluefin tuna flesh - rather than curtailing it. We "whittle away at their numbers with our delight", Rundell writes. There is always hope of a sort. As I read The Golden Mole, I also read of species new to science being discovered. Not just the Principe scops-owl, native to a West African island with a human population of less than 8,000, but a new type of water shrew in these islands. But also at the time of writing, world leaders were meeting in Egypt for Cop27 . Their decisions will directly affect our chances of continuing to discover more of this treasure. \</doc>

The world has "no credible path to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees", and 2022 has been a year of "woefully inadequate progress" to achieving that critical target, the latest UN Environment Programme (UNEP) report has said. Containing average global temperatures to within 1.5 degrees is a key target of the Paris Agreement to avoid irreversible and increasingly catastrophic impacts on the Earth. Current climate pledges, however, leave the world on track for a temperature rise of 2.4 to 2.6 degrees by the end of this century, UNEP concludes, which means "rapid transformation of societies is the only option" for the international community. The annual emissions gap report is the definitive assessment of global progress on cutting carbon emissions, and will feed into Cop27 climate negotiations in Egypt next month. As intensifying climate impacts across the globe hammer home the message that greenhouse gas emissions must fall rapidly, the report finds collective action "is still falling far short of the Paris goals". It calls for urgent sector- and system-wide transformations - in the electricity supply; industry, transport and buildings sectors; and the food and financial systems - that "would help to avoid climate disaster". "We had our chance to make incremental changes, but that time is over. Only a root-and- branch transformation of our economies and societies can save us from accelerating climate disaster," she warned. Despite a decision by all countries at the 2021 climate summit in Glasgow (Cop26) to strengthen nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and some updates from nations, "progress has been woefully inadequate". Paris goals NDCs submitted this year take only 0.5 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent - less than 1 per cent - off projected global emissions in 2030. To meet Paris goals, the world needs to reduce greenhouse gases by unprecedented levels over the next eight years, it confirms. Unconditional and conditional NDCs are estimated to reduce global emissions in 2030 by 5 and 10 per cent, respectively, compared with emissions based on policies now in place. To get on "a least-cost pathway" to holding global warming to 1.5 degrees, emissions must fall by 45 per cent over those envisaged under current policies by 2030. For the 2-degree target, a 30 per cent cut is needed. "Such massive cuts mean that we need a large- scale, rapid and systemic transformation," UNEP adds. "It is a tall, and some would say impossible, order to reform the global economy and almost halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, but we must try," Ms Andersen said. "Every fraction of a degree matters: to vulnerable communities, to species and ecosystems, and to every one of us." She added: "Even if we don't meet our 2030 goals, we must strive to get as close as possible to 1.5 degrees. This means setting up the foundations of a net- zero future: one that will allow us to bring down temperature overshoots and deliver many other social and environmental benefits, like clean air, green jobs and universal energy access." The report finds transformation towards net-zero emissions in electricity supply, industry, transportation and buildings is under way but needs to move much faster. Electricity supply is most advanced, as the costs of renewable electricity have reduced dramatically. "However, the pace of change must increase alongside measures to ensure a just transition and universal energy access," the report finds. Technology For buildings, the best available technologies need to be rapidly applied. For industry and transport, zero emission technology needs to be further developed and deployed, it says. "To advance the transformation, all sectors need to avoid lock in of new fossil fuel-intensive infrastructure; advance zero-carbon technology and apply it; and pursue behavioural changes," the report says. Food systems, accounting for about a third of global emissions, can reform to deliver rapid and lasting emissions cuts, it concludes, through "protection of natural ecosystems; demand-side dietary changes; improvements in food production at the farm level; and decarbonisation of food supply chains". "Governments can facilitate transformation by reforming subsidies and tax schemes. The private sector can reduce food loss and waste, use renewable energy and develop novel foods that cut down carbon emissions," the UNEP suggests. "Individual citizens can change their lifestyles to consume food for environmental sustainability and carbon reduction, which will also bring many health benefits." \</doc>

AN AWARD-winning wildlife photographer whose work has featured on 'Blue Planet' and 'Planet Earth' has praised the green agenda of Castlederg High School. Doug Allan, a Scottish wildlife cameraman who is best known for his work in polar regions and underwater, recently delivered a series of talks at venues across Northern Ireland, and took time out to met with pupils at Castlederg. Throughout his career, Doug, who celebrated his 70th birthday last year, has become concerned at the plight of the planet's wildlife and the environment, having witnessed first-hand the rapidly changing landscape of the polar regions. He fears many of the species he's captured on camera won't be around for future generations, and as such, the impact of climate change was at the forefront of his recent talks. During his visit to Castlederg High School, Doug met with a number of year groups, including AS and A-Level pupils, as well as the school's 'Eco-team', whose work helped the school become the worthy recipient of an 'Eco-School Green Flag' award. Speaking following his meeting with pupils, Doug said he was "extremely impressed" with the schools environmentally conscious pupils, who displayed a deep interest in his message and were keen to learn about how they could help fight climate change. "Having met with pupils, I am extremely impressed by school and the green agenda," Doug said. "It is clear that they are producing a positive opinion amongst youngsters who have become very mindful of their carbon footprint and the impacts of climate change. "I was particularly impressed by the school's Eco-Team, who have been doing their bit for the environment with litter picks, beach cleans and various other initiatives. It is no wonder they have been given the 'Eco-School Green Flag Award'. Having heard of their work, it is clear they are very worthy recipients. "During the talk we discussed ways to reduce our carbon footprint. For example, when it comes to buying things this Christmas, we should ask ourselves the question, does it have to be new, or could it be acquired second-hand? We need to be mindful of the emissions that go into making something, and how this can be reduced by reusing items. "I also spoke about how flying is damaging to the environment. Could a foreign holiday be replaced with somewhere closer to home? I also spoke about how some electricity suppliers use more renewable energy, and are more environmentally friendly, than others. I am pleased to say I have the pupils badgering their parents about that as well!" Throughout his 40-years as a wildlife photographer, where he has been frequently stationed at the North and South Pole, Doug has witnessed profound changes in the environment. He said that he doesn't need any scientists to tell him that the ice caps are melting - because he's been filming it for the past four decades. This is why he feels it is of utmost importance that world leaders and political representatives start taking the plight of climate change seriously. He continued: "It is reassuring to see the next generation taking a real interest in caring for the environment, yet it is frustrating that our political representatives cannot act in a similar manner. "It is clear that the pupils are as frustrated about this as I am. Action needs to be taken on climate change at the highest level, so for world leaders to have attended a two-week conference, COP27 , and come out with essentially nothing, is a complete failure. "The overall temperature of the world is expected to go up by 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels within the next five years, and this has an amplified impact on places like the North Pole, where a 5.5 degree rise is expect. "Unfortunately you can't negotiate with melting point of ice, it's fixed, and if a rise of a couple of degrees takes us past this melting point, it will be a tipping point for the environment and profound changes will take place. "It's difficult to know when this tipping point will happen, but once it is reached it will very hard to go back. Truthfully we needed a tipping point in human nature - only then will we start to get things done. There's ways to go I fear on that front." Doug concluded: "There was a massive environmental movement in the late 1960s and early 70s but then somehow we were all persuaded to turn our eyes away from it as life would be enrich\£ded through consumerism. "It's no use the UK saying they contribute just a small percentage to global warming as you need to remember our greenhouse gas emission figures don't include goods that are produced in China which are then shipped to the UK." {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell \</doc>

BY A remarkable coincidence, just as governments, campaigners and business owners are meeting in Egypt to address climate breakdown today, the world is officially crashing past the symbolic 8bn population milestone. This means global population is on its way to 10bn or more by the turn of the century. But there will be no attempt by countries at Cop27 to connect the inexorable growth of human numbers with the seemingly unstoppable rise in temperatures. Despite the fact that the several billion more people expected to be alive in 70 years will put more pressure on resources and will produce far more emissions, the population explosion is yet again being ignored, sidestepped, or denied by world leaders. Part of this is down to sensitivity about talking about human numbers. History is littered with violent governments trying to force sterilisation on vulnerable people. Suggestions, too, that human numbers be cut have often been peddled by authoritarian regimes and far-right extremists, and genuine concern today in rich countries is often met with accusations of racism or eco-fascism. Yet as the scientist James Lovelock was fond of saying, anyone who failed to see the connection between climate and population was "either ignorant or hiding from the truth", adding: "These two huge environmental problems are inseparable and to discuss one while ignoring the other is irrational." Until now, the orthodox Western intellectual argument has been that the number of people does not matter as much as how people use resources. Consumption and inequality are the problem, not population size. True, the wealthiest 10% consume about 20 times more energy overall than the bottom 10%. So of course, the rich must change their behaviour. But making climate breakdown all about consumption has become an excuse for countries to do nowhere near enough to reduce their populations. The hard fact is that in an age of climate breakdown, human numbers matter. And the ecological impact of another two to three billion humans will be immense. This is also about women's rights too. By ignoring population, the needs of women and girls are being sidelined by governments that are too obsessed with consumption to notice how vital education and family planning are in tackling the climate emergency. The Nobel peace prizewinner Malala Yousafzai summed it up best last year. "When girls are educated and when they stay in schools they get married later in their lives, then they have less children and that helps us to reduce the impacts of climate change that the population increase brings," she said. "If every girl was able to exercise her sexual and reproductive health and rights through quality education and had access to modern contraception, it could reduce total emissions." According to the UN population fund (UNFPA), 257m women have an unmet need for proper contraception, half of all global pregnancies are unplanned, and nearly a quarter of all women do not have enough agency to refuse sex. Yet the world's richest countries together contribute just a few hundred million dollars annually to the UN's population agency, with some now pushing "pro-natalist" policies to grow their numbers. In 2017, Donald Trump cut US funding to the UNFPA, and last year the UK followed, by cutting its contribution to the agency by 85%, from an expected $200m to a paltry $32m. US funding has since been partly restored but the British money alone, it has been estimated, would have helped to prevent the deaths of about 250,000 mothers and children, 14.6m unintended pregnancies and 4.3m unsafe abortions. The generations-long argument between those who uniquely blame overpopulation and those who maintain that consumption is the biggest contribution to the climate emergency must be ditched. Finally, and barely noticed, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's consensus of climate scientists, identified global population growth as one of the two biggest drivers of growing CO2 emissions, saying earlier this year that "globally, GDP per capita and population growth remained the strongest drivers of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the last decade". It also warned that if population continues to grow, "it will be much harder to limit warming to 1.5C". This should be proof enough for everyone that population growth and its future environmental impact are now twin global crises - and UN agencies and civil society groups meeting in Egypt must urgently recognise that both are driving planetary destruction, and poverty.

NEXT Tuesday, November 15, will be a milestone in our planet's history: there will be an estimated eight billion people on Earth - the largest number ever. Some think population growth is a thoroughly bad thing - David Attenborough has constantly preached that the environment is being destroyed by the proliferation of human beings. The philosopher Bertrand Russell hoped for some deadly virus that would wipe out swathes of humanity. The overpopulation guru Paul Ralph Ehrlich made a huge impact with his book The Population Bomb in 1968. He predicted that "hundreds of millions will starve in the 1970s" and that by the year 2000 "England will not exist". None of this has happened. As world population has grown, so has productivity, while standards of living have greatly improved. Since 1960, the global population increased by 75pc, but prices of the main commodities have fallen by the same 75pc, according to economists Marian Tupy and Gale Pooley in their recent book, Superabundance. The average life expectancy went from 52.6 years in 1960 to 72.4 years in 2017, and in most developed countries it is now over 80. Poverty has globally decreased, and so has world hunger: in four out of 10 African nations, obesity is now a bigger problem than undernourishment. So many of the improvements experienced over the past six decades are, according to these experts, a result of population growth. More people - especially younger people - offer more brains, more innovation, more problem-solving. More people mean more division of labour, which leads to more efficiency in production. In India in 1960, it took seven hours' labour to acquire a day's rice. Now it takes one hour, because of increased efficiency created by innovators. People, wrote the economist Julian Simon, are not a burden, but a resource. "The greater the population, the more likely it is that a creative mind will emerge to invent a solution to a pressing problem. As population grows, information accumulates and innovations accelerate." The climate change activists nearly all take the view that population increase is a bad thing because people use up the planet's resources. Some promote "denatalism" - discouraging people from having babies. Antinatalists such as Dana Wells and Sarah Conly in the US have been advocating either a childfree life or a one-child policy. Denatalism is already happening: in 89 countries or territories out of 300 surveyed, including Ireland, fertility has fallen below replacement level of 2.1 children. More younger people are already deciding to forgo having kids because of the climate emergency. However, a lack of children will mean a lack of new generations to solve the problems we face, or even to enrich society. Tupy and Pooley claim China would today be much richer if it hadn't enforced its one-child policy between 1980 and 2015 - often with brutal late abortions and infanticides. Irish history can certainly illuminate the woes of depopulation: it took more than 150 years to begin to recover from the famine that cruelly destroyed the population base. Even in the 1950s, there was huge concern about "the vanishing Irish" as the population of the Republic dipped below three million. Not coincidentally, a low population was accompanied by poverty and lack of opportunity. In contrast, Julian Simon wrote in his acclaimed book, The Ultimate Resource, that America benefitted from its ever-growing population - "immigrants made the US rich". People, he wrote, "skilled, spirited and hopeful" are needed to improve life for all of society. The authors of Superabundance regard some of the scaremongering and excesses of environmentalism as a form of secular religion (although they are themselves humanists). But the general decline in religious belief has, they suggest, created a psychological space for a new kind of faith - some "need for transcendence". Thus environmentalism has provided a return to a pagan nature-worship that prioritises "the planet" rather than the human life that makes it meaningful. Homo sapiens are about 300,000 years old: the brains of our primitive ancestors developed when farming was invented, a settled life made possible, and thus human society emerged. It was the interaction of people with one another that sparked the creativity and inventions of development. Yes, surely, we do need to address the crises in climate change, of carbon emissions and the pollution that we face. There's a lot we could change about our lifestyles, which have often been far too wasteful. Do we need all the plastic we dump in the oceans? Do we need to squander so much energy on throwaway stuff? But the solutions will come not from "the planet", but from the Earth's people reaching that congratulatory eight-billion mark next week. \</doc>

T HE Taoiseach will today meet British prime minister Rishi Sunak, which certainly augurs well for a better British-Irish understanding. Originally Michael Gove, one of the great meddlers in British politics and an ardent Brexiteer, was solely scheduled to lead the Westminster delegation at the British Irish Council (BIC) meeting in Blackpool. The new PM will meet the Taoiseach for about half an hour, and they will then join the formal dinner with leaders of the other assemblies that make up the BIC, including Nicola Sturgeon of Scotland, Mark Drakeford of Wales, and the heads of the Guernsey, Isle of Man and Jersey bodies. The Executive and Assembly of Northern Ireland will not be represented, as they literally can't get their act together. But the 'problem child' in the family will be the major topic of discussion between Miche\'e1l Martin and Rishi Sunak. The Taoiseach actually had a few moments with the new British prime minister in Sharm El Sheikh earlier this week, when both men attended and spoke at the COP27 climate-change conference in Egypt. The two men had a few introductory words, of no particular significance - but it would have served as a useful ice-breaker, if that is not an inappropriate allusion given the wider context. It was "very much an informal chat," a spokesman said. Mr Martin did not ask Mr Sunak to attend the British Irish Council at that accidental encounter, because the Irish side had just privately been told that the PM would be attending. It is a significant olive branch, since the occupants of No 10 have not attended the BIC meetings since the days of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, going back to the early days of the post-Good Friday Agreement peace process. The contrast with Liz Truss - who piloted legislation to abridge the Northern Ireland Protocol through the House of Commons, and who did not even telephone either Sturgeon or Drakeford during her short-lived premiership - could not be more stark. It effectively ends a go-italone UK attitude that has prevailed in many areas of Westminster since the Brexit referendum. The friendly gesture seems to point towards the necessary give-and-take that will be needed to achieve a resolution to the protocol row. Mr Sunak certainly does not need more distractions when he has larger fiscal fish to fry, and this latest Northern Ireland nitpicking really does have the potential to lead to an unwanted trade war with the EU. This was not just the case in British-Irish, but also in EU-UK relations, he said. Leaving aside the protocol row, which is preventing devolved government in the North because of the stance of the DUP, "there are a lot of important issues to work together on, including solidarity on Ukraine and the climate crisis." He added, as if butter wouldn't melt in his mouth: "The Taoiseach has had a good relationship with all the prime ministers he's dealt with." There have certainly been a few of those lately. It shows a willingness to work with others - whereas brusque Brandon Lewis, a political child of Boris Johnson as Northern Ireland Secretary, once publicly referred in Dublin to "vexatious" Irish claims. His career demise has not been mourned on Merrion Street. It may even be that Mr Sunak hopes to tie up a protocol deal for an early win, which would explain the stallthe-ball approach of current NI Secretary Chris Heaton- Harris - an old Brussels and Strasbourg colleague of Simon Coveney, when they were MEPs together. Suddenly all the stars and planets seem to be coming into alignment. Jeffrey Donaldson, for now, still wants to be alone. But bigger folk are moving along without him, and hopes are high. \</doc>

Donald Trump grabbed the election eve spotlight to flag an expected announcement on a new White House run, as the United States prepares to vote in midterms that polls show could land Congress back under Republican control. The former president, who has never accepted his 2020 loss, ratcheted up the hints that he would be entering the fray for 2024. "Not to detract from tomorrow's very important, even critical election... I'm going to be making a very big announcement on Tuesday, November 15 at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida," he told a cheering crowd in Ohio on the eve of polls that will determine control of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The brief mention, at the tail end of a typically dark, rambling speech, came as President Joe Biden made a final appeal in an election in which Republicans are well placed to win at least partial control of the levers of government. Even if Republicans win only the House of Representatives, that would scupper Mr Biden's legislative agenda for the last two years of his first term and potentially lead to a weakening of US support for Ukraine's resistance against Russia. Former US president Donald Trump grabbed the election eve spotlight to flag an expected announcement on a new run for the White House in 2024.He said he would make a 'very big announcement' next week | Read more: HYPERLINK https://t.co/BemV43AASs https://t.co/BemV43AASs HYPERLINK https://t.co/L3sGLBpmNv pic.twitter.com/L3sGLBpmNv HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/rtenews/status/1589893310495084544 November 8, 2022 "Our lifetimes are going to be shaped by what happens," Mr Biden told an enthusiastic crowd at a historically black university in Bowie, near Baltimore. "We know in our bones that our democracy is at risk and we know that this is your moment to defend it." "The power's in your hands," he told Democrats. "So vote, get out the vote." An influx of far-right Trump backers in Congress would also accelerate the shift that has been taking place inside the Republican Party ever since the former real estate tycoon stunned the world by defeating Hillary Clinton for the presidency in 2016. Despite facing criminal probes over taking top secret documents from the White House and trying to overturn the 2020 election, Mr Trump is now using the midterms to cement his status as the de facto Republican leader and presumptive presidential nominee. Last night's announcement was the closest the Republican has got to confirming his intention to run, building on his message last week that he "will very, very, very probably do it again". Lame duck? HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/news/us/2022/1108/1333806-us-election/ More than 40 million ballots had been cast through early voting , meaning the outcome was already taking shape before polls opened nationwide today. Mr Biden tried to remain upbeat during his closing address in Baltimore, but in a call with party allies yesterday he conceded that his dreams of keeping Congress, which Democrats currently control by a thin margin, amounted to a "very high expectation." Trump Republicans are "some of the darkest forces we've ever seen in our history," he said. Mr Biden's speech laid out what he said was "a choice between two very different visions of America," arguing that his administration has successfully steered the world's largest economy out of the Covid pandemic, with unemployment at 3.75% and manufacturing industries on the rise. Republicans, he said, would return to "trickle-down economics" that favor the rich. Polls show that Republican messaging emphasising four-decades-high inflation, crime and illegal immigration has left voters in an angry mood. As the party controlling the White House and - albeit barely - Congress, the Democrats are likely to get punished. Returning to the White House, Mr Biden told reporters he believed Democrats would win the Senate - though he conceded "it's going to be tough" to keep control of the House". If Democrats can't even hold the Senate, then Mr Biden would find himself in a state of constant political warfare in Washington. There would also be immediate, harsh questions over whether the president, who turns 80 this month, should seek a second term or give way to a younger party member. Mr Biden's entire agenda would go into deep freeze. That would raise questions over everything from climate crisis policies, which the president will be laying out at the COP27 conference in Egypt this week, to Ukraine, where Republicans are reluctant to maintain the current rate of US financial and military support. While insisting he supports Ukraine's struggle, Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told CNN there could be no "blank cheque" - a nod to the isolationist Trump wing of his party and a signal likely sending shivers through Kyiv. Adding to tensions - and a reminder of Russia's murky role throughout Trump-era US politics - Kremlin-connected oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin boasted that Russia was trying to tilt the outcome. \</doc>

Profoundly difficult challenges lie ahead  it\' s time to start finding things we all agree on, writes Sheilagh Foley There has been a lot of talk lately about unity. The British united in grief when Queen Elizabeth II passed away; meanwhile the United States of America are falling apart as they battle for control of their government. This brings us neatly to a topical question  a United Ireland? If we have learned anything from the above examples, it\' s that death and ineffable sadness are a thumbs up for unity, whereas voting and orange former leaders are a buzzkill. I am in London at the moment, staying near Kensington Palace. Not in the palace, but a stone\' s throw away. I don\' t know this because I spend my time lobbing stones at the palace while singing rebel songs. It\' s an estimation based on some eye squinting I did as I sipped my English breakfast tea on a cold morning on Bayswater Road. I married a Brit, some of my best friends are British, and like a lot of good Irish before me, I spent my 20s living in Londontown. I regularly return to see family and friends, and to attend hospital appointments. I feel I have a good sense of the inner workings of your average Briton. Firstly, I don\' t think they ever refer to themselves as \' Britons\'  I like to use the parlance of Roman times, keeps me relevant with the kids, innit?! Manners and \' doing the right thing\' play a large role in British society. People queued quietly for days to pay their respects to the Queen. Could such a thing happen anywhere else? I\' m not so sure, unless random violence, heavy drinking, loud singing, and general pranking were allowed. Could you imagine the Irish equivalent of the Queen dying? Forgive me, but I\' m at a loss as to who that could be. I want to say Gay Byrne, but he has sadly passed away (and anyone under 25 may not realise he was a beloved national treasure.) If we can\' t find a national figure whose imminent death we can all rally around, can we at least decide on one thing we all agree on? (Apart from the fact that Club Milks taste different now than they did when we were kids maybe that\' s just a me thing.) I suppose the vast majority of us do enjoy a cup of tea. Though that\' s not just an Irish thing, as 100 million cups of tea a day are drunk by the British/Britons. Well, at least we\' re not flailing around a political quagmire keeping our fingers crossed that a clown doesn\' t get into office. Hmm, maybe we\' re more similar than we think. The insightful academic futurist Nouriel Roubini has coined the term \' megathreats\' to highlight impending problems that could change the face of the earth and wipe that colour off your flag. According to Roubini, we are faced with the highest private and public debt ratios of all time, inflation is rising as a recession sets in, and an ageing population threatens to crash our healthcare and pension systems. To put it concisely: we\' re screwed! Cheap money is dead in the septic water. Crypto and property bubbles are at bursting point. AI will likely lead to permanent unemployment in ever-expanding fields. This landscape sets the scene for a rise in dangerous populist regimes. Aside from cyber wars, we have an actual war in Ukraine, and cold wars escalating between China and Taiwan, and Iran and Israel, to name a few. The biggest megathreat is of course climate change (as discussed recently at COP27 ). Roubini thinks a dystopian future is likely (cheery chap)  a moderate worry for us, a living nightmare for our grandchildren. Maybe it\' s time for some tea.

AS the drought crisis deepens and food gets scarcer, women in Kenya are resorting to the gastric band of the starving. They wrap their waists tight to stifle the hunger pangs that rattle their empty stomachs so that the children can have whatever meagre meal can be found. So tight that at times they cause themselves injury and the trauma leaves them unable to eat when food aid arrives. Susan Otieno describes the practice to explain the impacts of the crisis not immediately obvious to outsiders. "Hunger does not affect all equally," she says. "If you want to understand hunger, if you want to understand poverty, if you want to understand distress, look at the women and the children." Ms Otieno, executive director of ActionAid in Kenya, was in Dublin to meet her ActionAid Ireland colleagues who have helped form the Irish Emergency Alliance to rally support for millions of people in Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia hit by the devastating drought. The situation is dire after four failed rainy seasons in succession. In recent weeks, the international response has increased, but so too have the numbers affected and the complexity of their needs. The drought has not only brought hunger - it has unwound hard-won improvements in the rights and standing of women and girls. Girls are the first to be pulled from school in a crisis and are at risk of being married off as child brides by desperate fathers tempted by a dowry. "For this girl, hunger is only the start of her problems. She has lost her education, she has lost all her opportunities," Ms Otieno says. Once married in this traditional way, it becomes her responsibility to bring something to the table and she will eat last, if at all, so the cycle repeats itself. Ms Otieno's message is a challenge to the conventional response to such situations. Countries that send emergency aid can help prevent widespread famine - and their support is critical right now - but how do you turn back time to restore this girl's future? Ms Otieno herself feels just a step away from the discrimination facing women in traditional communities. "If I did not go to school I would have had a different life. I saw my aunties, my father's sisters, face this situation. "I was lucky. How about a baby girl in the pastoralist community? She can not decide for herself." The answer, Otieno says, is to ensure that women are fully involved in the current response and the rebuilding that will hopefully follow. Areas where ActionAid works have withstood the drought better than many, with market gardens, drought-resistant crops, food storage schemes and supplementary livelihoods reducing the vulnerability that comes with dependence on livestock. These programmes are run primarily by women. "In a patriarchal society, however, as much as a man will be suffering, they still remain at the top. "If we bring women into the programmes, they bring in the real experience and they also bring in real solutions that will work for everyone." Changing mindsets in traditional communities takes time but changing attitudes in the international community is an even greater challenge. The Horn of Africa is prone to periodic droughts but they are now much more frequent, more intense and longer. It is a deadly illustration of climate change in action. ActionAid is pushing for sustained financial support from the global north to tackle the impacts of climate change in countries such as Kenya. This is the controversial 'loss and damage' funding argument that Ms Otieno hopes will feature large on the agenda of the upcoming UN climate summit, Cop27 , in Egypt in November. "Unfortunately, it is an unpalatable subject because the global north does not want to take responsibility. "But as this crisis shows, there is a cost to providing emergency intervention. It is better to spend on prevention. "If we wait to only respond when there is a crisis, we lose time and we lose lives. And we lose the gains that have been made, especially for women."

The strategist Frank Luntz invented the phrase "climate change" for the George W Bush administration in the United States. "While global warming has catastrophic communications attached to it, climate change sounds a more controllable and less emotional challenge", he advised. Almost 20 years on a warming world is increasingly looking dangerously uncontrollable. This has not been helped by a turbulent 2022 for geopolitics and energy costs. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has rattled Europe and the western world. It is impacting on a vast number of people away from the cauldron of war. They are wrestling with an energy crisis that comes with appalling uncertainty. High gas and electricity prices are combining with rising inflation and soaring interest rates, resulting in a cost-of-living calamity for many. It has exposed Ireland's weak energy security due to heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels, while a combination of increasing electricity demand and lack of generation capacity has increased the possibility of power cuts this winter. For many developing world countries, soaring food prices and shortages of basic commodities has brought heightened risk of famine, which is already hitting the Horn of Africa. Invariably these are places vulnerable to extreme weather events made worse by global warming. This unexpected set of circumstances risks diverting global attention to worsening climate disruption. The northern hemisphere this summer witnessed unrelenting heatwaves, wildfires and extreme flooding demonstrably made worse by climate change. It is knocking off course efforts to scale up renewables and get off fossil fuels. It is casting a shadow over the Cop27 climate negotiations in Egypt to be hosted by the UN during November, though it is an opportunity to reassert commitments to key Paris Agreement targets and for economies to double down on pursuing sustainability. Big power blocks have led the way, notably the EU, while US president Joe Biden has managed to finally get the Inflation Reduction Act across the line, which he described as the "biggest step forward on climate ever". We have, however, used up too much of our first carbon budget (2021-2025). There is no room for further delays on action across all sectors. On a happier note, needless restrictions that hindered scale-up of solar have been unblocked. It means unlimited numbers of PV panels can be installed on houses, farm buildings, schools, community centres and non-domestic buildings without planning permission - with some restrictions near airports and hospitals with helipads. A report by MaREI research centre at University College Cork concluded that 1 million homes had the potential for six solar panels. A typical household in Dublin with six (2.4 kW) solar panels could generate over one third of their annual electricity and save EUR 380 a year in electricity bills, with the system paying back for itself in seven years. Current market trends suggest an even quicker payback. Policymakers, politicians, government departments and State bodies are engaged in addressing the interlinked crises on climate, biodiversity loss and energy but collaboration, adoption of known solutions and innovation are not sufficiently to the fore. In contrast, the corporate world is fully embracing the sustainability agenda - even if greenwashing by some is all too evident. The same applies to small businesses, communities, progressive farmers, major food co-ops and individuals. "There is real understanding of the urgency of the topic even if people don't fully understand the complexity," Dr Katharine Steentjes of Centre for Climate Change and Social Transformations at Cardiff University noted at the recent Environment Ireland conference. Opinion polls confirm repeatedly the public's wish for bolder action but the delivery system in Ireland continues to be painfully slow. \</doc>

As the COP27 climate change conference concludes in Egypt this week, the attention of climate experts is turning to the football World Cup in Qatar, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East. Organisers have claimed that the tournament, which begins with an opening ceremony in the Al Bayt stadium on Sunday, will be environmentally friendly and carbon neutral. However, some climatologists are expressing doubts over those claims. The Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy is the body responsible for the success of the World Cup in Qatar, a tournament like no other in terms of the criticism it has faced because of the Gulf state's human rights record. In an effort to prove their environmental credentials, Qatar and FIFA have pledged that this World Cup will be carbon neutral, a claim that many people are questioning. The first World Cup to be held in the Middle East will need at least 10,000 litres of water every day for each of its stadium pitches and the more than 130 additional training grounds. World Football's governing body, FIFA, and Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy said they have committed to reducing and offsetting all carbon emissions related to the games, which begin on Sunday when the hosts play Ecuador, and that they plan to have a carbon neutral World Cup. However, many people dispute those claims. Professor John Sweeney of Maynooth University told RT\'c9 News that it was not a sensible decision from a climate point of view to have the World Cup in such a hot country, even in winter. The water demands alone are huge. The tournament will need to manage pitches across eight stadiums, and more than 130 additional training grounds. Professor Sweeney is a climatologist who is querying the carbon neutral claims. "Well, I think claims of carbon neutrality really depend on what you measure, when you measure it, and how you measure it. And in this particular case, there's an awful lot of embedded carbon in the stadia that they're building. But in reality, they're not counting everything that they should be counting." Qatar, with a population of over three million, is one of the world's richest countries thanks to oil and gas exports. The World Cup will bring an invasion of visitors that will stretch the Gulf state's resources to the limit. "And of course, there's a great deal of accommodation pressure in Qatar, which means a lot of people are commuting to the World Cup from nearby countries. "These flights, and I believe there's about 60 commuter flights a day as reported into Qatar, these are not counted in any shape or form because they're in international airspace, and they themselves would render that claim of carbon neutrality fairly dubious. "In addition, I think the Qatari government are claiming they're going to plant a lot of trees. "Now one wonders how you grow trees in a desert, especially without a large commitment to water and to desalinated water, which is produced from energy consumption elsewhere. "So as well as that of course, trees will not be sequestering carbon at all for several years. "So a lot of the calculations, I think, are a bit creative in their accounting around a small four-week period. "And the reality I think, is that if we were to be really strict on counting carbon for the World Cup, I think that claim of carbon neutrality wouldn't hold up essentially." Barry O'Sullivan is an Irish Engineering Director, who has worked in Qatar for nearly 14 years. He told RT\'c9 News he feels that the Arab world deserves a World Cup and that technology can help make it sustainable. "It is called a 'World Cup' and much of the Arab world is a desert and a lot of the projects that have been done, it\' s not just the stadiums it's the metros, the roads, the walkways, the cycle paths it's going to be here forever for the community to enjoy as a whole. "Qatar's water comes from desalinated plants and obviously the cost of energy for them to achieve that is much less than what it would be in other areas of the world. "They've constructed massive solar plants now to do that in a sustainable fashion. "I think one of the things when you work with people here you get a multicultural environment, you get people coming in and they don't know what sustainability means, they don't know what health and safety is. There are some positive aspects in the area of public transport, according to Professor John Sweeney. "They've built a very good public transport system in the meantime, and there's also a dismantlable stadium, which is, to some extent good." \</doc>

Ireland's ranking in addressing the climate crisis has recorded its most significant improvement by rising nine spots to 37th, although it is still among "low-performing countries", the 2023 Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) states. The low ranking is mainly due to Ireland's rising greenhouse gas emissions and a high level of per capita emissions. Ireland receives a medium rating in renewable energy and energy use categories, with a low rating in climate policy and a low rating in emissions. The report acknowledges significant progress, with Ireland committed to reducing emissions by 51 per cent by 2030 (compared to 2018 levels) and achieving net-zero emissions by no later than 2050. "Despite these goals, Ireland's emissions are rising and have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels," it states. Carbon budgets The CCPI welcomes the introduction by the Government of legally-binding carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings this year. "However, Government implementation remains weak with necessary actions and measures delayed or ignored in many areas," it concludes. The index analyses and compares climate actions and policies across 60 countries including the EU as a whole, which accounts for 90 per cent of global emissions. It is regarded as the most reliable indicator of countries' response to the climate emergency, and has been published yearly since 2005. It has also played a leading role in setting out progress on implementing the Paris Agreement. It is compiled by Germanwatch, NewClimate Institute and Climate Action Network. The CCPI say policy improvements "urgently need to be translated into substantive actions across all relevant sectors to actually reduce Ireland's emissions". It notes use of coal in power generation has increased, while the country's agricultural policies "continue to support intensification of livestock farming, which increases GHG emissions, harms water and air quality, and is a primary contributor to biodiversity loss in Ireland". It highlights the need to reduce use of reactive (chemical) nitrogen in fertiliser and to pay for ecosystem services. Government plans for offshore wind are substantial, and new schemes have been introduced in transport, microgeneration and energy efficiency, it adds. "Energy retrofits and solar photovoltaics are not being delivered at the necessary scale and not reaching those most at risk of energy poverty," it says. "Fossil gas infrastructure and gas connections are also still being promoted. The Government has accelerated the phase-out of peat in power generation and committed to supporting peatland restoration and rehabilitation." Peat extraction The CCPI, however, criticises continuing peat extraction from wetlands for horticultural use and export. National experts who contributed to the policy evaluation of this year's CCPI chose to remain anonymous. Speaking at Cop27 "But our overall low rating reflects the fact that our emissions are still rising and the Government's adoption and implementation of policies and measures to cut pollution is still far too slow. "Ireland's first action plan under the new Climate Act is due to be adopted by Government before the changeover of Taoiseach in December. [It] is now the litmus test of our determination to shed the 'laggard' label that has dogged us for good, and do our fair share to contain climate breakdown," she said. Denmark, Sweden, Chile, Morocco and India lead the ranking this year while Iran, Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan come last. The US and China, the world's biggest emitters, perform " low" - though the US rises three ranks compared with last year, whilst China drops 13 places. The top three places again remain vacant because no country's measures, thus far, have been sufficient to achieve an overall " high" rating with none following a path necessary to keep global warming within the 1.5 degree limit. "The current energy crisis clearly demonstrates how the world remains dependent on fossil fuels. However, there is a number of countries that have a better standing than others. They took ambitious steps in climate mitigation and rapidly developed energy efficiency and renewable energies," it says. The good news is that in the last years, countries such as Chile, Morocco and India (ranked six to eight) have consistently performed well in the CCPI and are closing in on leading countries such as Denmark and Sweden (ranked four and five). CCPI co-author Prof Niklas H\'f6hne of the NCI said: "The energy crisis shows that ambitious climate mitigation is the most reasonable way to move forward economically: all countries should make themselves independent of coal, oil and gas. "Renewable energy is globally less expensive than any newly built fossil power plant, and investments in energy efficiency are an essential part on the way to carbon neutrality. Denmark, Sweden and Norway demonstrate what a rapid and sustainable expansion of renewables can look like." Jan Burck (Germanwatch), another CCPI author, added: "It's a moment of truth: how serious are countries about their climate commitments?" \</doc>

THE Government's most recent progress update on its housing plan Housing For All shows little to give hope to those already locked out of the market. Homelessness remains at record highs and the changing economic situation of inflation and rising interest rates are putting people under even greater pressure. The Government continues to claim that it will solve the housing crisis by using the same failed policies of an overreliance on the private market to deliver housing. Housing For All promised an increased delivery of social and affordable housing, but in reality, when you ploughed through the detail, it had that fundamental flaw at its core. Each year, of the 12bn to go into finance new housing, 10bn, is expected to come from private sector and just 2bn, or 16, from the State. The market is the dominant financier, and therefore, delivery mechanism for new housing in Government policy. Housing For All is a market-driven plan and that approach is leading us to an even deeper housing disaster as the private housing market jitters as private developers are deciding to delay or mothball new house building. A statistic that wasn't given any coverage in the update report is that new home commencements have actually dropped: They were 10 lower in the last 12 months. The ESRI highlighted this recently and has forecast housing delivery to fall in 2023. This is red flashing sirens time. The reason we are in this housing emergency is that successive governments have handed housing delivery over to the market - to the private developers, and investor funds to provide housing. But the market does not deliver housing to meet actual housing need. It builds when it can make a sufficient profit - it responds to a demand that gives it a big return. When those profit calculations change, they stop building. So now as building costs rise due to inflation and potential buyers are struggling to access finance and save deposits, developers are likely to slow down construction. The dysfunction and illogical decision to rely on the private market is going to be illustrated further. Our need for homes has never been higher. Yet the market is reducing its building. And this is what Government policy remains wedded to promoting. And in the area of vacancy and dereliction, the private property market is shown also to be negligent. There are 166,000 vacant homes, and tens of thousands of derelict properties. This hoarding of property in a housing shortage is akin to hoarding food in a famine. Yet Government policy is woefully inadequate in tackling it. These progress updates are frustrating. They repeatedly present targets and claim they were met, moving the goalposts as suits. Just 5,000 new social homes were delivered last year, some 4,000 below the initial 9,000 target. That missed target should be added to this year's goal, but that hasn't been the case. Even worse, they don't acknowledge just 1,500 social homes were delivered in the first half of this year. In terms of affordable housing the delivery is even more disappointing. Just 234 affordable cost rental homes have been delivered, and less than 100 affordable purchase homes. Cop27 is highlighting the other emergency: Climate. And I have shown that through housing we can really address these twin emergencies. Yet there is no acknowledgment that the cost-ofliving crisis will make it more difficult for people to afford to retrofit, and the Government's targets for social housing and private rental retrofitting are simply tiny in scale in contrast with the social and environmental catastrophe facing us. I was Blindboy's guest at Vicar Street recently for his live podcast and the audience was mainly young people in their 20s and 30s. They asked where is the hope. Should they just emigrate? I said there is hope, and they have a right to a future in their country. The hope is in the attitude change to housing that is underway across Irish society. People want property to be treated as a home not an investment asset. They want renters to have a secure affordable home, for rent reduction measures, for removing the ability of landlords to evict tenants on sale, for vacancy and dereliction to be properly tackled with radical measures like Barcelona's use it or lose it policies. Housing For All was flawed from the outset, it is now being exposed badly, and the housing crisis will worsen without a new housing plan based on putting the state central to ensuring affordable green homes for all. As a society, we cannot just accept or tolerate this crisis any longer. We must raise our voices together.  Rory Hearne will be speaking about his new book Gaffs , in conversation with Irish Examiner News Editor Deirdre O'Shaughnessy in Waterstones, St Patrick's St, Cork, on Wednesday, November 9, at 7pm. \</doc>

C LIMATE change is a global problem that requires co-operation between all nations. That's why today more than 30 newspapers and media organisations in more than 20 countries have taken a common view about what needs to be done. Time is running out. Rather than getting out of fossil fuels and into clean energy, many wealthy nations are reinvesting in oil and gas, failing to cut emissions fast enough and haggling over the aid they are prepared to send to poor countries. All this while the planet hurtles towards the point of no return - where climate chaos becomes irreversible. Since the COP26 UN climate summit in Glasgow 12 months ago, countries have only promised to do one-fiftieth of what is needed to stay on track to keep temperatures within 1.5C of pre-industrial HYPERLINK http://www.levels.No www.levels.No continent has avoided extreme weather disasters this year - from floods in Pakistan to heatwaves in Europe, and from forest fires in Australia to hurricanes in the US. Given that these came about from elevated temperatures of about 1.1C, the world can expect far worse to come. As many nations seek to reduce their reliance on The world's poorest people will bear the brunt of the destruction wrought by drought, melting ice sheets and crop failures. To shield these groups from the loss of life and livelihoods will require money. Developing countries, says one influential report, need $2 trillion annually to cut their greenhouse gas emissions and cope with climate breakdown. Rich countries account for just one in eight people in the world today but are responsible for half of greenhouse gases. These nations have a clear moral responsibility to help. Developing nations should be given enough cash to address the dangerous conditions they did little to create - especially as a global recession looms. Rich nations should deliver on the promise of previously committed funds - such as the $100bn a year from 2020 - to signal their seriousness. As a bare minimum, a windfall tax on the combined profits of the largest oil and gas companies - estimated at almost $100bn in the first three months of the year - needs to be enacted. The United Nations was right to call for the cash to be used to support the most vulnerable. But such a levy would only be the start. Poor nations also carry debts that make it impossible to recover after climate-related disasters or protect themselves from future ones. Creditors should be generous in writing off loans for those on the frontline of the climate emergency. These measures need not wait for co-ordinated international action. Countries could implement them on regional or national levels. A nation's cumulative emissions must be the basis of its responsibility to act. But an economic crisis has reduced rich countries' appetite for spending and the planet risks being trapped in fossil-fuel-dependence by a rearguard action of big business. Yet during the pandemic central banks across the world lubricated states' expenditure by buying up their own governments' bonds. The trillions of dollars needed to deal with the ecological emergency demands such radical thinking returns. This is no time for apathy or complacency; the urgency of the moment is upon us. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change must be about the power of argument, not the argument of power. Key to maintaining the consensus in Egypt is not to let disputes over trade and war in Ukraine block global climate diplomacy. The UN process may not be perfect. But it has provided nations with a target to save the planet, which must be pursued at COP27 to stave off an existential risk to humanity.

Leaders of the Group of Seven rich nations will be under pressure to stick to climate pledges in Bavaria from today, as Russia's energy cuts trigger a dash back to planet-heating fossil fuels. Germany finds itself in an awkward position as G7 summit host, having recently announced that Europe's biggest economy will burn more coal to offset a drop in Russian gas supplies amid deteriorating ties over the war in Ukraine. Chancellor Olaf Scholz nevertheless insists the G7 remains committed to the Paris agreement of limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. But concerns are growing that Mr Scholz will use the gathering to push G7 partners to water down a previous promise to stop financing gas and oil projects abroad by the end of the year. "That would be a real setback," said Alden Meyer, a senior associate at climate policy think tank E3G. "Scholz could go down in history as the climate backtracking chancellor." US President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and their counterparts from the UK, Italy, Canada and Japan will all be joining Mr Scholz at the luxurious Elmau Castle from today until Tuesday. Thousands of people marched in the city of Munich on the eve of the summit to urge G7 leaders to do more to fight climate change. With the impact of the climate crisis already being felt across the globe through devastating floods, rising seas and crop-wilting droughts, the summit will be closely watched for fresh funding pledges to help poor nations cope. But hopes of a breakthrough are low, as the conflict in Ukraine dominates the agenda and Western attention shifts to the vast sums that will be needed to rebuild the country. "Before the war there was a clear intent, also from Germany, to really deliver on climate finance and this seems off the table now," said Susanne Droege, a climate policy analyst at Germany's Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP). Soaring energy prices and fears that Moscow could abruptly cut off supplies have left European nations scrambling to wean themselves off Russian oil, coal and gas. With renewables like solar and wind power not yet a widely available alternative, countries including Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria are reverting to fossil fuels to plug the gap. German Energy Minister Robert Habeck, a Green party politician, called the decision to reactivate mothballed coal-fired plants "bitter" but necessary for energy security. He stressed that Germany was still on track to close its coal plants by 2030 and remained committed to a massive shift towards renewable energy. Ms Droege said Russia's aggression in Ukraine had exposed the risks of fossil fuel dependency. "The only benefit of this war is that... understanding has increased that renewable sources of energy will pay off," said Ms Droege. Environmentalists say a key focus of the G7 climate talks should be on helping the most vulnerable nations that are already bearing the brunt of the climate emergency. "In the Horn of Africa, a terrible drought is leaving over 18 million people suffering from food insecurity," Ugandan youth activist Vanessa Nakate told reporters ahead of the summit. "We are tired of empty promises. We need the G7 countries to put money on the table for loss and damage." Mr Scholz himself aims to launch a "climate club" that would see willing nations agree to play by the same rules to avoid competitive disadvantages. This could include setting carbon pricing standards or uniform regulations on what constitutes green hydrogen. Japan and the United States however have no plans to introduce a national carbon price. Observers say strong signals are needed from the G7 ahead of the United Nations COP27 climate talks in Egypt in November. The final G7 statement will be scoured for any walking back of previous pledges, including a promise to largely decarbonise their countries' electricity sectors by 2035. A long-standing promise by wealthy nations to spend $100bn a year from 2020 to help developing countries adapt to climate change remains unmet. \</doc>

Sometime in the coming days - probably on Tuesday, November 15th \£d- the world's population will reach eight billion. It continues to increase by roughly 140 people per minute, with births outweighing deaths in most countries. The issue is already surfacing at Cop27 in Egypt as 196 countries are attempting to find ways to curb temperatures on a rapidly warming planet. "Explosive population growth to 8 billion sees a 19 billion tonne CO2 spike" was the take of NGO Population Matters - highlighting increasing population as one of the largest factors driving record levels of carbon emissions. It is easy to catastrophise and say planet Earth cannot cope with a relentless rise in global citizens at a time of climate breakdown and collapse in nature - when human activity is the dominant influence on the environment. But it is a complex issue not helped by false claims that "the world population is accelerating towards collapse" - one of Twitter boss Elon Musk's infamous tweets on the issue - and hysteria and ignorance surrounding demographic trends, including talk of closing borders from populist leaders in autocratic countries. Most experts agree population increases will continue, albeit at an ever-decreasing rate, until the Earth's population reaches its ceiling, pauses and begins to contract, according to the 2022 World Population Review (WPR). Steadily improving global standards of living are responsible for decreasing rates of population increase. As wealth and quality of life increase, they contend, the average family size will shrink and population growth will steadily slow and eventually stop. However, others maintain poverty, inequality and urbanisation will cause a growth increase, particularly in countries in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia, where population growth is already much higher than the global average. Still others predict a decrease stemming from much bleaker causes, ie the current world population is unsustainable in the long term and natural resources are insufficient to feed such a large population or sustain the global economy at its current scale. The rate of population growth has been slowing. This trend is expected to continue until the rate of population growth reaches zero (an equal number of births and deaths) in about 2080-2100, peaking at about 10.4 billion people, WPR predicts. Tracking the exact number of births and deaths in every country and territory in real time - and maintaining a precise tally at any given moment - is logistically infeasible. Instead, population scientists use sophisticated mathematical models to create detailed estimates and projections, which countries can use to plan for future generations. China is currently the most populous country in the world with an estimated 1.42 billion people. India, with a population estimated to be 1.41 billion people, is expected to be the most populous country by 2030. Greying world Global life expectancy reached 72.8 years in 2019 - almost nine years longer than in 1990. This is projected to reach 77.2 years by 2050. Significant factors boosting life expectancy include ability to reduce Aids/HIV impacts and other infectious and non-communicable diseases. As a result, most countries are seeing considerable growth in people over 65. The percentage of over-65s is projected to rise from 10 per cent in 2022 to 16 per cent in 2050; twice the number of children aged under five. While the world is struggling with huge inequality, the climate crisis, and conflict-fuelled displacement and migration, it should not engage in "population alarmism", Dr Natalia Kanem, director of the UN Population Fund, warned in advance of reaching the eight billion milestone. She urged countries not to panic but instead focus on helping women, children and marginalised people who are most vulnerable to demographic change. "I realise this moment might not be celebrated by all. Some express concerns that our world is overpopulated, with far too many people and insufficient resources to sustain their lives. I am here to say clearly that the sheer number of human lives is not a cause for fear," she said. Trinity College Dublin professor in geography P\'e1draig Carmody dismisses talk of an out-of-control population surge because, he says, debate can become racialised and the reality is more nuanced. Africa is in many ways the continent that reveals most about the complexities and challenges of population growth. About 70 per cent of its population is under 30. The average (median) age on the continent is 19.7. By some estimates, by the end of the century, four out of 10 people on Earth, based on current trends, will be African - 17 per cent of the global population. "That's a huge level of growth," he says, though it can bring big opportunities. Africa, he adds, is actually in a "slow - some would say stalled - demographic transition". This in the context of the demographic transition theory, ie when societies progress from a pre-modern regime of high fertility and high mortality to a post-modern regime of low fertility and low mortality. African population trends are highly differentiated, he notes. The fertility rate per woman is still more than four; in some countries it's six. "Some countries seem to be going through a more rapid demographic transition. Others have stalled," he explains. It very much depends on economic development; women's empowerment, availability of contraception and related knowledge, education/literacy levels and extent of urbanisation. It is the last continent that is still primarily rural, though an urban revolution is beginning to take hold. The population policy of governments is a big factor. In Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni has "a kind of pro-natalist policy, believing Uganda will be a strong country if it has a big population. He has encouraged a higher birth rate and they've also had a very generous refugee immigration policy." But Carmody stresses: "I don't think population is the biggest problem we're facing globally." Rwanda has had a very rapid decline in fertility rate driven by government directive. "They've really pushed the family size reduction and contraception as part of their economic development strategy." People talk a lot about "technological overpopulation", he adds, "the idea that it's people like you and me who are the problem driving our cars, consuming a lot of energy and resources". That doesn't apply to Africa. Its carbon footprint is still within planetary boundaries, he points out - accounting for just 4 per cent of global emissions. "Very rapid population growth is a big problem, particularly if you have very limited resources to provide housing, infrastructure, food, all of those kinds of things that populations need," Carmody says. But there are upsides from population growth too. It can spark innovation, forcing change in doing things differently. It "is symptomatic of poverty largely. And it's not primarily a cause of some of the big environmental problems". Africa generates fewer than two tonnes of carbon per annum per person, which is sustainable. Though South Africa, because of dependence on coal, and Nigeria, being a big oil and gas state, are big emitters, most African economies are green economies. They have high levels of poverty that feed into high levels of population growth and resource overconsumption, as well as problems such as lack of housing - damaging the ecological footprint of cities and their hinterlands. Dependency ratio There is huge contrast with what is happening in China, which is encountering a dramatically increased dependency ratio because of its one-child policy. "That's going to be a massive problem for China going forward, that there aren't a lot of people of working age to support a greying population," Carmody adds. These big issues, he suggests, call into question "hard border philosophies" applied in some parts of Europe and China, when they require more workers while other countries have surplus labour. Many European countries, such as Italy, have shrinking populations, yet its new prime minister Giorgia Meloni has talked about instituting a naval blockade based on the Trump mantra "a nation without borders is not a nation" - and during the Ukraine crisis some border guards in Poland reportedly stopped black people while letting white people through without much problem. The US department of defence some years ago highlighted risks from the "youth bulge" in the developing world leading to poverty and unemployment, warning it was fertile ground for radicalisation. Carmody believes it's fundamentally an economic issue, while people will respond to financial incentives. "But again, you have to think about what factors produce rapid population growth." Population is among "the grand challenges", but largely driven by other trends, so humanity should be more concerned with mitigating climate disruption and trying to create decent jobs. Ireland is an exception in the developed world because of its population growth, the proportion of its young people and high fertility rate, confirms Mary Gilmartin, professor of geography at Maynooth University. CSO projections suggest sustained increases in population over the next 30 years; rising to 5.6-6.7 million by 2050 - it uses a variety of models using different birth and migration rate scenarios. The State's population will age due to reduced fertility, she says, but will take time to catch up with the rest of Europe in the second half of the century. Population fall will be due to economic factors; concerns about a place to live and uncertainty. As Ireland ages, this will change "the dependency ratio" with fewer people to support people not working. Equally, reunification of Ireland, if it happens, is likely to have a significant impact on population structure and profile, she says. "We have seen concern about population affecting fertility rate for decades," Gilmartin says - worry about the planet including the climate crisis is likely to be a contributing factor, she accepts, though that is hard to quantify. Migration Continuing net inward migration will be a positive, she predicts, as immigrants are younger, pay taxes, join the workforce and fill gaps in services, contributing to society and balancing the country's age mix. But Gilmartin says there are indications people want to emigrate at levels she has not seen before - which is reflected among students in her classes. The reasons they cite are cost of living and housing, "though they face these issues in most of the traditional locations they are planning to go, ie to English-speaking countries". While all might not leave, she believes this is possibly due to "less hope" compared to previously. On whether the national plan - a blueprint for 2040 - needs a radical overhaul, she points to poor planning when factoring in rising population up to now, where "the healthcare system has not kept pace with population increase at all"; there are struggles in education including third level and planning for housing, which has been "a disaster". Urban development has been a failure with, for instance, hotels and student accommodation blocks being built in Dublin city centre rather than permanent places to live, Gilmartin says. While transport planning has slightly improved, overall "planning for population growth has not been coherent and has not been effective enough". The milestone of "the eight billionth member of our human family" being born raises immense issues about living within planetary bounders; how best to tip the balance towards halting emissions and containing global temperature rise so risk of catastrophic climate breakdown is minimised. That includes a transition to sustainable growth where wellbeing and basic standards of living have greater priority across the world. What UN secretary-general Ant\'f3nio Guterres said at Cop27 in the context of climate action equally applies to population: "How will we answer when 'Baby Eight Billion' is old enough to ask: What did you do for our world - and for our planet - when you had the chance?" \</doc>

Apparently scientists have just discovered a new 1.5km-sized asteroid, named 2022 AP7, whose orbit has until now lain hidden from Earth by the sun. The comforting thought is that we are completely safe from an Earth-strike, apparently, for at least a good few centuries by which time we hope that our Earthling descendants will have found some technological means to deflect or destroy it before it destroys them. That's a comforting thought unless, that is, we haven't destroyed ourselves in the meantime. The simile with disastrous collision with space objects leaps to mind when we reflect on the narrow shave that the civilised world has had in the last week from a scenario in which President Xi Jinping, Boris Johnson and Jair Bolsonaro were all re-elected in advance of the Trump-dominated Republicans capturing both houses in the US congress and Binyamin Netanyahu regaining office in Israel. If that scenario had come to pass, the world's fate would soon lie in the trigger-happy hands of six or seven autocrats and warmongers, including Trump, Putin and Iran's chief ayatollah. Nothing is to be taken for granted. The United States is fundamentally unstable. Little notice is being taken in Europe of Steve Bannon these days. But he is fighting much more than his conviction and four-month prison sentence for contempt of Congress. He is busy leading a far-right campaign to win Republican control of two-thirds of US state legislatures with a view to giving the Trump-dominated Republican Party the right to redraw the American constitution itself. That is a really frightening political asteroid. Musk's Twitter Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter is another potential calamity. If he makes it into a free-for-all source of disinformation and conspiracy theorists, the damage that could be done in the run-up to Trump's re-election bid could be enormous. Musk's retweet of the outrageous slur on Nancy Pelosi's husband speaks to his character or lack of character. If it reflects his personal predilection for irresponsible use of social media, it augurs very badly for responsible use of free speech. It may be that the EU will have to square up to its responsibility as lawmaker for social media operation. Licensing of social media in the EU seems to be inevitable if Musk's brand of wild libertarianism is not to be unleashed on us. It seems that immunity from liability for content on social media platforms is drinking in the last-chance saloon. Consider for a moment what Trump might do with Putin to Ukraine if he is re-elected. Already a considerable chunk of the Republican right is questioning Biden's support for Ukraine. If Trump in any way signals a willingness to pull the plug on Ukraine, Putin will persevere with his cruel war. If Trump signals weakness on the question of sanctions on Russia, he will hold out the real prospect of success for Putin. The midterm congressional elections this month at federal and state level are at best finely balanced. More likely the Democrats face serious defeat and loss of control of both houses. Roe v Wade probably matters less to most Americans than inflation and higher home loan costs. Democrats and power If that happens, Biden's presidency will become a lame duck. The issue of whether Biden will seek re-election will become acute if the Democrats lose both houses on Capitol Hill. The question is whether they have a viable alternative candidate. Kamala Harris is certainly not a likely winner. Is there anyone else? Perhaps it would take the loss of both houses for any challenger to emerge on the Democrats' side. As I wrote here before, Florida governor Ron DeSantis now looks like a far better bet as Republican candidate from the perspective of world order, peace and prosperity than a re-elected Trump. And it may just be that Republicans in the House of Representatives, the Senate and state governors' mansions will feel much freer to distance themselves or dissociate themselves from Trump once the November elections are over. I sincerely hope so. In the meantime, Trump is still very like a large political asteroid on a collision course with western democracy. Depending on his angle of approach, he may burn up and fragment or, alternatively, he may land intact with terrible consequences. The January 6th hearings have not saved the Democrats. The reversal of Roe v Wadedoes not appear to hold out the prospect of a Democratic victory. It is very hard to be optimistic or even hopeful about the planet's political prospects these days. Economic turmoil is derailing political plans and appetites for countering climate change. The forthcoming Cop27 summit in Sharm el- Sheikh seems unlikely to yield new ground for the radical change that scientists claim is increasingly urgent. Cairo may be a wasted exercise of hot air and greenwashing. We are entering a period of what will, at best, be a succession of narrow shaves. \</doc>

Greta Thunberg's detractors are quick to denigrate her authority on climate, pointing out that she is a mere teenager and one with a tendency to truancy at that. "Listen to the science," has always been her solid response. Now, with her latest book, she asks people to read the science. And the economics. And the sociology, the history, politics, ecology, meteorology, hydrology, medicine and law. Thunberg has gathered a group of more than 100 experts as diverse as the facets of the climate crisis itself. Most have earned their place on the pages through their academic credentials and research. Others are activists and writers whose expertise comes from the lived experience of climate change or encounters with those who have. There are veterans of the battle to achieve action on climate, including Professor Michael Oppenheimer of Princeton University. He was among the brave few who testified at landmark hearings on climate change at the US Congress in 1988 and whose prescient warnings caused global shock and were then shamefully ignored. Others who will be well-known to those who follow climate discourse closely include Michael Mann, Naomi Klein, Bill McKibben and Katharine Hayhoe. From the 'don't hold back' school of climate communication comes George Monbiot with a blistering attack on the media's role in facilitating climate breakdown. Professor Kevin Anderson, whose presentation to the Oireachtas climate and environment committee this year was a bunker-buster to complacency, is in full throttle again here. Margaret Atwood, master of dystopian fiction, writes with wry humour, trying to turn the habit of a lifetime on its head and imagine a utopia where all the ills that led to the climate crisis are healed. One of the strengths of this book is that it gives us names, studies and stories that we in Europe, and in the global north generally, don't hear often enough. Contributors from Africa, South America, South-East Asia and the Middle East bring their own research and experiences, without which any discussion of the climate crisis is lacking. For this reason, and this alone -because it should not matter what a contributor looks like - it would have been good to see a collage of the authors' faces somewhere in this publication. whose There are those, chiefly in the palefaced global north, who still see climate action as an unjust tax on their hard-earned luxuries. To fully understand the crisis, its extent and impact, we need to see and hear more from those whose names we can not readily pronounce and whose countries we make faltering attempts to locate on a map. more she This book is a step in that direction and even though it is a snapshot in time, it will stand as a compelling record of how Earth and its most vulnerable people were affected by climate change in 2022. The book is divided into five parts, gathering essays in clusters that concentrate on the science of climate, the changes, the effects, the responses so far and the action required. REPARATIONS Climate migration is referenced often, with reminders of how the arrival of fewer than 1.5 million war refugees into Europe in 2015 triggered a bloc-wide political crisis. The question of how wealthy countries will deal with the anticipated dramatic surge in climate refugees over the coming decade is left hanging. Inequality is another prevalent theme. The poorest, most underdeveloped countries who did least to cause climate change are often those most affected by it and are certainly the least able to cope with it. That leads to debate around reparations by wealthy countries or 'loss and damage' as the issue will be termed at next week's Cop27 UN climate summit, where its very mention will make delegates bristle. It may be unpalatable to richer nations but Prof Anderson argues it is not a first choice dish for those suffering either. "We have left it far too late for real fairness," he writes. Have we left it too late for hope? It is another common thread in this collection. None of the contributors is hopeless but there are varying degrees of optimism and many provisos on the more upbeat outlooks. Thunberg, whose own writings are dispersed throughout the book, expresses more hope than she is normally credited with. She puts it down to the belief that when greenwashing has been exposed, when powerful corporate interests have been pushed aside, when marginal voices are heard and "once we have been given the full story", people will understand and act and insist their leaders do likewise. In producing this book, she has gone quite a way to helping the full story to be told. POLITICS The Climate Book Greta Thunberg Allen Lane, 464 pages, hardcover, (EURO)29.99; e-book \£312.99 \</doc>

Whatever else may be wrong with economics, its starting point is correct: people do indeed respond to incentives. Suppose renewables provided the dominant technologies for energy supply; suppose, in short, that it was more profitable to use solar, wind or other renewable sources of energy than fossil fuels. Market forces would then drive the transformation of economies in a climate-protecting direction on their own. It might still be necessary to reduce the costs of capital in emerging and developing countries. It might still be necessary to accelerate the transfer of technology. But the wind of profit would be at their back. Is this the world we live in? If not, how might we create it? Start with a simple proposition: if something is profitable, it will be done. Asset managers may dispose of shares in fossil-fuel businesses and banks may refuse to finance them. Some investors might refuse to own or fund companies that do things they consider wicked. But my fellow columnist, Stuart Kirk, is correct that someone else will then own and finance them, provided they are profitable. Those actors might be foreign governments and businesses or domestic private entities. Regulation might curb some activities. But political resistance is likely to make such regulation difficult - consider the debate over production of fossil fuels in the US. Moreover, oil producers will defend their interests to the death, as they showed at Cop27 in Egypt. If one doubts just how difficult it is to halt a profitable business, take a look at the history of drug prohibition. How close then are we to making renewables the dominant technology for energy supply? The answer is that we have made remarkable progress. But it is not fast enough to be transformative within the relevant timescale, one that has become ever shorter as a result of the past decades of delays. The good news is that, as the International Renewable Energy Agency shows, a dramatic fall in the so-called "levelised cost" of electricity from renewables has occurred since 2010. This is true for onshore and offshore wind and even more so for solar voltaics. Costs are now at the lower end of the range for generation by fossil fuels or even below it. This is potentially transformative. The bad news is that this fall in costs has not been transformative enough, quickly enough. A rise in the share of renewables in electricity generation has indeed occurred. In the EU it reached 25 per cent in 2021. But in the world as a whole it was still only 13 per cent. Low-emissions sources Meanwhile, total emissions from all sources have not fallen. Yet, if the 1.5-degree limit is to be kept alive, total emissions have to fall sharply by 2030, particularly in electricity generation. For this to happen there must be a huge expansion in the use of what the International Energy Agency (IEA) calls "low-emissions sources", the bulk being from renewables, while use of unabated fossil fuels falls by a third. Nothing happened in Sharm el-Sheikh to suggest this is likely. The reasons for the relatively slow adjustment to renewables so far, even as they have become more competitive, are many: the overhang of low marginal cost installed capacity, not just in electricity generation but also in heating, transportation and industry; the costs of a fast transition to alternatives; resistance to loss of existing business and employment in production, refining and distribution; resistance to building solar and wind farms; resistance to undertaking needed investments in systems integration; and difficulties in arranging finance for emerging and developing countries, and for households everywhere. With market forces increasingly pushing in the right direction, the question is how to accelerate them. This is why, despite scepticism over attempts to make profit-seeking businesses pursue moral objectives, I am pleased that these desired changes are at least in line with what the markets are clearly saying: one can hope to do well by doing good. Furthermore, as the IEA argues, in addition to being increasingly cheap, renewable energy sources add security to energy supplies. Wind and sun vary over days and seasons. But Vladimir Putin cannot cut them off. For China, Europe and India, to name but three big players, the security case for renewables is overwhelming. Broadly speaking, five policy changes still need to be made, or strengthened: increase investment in scientific research; increase subsidisation of the application of new technologies, with a view to accelerating learning-by-doing in each, as well as speeding up investment in complementary technologies; cease subsidisation of fossil fuels, which amounted to $700 billion in 2021, other than in carbon capture and storage; introduce carbon pricing in one of several possible ways, perhaps by preventing prospective declines in energy prices from working their way fully into the market; and de-risk finance especially in developing countries. None of this is new. But the politics just might be. Yes, the world has talked far more than it has acted. Yes, it is far behind where it needs to be. And no, the market is not going to deliver the needed transition fast enough. But there is now a significant chance of delivering safe, secure, clean and cheap energy to all. Moreover, the possibility might, properly supported, generate a global investment boom that would absorb excess savings for an extended period. The energy transition should no longer mean hair shirts forever, but an opportunity that politicians can sell. They should try to do much harder. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022 \</doc>

'M ay you live in interesting times' is often quoted as a Chinese curse. These times are certainly interesting, they are historic and might even be cursed. The words of German philosopher Hegel come to mind, "World history is not the soil in which happiness grows. Periods of happiness are empty pages in it." Of late, I find myself very much preoccupied with the fragility of things. Perhaps this is what living in wartime means, with its daily reminders that we are but a shattering of glass away from disintegration and the unravelling of everything that makes up the world as we know it. We live in a swirl of hypocrisy, inconsistency, and incongruity. There is the hypocrisy of the western powers championing the territorial integrity of the Ukrainian war effort. These are the same powers that tore Iraq and Afghanistan apart. At least they got it right this time around. The climate discussions at COP27 in Egypt are replete with glaring contradictions, among them the sight of powerful people arriving by private jet to talk about tackling the climate crisis. For some their next stop will be the World Cup in Qatar, an event that smacks of much that is wrong with the world where the sports-washing will only be matched by the greenwashing. I have been revisiting the work and words of Portuguese poet and writer Fernando Pessoa, a man whose emergence as a force in the literary world didn't happen until long after his death when his poems and prose were found in a disordered heap in a trunk. Though he died in 1935 his bestknown work was published for the first time in 1982. Entitled The Book of Disquiet, it is a diary recording the ordinariness of his life while probing everything for significance or insignificance. He was described by the Mexican poet and diplomat Octavio Paz as "a solemn investigator of futile things". 'Disquiet' is a word that captures the times we are in, times when social, economic and political upheavals are seismic with reverberations that are shaking and rattling the societal foundations we have long considered solid and certain. At times like these people make revolutionary choices. War, like every other disturbance, creates ripples from the core outwards, from the theatre of battle where the physical impact of the bombs and bullets wreak total havoc to the next circle where the psychological scars mark those bereft, bereaved and displaced. It eventually reaches those on the outer rings causing a shift in consciousness. The violent upheaval brought about by Putin's war on Ukraine is bringing change across our whole reality whether we realise it or not. National budgets, the availability of goods and the movement of refugees are among the more obvious changes. The world of literature and the arts will be charged through with the sights and sounds of conflict as poets become wartime poets, writers move their keyboards close to the edge of reality, playwrights dress their characters in uniform and visual artists find their Guernica moments. Norms and expectations are changed by war, people feel themselves freed to do things they might only dream of doing under what we would call 'normal circumstances'. The boundaries over which we would not give ourselves permission to step are no longer there. I think we are very close to the place where 'normal' is a matter of interpretation; what does normal mean when death is being rained down on a nation for no reason other than their neighbour wants to own them? What does normal mean when fossil fuel companies are making profits of $2.8bn a day while leading the planet to ruin? Lately I'm travelling to Dublin more often than I used to. A capital city is an interesting place to be in wartime with its cross-section of the population, loud conversations and where reading the faces can help you judge the mood and feel the anxieties. The hundreds and thousands of people going about their business with heads down and shoulders hunched appear determined to hold on and do what they always did. Perhaps they are also clinging to the belief that 'this too will pass'. Many make life-changing decisions when faced with the fragility of existence. Some find God, some find nihilism, while others wildly rejoice in the now, dispensing with learnings from the past and concerns for the future. As November darkens and a crisp edge adds itself to the breeze, the sights and sounds heralding Christmas are as incongruous as the sight and sound of an ice cream van in a funeral cortege. In Irish, the month of November takes its name from the festival of 'Samhain' or 'O\'edche Shamhna' when the veil between this world and the next is temporarily pulled aside and the two worlds intermingle in a night-time of chaos. The veil of normality shielding us from chaos is certainly fraying, and not only at the edges. As I crossed O'Connell Bridge I thought, 'what can I do, what can I say and who would listen?' What if I just took all my clothes off, walked out into the traffic and sat down in middle of the road? Surely someone would ask me why I did it? The sights and sounds heralding Christmas are as incongruous as the sight and sound of an ice cream van in a funeral cortege \</doc>

Leaders at the G20 meeting in Bali have agreed to pursue efforts to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C, including speeding up efforts to phase down unabated use of coal. "We resolve to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C," a declaration issued at the end of the meeting said. "This will require meaningful and effective actions and commitment by all countries." The leaders' declaration, issued following a summit on the Indonesian island of Bali, urged delegates at the ongoing COP27 in Egypt to "urgently scale up" efforts at the summit on the issue of mitigating and adapting to climate change. Leaders deplored Russia's aggression in Ukraine "in the strongest terms" and demanded its unconditional withdrawal in a declaration adopted at the end of a two-day summit. "Most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine," the declaration said, signalling that Russia, which is a member of G20, opposed the wording. The positions taken by China and India, which abstained from a similar UN resolution in March, were not immediately clear. However, at least three diplomats said the statement, which recognised that "there were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions", was unanimously adopted. "The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible," the declaration also said. "It is essential to uphold international law and the multilateral system that safeguards peace and stability. This includes defending all the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and adhering to international humanitarian law." Earlier, the day's schedule at the summit on the Indonesian island of Bali was disrupted by an emergency meeting to discuss reports of a missile landing in Polish territory near Ukraine yesterday, killing two people. https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2022/1116/1336370-poland-ukraine-russia-latest/ early information suggested it may not have been caused by a missile fired from Russia . NATO member Poland had said a rocket killed two people in eastern Poland near Ukraine, and it summoned Russia's ambassador for an explanation after Russia denied it was responsible. Leaders from the Group of Seven nations, Spain, the Netherlands and the EU, who were all in Bali for the G20 summit, attended the meeting. The G7 nations include the United States, Germany, France, Canada, Italy, Britain and Japan. After the meeting, the G20 leaders, dressed in white shirts and some with baseball caps with the G20 logo, took part in a ceremony to plant mangrove saplings to signal the battle against climate change. On the sidelines of the summit, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen held a two-hour meeting with Chinese central bank Governor Yi Gang, her first in-person talks with a senior Chinese economic official. She had said before the meeting she hoped to get new insight into China's policy plans and work toward more economic engagement between the two countries. WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told Reuters on the summit sidelines that several major economies faced a real risk of sliding into recession as the war in Ukraine, rising food and fuel costs, and soaring inflation cloud the global outlook. Mr Biden held a bilateral meeting with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, their first face-to-face talks since Sunak took the job. The US President described Britain as America's "closest ally and closest friend" while Mr Sunak said the partnership between their countries was unique and their values and interest were aligned. 'Calibrate monetary tightening' The Western-led push to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine dominated the summit. Many participants said President Vladimir Putin's 24 February invasion of Ukraine had pummelled the global economy and revived Cold War-era geopolitical divisions just as the world was emerging from the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic. Russia, whose forces pounded cities and energy facilities across Ukraine yesterday as the G20 met, has said "politicisation" of the summit was unfair. "Yes, there is a war going on in Ukraine, a hybrid war that the West has unleashed and been preparing for years," Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said yesterday, repeating Mr Putin's line that NATO's expansion had threatened Russia. Mr Lavrov was representing Mr Putin at the summit but left yesterday evening. Russia was later represented by Finance Minister Anton Siluanov. The West has accused Russia of making irresponsible statements on the possible use of nuclear weapons since its invasion of Ukraine. Russia has in turn accused the West of "provocative" nuclear rhetoric. The 19 countries in the G20 together with the European Union account for more than 80% of the world's gross domestic product, 75% of international trade and 60% of its population. Host Indonesia has pleaded for unity and a focus on problems like inflation, hunger and high energy prices, all exacerbated by the war. The summit document also said G20 central banks would calibrate monetary tightening with an eye on the global inflation problem, while being mindful of the need to limit" cross-country spillovers". The G20 members also reaffirmed their commitment to avoid excessive exchange-rate volatility while recognising that "many currencies have moved significantly" this year. On debt, it voiced concern about the "deteriorating" situation of some middle-income countries and stressed the importance of all creditors sharing a fair burden. \</doc>

H EARING Junior Minister for Overseas Development Aid, Colm Brophy, talk of his trip to the droughtstricken Horn of Africa, Professor John Sweeney was struck by how deeply affected the minister was - but also by what he didn't say. "I would have liked Minister Brophy to claim more in the way of complicity in Ireland causing the problem in the Horn of Africa that he so poignantly spoke about," said Prof Sweeney. "We in Ireland have to accept that even in a very small way - because we're still increasing emissions - we're making matters worse globally. "We can't point the finger at any other country unless we're walking the walk ourselves." Prof Sweeney is Ireland's longest-serving climate scientist. He has spent 44 years working at Maynooth Univer- sity, 35 of them trying to draw the country's attention to climate change. COP27 is his 11th global climate summit and while they haven't always been very productive, he says they are worth attending. "You see a bigger perspective on the climate issue from 197 countries than you would have listening to a more narrow debate in Ireland," said Prof Sweeney. "It's useful, especially for our politicians to come because they often come back from COP with a greater awareness of the issues than they had going out, sometimes transformed. It brings it home that this is not an abstract thing we're talking about, that it's affecting people." With "loss and damage" central to this year's summit, Prof Sweeney has done some number-crunching to show why it is necessary. "I followed the floods in Pakistan in September. I found that average GDP per capita there is $1,000. The average GDP per capita in Ireland is $84,000," he said. "Greenhouse gas emissions in Pakistan are about one tonne per person, ours are about 12 tonnes per person. "We are the people historically and currently causing the problem for countries that cannot cope with what we're inflicting on them so it is reasonable for them to ask us to help." People are not always reasonable when confronted with the reality of climate change and the responses it requires, however. "I don't do Twitter because I got trolled so mercilessly," said Prof Sweeney. Laughing, he says he now gets his hate mail in hard copy and prefers that because "at least it costs them something to send it". Politicians aren't always the most reasonable, or proactive, either, he says. "The political cycle is only five years and therefore the ability to think beyond that period and the vision to show leadership for a 10- or 20-year period is something that's hard to inculcate in politicians," said Prof Sweeney. "We also have to recognise that there are very powerful vested interests at work. "I was very naive. I was brought up in this idea that science informs policy and I know now that it doesn't - interest groups primarily inform policy." Prof Sweeney is concerned that the carbon budgets and sectoral ceilings agreed earlier this year to plot emissions cuts over the rest of the decade "don't hold water". We're well on our way to emitting more than allowed even though the limits are legally binding, and he says the ceiling on agricultural emissions is too generous. "I have the greatest regard for our farmers but intensive dairy farming is now costing the State more, in my view, than the benefits we accrue from it," said Prof Sweeney. "Average dairy-farm income in 2022, according to Teagasc, will be (EURO)130,000 so those are people earning twice the industrial wage who could be asked to trim their herd back. "A cutback by 10-15pc on their herd would go a long way." Other reasonably fast-acting carbon-cutting measures he would like to see are greater incentives for people to use public transport, switch to electric vehicles and ditch SUVs. "I was very supportive of Dublin City Council's idea of charging higher parking rates for SUVs. I think we should be taxing SUVs according to weight and road damage as well as according to carbon dioxide," said Prof Sweeney. More freight carried by rail and greater supports for retrofitting are also on his list, especially for apartment owners, who are often put off investing in retrofitting because they don't see the property as their forever home. He is grateful for the Climate Act because it will stay in place whichever political party comes to power. On global politics, he hasn't given up hope of leaders from countries that are big emissions offenders - such as China and India - coming to future COPs. Prof Sweeney said the World Trade Organisation might bring pressure to bear on these countries, while EU proposals to impose border taxes on imports from high polluters could also have an influence. He holds on to hope generally, but he added it isn't easy at times. "If you lose hope, you're a gonner. It is frustrating because you say the same things for so long, in my case 35 years," said Prof Sweeney. "I know that maybe in 10 years' time there will be a realisation that we should have done this 35 years ago but you can't give up hope." We are still causing problems for countries that cannot cope \</doc>

Tactical urbanism is process of community orientated experimental design. An urban version of moving the furniture about until there's consensus on the preferred living room. NYC famously played with Times Square to inform its transformation from grid-iron congestion to open-air street theatre. Such trials aren't always planned though and can play out at the metropolitan scale. With the snowstorms that knocked the city out cold in 2018 and more recently Covid-19, Cork City can draw lessons that should inform our adaptation to the ferocious storms predicted of climate change. The 'Beast from the East' hit in mid-February 2018. Shops and offices closed; the city was inaccessible to traffic. Blanketed in snow, Cork had a spectral beauty. Trudging my way down Patrick Street, I was struck by the exuberance of friendly snowball fights and a gentle hum of world languages. Census data shows that Cork's inner urban population has been growing significantly in the last decade. Young people want to live in the heart of historic, vibrant and cultured urban centres. In the absence of the noise and ugliness of traffic congestion, this community came out to play and reclaim the city as their own. Some two years later, I recall standing in my garden and being mesmerised by an orchestra of bird song. Covid-19 had arrived. Returning to my makeshift home office, I then worked reasonably productively via Teams with colleagues, similarly landlocked. At the urban scale, the council is to be commended for pedestrianising streets, embracing outdoor dining culture, facilitating the joy of the riverside Marina walk and for having the ambition to secure European Climate-Neutral status. But the pandemic should never have caught the world unprepared. US president Barack Obama had publically articulated the necessity of the world's most powerful nation being adequately prepared. Bill Gates had long forewarned of the likelihood of a pandemic. The UN had continuously declared the existential risks that zoonotic disease posed to the health and wealth of world's nations. Yet here we are again. On Monday, November 7, Ant\'f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, made an impassioned speech on the opening day of Cop27 : "we are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator ... we can sign a climate solidarity pact, or a collective suicide pact". Each passing iteration of the IPPC reports provides peer reviewed evidence that our increasingly fragile earth will be witness to climate chaos of potentially biblical scale and set within the context of an ecological sixth extinction unless we act now and act in concert. The same applies to Cork City. Lessons learned? Scientific forecasts play out. The storms are coming. We need a plan. The Coalition for Urban Transformation sets out a usefully alliterative elevator pitch for the urban transition to a net-zero carbon future. Clean, in our decarbonisation of electricity, the electrification of almost everything and implementation of energy efficiency. Connected, in our move to public transport and active travel. Compact, in our embrace of gentle density and inner-city revival. Site specifically, Cork will have to consider our exposure to Atlantic storms. A tidal barrier will require serious study - not to mind the necessity of the planned flood defences. In response to the biodiversity crises, we ought to turn this on its head and invest in nature-based solutions at the scale of the Dunkettle Interchange that could mark Cork out as the greenest city in Europe. The fabulous Lee-to-Sea greenway might be expanded to encompass a new national park extending from The Gearagh to the mouth of Cork harbour. A 100km-long riparian forest and greenway. This would clean our waterways and harbour, seed a year-round tourist attraction, massively mitigate our flooding risk, transform nature and wildlife in the city and deliver significantly on Cork's healthy city ambitions. Resilience and imagination are foundational to that plan. The social inequities in the US allowed Covid to become a trigger for salvos in the culture wars. Ireland can take heart in the way we pulled together as a society and collectively worked through Covid. And isn't imagination and story telling what we pride ourselves on? Reimagining Cork as outlined is a no regrets investment in the future. These projects will deliver a better quality of life, a city that can weather the future and would be a magnet for investment. It would allow us to pass the city on to the next generation in better shape than we inherited it. It's also a case of drawing on our storied past. Cork was once a cycling city, a city of trams, a city of European urban density. There was the lido by the Lee. Train lines ran from stations north, east, and west. Where once we laid claim to being the Venice of the Atlantic, perhaps Cork could become an exemplar for small cosmopolitan coastal cities worldwide. So, we're not moving the decks-chairs about on the Titanic. We're both redirecting the ship of state and rebuilding whilst all at sea. Otherwise, the Greenland iceshelf will play us a visit in the long night of climate change. This requires all party-political leadership, green infrastructure investment in the tens of billions, deep and ongoing community engagement and co-design, and our business and civic institutions to commit to a genuine net-zero and nature positive world. All else is greenwash. Imagination, resilience, planning. Pure Cork! Graphic Picture, Shane Clarke on his electric bike with son Oisin on the school run at St Luke's Cross, Cork City. \</doc>

It has been eight months since world leaders gathered in Glasgow for the much-hyped COP26 climate summit, a high-powered gathering of global leaders, activists and experts heralded as a turning point for critical action on climate change. Providing the backdrop for the summit was first part of the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a mammoth scientific assessment on how greenhouse gas pollution is heating the planet. It was described by UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres as a "code red for humanity". I attended COP26 in my role as Laudato S\'ed officer with Tr\'f3caire and witnessed two COPs in Glasgow. There was the one attended by world leaders which took place inside the UN conference halls known as the Blue Zone. And then the one on the streets where thousands of activists, including many from the global south, gathered in solidarity pleading with political leaders to act now. This movement on the "outside" was powerful, with representation from the world's faith communities: Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and many more who had gathered in Glasgow advocating for change. Vigils took place every day as people of all faiths sat in silent meditation and prayer for the success of these critical talks. The energy of the thousands of people who held vigil in Glasgow was inspiring to witness and be a part of. It has stayed with me. 'Wounded humanity' In advance of the crucial COP26 summit, Pope Francis and 40 world religious leaders issued an unprecedented joint statement appealing for decisive international political decisions "to safeguard, restore and heal our wounded humanity and the home entrusted to our stewardship". Future generations, the statement said, "will never forgive us if we miss the opportunity to protect our common home." These words hung outside the COP26 meeting rooms. But eight months on have things changed? In February and April the IPPC published two further damning reports flagged as a final warning for governments on the climate crisis. It signalled that the world can still hope to stave off the worst ravages of climate breakdown but only through a real commitment to a low-carbon economy and society. The climate crisis is having a devastating impact in the Horn of Africa, where Tr\'f3caire works. The World Food Programme says severe drought is leaving an estimated 13 million people across Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia facing hunger. In Somalia three consecutive failed rainy seasons have decimated crops and caused abnormally high livestock deaths. Shortages of water and pasture are forcing families from their homes and leading to increased conflict between communities. Our team there is reporting an unfolding crisis of epic proportions with people dying of hunger. Compounding this climate-induced crisis is the war in Ukraine, which is being felt across Africa, a continent heavily reliant on food imports from Ukraine and Russia. Within a few weeks, wheat, sunflower oil and fuel prices have soared to unprecedented levels. International aid funds are being channelled to Ukraine, which is the right thing to do. However, unless these are treated as additional to existing humanitarian funds, this will reduce funding for other crises, creating a perfect storm for the millions already struggling. Likewise, the climate finance which has been promised by richer countries must be delivered in addition to overseas aid and increased based on actual need. Given that the poorest half of the world's population is responsible for just 10 per cent of historical emissions, this is a matter of justice. While COP26 did not deliver all the urgent actions required to respond to the climate catastrophe, the strong mobilisation of faith groups in climate activism surely gives hope. There was power in marching in solidarity at COP26 with activists of all faiths and people from countries who are on the front lines of climate change. Working together can put pressure on our leaders and decision-makers to progress climate action. Globally, 80 per cent of people profess to be members of a faith community. There are 220,000 Catholic parishes in the world. Imagine the grassroots action that can be encouraged across all faith groups to drive climate action. COP26 may be over, but we are leading into COP27 in November. The big challenge facing activists is harnessing the energy for change and translating it into action. The faith-based activist community has no intention of stopping. There is too much is at stake. \</doc>

No wonder people are confused and angry. As COP27 takes place in Egypt this week, against the backdrop of environmental pessimism, we're told Ireland is leading the world in the use of renewable energy. Good news, surely? Yet, on the other hand, we're also told that, despite most electricity now coming from renewable sources, our spiralling electricity costs are tied to rising gas prices. The logical question is: if most of our power is renewable, why are we still paying prices dictated by the gas market? Meanwhile, many business owners across Ireland purchase guarantees-of-origin certificates, which say they are using 100 per cent renewable energy, only to discover that they are not the guarantee they thought they were, an issue which has now been raised as a cause for concern by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU). So, are people being misinformed about these two key issues? In reality, the market is complex, out of date and based on very different calculations and assumptions that no longer make sense. As has been pointed out recently, one major supplier has, with justification - proudly proclaimed its green credentials, highlighting how it is supplying "100 per cent green energy" based on a market share published by the CRU in November 2021. Likewise, the CRU itself said that this and other providers used 100 per cent renewable energy sources with zero carbon emissions. Let's consider the facts. Major suppliers can say with justification that they don't use any gas in the supply of their power, but that same power has almost doubled in price because of the problems with the gas supply. Design It all comes down to the outdated design of the market, which is leading to much of the cost increase, as a result of the fact that the retail price of electricity is tied to the price of gas. So, tying the prices of renewable energy to the price of gas is one of the main reasons for the rise in electricity prices, even though most of our electricity comes from renewable sources. Surely governments should be scrambling to change the rules of the market, rather than throwing vast amounts of public money at trying to cap prices? And so, to the second point: how can Irish businesses be sure their power, which they have a certificate to say is produced from renewable sources, actually is? Power taken from the grid is produced from a mix of gas plant, coal plant, nuclear and wind energy and imported from Britain, collectively known as fuel mix. Customers buying "green" electricity are, in effect, paying for a mathematical exercise, which energy suppliers complete with the CRU to have their supply badged green - commonly known as greenwashing. This maths exercise is completed annually, where the supplier submits to the CRU contracted sources of supply. If there's a shortfall in the percentage of electricity produced from renewable sources, energy suppliers can adjust their "supply and fuel mix' statement by subbing out some parts of their supply and adding guarantees of origin, known as 'GOs'. You could be forgiven for thinking that this all sounds like a sleight of hand. In reality, the option to purchase GOs fails to incentivise end-users to support renewable asset development in Ireland. It also means that companies that believe they are using 100 per cent renewable energy and say so publicly aren't being strictly accurate, leaving these companies with an ever-increasing liability. Things have now reached a point where the CRU itself has said that it wants to change the way companies detail the use of their certificates to provide greater transparency to customers. Before and during Covid, GOs were trading at around EUR 0.25c/KWH, so using 9GWh annually costs around EUR 2,250 a year to be able to say your electricity supply was supplied by 100 per cent renewable generation. Ongoing liability However, following the easing of Covid restrictions, the value of GOs has been steadily rising to the point where the same 9GWh annually is now EUR 45,000 a year or 20 times that of pre-Covid. Given that the customer (or supplier) may have been publicly claiming to be using 100 per cent renewable electricity, it is highly unlikely that they will want to revise that position and so are now locked into an ongoing liability without knowledge of their ongoing costs. It also means that renewable energy is subject to the same price fluctuation as fossil fuels, rendering the whole process somewhat wasteful and confusing. So, what should be done? Crucially, there needs to be a new market design and implementation so renewable energy is no longer tethered to gas prices, meaning consumers can pay lower and less volatile energy costs. Secondly, we welcome the CRU push to make the system clearer and we urge them to amend the Green Verification to Irish renewable assets only and for suppliers and large end-users to properly support local, non-Government supported assets, which could take the form of a corporate power purchase agreement (PPA) or direct private wire (a localised electricity grid). Otherwise, the status quo removes incentives for suppliers and energy users to support development of renewable assets by buying a virtual cert from outside Ireland and exporting financial value which could be put to use here. Rather than leaving energy users with no choice but to more or less pretend to use 100 per cent green energy, let's supply users with 100 per cent green energy.

RISHI Sunak has told a Cop27 reception hosted by the King that the world will experience "more human suffering" if we continue to allow "climate change to ravage our planet". The Prime Minister is attending Cop27 , the UN climate conference, in Egypt next week after a U-turn but Charles will miss the gathering of world leaders, business figures and environmentalists. The King has long campaigned on environmental issues and last autumn he told the Cop26 talks in Glasgow that the world has had enough of talking and commitments needed to be put into practice. But the "soft power" diplomacy of the monarchy will be absent from the international gathering at Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh. Speaking at a reception staged in the Buckingham Palace ballroom on Friday, Mr Sunak said: "As recent events have shown, delivering on the promise of Glasgow is more important than ever." Among the guests from the world of finance, technology, transport and agribusiness were Government figures including Environment Secretary Therese Coffey, Business Secretary Grant Shapps and Cop26 President Alok Sharma. \</doc>

Most voters do not think a Sinn F\'e9in-led government would resolve the housing crisis as support for Mary Lou McDonald's party has fallen significantly for the first time in over a year. The latest Ireland Thinks poll for the Sunday Independent also finds a clear majority of voters believe Ms McDonald should explain how she funded the renovation of her family home in Dublin. While it remains the most popular party in the country, Sinn F\'e9in has dropped three points to 34pc - its first significant drop in support in the Ireland Thinks series since April last year. There is no benefit for the coalition parties, however, with Fine Gael unchanged on 21pc, Fianna F\'e1il also unchanged on 17pc and the Green Party dropping one point to 3pc. Despite the Government facing huge criticism for its handling of the housing and homelessness crisis, 58pc of voters answered "No" when asked if they believed a Sinn F\'e9in-led government could resolve the crisis, with just 24pc saying it could and 17pc unsure. The poll also finds 61pc of voters believe the Government should pause accepting refugees from Ukraine and other countries amid unprecedented pressure on the State's accommodation system, with 26pc saying there should not be a pause and 13pc unsure. The fall in Sinn F\'e9in support has benefited others on the opposition benches, with Solidarity-People Before Profit up one point to 5pc, Social Democrats up one point to 4pc, Aont\'fa also up one to 4pc, and Independents and Others up two points to 10pc. Labour is unchanged on 3pc. A Sinn F\'e9in-led government that excludes Fine Gael and Fianna F\'e1il remains the most popular choice, when voters are forced to choose, on 43pc, but support for the re-election of the current three-party Government has increased to 41pc, up five points. Speaking at the Sinn F\'e9in ard fheis last night, Ms McDonald said change can no longer be stopped by Fianna F\'e1il and Fine Gael as she asked voters to let her lead the next government. "Change is on our doorstep," she said, describing the changeover in the Taoiseach's Office as "political hokey pokey". "Change can't be stopped by Fianna F\'e1il and Fine Gael," she said, saying the parties are "now so joined at the hip that it doesn't matter to them which leader is Taoiseach". Earlier, Ms McDonald said her home was paid for with a mortgage that she was still paying off. Continued on page 4 Continued from page 1 She declined to outline how much the renovation, which was the subject of coverage in a recent biography of the Sinn F\'e9in leader by former cabinet minister Shane Ross, had cost. While 59pc of voters said she should explain how she funded the renovation in the interests of transparency, 33pc said she should not, while 8pc were unsure. The poll also finds the public are evenly split on whether they would prefer T\'e1naiste Leo Varadkar to become Taoiseach next month or for Miche\'e1l Martin to continue. Ahead of the planned rotation of the Taoiseach's Office, 39pc of voters want Mr Varadkar to replace the Fianna F\'e1il leader while 39pc want Mr Martin to remain in the top job. Just over a fifth of voters, 22pc, are unsure. Mr Martin also has the highest approval rating of the four main party leaders on 46pc, up two points, with Ms McDonald on 45pc, also up two points. Mr Varadkar is up three points to 40pc with Green Party leader Eamon Ryan up one point to 22pc. The poll also finds 53pc of voters believe Sinn F\'e9in's housing spokesperson, Eoin \'d3 Broin, was right to apologise to the Department of Finance chief economist for saying he should be sacked, with 24pc saying he was not right and 23pc unsure. However, a strong majority of the public, 64pc, believe civil servants in Ireland have too much power, with 21pc saying they did not and 15pc unsure. As the COP27 An overwhelming majority of voters think it is unlikely the climate summit in Sharm El Sheikh will result in significant action to tackle the crisis, with 40pc saying it is fairly unlikely and 39pc stating it is very unlikely. Meanwhile, 73pc of voters support the development of a Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) terminal in Kerry to supplement Ireland's gas and energy supplies - a move strongly opposed by Green leader Mr Ryan, who is also the Environment Minister. Following the controversy over comments by Fr Se\'e1n Sheehy at a church in Listowel last week - where he suggested same-sex couples were going to hell, described transgenderism as lunacy and criticised supplying condoms to teenagers - 54pc of voters said the priest's comments as expressed should have no place in the Ireland of today. Twenty-four per cent of voters said that while they disagreed with the comments, he was only expressing the official position of the Catholic Church. Nearly a fifth of voters, 18pc, said they agreed with the comments, with 7pc of those saying he is entitled to say what he said during the mass. In a separate question asked of those polled, 67pc said they favoured the expansion of the criminal offence of hate speech to include online content and social media, including abusive or threatening speech or writing that expresses prejudice against a particular group. The poll was carried out among 1,002 people with a margin of error of +/- 3pc.  Sinn Fein ard fheis, page 10; Poll analysis, pages 14-15 \</doc>

W ITH the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the continuing Covid-19 pandemic and growing instability in the global economy, world leaders gathering for the next G7 summit have their hands full with urgent responsibilities. Rising to these challenges requires following through on promises to achieve peace, protect public health and ease poverty. But it also means addressing a threat that both dwarfs and implicates all the others: climate change. The climate crisis is fast approaching a stage of catastrophic harm that endangers the well-being and livelihoods of billions of people - and the window for preventing the worst possible outcomes shrinks by the day. In fact, we have until the end of this decade to transform the global economy, ending our reliance on fossil fuels and embracing circular forms of production, and to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, according to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. Climate action on this scale has never before been attempted, but the current moment presents us with a clear opportunity to take advantage of major technological gains that have been made in recent years, along with public consensus. Indigenous leaders and environmental activists have outlined the necessary course of action for decades. Now, the G7 summit can become the place where heads of state finally listen to this guidance and kick-start a just transition away from fossil fuels. G7 countries, the world's most advanced economies, can begin by committing the $100bn in annual climate financing for lowincome countries that they initially promised in 2009 but have yet to deliver. They can go further by ensuring these funds come in the form of grants instead of loans, and update funding targets in response to the increasing loss and damages caused by extreme weather events, rising sea levels and proliferating heatwaves. Responding to the current realities of climate change also entails helping countries deal with existing impacts. This is known as climate adaptation. While the majority of climate finance has gone to climate mitigation - reducing emissions - over the past decade, at least 50pc of financing should go to adaptation going forward. Investing in adaptation measures saves countries money in the longrun - the UN estimates $1.8trn spent on adaptation will save more than $7.1trn in climate costs. But what does adaptation look like in the real world? It varies by context, but could mean restoring storm-blocking wetlands in coastal areas, painting rooftops white in cities to cool living spaces amid blistering heatwaves or installing early-warning systems to ensure communities have time to prepare for natural disasters. It also means investing in the smallholder farmers who are essential to the stability of the global food system. Without international support, farmers in frontline communities risk losing their ability to bring crops to harvest, exacerbating the global food crisis. Without efforts to improve the climate resilience of farmers, agricultural production could decline by up to 30pc by 2050, even as the global demand for food rises by 50pc. Farmers need help adapting to the environmental changes that have already occurred and those that are getting worse. For example, as temperatures rise in various breadbaskets, crops need more water to stay hydrated, but many of these same regions are experiencing less rainfall, making it harder to bring crops to fruition. With financing, smallholder farmers can invest in plants that better withstand drought, install more efficient irrigation systems, deploy technologies that can help them plan far into the future and get better access to markets to ensure their crops don't go to waste. It's hard to overstate the central role smallholder farmers play in many communities. Throughout sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia, they produce 80pc of the food. An estimated two-thirds of adults living in poverty worldwide earn their income through agriculture, yet smallholder farmers receive only 1.7pc of total climate finance. They're currently receiving around $10bn in this area, far below their overall need, estimated at $240bn a year. We need to close this vast gap if we want to build a better future. Multilateralism has yielded good work in recent years, especially in getting 196 signatories for the Paris climate agreement and adopting the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals, a framework to end extreme poverty, tackle climate change and reduce inequality by 2030. But there is so much work ahead in fighting climate change, and progress hinges on the investments that are made today in climate adaptation. We look forward to steps taken following the G7 negotiations, and encourage global leaders to set examples ahead of the next UN climate conference, COP27 , in Egypt this November. Ban Ki-Moon is co-chair of the Ban Ki-Moon Centre for Global Citizens and the eighth secretary-general of the United Nations. The G7 Summit 2022 will take place from Sunday to Tuesday at Schloss Elmau in the Bavarian Alps. \</doc>

The Brazilian national team arrive in Qatar with a well-balanced squad. Football-wise, that is. A solid and experienced defence, a combative as well as creative midfield, and an attack of the highest technical ability made up of players who complement each other well. All this gives the head coach, Tite, a wide range of possibilities of how to set up. However, a World Cup is not just about the football, as we have seen in Qatar over the past few days. Concurrent to the countdown to the World Cup was the election in which former president Luiz In\'e1cio Lula da Silva returned to power, beating Jair Bolsonaro. It meant the country took a decisive step towards restoring its young democracy, which had been under threat since the 2016 coup that forced the former president Dilma Rousseff from office and paved the way for the rise of Bolsonaro's far-right government in 2018. Four years of erosive leadership, followed by a heavily polarised election, has left Brazilian society deeply divided. To make matters worse, Brazilians have had to watch as the national team's captain and star player, Ney-mar, turned his back on the more than 30m hungry Brazilians and the 120m who live on the cusp of food insecurity and backed Bolsonaro as part of a supposed fight against a nonexistent communist threat. Having had such success, the former Santos player with the humble background has clearly lost touch with his roots, as well as the plight and needs of the majority of the population that will cheer for him during the World Cup. It is a sad state of affairs. Every four years, the presidential elections and the World Cup coincide in Brazil, sending shockwaves across the societal landscape. After Russia 2018, the political hijacking of the historic yellow Brazil national team jersey, designed to boost Bol-sonaro's nationalist movement, made millions of Brazilians disown and refuse to wear it, even for a World Cup. Despite all this there is hope for better days ahead, with many in Brazil supporting the national team and hoping that a successful World Cup can bring the country closer together, kick-starting a sense of reconciliation in a nation with painful, fresh wounds. The process of recovering a Brazi lian identity has already started with Lula taking to the international stage during Cop27 in Egypt, showcasing Brazil's renewed commitment to global diplomacy and environmental leadership. That process will continue on the pitches in Qatar. Football-wise then? As I said, Brazil are in good shape before their opening game against Serbia tonight. They flew through the qualifiers, winning 14 and drawing three of their games, scoring 40 goals and conceding a mere five. Some Europeans may be under the illusion that South American qualifying is easy, but they could not be more wrong. Facing teams such as Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela away is anything but easy, believe me. Add to that Bolivia, where you have to play 3,400m above sea level. Brazil are one of the favourites to win the World Cup but that is not to say there aren't weaknesses. The best way to put this Brazil side under pressure is to attack the flanks. Tite took his time selecting the full-backs for this squad and I think their opponents may go for two forwards - whether that is in a 4-4-2 or in a 3-5-2 formation - to put pressure on the Brazil defence by getting the ball out wide and put crosses into the box. The danger zone for Brazil is between the defence and the goalkeeper, whether that is on the ground or in the air. Dani Alves was included in the squad but he is 39 now and playing in Mexico with Pumas. But he should not and probably will not be a starter. He brings experience and an unmatched ability to win trophies but defensively he is too fragile to be in the starting XI. Danilo, the 31-year-old Juventus player, should play there instead, and now is his time in the national side despite not having established himself fully at Manchester City and Real Madrid. He is, however, better going forward than defending. And this is where Tite's deep squad comes in. He has two excellent solutions that probably no other country can match. Option one is to play Fabin-ho there. The Liverpool midfielder is a much better defensive solution than the two full-backs already mentioned. Or he can move Eder Mili-tao to the right, the Real Madrid defender being versatile and having played as a fullback early in his career. Physically a beast, tough in duels, resilient and competitive, 24-year-old Militao could prove crucial in repelling opponents' aerial threats. In the left full-back position Alex Telles, the 29-year-old at Sevilla, has a wonderful left-foot, is skilful with the ball, and a good passer. He does not, however, have an abundance of international experience and is in a race to start with Juventus' Alex Sandro, who is not the most elegant of players but has solid technique and years of experience of European club football. He is a good left-back and will probably start but he is not consistent and can mix great performances with poor ones. The truth is, Roberto Carlos, the best left-back in Brazilian history, played at such a high standard, it has been impossible for his successors to reach that kind of unmatched excellence. Just as Cafu and a younger Dani Alves did for the right-back spot. The first game should go some way to displaying whether the defence can match the quality in midfield and attack. The Selecao are in a state of optimistic and tense energy. The whole of Brazil and, indeed, the whole of the world is asking: Which Brazil will we see in this World Cup? Only the players and the coach can decide that.  Guardian \</doc>

C LIMATE and Environment Minister Eamon Ryan wants the corporation tax take from multinational companies headquartered in Ireland to help pay for the harm caused to poor countries by climate change. Mr Ryan was speaking on his way back from the COP27 climate summit in Egypt where a historic decision was made to establish a 'loss and damage' fund for the world's most vulnerable HYPERLINK www.nations.No money was pledged to the fund and the details of how it will operate are to be worked out by an international committee to be formed over the next few months. But Mr Ryan said Ireland would be a contributor. "That (EURO)16bn corporation tax we get in a year, that's because we're the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) headquarters to so many companies. Are we going to say, 'Oh yes, we're going to take all the corporate profits thank you very much indeed, from our role as EMEA centre' and we're not going to be a leading contributor in funds like this? "That would not be fair, it would not be sustainable and it would not be defensible. "I think Simon Coveney gets this and Miche\'e1l Martin gets this. We increased our overseas aid budget this year by 17pc. "It wasn't mean, so I'm confident we'll do our bit." Ireland played a key role in getting the deal over the line with Mr Ryan appointed lead negotiator for the European Union on the loss and damage issue. It was a pivot by the EU on the contentious issue that finally broke the deadlock between the wealthiest and biggest economies and the smallest and poorest. It brought to an end 30 years of failure to progress the matter, which has been raised repeatedly since the first summit in 1992. But it took talks that carried on through Friday and Saturday night to finally bring the summit to a close at 7am yesterday. Mr Ryan said the past week had been quite emotional. "There's such a cast of characters involved in these talks but for all the nonsense and all the ridiculous late nights and macho negotiating stuff, it is a historic development, the loss and damage facility. "That's not to read too much into it - there's nothing delivered, it's just a political commitment, but it's a political commitment within a legal structure which is quite strong." The EU was initially opposed to setting up a dedicated loss and damage fund, preferring to use existing funds to pay out loss and damage assistance and seeking to defer the issue for further discussion. Most of the G20, the world's biggest economies, were cool on the very idea of loss and damage funding - which some studies have suggested could cost at least a trillion euro a year - although the US was more sympathetic than others. But the G77, the 134 countries the UN categorises as developing nations, were adamant there would be no COP agreement without a fund. "The EU wasn't against financing loss and damage but there is a history of funds being slow and bureaucratic so I think the EU's initial negotiating position was correct," Mr Ryan said. "But I also think it was correct to put that aside because the countries we were negotiating with needed the commitment. "Why would we get all high and mighty and say we know better than you? Sometimes you listen and move to the other person's position. "That was a key moment and it was a lesson that a bit of humility and listening of goes a long way." The change of tack caught the US by surprise. Mr Ryan said it was "unfortunate" the US team did not get more warning but the 27 EU member states present reached agreement themselves only 10 minutes before an open plenary of all 197 countries was scheduled. The US coming on board helped galvanise support, although opposition has been signalled by the Republican Party, which increased its power in the US government during mid-term elections last week. Mr Ryan was clear about the amount of work that has to be done to make the fund functional. The EU secured wording that the fund would prioritise the most vulnerable countries, because some of the countries categorised as developing under international law 30 years ago include the likes of China and India, which have since become industrialised and massive carbon emitters. The wording also seeks a broad base of funding, reforms of multinational development banks, debt relief and "innovative" funding. The latter refers to proposals made by Ireland, and backed by the EU, that fossil fuel companies and global shipping and aviation be levied to help pay for climate damage. On financial reform, Mr Ryan said: "That's all in prospect rather than guaranteed because this transition committee and the International Monetary Fund, the Asian Development Bank, African Development Bank, World Bank and so on - they have to step up to the plate." While loss and damage was considered the litmus test of the summit's success, progress on the other core issues was poor. On climate mitigation, which means reducing emissions, hopes of a commitment by countries to increase national targets were dashed. On eliminating fossil fuels, there was no strengthening of a pledge from COP26 to "phase down" coal rather than "phase out" all fossil fuels. "We were disappointed on mitigation. It doesn't go far enough, there wasn't sufficiently ambitious text in the agreement," Mr Ryan said. "What I hope is that you can unlock this sense of there being an injustice, that the poor countries that weren't responsible for the emissions were feeling the brunt of climate change. "At least with the loss and damage fund we have an answer to that question and we can say we have a fund, now let's talk seriously about mitigation." Mr Ryan paid tribute to the team of officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and Department of Environment (DECC) who were closely involved in the negotiations. In particular, he said the deal would not have been closed without the input of climate envoy Sin\'e9ad Walsh, deputy director of the DFA's climate unit, Jen Hobbs; DECC legal adviser Martin Collins and DECC assistant principal Emer Griffin. \</doc>

Matthew Jebb was disturbed to find the National Botanic Gardens' Callery pear tree in full bloom a couple of weeks ago. The deciduous tree , native to China and Vietnam, normally flowers in early spring. "This is the first time this has been seen in our collection," said Dr Jebb, director of the gardens. "It's completely out of kilter with the seasons." The botanist and biologist attributed drought stress for tricking the tree into thinking winter had passed and it was time to flower. After realising its mistake, so to speak, the tree quickly shed its buds. "Because the tree used up so much of its energy store blossoming early, it will blossom [as usual] in the early spring, but it will be a shadow of itself." Stress-induced flowering such as this is becoming more frequent due to global warming. This year, Europe experienced its worst drought in the past 500 years, with the driest August on record in Dublin since 2003, according to Met \'c9ireann. While trees such as the Callery pear can tolerate one drought, Dr Jebb said a few consecutive droughts would kill it. "We will see far more destructive changes because plant species cannot adapt to these extremes of climate and the regularity that they have never encountered before." On a crisp November morning at the gardens in Glasnevin, Dublin, Dr Jebb explained how subtle temperature changes affect flora. He pointed out a small, sage-coloured shrub with a fuzzy appearance, owing to its white hairs. Until about a decade ago, tens of thousands of these shrubs, cottonweed, grew along Ireland's south and east coast. Since then, their numbers have declined, with only 12 surviving at one location in Co Wexford. Scientists have been fighting to keep this perennial, classified as critically endangered, from going extinct. Twenty-five critically endangered plant species are on the cusp of extinction in Ireland. To save the cottonweed, a clipping of the plant is now growing at the gardens, allowing botanists to monitor it. "We're trying to emulate what happens in the wild and keep it happy," said Dr Jebb. "This includes piling sand over its roots to mimic the windblown sand that builds up around the plant as it grows." Meanwhile, in an another indicator a warming climate, the gardens' dahlias were in full bloom. Dr Jebb said an early frost should have killed them weeks ago. Increased temperatures such as this can lead to invasive or alien species establishing themselves, so staff quickly remove any plants that don't belong. Noah's Ark Both the botanic gardens and Trinity College Dublin have been working on a sort of Noah's Ark for plants. Hundreds of seeds from now-extinct plants have been cryogenically frozen at minus 20 degrees, with extracted DNA stored at minus 80 degrees, awaiting a return to their natural habitat. The Paris Agreement, adopted by 196 countries in 2015, aimed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. As delegates meet this week for the Cop27 conference in Egypt, the implications of relatively small fluctuations in temperature can be seen in plants. Dr Jebb said ribes alpinum, a shrubby plant that produces crimson berries, serves as a tool for measuring the arrival of spring. Scientists track when its leaves first unfurl, or when the buds literally burst open. "They will unfurl earlier if it's a warmer year, and later if it's a cold year. There is a clear trend that in the last 50 years, it is tending to unfurl its leaves up to three weeks earlier than normal." The shrub is part of a European network of clones. Decades ago, cuttings of a German ribes alpinum were sent to countries across Europe, with each growing an identical plant, making it an accurate tool to calculate spring's arrival across the continent. According to data, Dr Jebb said, spring is moving four kilometres per year northwards. To put that in perspective, oak trees, which appeared in Ireland after the last ice age, move at a pace of about 0.5 km a year. Movement occurs when birds, squirrels and larger animals eat the acorns and disperse the seeds. "Climate change is moving at four kilometres a year, so you could say that climate change is outpacing the speed at which plants can move by a factor of eight," said Dr Jebb. Unlike animals, a plant can't get up and move when the climate doesn't suit it, making it difficult for many to survive challenging conditions. Plants are so attuned to temperature changes that two unrelated plant species near one another will bloom within a day or two of each other, said Dr Jebb. But stress can disturb this synchronicity and prevent fertilisation. Without offspring, plants would become extinct. Without plants, humans would become extinct. While most scientists equate human intelligence with the chimpanzee, Dr Jebb said human beings are more intellectually on par with the pea. If you plant one pea seed in a container, it will produce a bountiful crop. "If you put two pea seedlings together in the same container, within a few days of sprouting, those two peas, although they don't have brains or nervous systems, are chemically aware of each other's presence." Since both need the same balance of minerals, they become aggressive. This competitive behaviour exerts so much energy, it stunts the plants' growth and results in a smaller crop of peas. Carbon footprint Dr Jebb compares this to humans, who instead of sharing earth's resources, which are more than enough for everyone, compete to exploit them, thereby destroying ourselves in the process. "We've got as much intelligence as those peas," he said. "We've got to reduce so many impacts of the human race so the natural world can survive the climatic change that we've unleashed upon it." Conscious of its own carbon emissions, the botanic gardens - which is managed by the Office of Public Works - is transitioning away from fossil fuels. Dr Jebb said neither the building nor the visitor centre will be heated. Their tropical selection of plant species will be reduced and glasshouses will be used to keep frost off plants. "There is no way we can justify the cost and also the damage these buildings are doing in terms of a carbon footprint." \</doc>

"Fail. Fail. Fail." Poor Mary Lou McDonald, perpetually disappointed by abysmal Government decisions yet still forced into the D\'e1il chamber, week after soul-destroying week, to issue further damning assessments of its most senior politicians and their work. Will she ever see any signs of improvement? About as likely as the Sinn F\'e9in leader opening up to Winston Churchtown to assist him with a second volume of his Mary Lou biography. It must get very tiring, having to mark everyone down. But the Dublin Central TD never gives up hope, no matter how many times she barks an encouraging "must try harder" only for the Taoiseach and his unteachable Ministers to disappoint yet again. Mary Lou had three questions in yesterday's truncated edition of Lambast the Leader, shortened because the Taoiseach was away in Egypt saving the planet. An experienced understudy was rushed into action. One might have expected Near-taoiseach Leo Varadkar to arrive for the main event, but Miche\'e1l Martin's second in command wasn't around either. Fortunately, Leo was not over in Egypt with him, doing a Boris Johnson and trying to upstage his successor. No need for that because he knows he will be rotating into the big job again next month. Unfortunately, this meant Michael Healy-Rae could not cause ructions by accusing the near-taoiseach of being "away with the Pharaohs", which would have been a triumph. Green jacket The Sinn F\'e9in leader, wearing a green jacket, chose the evergreen topic of housing for openers before wrapping herself in the green flag and finally jumping off the D\'e1il fence with a contribution on climate change. Then she finished up by taking a pop at the Government for the mouldy state of the health service. Her three closing words at the end of her first question summed up not only her conclusion on the Coalition's attempts to control the housing crisis, but also her opinion of its success in reaching climate change targets and handling of health policy. "Fail! Fail! Fail!" Which was a surprise. It would save an awful lot of D\'e1il time if Mary Lou was allowed give a brief description to the House of the topic she wishes to address followed by a stentorian "Fail!" and a withering glare at whatever Leaders' Questions victim is across the floor. In yesterday's case, it was the devil-may-care Minister for Expenditure and Public Reform, Michael McGrath, who is not a man easily riz, to put it mildly. Mary Lou thundered at him over housing: young mothers and fathers and their children squeezed into the box rooms of their parents' homes, families languishing on the housing lists, young people emigrating because they can't afford to put a roof over their heads. "The Government is incapable of bringing the required urgency to deliver the homes that are needed," she scolded, adding that the Government is "sitting on" EUR 2 billion in unspent money earmarked for housing while the crisis continues. Darragh O'Brien, the Minister for Housing, whispered urgently to his colleague. Michael responded, quietly. "This Government has acknowledged from the very beginning the scale of the challenge we face as a country in housing and the provision of accommodation for our people, whether it is private housing, public housing, cost rental or affordable purchase. We have prioritised investment in housing since coming into office in the summer of 2020. That is delivering results\~" More has to be done. Challenge still immense. Will rise to it. And so on. Michael started tossing out figures for people housed and builds completed or in the pipeline. Darragh nodded enthusiastically. "This is the right thing to do," murmured the stand-in, before going on the attack without raising his voice. 'New developments' "Sinn F\'e9in deputies are welcoming new developments as they are being opened throughout the country, which they are welcome to do, in addition to turning up at the launches of the Housing for All schemes all over Ireland," he pointed out, despite their leader's complaints. Mary Lou's troops howled in indignation. "Photograph. Photograph," reposted Heather Humphreys, the Minister for Social Protection, who has seen her fair share of smiling Sinn F\'e9in politicians posing beside new houses in her Monaghan constituency. The Minister talked about affordable homes and the Land Development Agency and Darragh's good work and the change to the Central Bank's "macroprudential rules". As for that EUR 2 billion capital underspend he is supposed to be sitting on? Please, Michael. No need to explain. "As the deputy knows, it is always the case that the final quarter of the year is the period in which there is the largest delivery. That is when schemes get closed out, accounts get done and drawdown of payments happens. "There will be no such underspend in housing capital this year. Any underspend, as the deputy knows, is subject to a carry-forward provision whereby it can be carried forward, subject to an overall rule in respect of 10 per cent of the ceiling for that vote into the following year." "The truth" according to the ever-so-measured McGrath, is that Sinn F\'e9in opposed all the Government schemes now helping people buy homes and it opposed the initiatives brought in by the Minister for Housing. A weary, disbelieving voice rose from the Sinn F\'e9in ranks. "Get outta here." No, really. "On this side of the House we are focused on doing everything we possibly can to resolve it," said the Minister. "That side of the House created it," harrumphed Pearse Doherty. It was a relief when Ivana Bacik's turn came. "I'm glad to see the Taoiseach is not here today," the Labour leader informed McGrath, who must have been chuffed. Charming. But she quickly elaborated. She was glad because it was very important to have Miche\'e1l representing Ireland at the Cop27 in Egypt. "It is vital that we see really strong leadership at national and international level on tackling the climate catastrophe." \</doc>

Reporter Juliette Gash has travelled to Kenya with cameraman Mark Ronaghan. Here, along with Ethiopia and Somalia in the Horn of Africa, there are 22 million people experiencing crisis levels of hunger and 4.6 million children are acutely malnourished. Four failed rainy seasons have resulted in the worst drought in 40 years - attributed to climate change. "Welcome to Samburu, where women rule!" - so goes the greeting at Umoja Women's Village in Samburu Province. Matriarch of the village, Rebecca Lolosoli, welcomes the guests, and the other women in the village cheer their appreciation. If only her brave declaration were true. A total of 36 women currently live in the village, most of whom have fled violence at the hands of their husbands. Rebecca said, "many women have died because of violence, they have come here to stop the death of their children and continue living". She said the drought is very bad for people, livestock and wild animals, but most especially for women, because they are responsible for getting water and for providing food for their families. "The women really are suffering," she said. There are tales of bravery and hope in Umoja. In one small hut, 15-year-old Mpanisa Lentiro speaks in a quiet voice about running away from her much older husband. She was his third wife, and he beat her badly. She never wants to go home, as she knows she'll be sent back to her husband or married off again. Her price was two cattle. She is being looked after by 86-year-old Rantilei Lolosoli, who shares her food and hut with her, as well as another 15-year-old. With Rebecca translating, Rantilei said the other girl also escaped an abusive older husband, and female genital mutilation. Women and girls are disproportionately affected by climate change Everlyne Situma is the Humanitarian Strategist for Oxfam in Kenya. She said that women are responsible for fetching water, and during drought they have to travel further to find water. They are vulnerable to attack on those longer journeys, both from wildlife, and human beings. She speaks plainly: "Men eat first, then the children, and women eat whatever is left over." "When we have a drought like this, especially in pastoral communities, the men will marry off their young girls. When they lose livestock ... they marry off their children to get some livestock to keep them going. "At the same time, when there are issues paying school fees for a boy and a girl, they would rather pay school fees for a boy and withdraw the girl and marry off the girl." HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2022/0905/1320721-africa-hunger-crisis/ The Horn of Africa is suffering the worst drought in 40 years , four failed rainy seasons so far, and it is set to get worse. The upcoming October to December rainfall season is also predicted to fail in parts of the Horn of Africa. The World Meteorological Organisation, along with other bodies, has said the unprecedented fifth failed rainy season will deepen the drought in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia. Scientists say the drought has been brought about by climate change. "The current drought, which we have all seen in data sets, in evidence, is very much a record drought. It is very strongly connected with the deteriorating climate change impacts in the Horn and in East Africa." That is the stark assessment by Dr Joseph F Mutemi, a professor at the Department of Earth and Climate Science at the University of Nairobi. Drought caused by climate change, caused by people, but mostly not those living in the Horn of Africa. Stephen Jackson is the UN's resident coordinator in Kenya, which means he coordinates the work of 25 UN agencies in the region, including drought response. It\' s a big job, and one he clearly is passionate about. "We sometimes think of the climate emergency as something that is still to come, but it's right here, right now in Kenya. "It's grossly unfair because Kenya didn't cause the climate emergency, Kenya produces one two thousandth of the world's carbon emissions. Kenya is at 93% renewable energy. "Kenya is a star child in terms of dealing with climate and yet has the misfortune of being on the front lines of experiencing the impacts of climate change because of changes in the Indian Ocean." Yet Dr Jackson is still hopeful, adding that there is huge potential for Kenya. The future "This is a water crisis, and there are ways to make the desert bloom. We must invest in resilience programming. "That's going to come to a head at COP27 . The big environment summit in Egypt in November. "That's already being called Africa's COP. And it's where the rubber is really going to hit the road on financing for climate adaptation. "There's climate mitigation, trying to reduce the climate emergency and climate adaptation, helping people contend with the climate disaster that's already hit them." He said that of the \€ 100bn that was promised by developed countries five years ago, a total of zero has been delivered. "That has to change, and it will change at Africa's COP, you can expect it to be a showdown." Hopeful words again, but it is hard not to draw parallels between that optimism, and Rebecca Lolosoli's bold statement about Samburu women. At the end of our interview, when asked about the future, in which some are already predicting a sixth failed rainy season in 2023, Rebecca is frightened. "What are we going to do? What is going to happen in some months to come. We are not sure if it is going to rain. We are always looking up at the sky, oh the clouds come and then they disappear ... everyone is scared about this, it's not normal." \</doc>

IT has taken the very worst effects of extreme weather to finally turn the tide when it comes to the realisation that fossil fuels are no longer the top dog. The world is finally taking notice that renewable energy is a main driver in getting the world out of the climate change mess that has been caused by humans and their reliance on greenhouse gas emitting power. But the consensus is coming, and momentum is shifting. The latest data bears it out. The International Energy Agency (IEA) world energy outlook (WEO) for 2022 predicts that global demand for each of the fossil fuels shows a peak or plateau across all scenarios mapped out in various scenarios. Crucially, the IEA has rubbished claims in some quarters from renewable skeptics that such sources are prohibitively expensive. "The WEO's analysis finds scant evidence to support claims from some quarters that climate policies and net zero commitments contributed to the run-up in energy prices. "In the most affected regions, higher shares of renewables were correlated with lower electricity prices - and more efficient homes and electrified heat have provided an important buffer for some consumers, albeit far from enough. The heaviest burden is falling on poorer households where a larger share of income is spent on energy," it said. Finally, governments and world leaders are committing to longer-term measures, as outlined at the UN climate change summit in Egypt this month, Cop27 , and building on pledges made at Cop26 in Glasgow last year. After an almighty tussle with even members of his own party, US President Joe Biden scored arguably his most significant policy victory with the passing of US Inflation Reduction Act, which is a major sea change in how the US will tackle its climate change ambitions in the future. Along with the likes of the EU's Fit for 55 and REPowerEU programmes, Japan's Green Transformation (GX) programme, Korea aim to increase the share of nuclear and renewables in its energy mix, and there are now ambitious clean energy targets in China and India, according to the IEA's outlook. These new measures help propel global clean energy investment to more than $2 trillion a year by 2030, a rise of more than 50% from today, it said. "Energy markets and policies have changed as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, not just for the time being, but for decades to come. Even with today's policy settings, the energy world is shifting dramatically before our eyes. Government responses around the world promise to make this a historic and definitive turning point towards a cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy system," IEA executive director Dr Fatih Birol said. The IEA said that for the first time ever, an outlook scenario based on today's prevailing policy settings means that global demand for every fossil fuel is at peak or at least plateauing by the middle of this decade. In Ireland, there is a ready, willing, and very able renewable energy industry waiting to take advantage of newfound and very hard-earned opportunities. According to Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin, the new Maritime Area Regulatory Authority (Mara) will, while not being the panacea, will significantly ease the blockages and uncertainties within the renewable energy system when it comes to offshore wind. It cannot come fast enough, and the likes of Wind Energy Ireland and Wind Europe have emphasised that time is of the essence when it comes to taking the opportunities that come Ireland's way. Solar's potential remains relatively untapped in Ireland, but could be a boon for jobs and homeowners alike, according to a comprehensive report from leading experts. Siddharth Joshi and Dr Paul Deane of MaREI, the SFI Research Centre for Energy, Climate, and Marine at University College Cork (UCC), found in a report this summer that "there are significant potential financial savings for people from their rooftops". "Beyond the positive impact on bills, solar PV provides an option for people to directly participate in the battle against climate change. Solar panels could be the entry point for many people on their sustainability journey," the Irish Solar Energy Association (ISEA), which commissioned the report, said. About 24,000 homes have already begun this transition, the report found. "As this report shows, the rooftops of Ireland have substantial potential. Many jobs will be needed to deliver this solar opportunity. These roles traverse a range of activities across the trades and business. These are purposeful jobs with real meaning. Enabling participation in the energy transition will only not create employment, but ensure that people are included in Ireland's decarbonisation journey." Meanwhile, a report into the economic impact of wind farms in Cork this year found that more than 7m has been paid in rates to Cork County Council in 2022, while communities received 437,000 in direct community benefit funding in 2020. When onshore wind works with local communities, and includes them in key decision-making and has real consultation, the proof is in the pudding. Susan Morton of Ballyvourney Tidy Towns said: "The Wind Farm Community Benefit Fund has positively impacted the community, we were able to do projects which we could not have afforded otherwise. This fund has supported us to create an inclusive, enjoyable space in our community which fosters social inclusion and physical and mental well-being." Timo Shinnors of Ballyhoura Mountain Bike Club said: "With the support of Castlepook Wind Farm Community Fund, we were able to buy a timing system which allows us to run events that get local members out on their bikes, support the development of mountain bike talent to compete on the world stage and bring competitors to beautiful Ballyhoura, from all over the country." There must be no going back to the patterns of destruction that have caused our planet to reach unprecedented levels of global heating, putting not only its people at risk, but also causing a biodiversity crisis that threatens the extinction of millions of species. Renewable energy is the future, at home and abroad. Ireland cannot risk missing out when so much is at stake. \</doc>

RUSSIA'S war on Ukraine reveals a new dynamic of non-alignment in the international system. Western leaders find themselves more isolated on the global stage than they expected. When the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) has taken votes to condemn Russia's aggression, China and many others have abstained or opposed them. Major democracies such as Brazil, Indonesia, India, Senegal, and South Africa have hedged their positions on the war. And by hosting and sending high-level delegations, Russia has been competing with the EU and US for influence in various regional blocs, intensively courting members of the African Union and the Association of South-east Asian Nations. Why are so many countries wary of taking sides, even after seeing the unspeakable suffering Russia has inflicted on civilians in Ukraine? Part of the reason is a widespread perception of European double standards and Europe's uneven diplomacy on issues such as Covid-19 vaccines, debt relief, migration, and climate financing. Moreover, many fear alienating Russia, given the vast leverage it has over energy and commodity prices. By upending Europe's energy landscape and highlighting its dangerous energy dependencies, the war underscores the volatility of today's fossil-fuel geopolitics. In the run-up to November's UN Climate Change Conference in Egypt ( COP27 ), and beyond it, the new non-alignment will become apparent in the sphere of energy diplomacy. It will be important to remember that the world's commitment to the 2015 Paris climate agreement is a direct threat to Russia's petrostate economic model and broader geopolitical strategy of cultivating profitable energy dependencies. At the onset of the invasion, Russia was the largest exporter of oil and gas to the EU. Several months in, skyrocketing prices resulted in the EU accounting for 70% of Russia's record fossil-fuel export revenues, reinforcing the Kremlin's belief that Europe would ultimately find it too costly to resist the aggression. But the EU has shown resolve in supporting the Ukrainian people and doubling down on decarbonisation within the framework of the European Green Deal. For example, its REPowerEU plan, agreed in response to Russia's war, has further deepened the bloc's institutional commitment to the Paris agreement. And yet measures to close Europe's immediate energy-supply gap have leant additional momentum to the new non-alignment. It has contributed to energy- and commodity-price inflation - just as the Kremlin intended when it engineered a natural-gas shortage in Europe. As Europeans have rushed to buy non-Russian oil and liquefied natural gas in already-tight global markets, countries such as Bangladesh and Pakistan have struggled - just as they were suffering scorching heatwaves - to pay for the LNG needed to power their electricity grids. Similarly, oil scarcities produced record-breaking profits of $ 59bn for the fossil-fuel industry in the second quarter of this year, while pushing up energy costs in many heavily indebted economies and emboldening non-aligned exporters such as Saudi Arabia. And more broadly, Europe's rush to diversify its short-term energy supply is triggering a scramble for new fossil-fuel infrastructure, undermining the global multilateral push towards decarbonisation along with the EU's own credibility. Between Germany's pledge to invest in new gas fields in Senegal and the EU's inclusion of gas in its sustainable-finance taxonomy, there have been unhelpful mixed signals, damaging the prospects for a cohesive European approach to climate diplomacy. Non-alignment offers developing countries and emerging markets new avenues to boost their autonomy in foreign and energy policy. Indirectly, that will reduce pressure on Russia and allow it to pursue a war of attrition, rather than seeking a rapid end to hostilities. And as we learned from this summer's drawn-out negotiations over Ukrainian grain - which the Kremlin repeatedly scuttled and has since threatened to abandon - Russia will continue to seek advantageous bilateral deals and other forms of leverage wherever it can. That does not bode well for the macroeconomic picture, or the Paris agenda. Global recession fears and rising interest rates have immediate implications for climate action, especially as it relates to the crucial issues of finance and debt. Sovereign debts have been rising throughout the pandemic, leaving 60% of low-income countries at risk of debt distress. Yet under current conditions, it will be difficult for advanced economies to make the domestic case for expanding grant aid to other countries, or for those same recipient countries to take on more debt in the form of concessional climate finance. Europe, for example, is under enormous fiscal pressure across the board. Shoring up the credibility of its climate-finance framework when it has so much else on its plate will not be easy. One top priority, of course, is to keep supporting Ukraine militarily, and to increase defence spending within the EU. Another is to prepare for winter. The expert consensus is crystal clear: The risks of supply shortages are real, and no amount of alternative gas imports will offset them. To avert shortage-driven crises, Europe will need to roll out comprehensive energy-savings schemes that could include shutting down some gas-consuming industrial facilities; leveraging alternative supplies; fuel switching; and a rapid deployment of renewables, heat pumps, and home renovations. A related priority is to prevent the energy crisis from creating a broader social crisis. Intense upward pressure on the cost of living will require strong and hugely costly social-policy measures to manage inflation, and targeted energy-efficiency programmes to address fuel poverty. But Europeans should recognise that it is in their interest to rise to the global climate finance challenge. In 2009, advanced economies committed to providing $ 100bn per year to support climate-related investments in developing countries. But this threshold still has never been crossed, and according to the OECD, the rich world is still $ 17bn short to this day. While Europeans aren't solely responsible for this failure, they must recognise how it looks to the rest of the world when they mobilise far greater sums for themselves in response to crises such as Covid-19 and the war in Ukraine. These are not auspicious times for multilateralism. What we achieved with the Paris agreement in 2015 could not have been done in 2022. With hindsight, 2015 - also the year of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Iran nuclear deal - may be remembered as a high point for international co-operation. But the deleterious effects of climate change are gathering pace, regardless of diplomatic alignments. The Paris agreement has become a guardrail for collective action - one that must stand even when other arrangements are shaking. By pursuing co-ordinated climate policies, we can also create new conditions to support peace and security, and new forms of co-operation. It won't be easy, but we have no choice.

Sir - Miche\'e1l Martin was in fine fettle during his rousing speech at the COP27 shindig in the heart of 'democratic' Egypt. So stirring, in fact, I waited anxiously for him to say that the two trillion spondulix needed to compensate the poorer countries most affected by climate change was going to be easy-peasy to find. It goes without saying, he inferred, that it's all our fault, and the full amount will be forthcoming - as a token of altruistic leadership in this troubled planet. What a generous man.

DAVID Ryan wonders why the British government intends to skip this year's COP27 climate conference in Sharm El Sheikh, "a big opportunity to have a real say" on climate change (Letters, Irish Independent October 31, 2022). I remember when 2013's COP19 in Lima was our "last chance" to save the planet. The funny thing about missing these "last chances", though, is that you can always just go the following year instead.

Twitter has informed its Irish-based staff who are at risk of redundancy that it intends to comply with its statutory requirements to inform the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment about matters to do with its plans to reduce its workforce here. The company has also told impacted employees that they are not required to work during the 30-day consultation period and has asked that they do not come into the office. However, affected staff have been told no decisions will be made on redundancies until the end of that time and in the interim they will continue to receive all pay and contractual benefits. In the communication, Twitter also told them that while their access to the company's systems has been turned off, this does not mean that it will not consult with them. The T\'e1naiste Leo Varadkar will meet officials from both the IDA and Enterprise Ireland this evening, where it is expected they will focus on tech sector jobs. The meeting comes after Twitter, Meta and Stripe all either signalled or announced job cuts in recent days. At the weekend HYPERLINK RT\'c9 News revealed that Mr Vardakar had not yet received a collective redundancy notification from Twitter. Companies are also required to carry out a 30-day consultation with employees and their representatives where collective redundancies are being proposed. HYPERLINK https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2022/1104/1333125-twitter-musk/ In an update to staff who were notified on Friday that their role was potentially impacted or at risk of redundancy, Twitter said that in line with its legal obligations it will inform the minister of a number of things related to its plans, including the identity of employee representatives, once they have been elected. The company also reiterated that employee representatives will be consulted before any final decisions are made. The staff were informed that roughly 50% of Twitter\' s global workforce of 7,500 will be impacted by the cost-saving measures, but the precise percentage varies by team, function and location and more detailed information will be provided during the consultation period. Taoiseach urges calm over job loss reports The Taoiseach said there are clearly issues in the digital sector and the Government is always concerned when there are potential job losses. However, Miche\'e1l Martin said that there should not be panic about the recent job losses in Twitter and potential losses elsewhere. Speaking at the COP27 conference in Egypt, he said that what happens globally does impact on Ireland, and the Government will consult with the IDA and with the companies involved. There are realities globally that we cannot change, he said, and we need to decide how we regroup and face the challenges. Mr Martin said that there have been similar situations in the past and he pointed out that other sectors in Ireland are continuing to grow. 30 days notice required A barrister specialising in employment law has said under Irish law a company that is laying off staff must notify the employees and the minister 30 days before they let people go. "A company who is engaging in collective redundancies has to consult with employees and inform employees, and also has to notify the minister 30 days before the first dismissal, so it is perfectly in order for an employer to commence the consultation and information process before notifying the minister and that may be well what we're seeing here now," Cathy Maguire said. Speaking on RT\'c9's Morning Ireland, Cathy Maguire said if a company does not serve sufficient notice an employer can be prosecuted, and it faces fines from \€ 5,000 up to \€ 250,000. "Not only is the company at risk of prosecution, but also the officers of the company so that's a reasonable disincentive," she stated. "The fact that the prosecution may be maintained not only against the company but against the officers does assist in that regard, and perhaps this is something that needs to be revisited by the legislature having regard to the scale of the companies now operating in Ireland," she stated. Individuals can also bring a claim that they have been unfairly dismissed.. "If they're selected for redundancy, they may assert that they have been unfairly dismissed and the maximum award is two years' compensation for any losses accrued," she explained. "So, in other words, if they mitigate if they get another job, then that they won't have accrued those losses and they can also seek reinstatement or re-engagement if the company is still operating in Ireland." She explained that even if someone joins a union, they cannot insist on the employer dealing with their trade union in the context of the consultation process required by the 1977 Act. "But of course, a union could assist them in being represented by a fellow employee," she added. Brian Caulfied, Chair of Scale Ireland, which represents indigenous tech companies here, told RT\'c9's News at One that what's happening with bigger tech companies globally may benefit smaller companies here and be an opportunity for the likes of highly skilled Twitter workers to be recruited elsewhere. He added that it was inevitable due to recessions across the globe and changes in the sector, that Ireland's take-in of corporation tax from the tech sector will reduce. He said that very strong relationships exist in the indigenous tech sector, so he couldn't say that there won't be any impact of recent moves by Twitter and Meta, but according to the latest survey by Scale Ireland, the biggest single problem for the sector was recruitment of good quality staff. "There is an opportunity that there will be people with fantastic skills exiting from some of larger companies and opportunities for them to consider joining an indigenous startup." He added that he did not think there will be a huge impact from a sales perspective, as most Irish companies are selling on a global basis but there may be issues from the investment side both publicly and privately. He said that Ireland and the world is in a very different economic environment compared to the last number of years, where there was a period of extremely low interest rates and low inflation, where growth and future profits of tech companies were very attractive to investors and they were prepared to pay a big premium for that growth but "that has now reversed, which inevitably readjustment and evaluations of tech companies". He added that parts of the world are already in recession and that is inevitably going to hit earnings in big tech companies so they\' re taking action to right size the business in such an environment. He said that broadly speaking the balance is right in Ireland in terms of dependence on the tech sector. He added that the foreign and direct investment sector has delivered in a big way for the Irish economy but "the Government has been wise to avoid applying excess corporate tax gains to core spending, because it\' s inevitable to see a reduction in corporation tax from big tech companies over the next number of years, and that will have an impact on the wider economy". Technology Ireland, the Ibec group that represents the technology industry, has described the current changes as a rightsizing of the tech sector. "We saw over 30% growth in the tech sector in Ireland over the last two years and really this is a stabilisation of the sector in this post-Covid era," said Una Fitzpatrick, Director of Technology Ireland. "There is still phenomenal growth happening in the indigenous tech sector here and now there is a real opportunity, with this very mobile international tech talent, to keep them in the country and we want to make sure those resources are utilised as much as possible within the tech sector here," Ms Fitzpatrick said.

Israel and Jordan have signed a declaration of intent at the UN climate conference to conserve and protect their shared Jordan River - a sacred waterway nearly running dry because of climate change, pollution and other threats. The agreement, struck at the Cop27 summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, marks an important initial step in co-operation. Water co-operation was a key element of the 1994 peace treaty between the two countries, but chilly relations over recent decades have complicated efforts to increase water supply to the river.

Sir - I turned on my radio last week to hear an RT\'c9 newsreader state: "Eamon Ryan is to ask permission of his government colleagues for him to be allowed to attend the COP27 conference in Egypt." I doubt if either Taoiseach Miche\'e1l Martin or Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney could have refused Mr Ryan and his advisers a trip to the Red Sea resort of Sharm El Sheikh. Martin and Coveney are to go there themselves, accompanied by a sizeable number of 'experts' to "make a valuable contribution" at the many functions that are to take place in the Egyptian sunshine. One can only wonder how much of an entourage those Irish ministers will deploy to the holiday resort. Tom Baldwin, Midleton, Co Cork \</doc>

When teacher Patrick Kirwan first raised the question of sustainability and climate change in his school, he didn't get the answer he was hoping for. "Nobody was talking about it;" says Kirwan, who teaches at Ardscoil na Mara in Waterford. "Nobody was talking about plant or about biodiversity loss." So he started the conversation. He began by taking steps towards creating a sustainable school. Kirwan involved students from his school and others in a "plant a planet" initiative and, as a result, more than 1,200 trees were planted in back gardens around the country. The project helped highlight the importance individual actions can have when tackling climate change. "You might think individual actions aren't significant or 'Can one tree make a difference?' But over 1,200 trees, that's pretty cool," says Kirwan. He believes no school is an island when it comes to educating students about climate change. In 2020 he established the Irish Schools Sustainability Network (ISSN). The network, which started with just two schools, now has 100 schools registered. Students and teachers meet online once a month to discuss environmental topics. "It's not about teachers, or students," says Kirwan. "It's about working as equals to address this." As part of ISSN's drive to create increased awareness and education around climate change, biodiversity loss and sustainability in education, they are running an online climate and nature summit this week. The event is deliberately being run at the same time as the United Nations' Climate Change Summit, COP27 , November 7th-11th. More than 3,000 teachers registered to participate in the debut summit in 2021, and Kirwan hopes they will exceed that number this year. Former president of Ireland Mary Robinson has recorded the opening address for this year's summit. In her speech she draws the students' attention to the topic of climate justice. "The worst impacts are being felt by those least responsible," says Robinson. There will be two video-based lessons available daily during the summit for primary and post-primary schools, and teachers can access them at times convenient to their school day. Kirwan has been co-ordinating the programme for post-primary schools and says the focus is on sparking meaningful debate and critical thinking through a series of thought-provoking workshops. The lessons deal with topics such as fast fashion, greenwashing and Irish rainforests and, while the subject matter may be serious, Kirwan has managed to incorporate some humour with a session from Colm O'Regan on "doing comedy in a crisis". How children learn Mary Moore, a primary schoolteacher with a PhD in sustainable schools, is leading the section of the summit aimed at primary level. She decided to build on the work done in the previous summit by adopting a thematic approach to the activities , "to make the planning and rollout easier for teachers but also because it's the way children learn," she says. This approach will help give sustainability education a wider reach by not confining it to science and geography. "Those subjects are great entry points, but this summit is for the child who loves the challenges of music or drama as well." Moore decided that she wanted literacy to be the starting point for the primary school summit and her first point of contact was Fighting Words, the company that promotes creative writing by facilitating free writing workshops for schools. "They promote the idea of critical thinking and creativity," says Moore. "If you're planning thematically, you need to connect it to literacy." Collie Ennis, research associate at Trinity College Dublin's department of zoology, has also been enlisted by Moore for the summit and will be talking to primary schools about how to create a school pond. She believes this activity will provide schools with an attainable idea for action as they take steps towards promoting sustainability. "It's all in the move to take action, however small that may be," she says. "But it's through action that we will change mindsets, and think differently about how we deal with things, how we live, and how we interact with the world around us." ISSN is not alone in helping schools tackle climate change. Elaine Nevin, director of Eco-Unesco, has been involved in promoting action in environmental education since 1995. Along with supporting the upcoming nature and climate summit, Eco-Unesco also works with young people through a variety of workshops and practical projects that focus on action and empowerment. "We engage young people, we educate them, we inspire them, and we support them to act," says Nevin. "One of our flagship programmes is the Young Environmentalist Awards (YEA). It's about young people taking action on environmental issues at a local level." Non-negotiable Students who wish to participate in the awards can register now for next year's event. They can choose any environmental issue that interests them but Nevin says there is one area that is non-negotiable. "We always encourage good research and using trusted sources of information - that's really important . And then the real focus is about taking that and putting it into action." The most recent report compiled by the World Meteorological Organisation for the UN tells the unsettling truth that current mitigation measures will not succeed in keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees of pre-industrial levels and that mitigation pledges need to be seven times higher. While this news is daunting, it is important that the delivery of the message to students is managed so anxiety is avoided and action is achieved. Nevin says keeping the focus local can help reduce eco-anxiety. "When you look at things from a global perspective, they can become very frightening. It can become overwhelming," says Nevin. "Encouraging the students to use the global perspective to inform how they will act on a local level can help to give them a sense of empowerment and see the importance of their actions." Moore says that, to prevent eco-anxiety among primary schoolchildren, the focus should be on positivity. "In primary schools, if we are doing anything in this area, it has to be about hope and hopeful endeavour," says Moore. "We need to instil in children a sense of positivity with regards to the future, the climate and the environment." P\'e1draig Cawley, principal of Ardscoil na Mara, says while it is important to have the climate change conversation with students, schools must moderate it to prevent anxiety. "It's about getting the conversation started, not putting the onus on them to fix it. We must be mindful that, along with growing up, getting a job, and going to college, they don't feel that they must fix the planet too," says Cawley. "We need to have an awareness around not putting the burden on the kids because they're not the problem, but they are definitely part of the solution." The school has several initiatives in place that promote sustainability on an ongoing basis. Five Minutes of Sustainability is the name of a series of videos sponsored by Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Cawley believes that, while teaching the students about sustainability is part of a school's role, it can be done in subtle ways. "There are simple steps that can be taken by both staff and students to engage them," says Cawley. "I love the idea of the awareness being developed in schools, and there's a lot of subtle ways that can happen. For example we're asking people to just check that the machines are off in the evening and to switch off their projectors - all simple stuff. It's not rocket science."

Growing up in rural Ireland in the 1950s and 1960s a person would be deafened by the sound of birdsong. Now the countryside is significantly quieter. In the 1980s and 1990s a summer drive would see the car windscreen covered in insects. Not any more. Today it is getting harder to tell the seasons apart and the warmth of this autumn has been unsettling. On May 9th, 2019, D\'e1il \'c9ireann declared a climate and biodiversity emergency, a historic moment and the result of many years of campaigning and debate inside and outside the chamber. The stark predictions of devastating consequences for humanity posed by climate change were repeatedly laid out by the scientists of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and finally proved impossible to ignore. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is the biodiversity equivalent of the IPCC, and in 2019 it issued its own stark warning, that "nature is declining globally at rates unprecedented in human history - and the rate of species extinctions is accelerating, with grave impacts on people around the world". The drivers of biodiversity loss are listed in descending order: changes in land and sea use; direct exploitation of organisms; climate change; pollution; and invasive alien species. The biodiversity and climate crises are thus interlinked, broadly caused by the same processes (human activity) and interacting with and amplifying the effects of each other, which will have severe negative impacts on human wellbeing. It is this interlinkage that requires the biodiversity and climate crises to be addressed in tandem, a fact acknowledged by the 2019 D\'e1il declaration, and which now underpins joint work by the IPCC and IPBES. Cop27 draws to a conclusion, the message to government should be loud and clear: Ireland must do its fair share in reducing greenhouse gas emissions urgently; anything less is inexcusable. We believe solutions exist for a just and environmentally sustainable transition that saves our biodiversity for future generations. Scale of biodiversity loss The scale of Ireland's biodiversity loss has been captured in many reports, including the 2019 report by the National Parks and Wildlife Service outlining the state of Ireland's EU-protected habitats and species. It showed that 85 per cent of these habitats had "bad" or "inadequate" status, including peatlands. We know less about the condition of habitats outside this protected area network due to inadequate research but we can learn a lot about the state of nature through monitoring birds; they are the proverbial canaries in the coalmine. BirdWatch Ireland and the RSPB Northern Ireland publish the Birds of Conservation Concern in Ireland assessment every six years. The most recent assessment in 2021 shows the status of 63 per cent of Ireland's 211 regularly occurring wild bird species are categorised as red or amber due to moderate to severe declines. This was the worst assessment since they began in 1998. Upland and lowland farmland birds, wading birds and seabirds have the worst status. Drivers of losses in Ireland mirror the drivers in the IPBES global assessment. Sectoral policies in agriculture, afforestation, peat cutting, infrastructure development and inappropriate fishing, are making land and sea more inhospitable for these species to survive. Interlinked crises As with climate change, decades of failure by the Irish State to address biodiversity loss has left us with little time to reverse it. Failure to comply with EU law, which Ireland helped to write There has been a renewed and sustained focus on climate action in Ireland over the past few years, which is critical and welcome. Climate change is projected to adversely impact genetic variability, species richness and populations, and ecosystems. The loss of biodiversity through the loss of peatlands and wetlands will in turn increase emissions from the land use sector, demonstrating the need to put biodiversity at the heart of climate action. Afforestation, onshore and offshore wind farms and greenways are essential actions on climate mitigation, and Ireland has ambitious targets in these areas. Done properly these much-needed developments present a win-win for communities and the environment. Done badly and they risk worsening biodiversity loss and alienating local communities. Increasing our dismal rates of afforestation, for example, is a good thing as we need more trees for carbon sequestration, wood products and, depending on the type of forest, the habitats they can provide. Tree planting, whether conifers or broadleaves, targeted on high nature value (HNV) farmland, however, obliterates seminatural grasslands that can be very rich in biodiversity from lichens, fungi, bryophytes, vascular plants such as sedges, grasses, wildflowers and all the insects they support, including bees and butterflies and ground-nesting bird species and mammals. Tree plantations not only wipe out the HNV habitats of these species such as the curlew and the corncrake, but the additional tree cover in the landscape attracts foxes and crows, which prey on eggs and chicks of threatened species, putting population restoration at risk as already depleted numbers are decimated further. Development of offshore wind energy has become more urgent for both climate and energy security reasons, with long-term proposals to strategically plan wind farms in Irish waters within the context of developing a network of marine protected areas (MPAs). However, in the short term several wind farms may get planning permission in the Irish Sea before the MPA network or marine Special Protected Areas are identified and designated. Some wind farm proposals indirectly threaten globally important seabird colonies such as that of the roseate tern on Rockabill island and could cause significant adverse impacts. Twenty-three of Ireland's 24 breeding seabirds are red or amber-listed birds of conservation concern. Following the science It is important to state that challenges to biodiversity presented by planned climate actions can be overcome by following the science. There are solutions, including: sensitivity mapping (understanding the optimal locations for wind developments and forestry); improving quality of surveying; better collection and sharing of data and more ecologists working at all levels of decision-making bodies. To date the Forest Service has declined to use sensitivity mapping, though this approach is promoted by the European Commission. It is misleading to frame a trade-off between urgent climate action and biodiversity protection as necessary and inevitable. The real trade-off is between climate and biodiversity policies that deliver for farmers, communities and nature or those that prioritise short-term, narrowly defined economic interests. For example, concentrating afforestation in areas where HNV farming is practised but where incomes are lower is simply shifting the burden for emissions reductions in the land-use sector from the richest to the poorest farmers. This will exacerbate inequality and lead to poor environmental outcomes and resentment. Addressing legacy issues such as the drainage of our peatlands and wetlands and tackling pollution from excessive agriculture nutrient use should be a priority in climate action. Afforestation should be undertaken not merely where farm incomes are marginal but where it is most suitable, as designated by the science. In our marine area, allowing a developer-led rollout of offshore wind without the requisite marine spatial planning, research and data on marine life or zoning for potential MPAs will lead to poor planning and negative impacts on marine biodiversity. Protect and restore The Irish Government bravely led the way in Europe on targeted, results-based agri-environmental schemes to support farmers to farm for threatened wildlife and habitats. We now call on the Government to lead the way on the EU's nature restoration law. By adopting legally binding targets in Irish law, the Government would be compelled to restore habitats at scale, particularly habitats that can help us mitigate climate change such as peatlands and grasslands, and adapt to sea level rise and extreme weather events such as floodplains, dune habitats and coastal wetlands. Early engagement with farmers, ecologists and the rural community in this will be key. The Government should also follow the science on biodiversity, to utilise approaches such as sensitivity mapping for planning and focus on climate action measures in the land-use sector that enhance our environment rather than threaten it. Wild birds in Ireland are an important part of our cultural heritage, celebrated in poetry and song but we could be the first country to see the extinction of the curlew. Through our short-sighted actions we are denying future generations the joy of experiencing the full diversity of Irish nature and of hearing the birdsong we were privileged to have grown up with.

Sir - A huge amount of human suffering is caused by climate change, and it seems the people who cause the least damage are the ones suffering the most. Because of our actions in driving economic development through the use of fossil fuels, we owe it to these people to have a levy on the fossil fuel industry to support those areas where people are suffering because of climate change. Two big fossil fuel companies each posted profits of (EURO)8bn for the past three months - surely it would not be too much to ask them to support development programmes in these countries. Agencies such as Tr\'f3caire, Concern, Oxfam and Unicef are doing great work in these places, but need to be more supportfrom the so-called developed world. The Government should put forward proposals at COP27 to address this matter. Conall Shovlin, Ardara, Co Donegal \</doc>

AS COP27 takes place, German chancellor Olaf Scholz has returned from a meeting with President Xi Jinping of China. Having been burnt by a totalitarian regime in Russia, the German economy is going to rely on the good offices of another totalitarian regime. At a time when the world economy needs to go into a managed suspended animation, it appears the accruing of wealth, ie. numbers on a page, is favoured over actual human survival. This is the acceptable world now. Deranged billionaires play games in Ukraine on social media and in world politics.

Sir, - The answers to our climate crisis may not all be found at Cop 27 in Sharm el-Sheikh. This week in local shops I found beetroot from France, courgettes and onions from Spain, and carrots from Denmark. Surely we could substantially reduce our carbon footprint by meeting as much of our needs as possible locally, if not nationally? - Yours, etc, ELIZABETH CULLEN, Kilcullen, Co Kildare. \</doc>

A NOTE to the Taoiseach and the incoming Taoiseach - it's not just the Irish people who are watching what happens at COP27 , the world is watching and future generations are watching. The science has long been settled. We know what we, particularly in wealthy countries, are doing to our only home, and we know what is causing this. We are the first generation to understand the extent of the damage we are doing to the planet. We may be the last to be able to halt it. The time for rhetoric and doublespeak is long gone and urgent action is now needed. Ireland is the third-highest emitter of greenhouse gases per capita in the EU. If we are to comply with our carbon budget for 2021 to 2025, it will require at least an 8pc compound reduction in emissions from 2023 to 2025. Are you going to show leadership on this, the most crucial issue facing us? Are you going to take risks, look beyond the short-term and face down vested interests who profit from destructive industries - for example, agribusiness, which is our biggest sectoral polluter? What is your legacy going to be? Rob Sadlier Rathfarnham, Dublin 16 \</doc>

THE UK is due to unveil detailed plans to cut spending and lift taxes, following its disastrous "mini budget" in September that triggered the exit of then prime minister Liz Truss and her finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng. On Thursday, chancellor of the exchequer Jeremy Hunt is expected to announce measures totalling at least \£350bn ((EURO)59bn) to plug the hole left after the September plan led to a huge rise in debt costs. The COP27 meeting of world leaders to discuss climate issues goes into a second week in Egypt, while US president Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are due to meet face-to-face for the first time in office at the G20 summit in Indonesia today. The CSO is due to publish an updated Irish trade balance tomorrow and house price data on Wednesday. A breakdown of inflation by household type, due on Friday, may help shape the policy response to rising prices. The Central Bank's latest update from its National Claims Information Database insurance tracker will focus on motor injuries. Kainos has a trading update today, with Dole to report Q3 numbers on Thursday. \</doc>

AT COP27 , world leaders gathered and admitted the waters around them have grown, but have they accepted that soon we will be drenched to the bone? That we better start swimming or we'll sink like a stone. Writers and scientists have prophesied with their pens, now is the time to act and our chance won't come again, as Bob Dylan wrote decades ago. For years the doorways of progress have been blocked by congressmen and politicians have failed to heed the calls for action. The science is unwavering: "He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled." The battle outside raging will soon shake our windows and rattle our walls. The "old road is rapidly ageing", the climate is changing, and the old order is quickly fading. Our sons and daughters are beyond our command, and they have been going to great lengths to make us understand. The line has been drawn, the curse it is cast, as the present now will later be past. The times, they are a-changin', and I wonder if our leaders have taken (or will take) the steps needed to make a significant difference? Do the actions they have taken suggest they really believe our world is worth saving? Elliot McCarthy Rochestown, Cork \</doc>

Abitter and hotly contested book auction took place in October, with five big publishing houses slugging it out over a much-hyped new manuscript by a social media and podcasting star. In the end, DK Life was triumphant, netting the rights to It's Not That Radical, the debut book by UK climate activist, Mikaela Loach. A few years ago this scenario would have been unheard of. Books on nature and climate science have been an enduring niche of the publishing industry for decades but rarely attracted broader attention. Until just before the pandemic, when the subject went mainstream. According to figures from Nielsen BookScan in 2019, sales of books in the environment/ecology category were breaking all records, with the market rising in value by over 300pc in one year. The pandemic put a significant slow to the gallop of this trend in green publishing. But in recent months it seems to be gradually firing back into life, with nature writing emerging as a new area of growth. In just the last few months, some of the world's most prominent thinkers and writers have been turning their attention to the environment. There's Greta Thunberg's debut, The Climate Book, released this summer following a storm of publicity, and currently going strong on the bestseller lists. Across the Atlantic, Braiding Sweetgrass, a collection of essays by botanist and native American writer Robin Wall Kimmerer, whose central thesis is that only by attuning to the natural world around us can we hope to save it from destruction, has spent 133 weeks on the US bestseller list. And it's not just activists and scientists dedicating themselves to spreading the word - 2022 was also the year Pulitzer Prize-winner novelist Annie Proulx released a new work of nonfiction, Fen, Bog and Swamp, in which she brings her feted literary flair to the subject of "peatland destruction, and its role in the climate crisis". In popular culture, the climate has gradually been moving into the mainstream as a subject that can attract audiences. The trend argua- bly started in 2006, when Al Gore released the documentary An Inconvenient Truth, which was produced to educate people about global warming and remains the 11th highest grossing documentary released in the US. In 2015, Naomi Klein released her bestseller This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs the Climate, which was translated into 25 languages. Last year, the political satire about the impending ecological disaster facing humanity, Don't Look Up had four Oscar nominations. And yet, as climate issues move centre stage - literally, at COP27 , which concludes on Friday - renewed attention is failing to translate into meaningful action. Projected figures published in September indicate that 2022 is likely to be a record-breaking year in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. For decades, climate scientists and activists have been puzzling over the issue of how to bridge the communications gap. Among those whose professional lives are dedicated to researching the environment, there is a pervasive sense of despair at the lack of political will and public action to address the urgency of the crisis. This year, more scientists than ever before have been resorting to desperate protest measures to raise awareness. In June, Peter Kalmus a scientist at Nasa was arrested after chaining himself to the door of the JP Morgan Chase bank in LA. Soon after, scientist Rose Abramoff chained herself to the White House fence, and last month five UK-based climate scientists glued their own hands to a British government building. Writer James Baldwin said: "The world changes according to the way people see it - and if you alter, even by a millimetre, the way people look at reality, then you can change it." " It's a credo which Denise Baden, professor of sustainability at the University of Southampton and author of genre fiction has taken very much to heart. She is a founder of the Green Stories writing competitions, which have been set up to incentivise fiction writers to embed green principles into theirwar - Loach storytelling. Baden devotes much of her spare time to puzzling over ways that she can use her creativity to nudge her readers into adopting more environmentally-friendly habits. She believes that much of the problem comes down to the apocalyptic tone of the discussion, which she argues makes people feel helpless and then disengage. "It's a worrying field to be in," she says, explaining that in her position she has "a good sense of what needs to happen and what shouldn't happen. And there's a communication barrier, an engagement barrier. "A lot of us suffer from eco-anxiety. I've probably got a clearer view than most about what needs to happen - but how do you get that out there? "Few people read academic articles. So that's why I kind of thought fiction might be a way to move beyond preaching to the converted the whole time." Denise has carried out research, based on her own work, on how to "inspire green behaviour" through storytelling. Though apocalyptic climate fiction is a growing sub-genre, she doesn't believe it is the best way to achieve that goal. "It's kind of depressing," she says of apocalyptic fiction. "It focuses very much on raising awareness of what terrible things are going to happen, and the predictions for the future are really dystopian." Overall, she doesn't find it inspiring. "I get enough of that in my day job," she says dryly. Instead, she's been keen on exploring "the question of how to use mainstream fiction to smuggle in green solutions". That's what she aimed to do in her self-published novel (as DA Baden) Habitat Man. It's a classic rom-com, with eco-education smuggled in. "For example, pesticides and flea treatments and worming treatments for pets are really bad for our ecology," she says. "If I wrote an academic article on that, who is going to read it? Whereas I put that into my rom-com, just as an aside during a bit of romantic banter, and loads of people have said: 'I never knew that.'" Through Green Stories, she's keen to encourage other novelists to do the same, and is convinced that this approach is more effective that scare stories in its power to change behaviour. She's done her own research on a sample of people who have read Habitat Man, and it shows that most people who read the book adopted at least one green alternative, directly as a result. "That was my motivation - to find a new way to engage with people. In my book I don't talk at all about any drastic issues. With biodiversity decline or habitat loss, I just go straight to the plot, the character and the solutions," she says. Irish writer and illustrator Ois\'edn McGann agrees that facts and figures mean nothing, if you can't find a way to engage with audiences in a way that is emotionally meaningful to them. As an author of fantasy and science fiction books for kids and young people, he'd been trying to come up with a way to address climate change in his work for years, when in 2020, the publishers Little Brown approached him with a commission to write a book on the subject in collaboration with Friends of the Earth Ireland. He wrote and illustrated A Short Hopeful Guide to Climate Change, which was published in Ireland last year. Greta Thunberg might be a global star, but the power of her campaign to entice young readers to pick up books about climate change remains limited as far as he can see. For his own book he says: "A nerdy 12 year old might read it - but it's a book about climate change, so the amount of people who are going to pick it up just for the sheer pleasure or interest in it is smaller than your average book audience. I knew it wasn't going to be a bestseller." He believes however that artists like himself have a vital role to play in helping to breach the still-enormous chasm between climate scientists and the wider public. It all comes down to using artistry to incite people to care. The role of the artist, he says, is to trigger an emotional response - to light a flame. The struggle, as he has observed it, that scientists are facing is that of making people care. "There has been a lot of effort put into talking about facts and policy and science - but events like Brexit show that these things don't get through unless you hit an emotional button," he says. "So when I write and when I work with kids, my first priority is engagement. And then it's whatever the message is, or the information. Because if they're not switched to receive, they're not taking it in. "It may sound strange," he continues, "but people need to be given reasons to care. And then, when they are emotionally engaged, that will motivate them." He agrees with Denise Baden that being too "doomist" is likely to put "people off". "Because you're saying: 'We're the losing side now. There's nothing to be done.' And that's not going to motivate people. You have to tailor your message to your audience all the time... in terms of how do I get their attention, how do I hold their attention. And then how do I explain this clearly enough that it'll get through." Ultimately, the most important thing that artists can do, he says, is to use their art to foster empathy: the magic ingredient that can spur people into action and inspire collective endeavour for the climate. "And yet it's still treated as something that is off to the side, something that we deal with in poetry or something. "But it's actually the cement between all the building blocks, it's literally what makes society work. It's how we cooperate, it's how we have teams, it's how we manage people, it's how we have friends and interact with each other. It's very much a practical, tangible thing." "The art is where empathy comes in," he muses. "The art is where we apply ourselves into provoking some kind of emotional reaction." If you alter, even by a millimetre, the way people look at reality, then you can change the world \</doc>

With Cop27 continuing, the world is still talking very seriously about the environment and what we have done to it, and what our relentless drive for more growth and more stuff might mean for people everywhere in the years ahead. As you will no doubt be aware, the news from Egypt could scarcely be bleaker, with UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres telling world leaders that humanity is on a "highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator". The financial cost of climate change was also laid bare at the global summit last week when it emerged that poor countries would need $2 trillion (EUR 1.98 trillion) a year in funding by 2030 just to cope with climate breakdown. The money will have to be spent to help climate-vulnerable states to switch away from fossil fuels, invest in renewable energy and other low-carbon technology, and cope with the effects of extreme weather. With talk of trillions of dollars and the failure of countries - including this one - to take the crisis as seriously as it should be taken, it would be easy to surrender to the negativity. But while much of the narrative that swirls around climate change is how much it is going to cost, both on a global and on a personal level, that is by no means the full picture, and there are many ways being environmentally friendly will actually save you money while simultaneously reducing your carbon footprint. Here are just 10 ways you can make a difference and cut your spending too. 1 Drive less Too many of us - including Pricewatch - rely too much on our cars to cover even small distances. And that reliance is having a terrible impact on the planet and our wallets. Road transport accounts for about a fifth of carbon-dioxide emissions across the EU, with passenger cars making up 61 per cent of the emissions from road transport. So a concerted effort to drive less would have a significant impact on the level of pollution we produce. How much? Well, every kilometre you choose not to drive when you otherwise might have will save about 250g of CO2 emissions. That means if you use your car just one day less each week than in the past you will see your CO2 emissions fall by tens of thousands of kilogrammes every year. The move will also save you hundreds of euro each year. The average motorist drives 16,000km every year, and if the average price of a litre of diesel right now is EUR 2.02 - as the AA tells us - then driving the average family car, which does 12.4km per litre (35 miles per gallon), will cost about EUR 2,606 annually. If you were to reduce your fuel bill by just 20 per cent you would save more than EUR 500 over the course of the next 12 months. Drive smarter It is not all about how much you drive; how you drive matters too. If you could cut the amount of fuel you use by even 5 cent by being a bit more canny about how you use your car, then you would reduce your carbon footprint and save yourself another EUR 120 or so each year. So do not over-rev your engine, drive in the right gear, and at a slightly slower speed on a motorway. Keep your boot empty, your tyres at the right pressure, get your car serviced, remove any roof boxes or racks that cause a drag on your car and only use the heat or air conditioning if you absolutely have to. Get on your bike The humble bicycle is one of the best ways of lessening your personal pollution levels while improving the quality of your life and saving you money into the bargain. By taking advantage of the tax breaks available to cyclists and their employers, you can get a decent bike for a knock-down price. The Bike to Work scheme covers bicycles and accessories up to a maximum of EUR 1,250, rising to EUR 1,500 for an electric bike. Your employer buys it and you pay for it, tax-free, over 12 months, which effectively knocks about 40 per cent off the price. If your commute is just 8km each way and you usually drive, then you will save about EUR 600 a year in fuel costs alone each year. That is less than the bike and gear will cost you, which means you will be better off just 10 months after you buy your bike. And you will keep saving money after that. Keep your house in order If your attic was insulated decades ago, you might want to have it re done and take advantage of SEAI grants to do it. Those grants could be worth 80 per cent of the total cost - or EUR 800. And getting a decent job done in the weeks ahead could see your energy costs fall by EUR 120 over the course of a year while simultaneously reducing your CO2 emissions. Don't forget to police the heating and lighting of your home while washing your clothes on an eco setting, reducing your reliance on your tumble dryer and immersion and ensuring your boiler is serviced. All of that could lessen your domestic carbon footprint by 10 per cent and save you EUR 400 into the bargain. Eat less meat Not a universally popular notion in this country, but it is one worth considering. Serious climate activists will suggest that you eat no meat and consume no dairy products on the basis that it is one of the biggest drivers of global warming. But Irish people love their meat products, which is why we consume twice the global average of meat. But 25 per cent of the average Irish person's carbon emissions comes from diet and, by becoming a vegetarian, a person can dramatically reduce one's emissions. But only about 5 per cent of Irish people follow a vegetarian diet, with the number of vegans much lower again. We are not going to suggest that the 95 per cent who do eat meat should cut it out immediately, but if we were all to reduce the amount of it we consume, it would be better for the environment, better for our health and better for our wallets, particularly at a time when meat and dairy prices are climbing at as much as three times the rate of general inflation. Let's say you spend EUR 20 a week on steak and mince for two dinners and you replace that with EUR 5 worth of beans, vegetables or pulses, you will save yourself EUR 750 over the course of a year and you probably won't notice a huge difference in the quality of your life, while the quality of your diet might actually improve. Tackle your food waste The food we throw away is another big problem when it comes to both the planet and our pockets. We bin more than a million tonnes of food every year. That hurts the environment on multiple levels. The waste produces toxic methane in landfill, for one. But it also has to be transported from the home, the farm, the shop or the restaurant to that rubbish tip. And then, of course, there is the huge impact the production of the food we do not eat has on the environment. By far the most environmentally friendly way to cut your emissions in this area is to eat what you buy, and don't buy more than you need. If a typical Irish grocery bill is about EUR 8,000 per year and you are absolutely ruthless about reducing waste, you could see that bill fall by at least EUR 1,000. So, make a meal plan and a list and base the list on what you already have in your presses, your fridge and your freezer. Stick to the list. Don't be suckered into buying stuff you don't need by the promise of special offers. Make more effective use of your freezer. If you are not going to use a full sliced pan before the bread turns mouldy, put a few slices in a freezer bag. Don't pile food on to plates - serve it in communal bowls. That way people can eat what they want and what is left in those bowls is more likely to be reused. Stay local Rather than driving to a faraway place to do a big shop, consider what alternatives are in your neighbourhood and then buy what you need from your local butcher, baker or vegetable shop. Where possible, shop in farmers' markets and co-ops and buy food that is grown locally. And if your wallet allows it, buy more organic products - they are better for the environment and, possibly, better for you too. Reduce, reuse, recycle This is a much-used phrase but, while you might be tired of hearing it, adhering to it will save you money and reduce your carbon footprint. In essence, we need to consume less and use it for longer and in more ways than it was intended. And then, once we are done with it, try to find another home for it. So, maybe think twice before buying. Do you really need it? Will it really last? And if you can afford it (and we know that not everyone can), buying better by buying less is a mantra to live by. Look at your clothes The production of textiles is the fourth-largest cause of environmental pressure after food, housing and transport, according to the European Environment Agency, while the United Nations has described the industry as the second-worst polluter on the planet, behind oil. The textile sector generates about 10 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, pumping at least 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere every year. That makes fashion worse for the environment than air travel and shipping combined. The industry also uses more water than a country the size of Ireland and pollutes rivers with dyes and toxic chemicals. Globally, close to 100 million tonnes of textile waste is created every year, which works out at about one rubbish truck full of clothes heading into landfill every single second. Try to be part of the solution by shopping smarter when it comes to clothes. Only ever buy what you need and try to find alternative sources when shopping. By buying clothes second-hand, for instance, you can acquire new stuff - if you need it - without contributing to the climate crisis and, depending on where you choose to shop, you can also support worthy causes when you spend. And such an approach will definitely save you money. Second-hand thriftiness is also very on-trend. Don't confine yourself to local charity shops either. DoneDeal and eBay are great for finding specific items, while Thriftify.ie is a rather brilliant way to shop across hundreds of charity shops without leaving your couch. And then there is the notion of a black bin party. And what is that? It's a fun way to get new clothes and hang out with your mates. Get everyone to put all the clothes that they no longer have any use for into a bin bag. Everyone brings their bags to someone's house. Open wine, dump everything on the floor and then rummage around for things you might like. Bring whatever is left behind to a charity shop. And some other measures Only drink tap water. Plant more house plants. They will do their bit to suck some of the carbon out of the atmosphere. If you are not overly green-fingered, pick easy-to-grow things such as bamboo - it is a nice house plant, grows quickly, is low-maintenance and can suck as much as four times the amount of carbon dioxide from the air as other plants. Use keep cups - many decent coffee shops will give you a discount if you do. Work from home. It will save you money on commuting costs. Use soap rather than shower gel. Take all these steps and we reckon you could handily save yourself a couple of grand. And feel better about yourself into the bargain. \</doc>

Miche\'e1l Martin is running late, held up at the opening of a new pharmaceutical plant in Swords, Co Dublin. The press secretary looks at his watch again and apologises. It's difficult to get the Taoiseach to leave events on time, he says, as there's always one more person he wants to meet. Half-an-hour later, a car sweeps up the drive to Leinster House and Martin climbs the stairs, past the Harry Clarke stained-glass windows. As we shake hands, I sense he seems a little different from the last time we met, during Covid. Perhaps, back then, when most of his meetings were Zoom calls conducted alone in his office, he welcomed some human contact. But last Tuesday, the first day of his penultimate month as leader of the country, he had the air of a man with no time to waste. NH: You hand over to Leo Varadkar in December - and now you've been given a few more days to attend the European Council summit. The fact you were given that opportunity suggests there's a warm working relationship between yourself and Leo now? MM: Yes, on a personal level we do get on well and we are respectful of each other. If issues arise, we contact each other and say, 'Look, we need to talk about this'. NH: Are you going to stay on as leader of Fianna F\'e1il going in to the next general election? MM: Yes, absolutely. It's not all about ego, so the idea that you step down as Taoiseach and become T\'e1naiste, I think, is an important message to send to people. It's actually about policy. And I believe in governments going the full term, because that's the best way of getting policies delivered. NH: How long are you likely to stay on? When does that time come? MM: Well, I will know that when the time comes. There is a new generation that have now come through [in Fianna F\'e1il]. That generation have ministerial experience and there's a good pool of talent there. The party clearly took the more challenging portfolios in government - housing and health were never going to be easy. Then a pandemic comes along, we're still managing Brexit and then we have this terrible war in Ukraine. But this new era of FF politicians have the mettle and have what it takes to have an impact in politics for the benefit of people. NH: Do the heaves and challenges within your own party affect you? MM: One never likes if there's a degree of undermining going on, but I also get tremendous support. The ard fheis was a tremendous tonic to the party. MM: It can create a negativity, which members don't like and supporters don't like. They want the party to focus on the problems of the people and not be overly focused on themselves. NH: Will you bring Barry Cowen back into the fold as a minister? MM: All members of the party, including Barry, have aspirations. I am not going to go into specifics today. But no one is disbarred from consideration [laughs]. NH: And Jim O'Callaghan? MM: Well, we have to be careful now because we could name the whole parliamentary party. I did offer Jim a minister for state position and he's a very talented guy. NH: Speaking of ministerial positions, can you give me any indication what you are going for [personally]? MM: I'm sorry, I can't [laughs]. Leo and myself and Eamon will talk about this at the end of November. This has to be done collectively. There is a number of jobs one would be interested in. NH: Are you open to going into government with Sinn F\'e9in? MM: I would be open to going into government with those whose policies are closest aligned with Fianna F\'e1il policies. We are not ruling out anything at the moment. Sinn F\'e9in policies in the last year or two, in my view, have not made economic or fiscal sense in terms of the amount of public spending that would be involved. They are essentially a party that, at their core, have been anti-EU and anti-enterprise. Take any free trade act the EU has negotiated, they have instinctively opposed it. And free trade is the essence of Ireland's economy. I also feel they have encouraged a narrative around the justification of violence, which they continue to do. And they need to desist from doing that. They seem to consistently want to rewrite history. They should acknowledge that the 30 years of violence was a terrible wrong, which did an awful lot of damage to an awful lot of people. The time has come to take the gun out of Irish politics. Sinn F\'e9in isn't doing that, it tries to have a bet each way. And it consistently endeavours to convince everyone of the modern era that violence was justified. MM: Well, we are saying that. We are vulnerable. But Germany put a lot of eggs in the basket of 'We can develop a relationship with Russia'. From an Irish perspective, the next year will be challenging and difficult, but we think we have cushioned people for this winter. We will reassess this on an ongoing basis and reassess where we are in the spring and a lot will depend on the course of the war. NH: How bad could it get? MM: We are entering a much more difficult period. It's difficult to predict. One can't be as definitive as people would like us to be. We have to take a cautious approach in terms of resources we allocate. That's why we have put billions aside to cover any downturns or difficulties. NH: Can you see us heading into another recession? MM: The analysts are saying not yet. NH: They said that in 2007 and 2008. MM: They did, yes, but these are independent analysts. We can't live through the prism of history, we have to learn lessons from it. We are now facing different types of challenges. What worries me most is the war in Ukraine and the uncertainty around that. [But] I think the world is much more resilient today than it was in World War II or in previous eras. We have a lot of resilience in our economy that can weather storms, but war is a fundamental disruptor in any world. NH: To bring us back to an individual level, people's grocery bills are rising, they have difficulty meeting energy bills. You just have to look at the number of people using food banks and we have record levels of homelessness. How concerned are you? MM: I am concerned. I am worried about the next 12 months. Primarily because of the war and the uncertainty that war brings on the global stage. There is no question and I understand the worry. I meet people every day of the week and people are concerned. NH: There is no end in sight to the war? MM: Not right now. I don't see any change before spring. And that is very depressing. NH: Can you guarantee you can keep lights on this winter? MM: I think we are in a better position at this stage in terms of energy security, but one can never guarantee there won't be a moment or an event. NH: The decade-long boom in digital advertising has now ground to a halt. Are you worried about tech jobs in Ireland? MM: We have a very strong tech sector. You are going to get headwinds from time to time in different sectors, that is only natural. The challenge is to look for new opportunities. NH: So, on to housing. Is the planning system broken? MM: Well, a year ago we asked the Attorney General, with the Housing Minister, to do a fundamental rethink and review of our entire planning code. That work is nearing completion and will manifest itself in a new act to streamline the planning system. It will do more than streamline it, it will improve it and give time lines so that decisions are made efficiently and in a timely manner. People have a legitimate expectation that if they put in a planning application they will get an outcome within a specific time frame. This will also have to be matched with the resourcing of An Bord Ple\'e1nala and local authorities and the introduction of more specialists. But we have a delivery problem and we have to deal with it. We have it in housing and objections. I don't mind people having issues, but they can take too long to resolve those issues. Particularly when dealing with areas that have already been zoned. NH: Nimbyism is what you're talking about. MM: Well, I don't want to label people, because people have concerns. But I would like people to stand back and look at the enormity of the problem. There are generations who have houses - they must look at people who don't have houses or access to housing and count to 10 before they object. We need more supply. NH: People will always object. So what are you going to do about it to get housing supply moving? MM: We are going to change the planning system. NH: Can you give me some specifics? MM: Basically, it's a fundamental overhaul and will provide clarity between the different decision making elements. We will get planning decisions much faster than we are currently getting them. NH: There are huge swathes of land around Dublin. You've also had 10 years of record low interest rates. Why have you not managed to get houses built on these sites? MM: We have loads of planning permissions. We have loads of zoned land. We are bringing in measures to penalise people who sit on land that has been zoned. That's happening. NH: Should you not be throwing all the money, all the brain power, all your resources at it at this stage to get the housing crisis fixed? MM: But we are. NH: Obviously it hasn't been enough. MM: But this Government is only two years in. And we have almost doubled the expenditure in housing. The issue isn't funding, it's not money, it's capacity and delivery - making sure builders and the industry can scale up enough. I do see hopeful signs. It's two years. We had two lockdowns in those two years, which hit construction. And then we had the war in Ukraine and the price of steel went up. This morning in Fingal I was on a site where 1,000 houses will be built. I mean, I'll put it this way. You have mentioned Sinn F\'e9in, no one else has come up with a more comprehensive plan than Housing for All. We are throwing the kitchen sink at this. I won't be happy until we can fundamentally turn this around and we need to be at much higher levels of construction. NH: Do your kids talk to you about it? MM: Of course. [They] are well aware of it all and their friends are all in a very similar situation. NH: When will we not have a housing crisis in Ireland? MM: We are going to have consistent challenges over the next number of years because of population growth. NH: But when are we not going to have a housing crisis? MM: I am reluctant to give a date. My view is we need to consistently build 35,000 to 40,000 houses a year over the next 10 years. I'm not going to say we will need to wait 10 years. I am saying we'll need to keep doing what we are doing now, but even more every year, because the population is growing. In the early 1990s we had close to 3.5 million people - we are now over five million. NH: So, what you are saying is it's going to get even worse? MM: I have no doubt the foundations have been laid in turning the corner on housing, but it will take time. Interview over, we chat about Martin's trip to COP27 , which begins in Egypt today. I had heard he is a genuine lover of nature, often taking quiet walks in the Cork countryside to clear his head. He opens his phone and shows the evidence of that passion: endless pictures and videos taken on his solitary walks of birds, butterflies, flowers, landscapes. My phone rings, and the taxi home is outside. The call takes just a few seconds but, by the end of it, Martin has left for another HYPERLINK www.meeting.No time for goodbyes, no time to waste as the clock runs down on his time as Taoiseach. People who have houses need to count to 10 before they object to planning proposals \</doc>

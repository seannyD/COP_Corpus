The global target of directing $100-billion to poor countries to help them cope with climate change is likely to be missed unless private sector finance is increased significantly, according to a new analysis.Rich countries will also have to raise more money from taxpayers to fund developing countries, enabling them to cut their greenhouse gas emissions and rebuild their infrastructure to adapt to the likely effects of global warming.The analysis, by the World Resources Institute, is a critical part of the run-up to the United Nations climate change conference , COP21 , starting on November 30 in Paris. Poor countries were promised $100-billion a year from developed countries by 2020, as part of the deal reached at the climate summit in Copenhagen in 2009.But finance has fallen well short of that target so far, and poor countries are concerned they will not receive the money. They are demanding that the target be reached, as a prerequisite for any agreement in Paris.The analysis shows that the target is unlikely to be met unless private sector funding is included. If it is, then the target can be reached or even exceeded. The Getting to $100-billion report, undertaken to inform the French and other governments before the negotiations, shows that rich countries must increase their pledges of funding to meet the target. It posits four scenarios, with varying amounts of money coming from the public sector, development banks and businesses.Under the most likely scenario, developed countries would provide about $31-billion a year towards the target from their taxpayers, nearly a doubling of the estimated $17-billion provided in 2012. Development banks, including the World Bank, would supply $28-billion, also nearly a doubling of the $15-billion provided in 2012."There is clearly a need for additional public money," said Pascal Canfin, a senior adviser on international climate affairs at the World Resources Institute and co-author of the report. "But this is doable."The money from rich countries would enable about $39-billion to be raised from the private sector - in other words, businesses would be expected to co-invest or use loans from the public sector, which would also be a substantial increase on the $21-billion from this source in 2012. The money from development banks would also be raised in the private sector, providing about $39-billion, up from $21-billion in 2012.If realised, this would amount to about $137-billion, enough to satisfy developing countries' requests.Providing the finance is seen as crucial to the success of the Paris talks. - \Â£9 Guardian News & Media 2015 \</doc>

The Minister of Transport Ms. Dipuo Peters, MP, is in the French capital, Paris, where she is part of the official South African delegation distinctly representing the country at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties ( COP ) 21 . Amongst the myriad of important climate control engagements, the Minister of Transport gave technical support to the Minister of Environmental Affairs, Mrs Edna Molewa, in the Joint High-Level Segment (HLS) which was attended by Heads of States, ministers and other heads of delegations. National Statements continued on Tuesday, 8 December 2015. The high-level segment concluded on the evening of Tuesday, 8 December 2015 with statements by inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations. The intentions of this noteworthy leap into the alternative fuels market for aviation was made with the underlying intention that SAA (South African Airways) will need to have bio-fuels being half of its fuel consumption by 2020, in order to significantly amplify our national input to reduce aviation CO2 emissions. This will be achieved whilst promoting the acceleration of fuel-efficient aircraft technologies and being a leader in the development and deployment of sustainable alternative fuels in the aviation sector. Government has committed to a 2% blend target for biofuels inclusion in the national fuel supply. If South Africa increased its blending target to 10%, some 125 000 direct jobs could be created, many of which would be based in rural areas, where poverty is widespread. The oil and gas sector is widely considered to be one of the largest sources of anthropogenic methane emissions, and to this end, the Minister of Transport also rigorously engaged her international counterparts when she took part in the 'International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) Market Mechanisms with Bottom Up Climate Agreements - Opportunities for Linking Jurisdiction', and the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment hosted 'Reducing Methane Emissions and Eliminating Routine Gas Flaring in Oil and Gas Operations' seminars. South Africa has committed to attain substantial reductions in CO\'e2(EURO)s\'e2(EURO)s emissions by 2025. The country supports research, technology development and special measures aimed at environmentally sustainable economic growth. South Africa continues to contribute its fair share to the global effort in accordance with the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibility, and Respective Capability (CBDRandRC). The South African delegation is indeed flying the African flag high at COP21 . As recent as last week, two of South Africa's major cities, Johannesburg and Cape Town, were rewarded at the COP 21 for their respective implementations of climate action policies. Cape Town was recognised in the C40 Cities category for Adaptation Implementation with respect to the Mother City's Water Conservation and Demand Management (WCWDM) programme. Johannesburg was presented with an award in the finance and development category for its Green Bond initiative. Speaking on the awards and on South Africa's prominent role at the COP 21 discussion, Minister Peters said, This is a defining moment in our lives and a clear indication of South Africa's firm commitment to working with its international counterparts to ensure that global temperature increases are kept well below the dangerous 2 degrees Celsius levels. \</doc>

KwaZulu-Natal Premier Mr. Senzo Mchunu has added his voice to the growing global chorus imploring world leaders to ensure that a legally binding deal is reached at the make or break COP21 summit taking place here, saying the crunch climate change meeting should mark a turning point in our quest to create an environmentally sustainable future. With negotiations expected to reach a landmark point this week, amid much horse trading, Mchunu warned that the very collective future of humanity was at stake if the parties failed to play midwives to the birth of a settlement. The premier was speaking at the Climate Group gathering on the sidelines of the COP 21 Summit. The Climate Group is one of the world's biggest climate change lobby groups representing more than 31 provinces and cities in the world. Among the members of the group, are the government of British Columbia, the State of California, the Government of South Australia, etc. The province of KwaZulu-Natal is the only African representative in the group. Addressing the meeting under the topic, priorities for 2016 and beyond, Mchunu said: This summit cannot be another missed opportunity, particularly when it comes to the collective contribution we make in the mitigation and adaptation measures to climate change at sub-national level - as states and regions. As the only African representative on this panel, we cannot over-emphasise this point for the obvious reason that the developing world has carried the disproportionate burden of effects of climate change, he said. Mchunu said it was because of this reason that developing countries should be favourably prioritised in the proposed climate fund, in line with the principle of equalisation and differentiation. The issue of differentiation - the principle that the developed world and the underdeveloped countries are not at the same level of development and therefore cannot be treated equally- is one of the sticky issues, which have pitted the two biggest blocs in the negotiations. He added: We come to this conference faced with a serious challenge of extreme drought in our country owing to the ravaging effects of climate change. Since we are a water-scarce country, we need long-term and sustainable measures such as desalination and other environmentally friendly power generating interventions. We are of the view that the current challenge provides us with opportunities for innovation. These, we can achieve by coming up with bankable projects on renewable energy and water resources. As a province, we are ready for new partnerships in this area and we have an enabling environment. At institutional level, we have in place a Provincial Climate Change Council. We are now working on improving its efficacy. Mchunu also announced that the province intended hosting the African Climate Group summit next year in order to give impetus to the province's effort to deal with issues of climate change.

As the clock ticks towards the United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ) in Paris in December, African experts, policy-makers and civil society groups plan to come to the negotiation table prepared for a legal approach to avoid mistakes made during formulation of the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol is an international treaty which extends the 1992 U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that commits countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, based on the premise that global warming exists and that man-made CO2 emissions have caused it. "The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is a legal instrument, and therefore we need legal experts to argue the case for Africa, using available evidence instead of having only scientists and politicians at the negotiation table," according to Dr Oliver C. Ruppel, a professor of law at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. "We must stop complaining and look at how much we have done ourselves with and without support, look at our success stories and build a case of what Africa can do instead of shouting for resources" - John Salehe, Africa Wildlife Foundation "It is a court case for Africa, and Africa must argue it out, and not keep looking for scientific evidence," Ruppel told an Africa Climate Talks (ACT!) forum on 'Democratising Global Climate Change Governance and Building an African Consensus toward COP 21 and Beyond' last week in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The forum, which was organised by the Climate for Development in Africa (ClimDev-Africa) Programme, was part of the preparatory process for Africa's contribution to COP 21 in Paris. Africa has always based its climate argument on geopolitics and science. However, in Paris, experts say that Africa will have to include a good number of lawyers who will table existing evidence of what climate change has caused, what Africans have done about it, and what they can do given appropriate financial and technological support. "We must stop complaining and look at how much we have done ourselves with and without support, look at our success stories and build a case of what Africa can do instead of shouting for resources," said John Salehe of the Africa Wildlife Foundation. "We need to show evidence of what we can do, then approach the negotiations positively," added Ruppel. Dr Mohammed Gharib Bilal, Vice-President of Tanzania, observed that Africa has suffered under the Kyoto Protocol because there were unforeseen gaps. "Since we are negotiating a new agreement, nobody in Africa will benefit if we make the same mistakes that were made in the Kyoto Protocol negotiations," he told the forum. According to experts, the Kyoto Protocol was formulated in a way that was designed to address mitigation of climate change, rather than adaptation to its impacts. "The agreement also failed to recognise some countries which have since emerged as major greenhouse gas emitters, a fact that has complicated implementation of the agreement's mechanisms," observed Mithika Mwenda, executive secretary of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA). He also noted that the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the protocol was based on markets, and therefore failed completely to address climate change in countries with negligible emissions. Such gaps must be sealed in Paris and a new agreement reached or else the world's sustainable development path will be jeopardised, warned Bilal. Nevertheless, the Tanzanian Vice-President recognised that sometimes Africa expects too much from the developed countries. "We need to change and change has to start from within," he said." The vision has to be crafted from within and we have to go to Paris to champion a narrative and cause that is consistent with our own development aspirations." So far, in response to changing climatic conditions, African countries have proactively put in place climate change policies with tools geared towards mitigating and adapting to their impacts. Some have invested heavily in clean energy, some have adopted climate-smart farming techniques, and others have invested in tree growing. "Africa has lots of capacities but they differ," said John Kioli, chairman of the Kenya Climate Change Working Group. "We need to take stock of what we have, and negotiate for enhancement of what we do not have." ACT! seeks to crystallise a conceptual framework umbrella for Africa's role in the global governance of climate change, and to position climate change as both a constraint on Africa's development potential as well as an opportunity for structural transformation of African economies. The objective is to mobilise the engagement of Africans from all spheres of life in the run-up to the Paris negotiations, increase public awareness of climate change and the roles people can play in the global governance of climate change, and elicit critical reflection on the UNFCCC process among Africans.

The Department of Environmental Affairs says it has noted incorrect media reports about the South African delegation which was attending the 21st Conference of Parties ( COP21 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in France, saying they are based on outdated information. The media reports appear to be based on an outdated and subsequently revised delegation list, said the department on Saturday. The incorrect media reports contain a list of names of delegates who were not at the conference, a wrong tally of the size of the delegation as well as names of officials who did not attend the full conference, only the conference opening, among others. The department said it strictly complies with the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), and all the necessary regulations, as well as the recent cost cutting measures agreed to by Cabinet. "I want to personally assure all stakeholders and the South African public at large that each and every official attending COP21 on behalf of the South African government was there because they are a vital part of our team; they have done sterling work in the years, weeks and days leading up to the conference, as well as during the conference itself," said Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa. The Minister lauded delegates who attended the conference on behalf of South Africa. "They have served their country with distinction, especially our teams of negotiators. We are ever mindful that we represent every South African, and I am immensely proud of what we have achieved," she said. The department added that it intends to hold a briefing to report to the nation on South Africa's achievements at COP21 . The department has kept the South African public abreast of developments at COP21 with regular updates. Also, as part of our mandate to keep South Africans informed of the work of the South African team, the department sponsored travel for a number of journalists to attend COP21 . The South African delegation was representative of all key national departments, local and provincial government, Members of Parliament and other key stakeholder groupings. As current chair of the G77 plus China, South Africa played a key role negotiating on behalf of the developing countries of the world, as well as in its capacity as part of the Africa Group. On Saturday, the UNFCCC adopted a historic agreement to address greenhouse gas emission for the post-2020 period, while increasing countries' ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change during the next session. The work done by the South African team at COP21 was the culmination of a four-year negotiating process to ensure a favourable outcome for South Africa, Africa and the world in battling one of the biggest global challenges of the century. \</doc>

Surveyors institute gears up for COP21 THE Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) says the built environment has a vital role to play in helping governments meet their carbon dioxide (CO\'b2) emissions targets. These targets will be central at the end of the month, when 196 governments meet in Paris for a crucial climate change summit hosted by the United Nations (UN). The 21st Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) is of particular significance, because world leaders and negotiators must agree on a new climate deal aimed at curbing the damaging effects of greenhouse gas emissions on the global climate. & As a global professional body working in the public interest, RICS will be in Paris to join stakeholders from governments, industry and civil society to support efforts to reach an agreement,& says TC Chetty, SA country manager for RICS. & The commitments made in Paris could have far-reaching repercussions for the built environment, and the global economy. & Buildings are some of the biggest emitters of CO\'b2, accounting for one-third of global greenhouse gases. Commercial and residential buildings also account for 40% of the world's energy consumption. RICS is working with its members in the land, real estate and construction sectors to find solutions across the property lifecycle to support more sustainable business practices. & The property sector has a huge influence on the global financial system. We want to leverage this influence to support the efforts of governments as they negotiate a new climate deal in Paris. RICS is a natural partner for the UN, with whom we have worked before.& RICS CEO Sean Tompkins says: & We want to build on that relationship by supporting governments as they make adaptation and mitigation commitments to curb the effects of climate change.& Governments negotiating at COP21 are under pressure to produce an international climate agreement that balances environmental ambitions with the global economic realities. RICS, with its network of professionals in more than 140 countries, wants to give governments the & confidence to commit& RICS wants governments to be confident that the progress made towards their commitments to reduce CO\'b2 emissions can be measured through the tools and expertise the organisation provides throughout the world. \</doc>

FOR sheer gobsmacking, jaw-dropping, purblind stupidity, the comments on the Paris massacre published on Saturday by the editor of the Ecologist magazine take first prize cum laude. It is difficult to believe what appeared on the magazine's website, taking pride of place underneath a banner proclaiming that the magazine has been "setting the environmental agenda since 1970". Published immediately after the massacre, the editor had clearly given it a great deal of thought before putting his homemade pencil to his environmentally-friendly paper, and then delivering his missive to the webmaster via a small boy bearing it in a cleft stick. He chose to introduce his piece with a question. "Is it a coincidence that the terrorist outrage in Paris was committed weeks before COP21 (21st Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change), the biggest climate conference since 2009?" No. Of course it was not a coincidence. Everyone knows that the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (Isis) has it in for the environment and Gaia worshippers everywhere because they pose an existential threat to its perverted version of Islam. The conspiracy theory continues: "Failure to reach a strong climate agreement now looks more probable. And that's (sic) an outcome that would suit Isis" - which makes $500 million (R7.2 billion) a year from oil sales - together with other oil producers. Religious maniacs It was all about oil companies wanting to raise the price of oil? So we must seriously consider the possibility that this motivated eight religious maniacs to kill and wound more than 300 innocent people in Paris? That is clear enough. It means that in his paranoia he believes two things: that everything bad that happens is because of the machinations of big business, and particularly oil companies; and that ridding the atmosphere of carbon dioxide is on a par with the threat posed by Isis. What could he have been smoking? Asking and answering the question: "Why Paris?" the writer does briefly bewail the terrorist attack, but soon turns away from the shock and horror of the death toll of soccer fans, patrons of a rock concert and people enjoying an evening meal, and gets down to how it may affect COP21 . The main tenor of his scribble is the awful effect increased security might have. One wonders how it is possible to put heightened security on a par with the convenience of conference delegates. Following the Green script, he emphasises that COP21 is the last chance to avert climate catastrophe. But he then goes on to complain about the isolation of the conference from the prettier parts of the city, noting that the site is a small airport used mainly by corporate jets. This he intones might allow "VIPs to fly in and out without ever leaving the airport and conference complex". He is probably right. If the VIPs have any brains, they will do this as fast as their jets can turn around. The Paris killings, he suggests, will make it even "harder for accredited journalists, campaigners, activists, even businessmen to gain access to the conference, with stringent searches, long queues and arbitrary refusals to people who may have travelled thousands of miles to be there". He might have added, "and in the process (delegates) will have pumped considerable quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere". He does not, of course. It gets even worse. What a shame. Conferences like COP21 should be fun. "It's estimated that ten thousand or more climate activists from around the world may be planning to stay in Paris for the duration of the conference, both to demand a strong and effective agreement, and to develop their own agenda, alliances and plans for climate action." A lack of focus They will be seriously inconvenienced by the "more repressive" security presence at COP21 , because police officers will not bother distinguishing between potential terrorists and climate activists. And then he notes the possibility, the terrible, hand-wringing possibility, that COP21 will lack focus. Instead, the world leaders summoned by the UN to sign a binding treaty to conquer the climate will instead talk about more immediately pressing security matters. Gee whiz. How awful this will be. Thus distracted, agreement on a binding treaty on climate change is unlikely, not to mention the huge amount of cash being demanded to address a problem that may (or may not) affect the world's climate 150 years in the future. There is a dreadful chance that all this terrorism business in Paris might make world leaders skid off the Green straight-and-narrow. COP21 will not send "a clear message to energy corporations and investors that oil and other fossil fuels are no longer a smart investment - and instead to put their resources into the clean, green, renewable energy technologies of the future". Heavens! Investors might choose instead to put their money towards protecting themselves and their fellow compatriots and towards eliminating the scourge of terrorism. The truth is Isis does not care a hoot about global warming. As President Barack Obama said, this attack was not just on Paris, but on the entire civilised world. Green issues have become irrelevant.  HYPERLINK http://www.theecologist.org www.theecologist.org Keith Bryer is a retired communications consultant. \</doc>

A famous saying goes: To whom much is given, much is expected. This is the message that the African Development Bank (AfDB) is carrying and delivering for, and on behalf of Africa at the global conference on climate change, COP21 , which opened Monday, 30th November. "All fingers are not equal. Those who pollute more should do more in saving our planet," said AfDB President, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, who is leading his bank's team at the climate change conference in Paris. Adesina, a former Minister of Agriculture in Nigeria, knows what climate change has done and what its implications are for Africa's agricultural development if nothing is done to halt global warming. "The danger that Africa will not be able to feed itself is a real one. And if we don't have resources to adapt to climate change, Africa will not be able to unlock potential in agriculture," said Adesina, highlighting the implications of climate change variability on Africa's agricultural transformation agenda. He says the bank's message at the COP 21 was clear: a new climate deal that does not work for Africa is no deal at all. According to Dr. Adesina, the major and historic polluters must take a fair share of responsibility not only to cut their emissions but also help the suffering adapt to climate impacts. The AfDB's stance resonates with a long standing position of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN)which has been pushing for a common but differentiated principle demanding historic emitters to cut emissions to keep warming below 1.5 degrees celsius and provide funding for adaptation for vulnerable countries, most of which are in Africa. With impacts ranging from droughts and floods affecting agricultural production and water availability in the southern and Sahel regions of Africa, to shrinking rivers, a classic example being Lake Chad, African countries are hoping for a climate deal that would address these challenges both in the short and long term. "Adaptation as you know is key for Africa but this time we are demanding a high level of adaptation equal to mitigation because we know that the two are closely linked," Chair of the African Group of Negotiators Nagmeldin Elhassan told a high level panel discussion at the on-going climate talks in Paris. Nagmeldin said African heads of state are expecting nothing short of a fair and just deal for the continent, a victim of circumstances it never caused. He said adaptation would be a key issue at the COP 21 negotiating table for Africa as over the years, the African Group of Negotiators has been seeking for parity between mitigation, adaptation and provisions for enhancing means of implementation, noting the increased burden for adaptation in developing countries. "When we speak adaptation, we link it to means of implementation as a way of getting developed countries involved to provide support," the AGN chair said. And the African Union Commissioner for Rural Economy and Agriculture, Rhoda Peace Tumutsime puts it categorically that, "Unless we get a good deal here, that will help with the right technology, we will not be able to modernize and transform agriculture." The question of means of implementation is a critical component of this year's COP. According the African Climate Policy Centre (ACPC) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa-(UNECA), climate change could stimulate developing economies into adapting sustainable development paths, through entrepreneurial opportunities, and spaces for policy makers to address equity concerns in gender and youth policies. Dr. Carlos Lopez of UNECA argues Africa's possible positive outcome from danger. "Despite all the negative news that is reported about Africa, there are opportunities that we can take advantage of. It is very important to get the perceptions right about Africa's challenges and available opportunities. In all the bad news are potential areas for growth," he said. Dr Lopez said Africa has a massive advantage to develop differently by embracing the opportunities that climate change offers to develop sustainably. "It is also important for us to realize that we are not going to make it using the same carbon intensive model... let's take for example, under the 2063 agenda we have to create 122 million jobs. Following the carbon path, we will only create 54 million jobs, but what about the deficit?" he asked. Citing various examples of opportunities among which is renewable energy owing to Africa's natural potential of solar, the UNECA Chief is more than convinced that the continent should be part of the solution and "achieve industrialization which is cleaner, greener, without following the carbon model." However, the question of resources still remains. Will the climate deal offer Africa this opportunity? The next week or so will decide what and which way forward. (End) \</doc>

ON SATURDAY, December 12, the still massive influence of South Africa's greatest ever statesman, Nelson Mandela, came to the fore at COP21 in Paris. At a climate change agreement among almost 200 countries, Laurent Fabius, the foreign minister of France drew on the wisdom of Mandela to explain how the deal had been struck. "It always seems impossible until it's done," he said. "None of us acting alone can be successful. Success is built collectively." The accord struck in Paris, the scene of so much bloodshed just a few weeks earlier, showed that, given the will, countries around the globe can work together for the common good of everyone - rich and poor. In what has been described as possibly one of humankind's greatest achievements, leaders of the countries attending the conference agreed for the first time on a climate change treaty. The accord reached by participants will limit average global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures. However, they will strive for a limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius if possible. Of course, there is a big difference between pledges and action - and many struggles and tough decisions still lie ahead. But at COP21 there appeared to be a genuine willingness among all countries to seek solutions, and by richer countries to help poorer ones meet their commitments. In terms of the agreement, there will be a five-year review of progress, starting in 2019. The idea is for the world to have "full decarbonisation" by 2050. Particularly heartening is the way the accord straddled national and international politics. For instance, mayors of 1 000 cities around the world committed to using only renewable energy by the middle of the century. South Africa will face its own challenges over the next few years. For the world to meet a 1.5 degrees Celsius limit, the burning of coal will have to be phased out before 2030 - and coal is our primary source of electricity. But we will heed Mandela's words as we rise to the challenge - so that we can help build a world that will assure the future of generations to come. \</doc>

CLIMATE change mitigation is a constitutional imperative which required transparent monitoring to ensure communities live in a healthy environment that is protected against degradation and pollution, according to the Centre for Environmental Rights. "Adopting effective and adequate climate change mitigation measures is not just a matter of policy, or a matter to be negotiated with greenhouse gas emitters, but in fact a legal - and constitutional - obligation on the state," said Nicole L\'b6ser, an attorney at the centre which represents communities in their fights for a safe, healthy and sustainable environment. Speaking at yesterday's parliamentary public hearings on climate change, she said the construction of new coal-fired power stations, not only at Medupi and Kusile, but also nine independent power producer projects, "directly contradicts" the need for effective climate change mitigation. "It is clear South Africa is operating at cross purposes, expressing international and domestic commitments to fight climate change whilst simultaneously adopting policies and making decisions which completely defeat these objectives," added L\'b6ser. A day earlier, trade union federation Cosatu called on South Africa to lobby for an end to fossil fuel subsidies - and rejected both fracking, or hydraulic fracturing for shale gas, and nuclear power. Instead, Cosatu emphasised renewable energy, including solar and wind, was "a win-win opportunity to address our energy needs in a sustainable, cost-effective, safe manner". Meanwhile, Business Unity South Africa (Busa) pointed out no country had managed to reduce its carbon emissions while increasing economic growth, saying South Africa needed to be careful in evaluating the relationship between poverty and climate change while finding solutions. Two day-long public hearings were called by the parliamentary environmental affairs committee to garner views before South Africa's attendance of the United Nations ' climate change conference of parties, COP21 , in the French capital Paris in December. It follows departmental consultations which, during the public hearings, were criticised for being rushed and superficial. More than 40 organisations representing communities, academic and civil society and business, government institutions and individuals from across South Africa made their voices heard over two days of public hearings, which were among the most diverse and representative Parliament has seen in recent times. Environmental affairs committee chairman Jackson Mthembu said their views, even those telling "the department where to get off", had been heard. "What is important... is that as South Africans we started to talk. We have opened ourselves to the possibilities of climate change," he said wrapping up what had been at times very robust|discussions. \</doc>

PARIS: As the pre- COP21 informal ministerial consultation entered its second day yesterday, the ministers and representatives from 70 countries were set to start four parallel working groups to ensure the success of the coming COP21 in Paris. The working groups were expected to work on specific issues including equity and differentiation, ambition, pre-2020 action and support, and post-2020 finance. All the conclusions are set to presented today as the consultation comes to a close. According to the organiser, the purpose of this pre- COP21 is not to negotiate the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP), but rather to "provide the necessary political guidance to the ADP negotiating process and to come up with proposals for common ground on some of the key political issues that remain open". Representatives from more than 70 countries, along with Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the |UN Framework Convention |on Climate Change, have accepted the invitation of French Foreign Minister |Laurent Fabius and Peruvian Environment Minister Manuel Pulgar-Vidal together in Paris to prepare for the upcoming COP21 . COP21 . The 2015 UN Climate Change Conference ( COP 21 ) will take place from November 30 to December 11 in Paris - with the aim of achieving a legally binding and universal agreement on climate change. - Xinhua \</doc>

"NEVER before has a responsibility so great been in the hands of so few." These were the words of Christiana Figueres, head of the UN's climate convention, who urged countries in her opening address at the COP21 climate talks in Paris yesterday to reach a climate deal that would tackle climate change effectively. Speaking to about 150 world leaders, Figueres said: "The world is looking to you. The world is counting on you." Negotiators from 195 countries are attending COP21 , where they will try to reach a deal within two weeks that will cut global carbon emissions and limit global temperature rise to 2\'c2\'b0C. The climate talks began the day after 700 000 people in cities around the world took to the streets in climate action marches, urging leaders to take strong action at the talks. At the COP21 opening, a coalition of 40 governments, hundreds of businesses and international organisations called for the phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies, which they said would cut greenhouse gas emission by 10 percent, by 2050. Governments collectively spend more than $500 billion (about R7.18 trillion) of public money a year on subsidies that keep the price of coal, oil and gas artificially low. New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, who presented a communique from the Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform to Figueres, said it was estimated that more than |a third of carbon emissions between 1980 and 2010 had been driven by fossil fuel subsidies. "Fossil fuel subsidy reform is the missing piece of the climate change puzzle. Their elimination would represent one seventh of the effort needed to achieve our target of ensuring global temperatures do not rise by more than 2\'c2\'b0C," Key said. Britain's Prince Charles said in a keynote address that while humanity faced many threats, none was greater than climate change. "In damaging our climate, we become the architects of our destruction. While our planet can survive the scorching of the Earth and the rising of the waters, mankind cannot," he said. However, humanity had the knowledge, the tools and the money to solve the climate crisis." French President Francois Hollande called for a "universal and binding" agreement to come out of the talks. "The greatest threat is not that we aim too high and miss. The greatest danger is that we aim too low and only do that. To resolve the climate crisis, goodwill, statements of intent are not enough. We are at breaking point." UN secretary-general Ban Ki-Moon urged world leaders to instruct their negotiators to choose a path of compromise and consensus. "Bold action is in the interests of every single country represented at this conference." \</doc>

GIVEN the media saturation of the Paris killings, there can be few who are unaware that they happened in the suburb of St Denis, but those climate activists who were looking forward to a 10-day Paris holiday, courtesy of other peoples' money, may no longer be as keen as they were. St Denis is also the venue of next month's 21st Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP21 ). COP21 has already "copped" (sorry) one blow. Thanks to the three-month State of Emergency in France: all outdoor activities have been cancelled, including a parade through the streets by the estimated 40 000 delegates and hangers-on on the eve of the talks. What effect the killings will have on the money-making side of things can only be guessed at, but it seems unlikely that COP21 will now provide the bonanza the French government was expecting. It is also probable that given the new demands of its security forces, it is already regretting having splurged e170 million (R2.5 billion) on COP21 in order to present itself as Europe's most fervent supporter of the climate change theory. Climate Armageddon It is just (faintly) possible that even the most fervent of believers in climate dogma will recognise that civilisation faces more immediate threats than a debatable theory predicting climate Armageddon a century in the future. It will be interesting to see whether these acolytes will flock to Paris in their thousands. Will the promised 40 000 turn up to provide the colour and street theatre that makes an otherwise dull conference highly newsworthy for the television cameras? Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen. If they do not, if they have second thoughts, if they find that the conference venue is disturbingly close to the site of the shooting, then the economic argument to justify holding it in Paris (happily endorsed by the UN organisers) falls rather flat. This is the promise COP21 organisers put forward, probably taken from the international conference organisers' handbook: "The...conference will feed directly into the local economy and (there) will be creative activities and jobs. "The tourism sector in \'c3 le-de-France (the centre of Paris some distance from the conference site) will directly benefit from these economic spin-offs. "(It)... will bring around e100m... due to various expenses of participants (accommodation, catering, shopping, etc). "To develop and operate the website of Paris-Le Bourget, nearly 60 providers and enterprises are mobilised. Employment generated by the event will receive priority to people living in the region. "There are also plans to raise about 600 young people, living mainly in Seine-Saint-Denis. 200 of these young people... (in training and professionally qualified)... will be able to realise their study internships with the event specialist providers working on the COP21 . The excitement is palpable. There are even great words from President Fran\'c3\Â£7ois Hollande himself that risk being seen later as the height of hubris. It cries out for the reader to stand to attention and to sing La Marseillaise. On December 10, 1948, France hosted the UN to adopt the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. During COP21 , France will welcome all countries to a new stage of rights. It should be set to music or carved in stone as a monument to pomposity. The bloody battle on the streets of St Denis should make a Paris holiday less attractive, but the predicted legions of green enthusiasts may turn up in their thousands after all. Extravagances One can only hope our government does not add to them by repeating its extravagances at COP20 in Lima, to which it sent the entire staff of the Ministry of Environment Affairs, including the office cleaner. Meanwhile, the cancellation of the planned mass march/mardi gras on the eve of the conference has dampened the organisers enthusiasm or their imagination. Now the plan is for everyone attending COP21 to donate a shoe to be placed on a heap planned for the Place de la Republique. Each shoe (left foot no doubt) will have the name of the donor written on the sole together will a message to do with climate change. The other shoe presumably goes in the donor's mouth. No one seems to have considered that old shoes might not go too well with the thousands of flowers in memory of the dead and messages of condolence for their families left on the same spot. A much better idea would be for climate activists and COP21 delegates to learn the words of the French national anthem. Among its verses is this one: Do you hear, in the countryside, The roar of those ferocious soldiers? They are coming right into your arms To cut the throats of your sons, your women! Given the circumstances, these lyrics of La Marseillaise might be more appropriate. Don't you think? Keith Bryer is a retired communications consultant. \</doc>

The Paris Agreement on climate change, which aims to keep global warming to a maximum increase of 2\'b0C, with efforts to contain it at 1.5\'b0, would not have been possible without South Africa's role in the process, President Jacob Zuma said yesterday. One-hundred-and-ninety-five countries at the 21st Conference of Parties ( COP21 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) adopted a historic agreement in Paris on Saturday to address greenhouse gas emission for the post-2020 period, while increasing countries' ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change during the next session. "This would not have been possible if South Africa had not delivered the outcomes it did as president of COP17/CMP7, held in Durban in 2011," Zuma said. The success in Paris was the culmination of the watershed Durban climate change conference where COP agreed to the mandate for the Paris Agreement, he said. "We congratulate South Africans for this contribution to finding solutions to a global challenge. The agreement presented a big step forward in committing all countries to act decisively against climate change. \</doc>

Thousands of South African women will register their concerns and demands to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) taking place in Paris, France from 30 November to 11 December... The resolutions of the conference will replace the Kyoto Protocol, and different stakeholders will use the platform to voice their concerns about the impact of climate change. South African women, represented by the non-governmental organisation, GenderCC Southern Africa - Women for Climate Justice, will be among those who want their views to be heard. GenderCC SA - Women for Climate Justice conducted various workshops to highlight the impacts of climate change on women and grassroots communities in the Eastern Cape, Limpopo, North West and Gauteng provinces in the build up to COP21 . Over three thousand women attended the information and discussion workshops where they raised a number of issues they want climate change negotiators and policy-makers to take into account as they plan the future of the world. Governments must act According to Dorah Marema, executive director of GenderCC SA, the potential of agriculture and food security in Southern Africa could remain a pipedream if the governments do not actively address obstacles facing women producers. "Women want to move beyond the slogans and mere talking and focus on sustainable solutions, since they feel the brunt of climate change especially as smallholder farmers. It is unfortunate that the powers that be decided to host COP21 in Paris, one of the most expensive cities in the world, whilst millions of women at the grassroots communities across South Africa and many other developing countries are struggling to access finance for them to adapt to the changing climate," Marema explains. Studies have found that the success of increased agricultural production and food security for Africa, rests largely in the hands of women farmers on the continent. Women farmers play a major role in food production on the continent, as the majority farmers and are key contributors to household food availability. Severe constraints Female farmers face severe constraints as compared to their male counterparts when it comes to accessing productive resources such as land, credit, technologies and information. Ignoring the potential and contribution of women in agriculture may come at price for the continent. Attendees at the climate change workshops demanded: - Financial support for the Green Climate Fund from which women should be supported. - More government support for small scale women farmers. - Inclusion of women in all decisions affecting women, especially in relation to climate change. - Provision of relevant and affordable climate smart technologies for women producers. - Support for women on renewable energies. - Urgent need to address water infrastructure challenges impacting on women farmers. - Provision of more information and education around climate change. \</doc>

"THE future of Africa is placed fairly and squarely in the hands of energy. The future of our country and continent is about infrastructure, good governance and low poverty... today we have come to ensure that energy will not only alleviate poverty, but eradicate poverty completely," said Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson at the conclusion of the South African International Renewable Energy Conference. She said governments needed to actively pursue low carbon policies, meet green-house gas reduction objectives and mitigate global warming. "Africa remains one of the most unequal societies on the globe. This conference has assisted us in addressing those inequalities. In these three days, we have looked at the whole renewable energy value chain, focusing on our continent, on interconnectivity, regulatory frameworks which provide policy certainty," she added. Delegates have committed themselves to upscale and mainstream renewables to achieve a global energy transition. While the event came to an end at the CTICC yesterday, delegates will today visit renewable energy projects in the province. More than 3 000 delegates, including cabinet ministers, government delegations, representatives from the private sector, NGOs, academia, business, industry and international organisations participated in the conference. COP21 ( UN Conference on Climate Change in Paris, starting on November 30). Global Forum for Sustainable Energy president Irene Giner-Reichl read out the declaration which said that in order to make the global |transition to renewable energy happen rapidly, the following elements were crucial: promoting transparent and effective procurement processes; advancing renewable energy globally; promoting skills transfer and development; securing financial resources; conducting research and development; prioritising regulatory frameworks; localising supply chains and local investment; emphasising integrated planning; regionalising trade and energy resource development; conducting programmes for infrastructural development in Africa; embarking on clean energy corridor initiatives and focusing on the African Renewable Energy Initiative; regional co-operation and international co-operation. All delegates also acknowledged the success of the South African renewable energy initiative. In the space of only five years, the department's Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer (IPP) Procurement Programme has contributed 4 294GWh to the national grid. Total payment to IPPs stands at R9.2 billion and the initiative has also saved 4.4 million tons of |carbon dioxide. South African National Energy Development Institute chief executive Kadri Nassiep said the declaration came about after consultation with delegates. "We want to take a positive message forward. In the course of COP21 we will take our place with other countries in an effort to come to an equitable resolution to the problem of not having a global treaty in place," he said.

While the world is starting to make strides towards emissions reduction standards and countries are coming to the negotiating table, increasingly the data shows what local leaders have known for years - cities are leading the way. That is why, this weekend, I am joining local government leaders from around the world in Paris, France, for the Climate Summit for Local Leaders - taking place alongside the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) - for what is poised to be a turning point in the global fight against climate change. Mayors are uniquely positioned as leaders on climate. The cities we govern account for 70 percent of the world's total energy-related carbon emissions. Ninety percent of the world's largest cities are on coastal or intercostal waterways, with cities such as Johannesburg forming part of the 10 percent. This latter group is increasingly vulnerable to negative economic, environmental and health impacts. This daily reality has prompted mayors to promote and protect the sustainability, health and livability of our communities. And that's crucial. We know, now more than ever, that cities play a pivotal role in promoting policies that impact the daily lives of their constituents. From small cities to mega-cities, to our work here in the City of Joburg, mayors are finding solutions. From a simple plan to replace light bulbs, to major green transportation investments, some of the most innovative ideas to combat climate change are already implemented at the local level, and are being replicated around the world. In our case, the Rea Vaya Bus rapid transit system, our new biogas fuel metrobuses, and the recent EcoMobility World Festival 2015 to promote sustainable mobility, as well as the various load limiting interventions for both the commercial sector and households, come to mind. So how did we get here? By providing a platform to demonstrate our collective impact, the Compact of Mayors has empowered local leaders to have a voice at COP. Launched at the 2014 United Nations Climate Summit. The Compact of Mayors is able to track commitments and progress on these plans, big and small, and demonstrate the collective impact of cities. That means there's an enormous responsibility for cities such as Joburg to act. Joburg has already made promising progress and we are contributing to the global impact of city climate action. About 40 000 people use the BRT daily, while more are calling on the Metrobus service to be introduced in new areas of the city. The EcoMobility World Festival 2015 in October also brought to the fore the need for a sustainable integrated transport system in the city. The use of private cars decreased from 90 to 68 percent during the EcoMobility Festival, while the number of Gautrain passengers increased by 8 percent. Even cycling went up by a slight 7 percent. The role of the minibus taxis industry within the city's transport mix was also underlined over the four weeks of the Festival, as people bought into the idea of an ecomobile Joburg, and walked, cycled, shared a car and used public transport more. The commitments and plans we make in Joburg have an important impact, not just in towns that neighbour ours, but on communities around the world. It is because of this that the tragic attacks on Paris have strengthened my resolve, and the resolve of mayors around world to participate in the COP21 at the Climate Summit for Local Leaders hosted by Mayor Anne Hidalgo and Michael Bloomberg - the United Nations Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change. The summit gives us the opportunity to stand in solidarity with the City of Paris during this time of mourning to collaborate and build on the progress we have made towards a more resilient future for our respective communities. The COP21 As commitments to the Compact of Mayors grow, mayors from around the world will be able to tap into innovative solutions, and exchange ideas to build a better local economy and more resilient communities. We need more mayors to take a seat at the table and share their stories. I am acting on climate because I believe that climate actions contained in the Joburg Growth and Development Strategy 2040 can indeed change people's lives beyond our city. Together with all the mayors heading to Paris, we will show that cities can shape solutions, and demonstrate the power of collective action on climate change. \</doc>

One of the key aims at the Paris climate conference is to set the planet on a more desirable greenhouse gas emissions trajectory. The talks in Paris are taking place on a landscape transformed since the failed summit in Copenhagen six years ago. Three crucial changes strongly increase the chances of an agreement, with implications for Africa.These are:A move away from a top-down to a bottom-up approach to managing climate change, giving individual countries more say in what steps should be taken;Major developments in clean technology; andThe development of knowledge and expertise about climate change in developing countries. The voluntary approach At COP15 in Copenhagen, the negotiations adopted a top-down approach. A global emissions path was set and negotiators sought to determine a country's responsibilities for achieving this path.In contrast, a bottom-up approach is being adopted at COP21 in Paris. Individual countries offer what they perceive to be achievable and fair emissions paths for their particular circumstances.This voluntary approach has greatly increased a country's willingness to engage, expanding the scope of the agreement. In this new framework, the sum of country offers, formally called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, is the projected global emissions trajectory.In this new landscape, there is no prospect of all nations agreeing to adhere to a single global policy framework. Rather, countries and regions will set about achieving their nationally determined contributions in their own ways. And the means for achieving these ends will vary enormously.For example, South Africa recently released a draft carbon tax bill for public comment. South Africa has also been considering regional strategies, particularly related to hydropower. Major strides in new technologies Extraordinary developments have taken place in renewable energy technologies. Since 2008, the year before COP15 failed to produce a move towards effective global mitigation, the price of solar modules has fallen by 75%.Declines in the cost of wind power have also been rapid, though not as dramatic. African countries hope this year's COP21 will be much more successful than COP15 was. (Stephane Mahe/Reuters)Investments in energy production have reflected these changes. In 2014, the newly installed capacity of renewable energy systems surpassed that of fossil fuel-based systems on a global basis for the first time.Rapid technical advances in clean energy technologies improve the politics of supporting an energy transition, with generally positive implications for future policies and the future rate of technical advance in clean energy technologies. Developing countries join the party The developing world confronts climate change issues with a far deeper and more sophisticated knowledge base than in 2009. Although it was clear in Copenhagen that developing countries had a critical role to play in any effective global mitigation regime, there were still no clear understanding about how they were going to be affected by climate change.For instance, a World Bank study, which was meant to serve as a critical input to developing countries for COP15, was only published after the Copenhagen meeting.To say that climate change information has been fully considered and appropriate policies assessed in developing countries is an overstatement. But the process of doing so is much more advanced than it was in 2009.The 157 intended national contributions on the UN Climate change website are perhaps the most salient evidence of this improved knowledge base and higher level of engagement.India and China are cases in point. In 2009, India viewed climate change mitigation as a developed country problem. Today, India has offered serious attempts to reduce the carbon intensity of GDP.China has offered to peak emissions by 2030 with further declines in the decades after.African nations are also taking part. Kenya has committed to reducing its emissions by 30% by 2030 relative to a baseline scenario. South Africa targets a peak in greenhouse gas emissions between 2020 and 2025 and then a decline after 2030. These offers, along with many others, come from difficult policy discussions and assessments in societies and governments. Good news for Africa The world stands at the cusp of an era of policy experimentation in driving a clean energy transition. The outcome depends on what transpires in Paris as well as the vigour with which countries pursue agreed contributions. If implemented, the global emissions trajectory that emerges from COP21 would represent a turning point.A promising path towards a stabilised global climate lies ahead. An important step down this path will be successful negotiation and implementation of CoP21 .From the African perspective, this is very good news. The continent is one of the world's more vulnerable regions. Africa has very good reasons to avoid extreme warming scenarios and thus a strong preference for effective global mitigation policies. The continent also possesses abundant sun, wind and hydropower resources as well as substantial, and growing, reserves of natural gas, which is a relatively clean fossil fuel.Renewable energy sources present clear challenges because of their intermittent nature. But all countries face these challenges. The scale and breadth of Africa's renewable energy endowments place the continent in a favourable position.In a world characterised by globally effective emissions constraints, Africa has the potential to exploit a comparative advantage in energy production.Channing Arndt, Senior Research Fellow, United Nations UniversityThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

IF YOU want President Jacob Zuma to hear what you think the South African stance ought to be at the COP21 climate talks in Paris, try tweeting him. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has set up a website where the public can select the leader of their country and send him or her a message about what they would like to see emerging from the climate talks. "Your tweet can make all the difference. Share it now and empower your leader to act today for a better tomorrow. Together, we can make climate change history," the WWF said yesterday. The WWF described the climate talks, which began on Monday and will close on December 11, as "one of the biggest climate conferences of all times and here's why: climate change isn't some distant, intangible thing; we are feeling its effects now". " COP21 About 40 000 delegates from 195 countries are attending the Paris talks, where they hope to agree on an accord to cut global greenhouse gas emissions sufficiently to keep average temperature increases below 2\'c2\'b0C.

The Green Building Council South Africa (GBCSA) has made an ambitious commitment at COP21 in Paris to introduce a net zero/positive building certification scheme by 2020, along with six Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A total of 25 Green building councils worldwide unveiled national commitments to ensure the sustainability of their buildings to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and that the building and construction industry contributes towards limiting global warming to 2\'baC. Because buildings account for about one third of global emissions, green building is a critical to climate change. GBCSA chief executive, Brian Wilkinson, says the council's commitment to net zero/positive building certification will cover energy and carbon emissions, and possibly also cover water and waste. It will leverage and be built upon the GBCSA's current Green Star SA and energy water performance certification schemes that can already assess whether a building is water or energy neutral or positive. However, to upscale its importance, GBCSA will allow for specific recognition of the net zero/positive aspect. GBCSA also committed to six further SDGs by 2020: l To target 2 500 commercial green building certifications, representing around 10 million square metres of gross building area. l A target of 10 000 residential green building certified homes. l 12 000 Professionals to be trained in green building principles and practices. l 10 Percent of local government staff to be trained in green building principles and practices. l Inspiring and assisting fellow African nationals to establish and capacitate green building councils in their countries by providing, among others, support with rating tools and training - with a target of establishing five African GBCs. The commitments were made at Buildings Day - the official COP21 meeting led by S\Â£9gol\Â£8ne Royal, the French minister of ecology and former presidential candidate. Terri Wills, chief executive of the World Green Building Council, said: "The GBCSA is demonstrating real leadership on green buildings by launching its ambitious commitments at these critical climate change negotiations in Paris. "We know how to build bigger and bigger. The challenge is to build bigger and better. And commitments like these will help to transform the global building industry so that a 2 degree world is possible tomorrow, and we can realise the benefits from this new way of building. Today". Limiting global warming to 2\'baC requires the building sector to reduce emissions by 84 gigatonnes by 2050 - the equivalent of not building 22 000 coal-fired power stations. "This large-scale reduction of emissions is possible, but it will require transformative action and collaboration. By 2018, green building in the US will account for over 3.3 million jobs - a third of the entire US construction sector" says Wills. The GBCSA constitutes more than 1 300 entities, each with thousands of individuals who are now activators and implementers of green building - in both the private and public sectors. The GBCSA safeguards the built environment as ecologically sustainable through design, construction and operations. Its critical focus is to radically reduce harmful emissions resulting from building practices. At COP21 In addition, 25 green building councils committed to register, renovate or certify over 1.25 billion square metres of green building space - almost twice the size of Singapore - and train over 127 000 qualified green building professionals by 2020. Three councils - Canada, Australia and South Africa - committed to introduce net zero certification for buildings. More than 125 corporate GBC members have tabled commitments, including the French product manufacturing giant Saint-Gobain, Australian developer LendLease and Swedish construction firm Skanska. \</doc>

The 21st meeting of the Conference of the Parties (or COP21 ) is underway, with the goal of hammering out a deal to reduce global carbon emissions top of the agenda... Business has a significant stake in the talks. Company representatives will play a key role in shaping the agenda and there are more than 180 business events planned in Paris. The UN climate chief Christiana Figueres has called for "business involvement at the highest levels" at COP21 , while UK prime minister, David Cameron, called for a stronger role for business in his address. Climate change is "too large for governments alone to deal with" and businesses need "long-term certainty for investment", he said. So which are the businesses that participate in COP meetings? Will COP21 result in meaningful action by business or will it be another massive greenwashing exercise under the benevolent gaze of the United Nations? Renewables and tech While a wide range of industry sectors participate at COP meetings the usual suspects are not hard to identify. First, there are the "good guys" - companies in the renewable energy business and technology companies offering products and services for environmental protection, energy efficiency, water and soil conservation, and "clean agriculture". Then, there are the "bad guys" - oil and gas companies, mining corporations, electricity generators and other fossil fuel-based industries, eagerly promoting their green credentials. But perhaps the most influential groups are the various industry and trade associations that directly and indirectly lobby policy makers. Industry associations such as the Confederation of European Paper Industries, European Steel Association, European Association of Metals and the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers regularly lobby EU climate policy makers, advocating business friendly policies. They also provide technical advice on their preferred climate policies, mobilise support from other industry associations and organise meetings and dinners between CEOs and policy makers. A recent report by the Policy Studies Institute found that 77% of the Fortune 500 corporations lobbied climate policy makers through their trade associations. Global carbon price Every corporation, industry association, and myriad "responsible business" coalitions appear to agree that what business needs to agree on above all else is a global carbon price. The economic logic is that a carbon price can incentivise low carbon innovation and provide a stable policy framework for business. The problem of course is that a price on carbon and emissions trading, while being cost effective and efficient for business, will have little if any effect on absolute greenhouse emissions. This is because it will take a relatively high carbon price (to the order of US$30-US$40 per ton according to experts) to shift investments to cleaner energy sources. With the current price of carbon under the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme languishing at around US$6 a ton though, there is little incentive for companies to make these investments. Plus, a price on carbon simply serves to raise the cost of fossil fuel energy and does nothing to lower the costs of alternative energy sources. All the major oil companies have internal carbon prices in place, yet they continue to invest in fossil fuels. The likely result COP21 will likely see businesses set aspirational goals committing to move to 100% renewable energy sources, they will make numerous climate pledges, and they will mobilise support for carbon pricing and emissions trading. But there will be no concrete commitments or deadlines. Business can already boast its support for COP21 . A consortium of companies has given \Â£325m to the conference - for which it has taken flak from green groups. Sponsors include some of the largest carbon emitters in the world: EDF Energy, Engie (which accounts for nearly half of France's annual carbon output), Air France (which has opposed emissions reductions in the aviation sector), and BNP Paribas (one of the top ten global coal lending banks during 2005-2013). BMW, Coca-Cola and BT are also sponsors of the event. Ultimately business involvement at COP21 will ensure there is no "distortion of competitiveness in the global market" as the International Chamber of Commerce Climate Working Group puts it. And as long as business-friendly proposals continue to define climate policy, as they have in the past, there can never be any meaningful climate action. Business as usual will continue, despite all the pledges and climate summits. Climate policy, friendly or otherwise, needs to drive business if new business models are to emerge - not the other way round. Otherwise, as environmentalist Bill McKibben warns us "even before we run out of oil, we will be running out of planet". \</doc>

The most important climate conference ever has kicked off in Paris. COP21 - the 21st Conference of the Parties - has entered its first full day, with nearly 150 heads of state in attendance. Opening the conference, French President Francois Hollande said: "Everything depends on us. The hope of all humanity rests on your shoulders." The overarching goal of COP is to create a global framework for countries to reduce their carbon emissions, so that the average global temperature does not increase by more than 2\'c2\'b0C. The UN's climate agency says an increase greater than that will be catastrophic for the world's life support systems. Oceans will warm and storms will become more frequent and damaging. Sea levels will rise and ice caps will melt. That impact will be most keenly felt in the tropical regions of the world. Temperature extremes will change weather patterns and dry up rainfall. For South Africa, the interior will be up to 5\'c2\'b0C hotter by 2050. Coastal regions will warm by half that rate, but will have to deal with rising sea levels.The stakes have created a great deal of rhetoric on the opening day. Laurent Fabius, France's foreign minister and the chair of COP, said, "Either we fail in Paris and spread desolation everywhere, or we succeed and spread a bright future." Success will come over the course of two weeks, with world leaders departing after today so their negotiators can hammer out a deal. Those negotiations started on Sunday evening, a day ahead of schedule.The last time negotiations came this close to an agreement - at Copenhagen in 2009 - they fell apart because too much detail was left until the last moment to discuss. It took COP17 in Durban to bring countries back to a point where they could agree that another attempt should be made. The deadline given in Durban was COP21 . And this time, a draft document has been discussed over the course of 2015 and cut down to some 30 pages. Most countries have also given roadmaps for what they'll be doing to tackle their carbon emissions and adapt to a changing climate. These Intended Nationally Determined Contributions picture a future where renewable technology has largely replaced fossil fuels and communities have adapted to the impacts of the changing climate. But these are not enough to keep the world from warming by less than 2\'c2\'b0C. With average global temperatures already up by 1\'c2\'b0C, the UN says that - if implemented - the intended contributions would still see the world warm by 2.7\'c2\'b0C. Over a hundred countries have added more pressure to this target, by saying that the maximum allowable increase should be 1.5\'c2\'b0C. These are countries that are already being hard hit by the climate changes brought on by existing temperature increases - with most island states and African countries asking for this target to be included in any agreement that does come out of COP21 .Their demand represents a further splintering of positions. The big block to any previous climate agreement has been the divide between the developed and developing world. When negotiations started in the 1990s, the world was split into those two blocks, those that recognise that developed countries were responsible for the majority of carbon emissions - so should do the greatest amount of work to lower their emissions - and that those emissions would disproportionately affect developing countries. The intention then was that developed countries would pay developing countries to develop in a more sustainable manner, and help them adapt to the worst effects of climate change. But very little finance has been forthcoming. The Green Climate Fund -established to handle $100-billion a year in climate funding by 2020 - has only raised half of the capital it needs. This has seen developing countries loath to sign an agreement that essentially allows developed countries to escape paying for the damage caused by their carbon emissions. For their part, developed countries have resisted an agreement that would see the rapidly growing economies of China and India benefit from climate finance and technology transfer. But many of the leaders speaking on Monday have said the climate extremes evident this year have given COP21 additional impetus. This year has seen every month except January and April break a temperature record. It is also on course to be the warmest on record, after 2014 set the previous record. October was the hottest October ever. That month also set the record for the greatest increase from month to month, showing that the rate of warming was increasing. With the effects of global warming becoming more evident, leaders have said COP21 should create a world that can lower its carbon emissions and adapt to the changing climate. Speaking on Monday, United States president Barack Obama said: "There is such a thing as being too late and I believe that hour is almost upon us." \</doc>

COP21 was always going to come down to the last week, where ministers arrive and try iron out what disagreements are left in the draft text of a possible climate change agreement. Sleepless nights and intense pressure mean an agreement should still be reached - creating a global goal for managing temperature increases.But the hurdles are great. After four years of negotiations - starting after COP17 in Durban - the draft deal still runs to 48 pages. It also has more than 900 square brackets, which are left to show areas of disagreement.These brackets chart the different options available in a possible final agreement, often allowing for a choice between an ambitious path - such as the world completely moving away from fossil fuels by 2050 - and one riddled with political compromise - such as countries doing as much as they think they can, but without an overarching target.A similar plethora of brackets and options led to the collapse of a possible agreement in 2009 in Copenhagen, at COP15. But then the text ran to several hundred pages and China and the United States were resolute in blocking action. This time the two countries have been solidly backing a positive outcome.Now the disputes have focused on several core issues, which tend to divide the world into developed and developing countries. These have to be decided by Friday for an agreement to be signed, although most negotiations run over time by at least a day. This week will be about ministers coming together to iron out any problems, by agreeing to compromise or trade to get what suits their country best. This compromise will decide whether or not the world has a document with which to lower carbon emissions and adapt to climate change. 1 - Finance The developed world wants a COP agreement to focus on mitigating - lowering emissions to keep global warming below 1.5\'c2\'b0C or 2\'c2\'b0C this century. But the developing world wants the agreement to have a solid component dealing with the damage caused by climate change, with most historical emissions coming from the Europe and North America. Island states - which are already being eaten away by rising sea levels - and poor developing countries are at the forefront of this movement. These are the countries least responsible for carbon emissions, but most likely to suffer. They want a "loss and damage" compensation for climate damage.At most, the developed world has agreed to have $100-billion a year by 2020 in the Green Climate Fund. This will equally fund adaptation and mitigation projects. But the developing world - particularly India - has questioned how much will actually be committed to this fund and want stronger guarantees. 2 - How hot can the world get Climate negotiations have as their stated goal the imperative of ensuring average global warming does not exceed 2\'c2\'b0C. Average global temperatures have already increased by half that number. It is a number pushed by the developed world. But COP21 has seen a strong call for that target to be revised down to 1.5\'c2\'b0C. This is because vulnerable countries will struggle to survive a change that great. This is especially true in Africa, where the temperature has increased at 1.5 times the world average. As a result, this is a cornerstone of the African group negotiations in Paris. The current draft agreement allows for both of these options. But countries - particularly those in the oil-rich Middle East - have pushed back against this, as it requires the world to move away from fossil fuels at a much quicker rate.3 - Will the agreement have legal force Paris is about getting countries to agree to a framework that ensures everyone lowers their carbon emissions. It is a process that relies a great deal on trust between nations, and the expectation that everyone will do their bit. Prior to last Monday, most of the world's countries had submitted their plans - Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. These are voluntary plans that each country says they will implement. But there is no punishment for not doing what is in the plan.Many countries are therefore pushing for a legally-binding agreement, which will force countries to act on climate change. This is especially important for the developing world, which wants guarantees on funding and renewable technology to be carried through - instead of the possibility where developed countries lower carbon emissions and do nothing for those suffering from historical and current emissions. 4 - How much pressure for change going forward The intended contributions are only applicable in the 2020s and many countries have called for a continual updating of these contributions. The most-supported plan has been for the contributions to be revisited every five years so that their ambition can be increased as technology improves and national circumstances change. This will allow a possible Paris framework to continue long into the future, with a chance for plans to be changes as circumstances demand. 5 - Who is responsible When climate negotiations started in the early 1990s, they divided the world into two simple blocks - developed and developing. The former included western countries and the latter covered everyone else. This would allow the developed world - with more money and technology - to lead the push away from fossil fuels and help the developing world with the damage from a changing climate. But this binary world has been broken by the arrival of mega developing countries - particularly in the form of India, China and Brazil (which along with South Africa form the Basic negotiation group). These want to be classified as developing so they do not have to pay for the damage their emissions are doing - China and India are the first and third largest emitters in the world, respectively - and get climate finance. The developed world is resistant to this, and is pushing for a classification of the world according to current capabilities. This has come down to a straight fight between the United States, European Union and the Basic countries and presents one of the largest hurdles, politically, that will have to be overcome in Paris. \</doc>

Southern African farmers and farmer's organisations are shocked by the absence of an agricultural proposal in the COP 21 draft text. The farmers' constituency has been intensely involved in the climate debate both inside and outside the COP-process over the last decade. Southern African Confederation of Agricultural Unions (SACAU) and other stakeholders in the public and private sector have persistently demanded that negotiators include agriculture in the global agreement on how to adapt to and mitigate climate change. "At the very least parties should agree to approach the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) to seek wisdom and gather scientific data in order to guide a global climate strategy for agriculture," said SACAU president Dr Theo de Jager who is also president of the Pan African Farmers Organization (PAFO). "If a constituency as diverse as our members, ranging from small holders to industrial-scale farming operations, from pastoralists to foresters, dairy to cropping, horticulture to aquaculture, can have a unanimous demand for such a research programme to inform decisions, surely political parties and governments around the negotiation table should be able to follow suit?" said de Jager. Frustrated farmers SACAU believes farmers are the most vulnerable to climate change. "No fraternity in the world is more vulnerable to the impact of climate change than farmers. No industry in the global economy can do more in a shorter space of time to adapt to, and even mitigate climate change, than farmers. It simply makes no sense to exclude agriculture from a new agreement. A very frustrated farmers' delegation will represent farmers' voices at COP 21 in Paris from 30 November to 11 December 2015, to air our frustrations and mount pressure on negotiators to include agriculture in the new agreement" said de Jager. SACAU has launched a massive twitter campaign, #includeagriCOP21 to demand a commitment by the Paris agreement to support farmers. SACAU has called on its 17 national member organisations in 12 countries, its partners, sponsors and sympathizers to actively participate in the #includeagriCOP21 campaign. It also seeks to partner with the Pan African Farmers' organization (PAFO), the World Farmers' Organization (WFO), as well as NGOs, CSOs and other stakeholders in the climate smart agriculture alliance, to support, promote and drive the campaign. \</doc>

Beginning this week on 30 November 2015, leaders of 190 countries are gathering in Paris for COP21 . Unable to march themselves following the terror attacks in Paris two weeks ago, digital social activists Avaaz.com stepped into the gap, urging people to show up in their cities and countries in solidarity with Paris and all global citizens. <h2>Online petition</h2> A spectacularly successful response has resulted in the largest climate march in history ever staged, with people turning out in London, Berlin, S\'e3o Paulo, Melbourne, Sydney, Tokyo, Rome, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Auckland, Ottawa, Mexico City, Seoul, Madrid, Togo, Tanzania, Papua New Guinea and more and the Avaaz.org online petition accumulating 3.6 million signatures. Viva green Cape Town On Sunday, 29 November, in solidarity with the 2000 other worldwide events, the Cape Town Climate Walk event took place, with 1500 green-clad people (many of whom had made a special effort to attend from outlying areas) drumming, singing, dancing and chanting through the streets of Cape Town en route to deliver their memorandum to Parliament. Capetonians gathered on Keizersgracht outside the Cape Town University of Technology (CPUT) campus. Speakers included Peter Johnston from UCT, Louise Naude from WWF, Nick King and other environmental activists such as Thembeka Mjali and Mpumeleo Mhlalisi, who spoke about clean energy issues. Memorandum delivered to Parliament Key points of the memorandum: - The need for South Africa to up its level of commitment to reducing dangerous climate change causing gases by moving more determinedly away from its reliance on fossil fuels. At present its pledges are deemed "insufficient". - The need for the Western Cape to heed its own telling report on climate change impacts on the province by carefully re-evaluating policies related to land use change, economic development and conservation of coastal, wetland and biodiversity rich areas. - The need for Cape Town to embrace the potential for all citizens to contribute to the electricity grid through small PV installations by revising policy that currently inhibits this.

NEWS ANALYSISThe Congress of the Parties (COP) was self-congratulatory last weekend. The world has been saved, they told us, and history was made. The hyperbole could be forgiven as the product of exhausted relief; so many things could have gone wrong, but didn't. The objection of a single party last Saturday could have derailed 13 days of negotiations, yet a deal was reached against the odds.But the Paris agreement is weak. It commits countries to a de facto voluntary system, in which a single text and peer pressure is all that stands between humankind and catastrophic global warming. It was reached through endless compromise - each of the 195 countries represented gave way on their demands so that everyone would be on the same page.Read: COP21 comes down to a lot of hot airRead: Climate-fragile countries need direct financial aidIt almost fell apart an hour before Laurent Fabius, France's foreign minister, tapped the green gavel to signify that the world had adopted a framework for tackling climate change. Exhausted brains had introduced a grammatical error into the text - "shall" instead of "should", which was later amended. "Shall" would have made a section of the agreement legally binding, making it unlikely to pass through the United States Senate. The US also had to form an unlikely last-minute alliance with Cuba to convince Nicaragua not to derail an agreement.This was the story of the previous two weeks. Negotiators poked and probed at their peers, trying to demolish their positions to gain the ascendancy.When India and China threatened to triumph in their demands, the European Union and the US took away their developing-world support base by joining the coalition of high ambition. When South Africa wanted more detail on funds for the ongoing damage caused by a changing climate, the developed world agreed to make its $100-billion commitment to funding a "base" that would be increased. Small island states and African countries were bought off by a change in the wording of the Paris agreement's overarching goal - now an aspirational target of lowering emissions to ensure temperature increases do not exceed 1.5\'c2\'b0C stood alongside the previous target of 2\'c2\'b0C.Edna Molewa, South Africa's environment minister, was quick to point to these compromises and cut through the hyperbolic self-congratulation. The developing world had given up more than the developed world, and this would have to be fixed at COP22, she said. "Again, developing countries have been asked to take this leap without the firm commitments to provide the support that will enable us to contribute our fair share."The agreement, as it stands, locks the world into a 3\'c2\'b0C temperature increase this century. For Africa it means a 5\'c2\'b0C increase this century. Summer temperatures will head into the 40s on a regular basis, and increasing ocean levels will eat away at coastal cities. In South Africa, drought will become more frequent and staple crops will not grow. Livestock will vanish from the interior.But the Paris agreement, though currently ensuring this future, also gives the pathway towards a world that can be survived. Each country has already submitted its plan for tackling climate change - its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution. These will be reviewed every five years, with a mixture of realpolitik and peer pressure ensuring that countries submit increasingly ambitious plans. Linked to ever-better sustainable technology - the price of renewables has gone down 80% in the past five years - this will see countries naturally adopting economic models that do not need to emit vast amounts of greenhouse gases. For the first time in more than two centuries, the rule that economic growth comes with a growth in emissions will cease to be true. Thanks to the Paris agreement - with everyone symbolically and practically starting to head in the same direction - humankind may just have agreed to save itself. \</doc>

The organisers of the COP21 climate conference starting in Paris in a month's time are faced with an unenviable task as they prepare for an event that it is hoped will produce a new roadmap to stop the Earth warming... They must welcome tens of thousands of participants to a site near the French capital, house them, feed and transport them, and do so in the greenest conditions possible, with the world's media dissecting every aspect of the event's organisation. With US President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping among more than 80 world leaders attending the 21st United Nations Climate Change Conference -- the biggest international meet in France since the Universal Declaration of Human rights was drawn up in 1948 -- security will also be tight when proceedings open on November 30. But above all else, as world leaders comes together aiming to reach a single agreement on tackling climate change, with the goal of capping warming at two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-Industrial Revolution levels - the conference has to be ecologically exemplary. This conference is "exceptional in every way, because of its duration (two weeks), the seriousness of what is at stake which affects us all, and because it brings together a great number of participants," said the official in charge, Pierre-Henri Guignard. A temporary town is being built at Le Bourget near Paris to host the event, with organisers claiming it has been planned according to the principles of sustainable development. The 40-acre site includes 60 buildings that house meeting rooms, restaurants, shops, a bank, a post office, a 24-hour press centre for 3,000 journalists and medical facilities - and through all of that runs a covered avenue. The estimated 21,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases expected to be produced by the site will be offset after the conference by projects in the Southern Hemisphere, the French government says. French company Engie is supplying a condensing boiler that recovers the lost energy generated in the traditional combustion process, a technique the firm says delivers greatly increased efficiency. There will also be so-called "wind trees" - effectively windmills - while Ikea will supply furniture, Google the computer screens and the Renault-Nissan group are providing 200 electric cars. The 900 trees sacrificed for the wood in the giant room that will host the plenary sessions for 2,000 delegates will be replanted. "The materials we are using have already been used, we are using them again and they will be used once again after the COP," said Patrick Bazanan, of Decoral, the company building part of the site. The collection of restaurants, snack stands, cafes and food trucks that will serve the delegates have been ordered to cut down on wasteful packaging. By using biodegradable and returnable glasses and cups, two million plastic cups will be saved from the waste containers. All cutlery will also be made from biodegradable materials, said Jean-Francois Camarty from catering firm Elior. As you would expect, recycling bins will be situated throughout the site and electric-powered vehicles will pick up the waste. With the organisers acutely aware of coming under scrutiny for "food miles", "74% of the food products will be made in France" and where possible they will come from a 200-kilometre radius, Camarty said. Ten thousand bread rolls will be baked on the site every day and any unsold meals will be donated to charity. To reach the site, delegates are being urged to use public transport, and are being given free travel passes as an incentive. The French national rail company SNCF has taken measures to transport an additional 70,000 people every day on the suburban rail line that links the centre of the capital with Le Bourget. But at least one group is shunning the list of official hotels and opting for a truly "green" form of accommodation - a 100-strong French group of Young Ecologists have opted to pitch tents and camp during the conference. They have joined the umbrella organisation, Coalition Climat 21, to criticise the organisers for failing to provide enough accommodation for the thousands of activists expected to demonstrate during the conference.

A total of 195 countries on Saturday adopted a landmark agreement to fight global climate change, which aims to limit the rise in global warming to below 2\'b0C by reducing carbon emissions. The 21st Conference of Parties ( COP 21 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) started on November 28 in Paris, with governments seeking a legally binding deal. The 12-page agreement eventually adopted sets a high aspirational goal to limit global warming to below 2\'b0C, and to strive to keep temperatures at only 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. It also incorporates commitments from 187 countries to reduce emissions, which on their own would only hold warming to between 2.7\'b0C and 3\'b0C. The deal highlights countries' responsibilities for action and provides for finance for poor countries to deal with rising |temperatures, both key asks for developing nations. It also includes human rights as a bedrock principle, ecosystem integrity, a commitment on technological support, |and the inclusion of a "Loss and Damage" article. However, it sets out procedures for review at regular intervals to increase emissions cuts, with countries aiming to peak global greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, and then rapidly scale down in the second half of this century. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said the agreement demonstrated solidarity, was ambitious, flexible, credible, and durable. All countries had agreed to hold the global temperature rise to well below 2\'b0C. "This is especially important for the nations of Africa, small island developing states, and least developed countries. You have listened to the voices of the most vulnerable and recognised the importance of minimising and addressing loss and damage. "One-hundred-and-eighty-seven parties have submitted their national plans, the INDCs. I urge the remaining parties to submit their plans as soon as possible. You have rightly agreed that the current level of ambition is the floor, not the ceiling, and that every five years, beginning before 2020, you will regularly review what is needed in line with science. "Developed countries have agreed to lead in mobilising finance and scale-up technology support and capacity building." Ban said the agreement ensured a sufficient, balanced adaptation, and mitigation supporting for developing countries, especially the poorest and most vulnerable. US Secretary of State John Kerry said the agreement would help change to a global clean energy economy and prevent consequences of climate change from happening. "We have reached an agreement that, while everybody here understands there are things here and there that everybody doesn't like, it will help the world prepare for the impacts of climate change that are already here, and also for those we know are now headed our way inevitably," he said. Among the 195 countries, almost 190 have submitted plans for the action they will take against climate change. Rich countries agreed to raise $100 billion a year by 2020 to help poor countries transform their economies. The next COP will be held in Morocco. US President Barack Obama on Saturday called the Paris climate agreement "a turning point for the world," saying it had created an "enduring framework" for future efforts. "This agreement sends a powerful signal that the world is firmly committed to a low-carbon future," said Obama in a televised speech. "This agreement represents the best chance we've had to save the one planet that we've got." Even if all the initial targets set in Paris would be met, the efforts to reduce carbon from the atmosphere would have to be continued, said Obama. "We'll only be part of the way there when it comes to reducing carbon from the atmosphere," he said. "But make no mistake, the Paris agreement establishes the enduring framework the world needs to solve the climate crisis." - ANA, Xinhua \</doc>

GOVERNMENT on all levels must introduce green procurement policies in the same way that it had insisted on local content and black economic empowerment when awarding tenders, delegates said at a |climate change workshop this week. As government spending made up 29 percent of the GDP, insisting on a green procurement policy would be an important way of reducing the country's high greenhouse gas emissions. This was one of the points made by delegates at the Department of Environmental Affairs' workshop in the city, to gain input from civil society and officials in the Western Cape into South Africa's targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The targets - known as intended nationally determined contributions - will be tabled prior to the COP 21 The department has run similar workshops in all provinces. They said the government's responsibility was to cut greenhouse gas emissions regardless of what happened at COP21 . Several groups raised the point that municipalities were pivotal in tackling climate change and that national government needed to involve local authorities. They said 60 percent of South Africa was urbanised, so the role of municipalities was crucial. Delegates dismissed Environmental Affairs' view of having to balance the country's environmental and developmental imperatives when tackling climate change, as this was not an "either or". They said good development was low carbon development, so it served both. They also urged Environmental Affairs to take ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets to COP21 . Judy Beaumont, deputy director general at Environmental Affairs, said she understood the need to table ambitious targets at the international talks; South Africa has to be able to measure up to the commitments it made in the international arena. "The reality is money is tight, for business, government, local authorities, so we have to make sure what we put into the international space is what we can measure up to." Beaumont agreed that there was a need to change how the Environmental Affairs viewed development versus environment protection and tackling climate change. The UN said 50 percent |of countries, which accounted for almost 70 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, had already submitted their national climate plans in preparation for COP21 . Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention for Climate Change, said these emission reduction targets on their own would not keep the temperature increase below 2\'c2\'baC. "But they underline a sharp and positive departure from business as usual and will form the essential foundation to reach that ultimate goal if governments agree to clearly ramp up ambition over time," she said.

As 195 countries hammered out an agreement to minimise climate change, the town council of Woodland in North Carolina in the United States met to ban a solar farm on its land and prevent all future attempts to establish one of these devilish installations.One of the speakers, a retired science teacher no less, opposed the green energy project because she claimed it would soak up all the sunlight and kill plants in the vicinity.The Paris agreement is powerless to counter such moves. Article 12 states: "Parties shall co-operate in taking measures, as appropriate, to enhance climate change education, training, public awareness, public participation and public access to information."Read: COP21 reached a weak dealBut this commitment is as unenforceable as the rest of the document. Politicians have congratulated themselves just the same. United States President Barack Obama said he believes "this moment can be a turning point for the world", and World Bank president Jim Yong Kim said the deal "finally reflects the aspiration, and the seriousness, to preserve our planet for future generations".And, indeed, reaching any kind of consensus after months of preparation and weeks of exhausting talks can be cathartic. But the Paris agreement has parts that are specific and parts that are binding - never both at once.In November, before the COP21 climate change conference began, US secretary of state John Kerry said it would not produce a binding treaty requiring every country to cut greenhouse gas emissions to a specific level. That earned him a reprimand from French President Fran\'c7ois Hollande, who insisted the agreement would be rock-solid: "If the agreement is not legally binding, there won't be an agreement, because that would mean it would be impossible to verify or control the undertakings that are made."A month later, here's how Politico (politico.com) described a key moment in the deal's passage: "Deep in the legally binding part of the final draft agreement, article four, the text said wealthier countries 'shall' set economy-wide targets for cutting their greenhouse gas pollution, rather than 'should'. The words may be interchangeable outside the negotiating rooms, but in United Nations-speak 'should' isn't legally binding, while 'shall' is. That would have forced Obama to submit the final deal to the Senate, where the Republican majority had promised to kill it. Instead of protracted negotiations, [French Foreign Minister Laurent] Fabius treated the language as a typo, pushed through a quick amendment to the text."The final version, of course, says that "developed country parties should continue taking the lead by undertaking economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets".Thanks to that and to its general vagueness, the deal won't require ratification by the US Congress, where the vote is likely to have gone as it did in Woodland. Kerry's goal has been achieved: the US won't be blamed for killing off a global effort to slow down climate change. But it's Hollande and Fabius who are taking the credit for engineering a diplomatic breakthrough.What the deal actually does is set a tentative target - to keep global warming to no more than 2\'c2\'b0C above preindustrial levels (that allows for a remaining increase of about 1.1\'c2\'b0C) and to try limiting it to 1.5\'c2\'b0C - and it instructs each participating country to publish its own plans for contributing to this effort regularly. The negotiators call this a "framework", and the requirement to produce the plans is binding, but nobody has taken on any obligations to comply with any common plan and there's no punishment for treating the emissions-reducing programmes as a formality or never following through on them.Apart from the temperature goal, there's just one specific number in the agreement (its nonbinding part): $100-billion a year, the amount of assistance to be provided by developed nations to developing ones so they can make their energy industries cleaner and greener. That number was already part of the previous climate accord, reached in 2009 in Copenhagen. This level of funding was supposed to be reached by 2020. Since 2009, however, governments and environmentalists have failed to agree on what kind of financing to include in the $100-billion. For example, do loans issued on market terms qualify? If they don't, the $100-billion goal is hardly achievable.A report from the World Resource Institute, published earlier this year, put the total climate finance from developed nations and international institutions at $42-billion in 2012 and projected that it could reach $77-billion by 2020 under a medium-growth scenario.Only private sector funding can drive it up to more than $100-billion a year and, even if it does, it's not clear whether this will keep global warming to the 2\'c2\'b0C target. In 2010, the World Bank put the necessary funding at $275-billion a year. International diplomacy is useful in getting governments to agree on common goals. It's important that there is an international agreement in which most of the world's nations acknowledge climate change and the need to do something about it. But that is all the Paris deal is good for.In the real world, the energy transition is all about developed nations' isolated efforts to cut emissions. Germany and some of its European neighbours, such as Denmark, have gone a long way and paid dearly to get greener. In the process, they have created markets for the technology and equipment needed for sustainable energy. These markets are still shaky, but they're growing less dependent on subsidies. There will be further technological advances. Last week, Germany's Max Planck Institute turned on a revolutionary fusion reactor that might make waste-free, safe energy generation commercially feasible in the coming decades.When the costs of green technology are low enough for developing countries to adopt them, they will do so without much prompting. The richer nations' contribution is in developing, testing and scaling the technology.The diplomats and politicians might like to get in on the process and help it along, but the future of climate change depends on scientists and markets. All governments can do is make sure they are not hampered because the world is full of Woodland town councils. - \Â£9 Bloomberg \</doc>

SOUTH Africa's pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions was among the four most ambitious commitments submitted to the COP21 climate talks, according to a Bloomberg New Energy Finance report. The others were South Korea, Brazil and Mexico. And Bloomberg's Climatescope 2015 report showed that South Africa was the fourth top investor in renewable energy after China, Brazil and Chile. The 160 countries that together accounted for 95 percent of global emissions pledged a cumulative reduction of 37 gigatons (Gt) between 2016 and 2030. "This is not enough to put the world on a 2\'c2\'baC trajectory, which would require further reductions of 15 to 20Gt a year by 2030," the report said. Bloomberg analysts saw India and south-east Asia as key to curbing future growth in global emissions. Although India and southeast Asia currently accounted for less than 20 percent of global emissions from the power sector, this would change dramatically over the next 25 years when the planned 200 giga watts of coal-fired power plants were built in the region. "We forecast India and southeast Asia will account for almost 40 percent of global emissions from the power sector by 2040. Over the next 25 years, cumulative power sector emissions in India and south-east Asia will almost equal that of China," it said. China's emissions are expected to peak before 2030, but India and south-east Asia's emissions are expected to keep on rising until 2040. "If global emissions growth is to be brought under control, it is crucial to address growth in India and south-east Asia," the report said. The global power system would be transformed over the coming decades, based purely on economic trends. Renewable energy was getting cheaper and costs had fallen to such an extent that these power sources were competitive with |fossil fuel. "On a levellised cost of electricity basis, renewable energy technologies are currently cheaper than coal or gas-fired powered plants in several of the world's major markets. Based purely on economic trends, we expect that the global power system will be transformed and the share of fossil fuels in power generation will peak around 2025 and begin to slowly decline thereafter. We expect fossil fuel to fall from 66 percent to 44 percent by 2040." Renewable energy would dominate new power plants purely because of the dropping price of these technologies, even without additional policies to support low carbon technology. "Energy efficiency gains and greater penetration of wind and solar will eat into the demand for coal and natural gas in the power sector. "This impact is not being adequately recognised by the fossil fuel industry or by the International Energy Agency (IEA). We expect the power sector coal and gas demand to be below the forecasts made by BP, Exxon, Statoil, Shell, Gazprom and the IEA," the report said. Although the high growth of renewable energy would result in a decline in greenhouse gas emissions, these would be "far from enough" to keep the temperature rise at 2\'c2\'baC. \</doc>

Google's new Street Views, captured by Polar Bears International, showcase the threatened habitats of polar bears in Canada. Google Maps on Monday provided online street views of remote locations around the world where wildlife is threatened by pollution and climate change, in time with the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. Originally providing panoramic photographs of cities and residential areas to users of Google Maps, Google Street View now allows users to virtually explore wilder settings, such as mountains, rainforests and ocean depths. Some street views are constructed to give users a picture of the threats felt by people and animals in these areas. "From polar bears in the Canadian Arctic, to communities in the Brazilian Amazon, to blue oak trees in Central California, the impacts of climate change are being felt by plants, animals, and people across the planet," said Karin Tuxen-Bettman, outreach programme manager for Google Earth. The new street views were constructed in collaboration with a number of organisations working to address environmental damage, and aim to showcase the work these organisations are doing.

The United Nations' International Day of Rural Women that is observed on 15 October, celebrates and honours rural women around the world... The first International Day of Rural Women was observed in 2008. The idea of honouring rural women with a special day was put forward at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China, in 1995. It was suggested that October 15 be celebrated as "World Rural Women's Day," which is the eve of World Food Day, to highlight rural women's role in food production and food security. Celebrating Southern Africa's rural women GenderCC Southern Africa, a nonprofit organisation with the vision of becoming a leading platform for women to effectively represent their needs and rights at grassroots, national, regional and international climate policy areas, will be hosting a workshop in Johannesburg (Joubert Park, Greenhouse Project) on 15 October. Hundreds of women from around Gauteng and the country will be in attendance, as well as various local and regional stakeholder organisations. According to Dorah Marema, executive director of GenderCC Southern Africa, the day will be celebrated by looking at challenges as well as the proposals from women for the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France in December 2015. "Although progress has been made to recognise the role of women in agriculture, much more still needs to be done. Despite women in Africa being the primary providers of household food security, women still do not receive the same level of support from governments and financial institutions as men do. We want to build partnerships with women which can influence policy and the status quo for the benefit of the broader society," Marema explained. All media and interested parties are welcome. \</doc>

Ethiopia has set targets to slash carbon emissions by two-thirds within the next 15 years, the most ambitious goal so far presented to an upcoming UN climate change conference in Paris... "Ethiopia intends to achieve its vision of becoming carbon-neutral, with the mid-term goal of attaining middle-income status," according to a statement published on the website of the UN convention on climate change. Addis Ababa has set a target to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases by 64 percent by 2030, the most ambitious plan to date presented to the United Nations Climate Change Conference , which begins in November. Ethiopia said it plans to cut emissions by adopting cleaner practices in agriculture, construction and transport, as well as slowing deforestation. More than three-quarters of Ethiopians have no access to electricity, and depend entirely on wood stoves -- a major source of carbon dioxide. The Ethiopian government has launched major infrastructure projects to increase renewable energy production, including the giant Grand Renaissance dam on the Blue Nile river, to produce 6,000 MW when completed in 2017. Ethiopia has also built several wind farms and geothermal projects in recent years. "Ethiopia's strategy to build a climate resilient green economy is showing the way to rich countries - from Australia to Japan - who have yet to announce their final countries commitments ahead of the critical climate summit in Paris," said Tim Gore, Oxfam's international climate adviser. Ethiopia is the twelfth country worldwide and the third African nation to submit its contribution to the climate conference in Paris. Source: AFP \</doc>

South Africa will push for an agreement that ensures global emission reduction efforts are adequate to keep the increase in global temperature below 2\'c2\'b0C at the upcoming climate change conference in Paris. Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa on Monday held an interactive multi-stakeholder engagement in preparation for South Africa's participation in the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which will be held from 30 November to 11 December. The UNFCCC Secretariat synthesis of all Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted so far has concluded that the sum of all emission reduction pledges is likely to put the world on track to a 3\'c2\'b0C temperature increase. In the African context, this implies a 4\'c2\'b0C to 6\'c2\'b0C temperature rise in many countries, she said. Inevitably this will have an impact on water and food security, infrastructure and overall development of countries in the continent, including South Africa. Minister Molewa said it was clear that collectively the INDCs will not reach the level of ambition that science indicates is required to keep the world temperature rise below 2\'c2\'b0C. The Paris Agreement must therefore find a way to address this ambition gap. This is a survival issue for many African countries and Small Island Developing States, she said. South Africa, which is part of the Africa Group, will negotiate for a Paris agreement under the convention that is ambitious, durable, fair, and effective. Minister Molewa said the agreement must balance environmental and development imperatives. The deal must have adaptation at its core and there must be an ambitious outcome on finance, technology and capacity building to support the adaptation and mitigation efforts of developing countries. A key position of the Africa Group is that adaptation is a global responsibility, she said. Whip of the Portfolio Committee on Environmental Affairs Zondi Makhubele said the committee has proposed the introduction of a climate change bill to the Department of Environmental Affairs. We envisage developing an effective domestic climate legislation as a possible and commendable route to shape multilateral processes as a bottom-up strategy, Makhubele said. He said climate change was rapidly pushing communities, particularly the poor and marginalised, beyond their capacity to respond effectively to their ever changing circumstances. Climate change poses a serious threat to sustainable development in South Africa, largely due to the lack of financial capacity to manage the impacts of global climate change on the most vulnerable that sadly appear to constitute the vast majority of the South African population, Makhubele said. The international climate change talks are expected to be the culmination of a four-year negotiation process that was initiated in Durban at COP17 in 2011. All Parties to the UN Climate Convention are expected to adopt either a protocol, legal instrument or agreed outcome with legal force in order to conclude the Durban Mandate. The agreement will be applicable to all parties and will come into effect from 2020. South Africa submitted the country's INDC to the UNFCCC by the 1 October deadline. \</doc>

African countries would do well to take their own lead in finding ways to better adapt to and mitigate the changes that climate may impose on future generations instead of relying only on foreign aid. This was one of the messages that rang out during the international scientific conference on 'Our Common Future under Climate Change' held earlier this month in Paris, six months before the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ), also to be held in Paris, that is supposed to pave the way for a global agreement to keep the rise in the Earth's temperature under 2\'b0C. African countries would do well to take their own lead in finding ways to better adapt to and mitigate the changes that climate may impose on future generations instead of relying only on foreign aid Africa is already feeling climate change effects on a daily basis, according to Penny Urquhart from South Africa, an independent specialist and one of the lead authors of the 5th Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Projections suggest that temperature rise on the continent will likely exceed 2\'b0C by 2100 with land temperatures rising faster than the global land average. Scientific assessments agree that Africa will also face more climate changes in the future, with extreme weather events increasing in terms of frequency, intensity and duration. "Most sub-Saharan countries have high levels of climate vulnerability," Urquhart told IPS. "Over the years, people became good at adapting to those changes but what we are seeing is increasing risks associated with climate change as this becomes more and more pressing." Although data monitoring systems are still poor and sparse over the region, "we do know there is an increase in temperature," she added, warning that if the global average temperature increases by 2\'b0C by the end of the century, this will be experienced as if it had increased by 4\'b0C in Southern Africa, stated Urquhart. According to the South African expert, vulnerability to climate variation is very context-specific and depends on people's exposure to the impacts, so it is hard to estimate the number of people affected by global warming on the continent. However, IPCC says that of the estimated 800 million people who live in Africa, more than 300 million survive in conditions of water scarcity, and the numbers of people at risk of increased water stress on the continent is projected to be 350-600 million by 2050. In some areas, noted Urquhart, it is not easy to predict what is happening with the rainfall. "In the Horn of Africa region the observations seem to be showing decreasing rainfall but models are projecting increasing rainfall." There have been extreme weather events along the Western coast of the continent, while Mozambique has seen an increase in cyclones that lead to flooding. "Those are the sum of trends that we are seeing," Urquhart, "drying mostly along the West and increase precipitations in the East of Africa". For Edith Ofwona, senior programme specialist of the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), one of the sectors most vulnerable to climate variation in Africa is agriculture - the backbone of most African economies - and this could have direct negative impacts on food security. "The biggest challenge," she said, "is how to work with communities not only to cope with short-term impacts but actually to be able to adapt and be resilient over time. We should come up with practical solutions that are affordable and built on the knowledge that communities have." Experts agree that any measure to address climate change should be responsive to social needs, particularly where severe weather events risk uprooting communities from their homelands by leaving families with no option but to migrate in search of better opportunities. This new phenomenon has created what it is starting to be called "climate migrants", said Ofwona. Climate change could also exacerbate social conflicts that are aggravated by other drivers such as competition over resources and land degradation. According to the IDRC expert, "you need to consider the multi-stress nature of poverty on people's livelihoods ... and while richer people may be able to adapt, poor people will struggle." Ofwona said that the key is to combine scientific evidence with what communities themselves know, and make it affordable and sustainable. "It is important to link science to society and make it practical to be able to change lives and deal with the challenges people face, especially in addressing food security requirements." Meanwhile, she added, consciousness in Africa of the impacts of climate change is "fairly high" - some countries have already defined their own climate policies and strategies, and others have green growth strategies with low carbon and sustainable development. Stressing the critical role that African nations themselves play in terms of creating the right environmental policy, Ofwona said that they should be protagonists in dealing with climate impacts and not only passive in receiving international help. African governments should provide some of the funding that will be needed to implement adaptation and mitigation projects and while "we can also source internationally, to some extent we need to contribute with our own money. While the consciousness is high, the extent of the commitment is not equally high." Edited by Phil Harris \</doc>

KwaZulu-Natal Premier, Senzo Mchunu, congratulated the eThekwini Metro and the 2022 Commonwealth Games Bid Committee on a successful bid and for bringing the 22nd Commonwealth Games to KwaZulu-Natal in 2022. This is indeed a historical moment not only for KwaZulu-Natal and South Africa but for the entire continent of Africa. The positive economic spin-offs of hosting these games will include an increase in tourism, infrastructure development and maintenance which will in turn help in our endeavours of improving job opportunities. With its world-class facilities, beautiful sunshine and surf, and outstanding accommodation and venues Durban is the ideal city to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games. This bid is a fully integrated part of KwaZulu-Natal's strategic intention to build the profile of the Province as a world-class sports destination and to generate significant economic benefits for the region. KwaZulu-Natal has, in the past, hosted a number of international events to great success. These include the annual Duzi Canoe Marathon, the Comrades Marathon and world surfing events. other non-sporting events that have been hosted by the province include the 2000 International Aids Conference, the launch of the African Union in 2002, the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2011, to mention but a few. These events and many others that have been hosted successfully by the Province are an indication of our capabilities of discharging our duties with dedication and diligence and of ensuring that they proceed without any glitches or security breaches. As the work starts in earnest in preparing to host our international guests we again appeal to all the people of KwaZulu-Natal to join hands with Government, the private-sector and all stakeholders in ensuring that all our guests get to experience the spirit of Ubuntu that KwaZulu-Natal is famous for. \</doc>

The Department of Environmental Affairs has noted media reports questioning the size of the South African delegation attending the 21st Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris, France. Climate change is one of the major global challenges of the 21st century. It is an economic, social and environmental challenge that requires political leadership and co-ordination across all sectors and spheres of government, as well as engagement with leaders of business, labour, civil society and research institutions. South Africa's delegation must therefore be representative of all key national departments as well provinces and local government, and all key stakeholder groupings, under the leadership of the Department of Environmental Affairs. Later today, 11 December 2015, Ministers and delegates from more than 196 countries are expected to conclude a new ambitious, fair and effective multilateral legal instrument, applicable to all Parties, which will provide the legal basis for addressing the global challenge of climate change from 2020. In this process, South Africa is leading negotiations on finance, technology and capacity building, on behalf of the Africa Group, and is the chair of the Group of 77 and China, which is negotiating on behalf of developing countries. We are also engaging actively in the negotiations on pre 2020 implementation programmes. The agreement would have come about as a result of long hours, working around the clock, on complex multiple parallel work streams, formal and informal meetings, negotiations and consultation sessions and side events. It is therefore highly imperative that those who write articles, must address the context and facts. It is not helpful that when our teams spend sleepless nights serving their nation, South Africa, in ensuring that our national interest is fully secured and that our planet is saved (in the climate change negotiations context), some distort facts and underestimate the magnitude of work being done here, and only try to focus on counting heads out of context and facts and therefore try to mislead our nation. Our South African team is determined to do our nation proud and shall not be deterred by "uninformed critics". South Africa is regarded as a constructive negotiator, because it plays a major role in ensuring that parties reach consensus in the negotiations. For example, South Africa has worked hard to ensure that adaptation to the impacts of climate change is recognised as a global responsibility in new legal agreement. This ensures that African countries will be supported in their efforts to address the irreversible effects of climate change on water and food security, health and infrastructure, in the context of increasing global temperatures. We must do everything in our power to secure and pass on to future generations, a country, continent and world that is resilient to the impacts of climate change. "South Africa's active and vigorous participation in these negotiations, and our commitment to ensuring an ambitious, fair and effective legally binding outcome that concludes the Durban Mandate, negotiated under our leadership in 2011, is therefore not negotiable," Minister of Environmental Affairs Ms. Edna Molewa said. \</doc>

NEWS ANALYSISThe time for dreams, hopes and aspirations is over. Political imperative has won the day and now all that remains is for countries to swallow their ambitions and accept a weak Paris climate agreement - one that guarantees that the Earth will be 3\'c2\'b0C hotter this century. That number is catastrophic. In South Africa it means an interior 5\'c2\'b0C hotter than now, devoid of rainfall, grain and livestock.But it was always going to be this way. COP21 - the 21st meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - is the climax of a two-decade attempt to achieve the impossible: get 196 countries to agree to save themselves by putting aside their differences. The mathematics of it is straightforward. Spend some money now on a greener economy - which in itself will drive a whole new industry - or spend a whole lot more dealing with the damage a changing climate will do to the economy. The influential 2006 Stern Review broke it down like this: lowering carbon emissions now would cost 1% of global gross domestic product (GDP) and not doing anything would cost up to 20% of global GDP each year simply in dealing with the damage caused by climate change. Similar thinking led world leaders to create the UN climate change framework in 1992, which would be legally binding and contain key goals, such as the need to ensure average global warming does not exceed 2\'c2\'b0C - but it is already halfway there. Its first success was the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. This top-down agreement saw industrialised countries committing to lowering their carbon emissions by a certain amount. In a binary economic world this was simple - the developed world accepted its role in generating the majority of carbon emissions and agreed to do the most to lower them, while helping developing countries to follow a less carbon-intensive model. This system was a product of a post-communist world, in which the framework convention codified the world into Annex-1 (developed) and non-Annex-1 (developing) countries. But then the economies of China, India and Brazil exploded. They found common ground - together with South Africa - and formed the Basic negotiating bloc, which began to dominate COP talks as they sought to defend their high-coal development pathways. Led by China, it sank COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009 - the last time an agreement to lower emissions was on the table. Ambitious targets were thrown out and, at the end, it took world leaders in a locked room to salvage a political victory - with large countries promising to lower their emissions by a voluntary amount. South Africa's plan to lower emissions by 42% by 2025 comes from this, although it is not legally binding. That moment so soured negotiations that it took a tremendous rally from a developing world and European Union alliance in Durban at COP17 to salvage the process. The Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action provided a timetable - four years of negotiations, to end in Paris in 2015 with an agreement to tackle climate change. Each country was also compelled to submit its climate plans prior to Paris, in the form of what were dubbed intended nationally determined contributions. These were to provide a road map for how each country intended to lower its emissions and build resilience to the changing climate. But, put together, these plans only do enough to keep global warming to just below 3\'c2\'b0C this century. Giving urgency to proceedings, the Paris meeting started during a period of unprecedented temperature increases - with 2015 on course to be the hottest year ever recorded, and 10 months this year have set their own temperature records. An unprecedented 150 world leaders gave vitriolic speeches, extolling the virtues of climate action now. China and the United States led the way, showing how their national circumstances - catastrophic air pollution in China and a moratorium on climate legislation in the US - now meant they would support an agreement. But that was just politicking. Negotiators then sat down to tear into a draft climate change agreement. The product of months of negotiation, this draft still arrived in Paris littered with hundreds of square brackets - outlining all the possible options. Negotiators had a week to whittle this down to a few sticking points, before the arrival of national environment ministers in the last week. The scientific imperative would then be handed over to politicians to work out what could be traded to reach a compromise deal. Much of this happens in large plenary sessions at the converted airfield outside Paris that is being used for negotiations. But the real decisions are taken in small huddles in the corridors and in poorly ventilated rooms, where a handful of sweating ministers have candid discussions about what each side is willing to compromise on. They then hold press briefings, where ministers put across the message they want the world's media to publish - all with the objective of telling each other on another platform what they are unwilling to trade on. When this does not work, negotiators sit together on the bus back to their hotels - or in coffee bars - and trade square brackets. In the past week this saw a 40-page draft cut down to 29 pages. The urgency of Friday's deadline - and all-night discussions held by sleep-deprived officials - has cut the sticking points down to the fundamental differences that have bedevilled every COP in the past decade. Getting around these will be the key to a Paris agreement.The critical groups now are the US (which wants an agreement but one that its Senate does not have to ratify); the EU (which wants an ambitious agreement to justify its years of spending on renewable energy); oil-rich countries such as Saudi Arabia (which want the weakest agreement possible to secure their oil revenues); the poorest and most vulnerable countries, such as island states (which want loss and damage funds to cover the fact that their countries are already suffering from climate change); and the Basic countries (which want to avoid responsibility for their growing emissions, while still getting funding from developed countries to adapt to climate change).Each one of these has intractable demands that will either derail the agreement or - in all likelihood - see the pact come out so weak that it does little more than get countries heading in the same direction. In simple terms, Europe and most developing countries want an agreement that keeps the world less than 1.5\'c2\'b0C hotter. But those nations want finance for the damage resulting from that change, and Europe is loath to give it because China and India will have access to it. The EU and the US want the basis for future climate action - the intended nationally determined contributions - to be reviewed every five years as technology matures. This will allow the 3\'c2\'b0C warming guaranteed by current contributions to be ratcheted down. The Basic group largely rejects this - particularly India, which is going through a boom in coal-fired power generation. The group is instead focused on the Green Climate Fund, which developed countries set up after the Copenhagen COP to disburse $100?billion a year in climate funding. The developed world says $60?billion of this has been raised, but India has rejected the accounting behind this figure. And although most parties want the agreement to be legally binding, so that countries have to do as they promise, the US has consistently argued against this, saying voluntary agreements work.These differences are fundamental. The lofty rhetoric is there - US President Barack Obama warned that "we are the first generation to feel the effect of climate change and the last generation who can do something about it" - but the reality of getting 196 countries to agree to a single plan means nobody wins.Deciding the futureThe draft agreement has still not settled the major disputes.

THE BORDERS have been drawn, |the central point of the convergence |of the puzzle is clear. In December, |governments will convene to continue their efforts to complete the climate change puzzle. They will be meeting to negotiate a multilateral climate change regime under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The event is an annual one - this is the 21st Conference Of the Parties ( COP21 ) to the convention and it will be held in Paris. What is important about COP21 is that governments and interested parties will be meeting to fulfil a programme of work adopted at COP17 in Durban in 2011. This year, the parties to the COP negotiations were required to prepare their sections of the puzzle for submission. They are supposed to bring almost-complete sections of the puzzle to the year-end meeting. This requires some level of preparation. The parties previously took different pieces of the puzzle back to their national territories with the intention of compiling intended nationally|determined contributions (INDCs). The INDCs are like pieces to a section of the global puzzle which have been given to individual country to put together. Globally, all the parties to the UNFCCC have their pieces but they do not necessarily know how they will fit together as a complete puzzle. The UNFCCC climate negotiations, as well as the subsequent inter-sessionals, have largely focused on the big picture of national contributions and have placed great importance on the architecture of the post-2020 climate agreement. However, the emerging consensus on the development and speed of the negotiations has raised concern over discussions concerning pre-2020 ambitions and pledged support. All of these crucial aspects of the next climate change regime beyond the Kyoto Protocol form part of the negotiations in the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (the ADP). Parties at the UNFCCC inter-sessionals exchange puzzle pieces and share what images|are emerging from their current work when the sections are put together. The architecture of the post-2020 agreement is akin to completing the boundaries of the puzzle - it is the setting of parameters and rules. But what seems to be a challenge is the fact that there seem to be more puzzle pieces than there is space to complete the puzzle after all the edges of the puzzle are laid out and completed. The question is where do the other pieces come from and where are they meant to go? This part of the conversation forms part of the stalled negotiations around pre-2020 ambitions as well as finance discussions. In the local context, the South African section of the puzzle is intriguing and somewhat|complicated. Remember COP17? Remember the cheers and the applause, the sense of accomplishment in finally coming up with a roadmap (a way to divide the puzzle pieces and to potentially assist one another) and the redemption of the multilateral climate process (that parties can at least agree on something, even if it is just a roadmap)? Well, the ADP was born and designed in Durban (hence the name "Durban Platform"). South Africa in its capacity as a negotiating party in the UNFCCC has made it clear that it will seek to maintain and champion the COP17 legacy. The INDCs have come about as a consequence of the Durban platform. The process requires the government to stand-up and proclaim true ambition. Even though the INDCs may have come at a later stage in the negotiating process, they nonetheless are crucial in achieving the ADP's purpose, and ultimately the UNFCCC's objective. South Africa, as the host of the ADP and the site for the design of subsequent contributions, needs to be ambitious and to commit to real |emissions reduction before 2025. At this stage of defining our INDC, we need to set out a clear and ambitious intention to mitigate and adapt to climate change. This year, we will be playing a pivotal role in the international community. South Africa is the co-chair of the most inclusive developing-country negotiating group known as "the G77 & China". We have the opportunity to champion the development of ambitious INDCs, and to orchestrate a unified negotiating position for developing countries that is consistent with achieving a fair and binding global climate agreement. Back home, South Africa needs to bring more stakeholders on board to help share their insights into completing our section of the puzzle. Our contributions have to take into account a number of circumstances such as: l Very high carbon emissions - South Africa is the world's 11th largest annual emitter of carbon dioxide (with a possible 10 percent increase in emissions when Medupi and Kusile come online). l High historical emissions. l An ever-increasing energy intensity ranking - South Africa is 48th out of the world's 50 largest economies. l Wealth distribution disparities. l A growing unemployment rate. l Developmental challenges . l Historical and current international |commitments. The world's governments will finally share their completed puzzle pieces by the end of next month. The question is, will South Africa be on time in submitting its INDC? The process of compiling the South African INDC has been less than ideal, but at least there will be stakeholder consultations. South Africa is at an important stage of putting together its part of the puzzle. It still remains to be seen how these consultations will play out, as some of them have been delayed. The pieces need to create a real, consistent image. The consultation process needs various perspectives and should not be rushed, but then again there is a deadline looming, and South Africa should not keep the international|community waiting too long. Other countries in similar situations to South Africa have already submitted their contributions. It is time South Africa demonstrated its vision and completed what it started at COP17. l Happy Khambule is the policy and research co-ordinator at Project 90 by 2030, an|environmental NPO based in Cape Town. \</doc>

Cape Town opts for fleet of electric buses THE City of Cape Town is to put out a multimillion-rand tender for a fleet of 12m-long electric buses. The city is also considering electric double-decker buses for long-distance trips. The tender, worth R50m over two years, specifies that the electric buses should be able to travel at least 250km in traffic before their batteries need recharging. Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille said: & The successful bidder must also provide the city with the charging stations for the buses and the necessary training for drivers and mechanical engineers.& The metro is undertaking a research project into biofuels to determine how it can use them to run a cleaner and more efficient MyCiTi bus service. China and the US have been experimenting with electric vehicles to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and curb air pollution. British futurologist Ian Pearson has forecast that in 2026 the electric car will overtake its petrol-powered cousins in terms of sales. Last year, Nissan and BMW said they would collaborate to advance electric vehicle and plug-in hybrid car-adoption in SA. The two vehicle manufacturers have agreed to plan and build a national grid of charging stations that will power electric vehicles. Ms de Lille, who uses a hybrid car as her official mayoral vehicle, said: & The operational cost of electric buses is lower, not only in terms of fuel, but also in relation to maintenance as there are fewer parts to service.& Electric buses are easier to drive, their motors generate less heat than diesel engines and make less noise. Transport for Cape Town, the city's transport authority, is exploring a mechanism for procuring solar technology to offset the energy required for an electric bus fleet. Ms de Lille said the initiative was in line with Cape Town's commitment to the progressive action pledged at last year's United Nations climate change conference in Paris to reduce energy consumption and emissions. & The city's Energy 2040 Strategy sets carbon targets, and projects like this will help to ensure that we reach them,& the mayor said. & As we reduce our carbon footprint, Transport for Cape Town will earn carbon credits which the city will be able to sell to developed countries that are signatories to the Kyoto Protocol. & This will generate much-needed revenue for the city and result in public transport benefits for residents, making this investment even more worth our while,& she said. phakathib@bdfm.co.za \</doc>

The Davis Tax Committee (DTC) takes its mandate from its Terms of Reference. Amongst other items, The terms of reference for the Tax Review Committee are to inquire into the role of the tax system in the promotion of inclusive economic growth, employment creation, development and fiscal sustainability. The committee will take into account recent domestic and international developments and, particularly, the long term objectives of the National Development Plan. The DTC received numerous requests to inquire into the carbon tax proposed by National Treasury in various discussion papers released to the public since 2006. National Treasury also released its draft proposed carbon tax legislation on 2 November 2015 for public comment. Although not specifically listed in its Terms of Reference, there is sufficient scope for the DTC to examine the proposed carbon tax and make recommendations to the Minister of Finance, based on the following wording in the DTC's Terms of Reference: The Committee is mandated to study any further tax issues which, in the Committee's view, should be addressed in order to promote inclusive economic growth, employment creation, development and fiscal sustainability. United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris this December, the DTC expedited the submission of its comments and recommendations on the proposed carbon tax to the Minister of Finance as input for South Africa's representation at the conference. A DTC report was submitted to the Minister on 29 October 2015. He subsequently approved the release of the report for public comment. In compiling the report, the DTC consulted widely and took into account 45 written and oral submissions from the public. Drafts of the report have been reviewed and discussed by the committee as a whole in the production of the signed-off final version. The DTC will gladly take into account any responses that may be generated by the report and will produce a further report accordingly.

Even if the world celebrates a Paris climate deal on December 11, the process will still have to be regarded as failure. Let me explain why.The basic reason is that the unequal distribution of carbon emissions is not even on its agenda. The historical responsibility of the West is not on the table, nor is a method of national carbon accounting that looks at how the emissions a country consumes rather than produces. Instead, what is on the table are expanded and new mechanisms that will allow the rich, Western countries to outsource their emission cuts so they can paint themselves green.When the figures are in, 2015 is likely to be the warmest year on record and we've just reached 1\'c2\'b0C temperature rise since the industrial revolution, halfway to the 2\'c2\'b0C widely agreed to be the upper safe limit of global warming. It's the fastest surface temperature increase in the world's known geological history. We are now entering "uncharted territory".The dangers of global warming have been known - even to oil company executives - since at least the early 1980s. Yet, despite 25 years of UN-led climate talks, the world is burning more fossil fuels than ever.This is not simply the fault of big emerging economies such as China, India or Brazil. Instead, what we are dealing with is the fundamental failure of neoliberal capitalism, the world's dominant economic system, to confront its hunger for exponential growth that is only made possible by the unique energy density of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas.Historical responsibility A glance at global history reveals how closely energy is linked to economic growth. The Netherlands was the first country to get a taste for exponential industrial growth back in the 16th and 17th centuries - and the Dutch empire was built on the availability of cheap domestic peat as well as timber from Norwegian and Baltic forests. Here's to cheap energy. 'The celebration of the peace of M\'c3\'bcnster' Bartholomeus van der Helst, 1648One reason the British took over the Netherlands' imperial leadership was its vast reserves of cheap coal, which started to be burned at the end of the 18th century, exponentially growing in the 19th century. Then came oil and gas, which helped make America the imperial master from the early 20th century onwards.So there are more than 300 years of massive fossil fuel burning by the so-called West to account for. And while this historical responsibility still played a significant role at Kyoto in 1997 - resulting in emissions cuts that were only legally binding for industrialised countries - it has gradually been pushed into the background.Now in Paris it seems almost forgotten. But the fact that about 80% of historical carbon emissions have to be attributed to the developed countries cannot simply be wished away.The rapid rise of emissions, particularly in China and India, is often cited as reason for why these rapidly industrialising countries now also have to curb their emissions. I'm not saying that they shouldn't. Both countries clearly have their own imperial ambitions, which they hope to achieve by stimulating massive industrial expansion.But let's bear in mind that India's carbon emissions per capita are still 10 times lower than those of the US. And China's rapidly rising emissions are to a great extent driven by export-driven industries, producing consumer goods for the West.Creative carbon accounting In fact if a consumption-based approach to carbon accounting is taken, the UK's national carbon emissions would be twice as high as officially reported. This is also true for most Western European countries and the United States, which have experienced increasing rates of deindustrialisation over the past two decades with not only jobs but also carbon emissions being offshored to developing countries. In return the West is receiving cheap consumer goods without recognising the responsibility for the embedded carbon emissions that come with them. A clear form of carbon colonialism. Western countries import goods - and export emissions. William Hong / ReutersOf course, some of the exponential growth in carbon emissions by India and China is also due to increases in home-grown consumption. China apparently now has the largest middle class in the world. However, if we take a consumption-based view, then even China's emissions per capita will not reach the US's current rate for a long time - and India's lag further behind.Yet rich countries continue to be eager to outsource their responsibilities. Carbon offsetting will see an unprecedented growth in the coming years. Countries such as Norway and Switzerland will continue to strike bilateral deals with poor nations desperate for cash. Emissions trading systems (ETS) will allow maximum flexibility for companies to offset their emissions.These are all mechanisms designed to cement the status quo. The EU ETS has not made a significant impact on the trading bloc's carbon emissions since its inception in 2005, allowing Shell's chief executive, Ben Van Beurden, to insist even in 2015 that: "The reality of demand growth is such that fossil fuels will be needed for decades to come."Nothing significant has changed since Rio 1992 or Kyoto 1997. Paris 2015 will be no different. The talking will continue until we realise climate change is a failure of a system, which - on the back of fossil fuel - is geared towards exponential economic growth. Nobody who sits at the negotiation table in Paris has the mandate nor inclination to ask fundamental, systemic questions of the logic of the dominant economic system and the way we consume the resources of this planet.Steffen B\'c3\'b6hm, Professor in Management and Sustainability, and Director, Essex Sustainability Institute, University of EssexThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

On Saturday, 12 December 2015, Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) adopted a historic Agreement in Paris to address greenhouse gas emission for the post-2020 period, while increasing countries' ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change during the next session. This would not have been possible if South Africa had not delivered the outcomes it did as President of COP17/CMP7, held in Durban in 2011. The success in Paris is the culmination of the watershed Durban Climate Change Conference in 2011 where Parties to the Convention agreed to the mandate for the Paris Agreement. We congratulate South Africans for this contribution to finding solutions to a global challenge. We also thank the United Nations for the opportunity provided to us to play this role. This Agreement was also reached as South Africa chaired the Group of 77 plus China - a group of more than 130 developing countries representing more than eighty percent of the world's population. The Group is comprised of a diverse group of countries, but united by the goal to protect their vulnerable and poor. Under South Africa's leadership the Group of G77 plus China was more united than ever before in the history of the climate change negotiations and South Africa managed to rally this group of developing countries, which made a decisive difference in building the political will that was required to reach agreement on this important issue. Climate change poses a grave threat to developing countries' ability to ensure that their people are lifted out of poverty. It has therefore been a great honour for South Africa to play such a key role at both the beginning and at the end of the process through which the international community worked toward reaching this historic solution. The agreement presents a big step forward in committing all countries to act decisively against climate change. Through this agreement, hope has been restored for a safe and prosperous future, where climate change will be adequately addressed. We congratulate the South African team in Paris under the leadership of the Minister of Environmental Affairs, Ms Edna Molewa who was supported by Ministers Dipuo Peters (Transport), Nomvula Mokonyane (Water and Sanitation) and Senzeni Zokwana (Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries), Ambassador Nozipho Mxakatho Diseko (Department of International Relations and Cooperation) and other senior officials.

Environmental damage to the oceans is silent, while wreaking havoc on the globe's eco-systems. With Marine Week this last week having raised issues of ocean warming, over-fishing and pollution, marine ecologists will be highlighting these problems at at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) COP 21 , at the end of next month. Judy Mann, a conservation strategist at the SA Association for Marine Biological Research (SAAMBR) in Durban, said while they would not be attending COP 21 directly, they would have representation through partners and colleagues. Describing Marine Protected Areas off the South African coast as "the Kruger National Parks of the oceans and coasts", Mann said these zones were vital in protecting ocean biodiversity. "The key issues facing our South African oceans are over-exploitation, climate change (ocean acidification), pollution and rampant coastal development, among others," said Mann. Another committed conservationist and leading global figure in marine conservation is Prince Albert of Monaco, who is married to former South African Olympic swimmer, now Princess Charlene of Monaco, who shares her husband's passion for restoring the oceans back to health. At the turn of the 20th century, his great-great-great-grandfather, Prince Albert I of Monaco, was one of the first ecologists to sound the alarm on over-fishing. An explorer and a passionate conservationist, he led the way in establishing modern oceanography. More than 100 years later, Prince Albert II has seen first-hand the irreparable damage that has been done to the environment. In a recent interview with Paris-Match magazine, he highlighted his 2005 expedition to the North Pole, where he literally retraced Albert I's footsteps in the snow. "He left on an expedition to discover an unknown land and I went there to see the alarming damage suffered by this weakened environment. "One hundred years after Albert I, from the Lilliehook glacier, we photographed a panorama that he himself had taken and when you compare the two photographs, you can see that the glacier has receded by 6km," said Prince Albert. "In his accounts dating back to the beginning of last century, Albert I was already pre-occupied by the long-term problems resulting from over-fishing and they have continued to grow ever since. "For a long time, we were led to believe that fish and seafood would be inexhaustible. "We now know that if we make no effort to respect quotas - quotas which, for certain species, I find still too generous - in less than 40 years there will not be enough fish left to feed us," said Prince Albert. "In the Pacific Ocean, the mass of accumulated waste spreads over a perimeter which is larger than the state of Texas and is piled up to depths of several metres. It is disintegrating, but extremely slowly. "On Spitsbergen, we found waste on very remote desert islands where the only inhabitants are polar bears. It's quite staggering," he said. Over-fishing, pollution, melting glaciers, ocean warming and acidification are all challenges that are going to come under a harsh spotlight at an event to be held at the |United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change COP21 conference on December 4 in Paris. The UN World Oceans Day event, held in June this year, attended by key stakeholders, decision-makers and heads of state, identified key issues that must be taken forward and urgently addressed at COP 21 . Ocean warming and acidification were highlighted as major threats, with the only long-term solution being a reduction in CO2 emissions. It was agreed that collective action was imperative and would include increasing the number of Marine Protected Areas, promote a low-carbon blue economy, reduce the cumulative impact from pollution and shipping, as well as push for a global reduction in fossil fuels and decarbonising energy systems. Monaco's royal couple became new parents in December last year to twins, Crown Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella. Looking ahead to the world his children would inherit, Prince Albert said a difficult future lay ahead for the next generation and his royal heirs. "They will have to act - and this means preparing them now to broach these environmental issues and imagine solutions by themselves," he said. But he was also upbeat about how new technology could create jobs and address unemployment. "There are not many who have realised the development of renewable energy or new environmental technologies can generate jobs," he said. "Even if this new economy is not yet tangible, we must be brave enough to take the plunge. "We could continue saying that it will only happen in a hundred years. But a hundred years, that's practically tomorrow. We have to think of our children and the generations that will follow," said the prince. - Additional information: courtesy Paris Match \</doc>

Either we change or the climate does Business leaders need to tackle global warming with courage THE headlines we see in newspapers are arresting: ongoing economic challenges in Europe, oil price volatility, violent instability in the Middle East with spillovers to other regions, and growing concerns about inequality, poverty and global unemployment. This is even before you consider the sort of pressures we face as a bank. New technologies, changing customer demographics and a slew of new regulations are just part of the things we're coming to grips with. On November 30, business leaders, politicians and environmentalists will converge on a wintry Paris for COP21 , the UN conference on climate change . As business, we need to deliver a firm mandate to our negotiators in Paris to enhance the likelihood of a successful deal that will create new opportunities as we move to a low-carbon economy. Simply put, the level of greenhouse gas emissions needs to be drastically slashed now. Quite how this will play out remains to be seen: we cannot be sure that the negotiators will succeed where 20 previous attempts have fallen short, but we really need them to. Time is not on our side. This presents something of a challenge for executives and CEOs. Business has often struggled to deal with climate change, partly because this requires courageous leadership and our ability to consider the whole rather than our narrow self-interest. It's a unique challenge: the impact has no respect for borders, the consequences span generations, and it is distinctively irreversible because once a threshold is breached, there's no going back. What makes it particularly difficult for people - and business - to grasp is that climate change isn't actually caused by evil intentions or deliberate selfishness. Rather, it has its roots in our well-meaning efforts to provide affordable energy, food, and higher living standards. Even understanding the causes and impact of climate change has required an unparalleled scientific endeavour. The basic principles of climate science were firmly established a century ago, and underscored by a US National Academy of Science study in 1979. But it's only in the past two-and-a-half decades that the topic has really been scrutinised and peer-reviewed, unlike almost anything else. True, no process is perfect, but the work overseen by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is surely the best effort the world could have mounted to understand the complexity of the challenge. And the message from the panel is emphatic: the world needs to take rapid and decisive action to avoid dangerous interference with the climate system. This is why we as South African business must lend our support now, to secure some form of globally binding agreement. For sure, any deal will inevitably imply sacrifices from all of us and changes in the way we pursue certain objectives. But longer-term gains nearly always require shorter-term pain, and the bottom line is, we don't really have any alternative. A point that many in the business community overlook is that responding to climate change is the most economically rational thing to do. Fortunately, continued advances in renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy storage technology are also making it increasingly achievable and cost-effective. South Africa, like the rest of the world, can now see a credible pathway ahead for the continued expansion of energy services. At our bank, we're taking these steps as part of an economically rational approach, too: we want to be around for a long time, to create long-term value for our stakeholders, and help shape our society. In our own planning, we have found it useful to apply the lens of a "carbon budget". Budgets are something that we are all very familiar with, and we firmly believe in the discipline that budgeting instils. Applying a carbon budget can unlock a great deal of innovation and far-sighted decision-making, as we are compelled to consider the use of every resource prudently with the future direction in mind. This means our lending portfolio, as well as our branch footprint, need to correspond with a greenhouse emission trajectory that is compatible with an equitable carbon budget for South Africa, informed by the globally accepted 2\'b0C threshold. National legislative frameworks, international political commitments and the latest scientific knowledge provide useful guidance as to what such a budget should be. We need to take a unified message to Paris, all on board with the notion that there simply is no Planet B.

The next three weeks could be crucial if Africa is to avoid scorching temperature increases of up to 6\'c2\'baC, along with more frequent heatwaves, runaway fires and droughts. This was the warning from a group of 11 climate researchers in the build-up to the UN's COP21 climate talks that start in Paris next week. They said an analysis of six computer-based climate models projected that surface temperatures in subtropical Africa could rise by between 4\'c2\'baC and 6\'c2\'baC by the turn of the century. The lead author, Professor Francois Engelbrecht, of the CSIR in Pretoria, said the analysis suggested that temperatures in subtropical Africa "may plausibly rise at about 1.5 times the global rate of temperature increase". Paris talks Their projections, published in a recent issue of Environmental Research Letters, are based on a low rate of greenhouse gas reductions by the more than 190 member states signed up to the UN's framework convention on climate change. Engelbrecht and his colleagues said the "drastic" temperature rises predicted for large parts of Africa should be at the forefront of decisions made by African policymakers at the Paris talks, which end on December 11. They also expressed concern about the strong likelihood of more frequent heatwaves in several parts of Africa. They define a heatwave as an event in which maximum temperatures at a specific location exceed the average maximum temperature of the warmest month of the year by 5\'c2\'baC, for at least three days. Heatwaves were currently seen as rare events over Africa, with about three such events every year on average. But over the period 2071-2100, they expected there to be between 20 and 80 heatwave days over large parts of subtropical southern Africa each year. Over the Sahara and Sahel (the zone between the Sahara Desert to the north and the Sudanian savannah to the south) regions there were likely to be between 10 and 40 heatwave days each year. "These projections are representative of unprecedented periods of prolonged heat over Africa," said Engelbrecht and fellow researchers from the Nasa Space Flight Centre in the US, Australia's CSIRO, Wits University in Johannesburg, North West University in Potchefstroom and two Dutch institutions. The rapidly rising temperature projections were likely to have "drastic impacts" on maize and cattle farmers, the environment and water security. Human health could also be affected, although the precise impacts of chronic exposure to heat were not properly understood because there had been very few academic studies focused on heat and human health.

Today, 2 February 2016 the National Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) launched a multi-million rand second Phase of a Non-Motorised Transport Programme (NMT) at its offices in Pretoria, Gauteng. The launch was conducted in partnership with its funders, the KFW German Development Bank who act on behalf of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany. President Jacob Zuma announced prior to the Copenhagen United Nations Climate Change Conference in December 2009 that South Africa will implement nationally appropriate mitigation actions which will result in the reduction of carbon emissions by 34 % by 2020 and by 42 % in 2025, dependant on availability of finance and technology. The National Climate Change Response Policy was introduced and sets the country's vision for an effective climate change response and the long-term transition to a climate resilient and low-carbon economy and society. eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality City of Johannesburg Polokwane Local Municipality. Phase 1 of the programme was initiated in 2011 focused on developing bicycle routes, parking facilities and rental stations with a view to promote non-motorised transport. The outcome is to reduce carbon emissions, improve air quality; and advocate behavioural change towards a cleaner healthier lifestyle. The infrastructure development of Phase 1 has been completed at eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality and City of Johannesburg, whilst Polokwane Local Municipality is at the final stages of completion. The advocacy component of the NMT Phase 1 Programme comprised of several knowledge sharing sessions including a legislative review in order to inform the NMT agenda from a legislative perspective; the hosting of South Africa's first National Conference on NMT and the development of the NMT Best Practice Manual to aid municipalities in planning, implementing and monitoring of similar projects. Given the success of Phase 1, the DEA secured a grant of EURO 5 million to finance a five year NMT Phase 2 from KfW Development Bank, within the framework of the German-South African bi-national Financial Cooperation with. Phase 2 will comprise of the extension of the existing bicycle networks, to contribute towards efficient intermodal transportation networks within the cities. It will further include associated services such as the promotion of Small, Medium and Micro-sized Enterprises (SMME) development through the establishment of Bicycle Empowerment Centres (BECs). In addition to the infrastructure development and associated services, the programme will have a national component which will entail advocacy campaigns to encourage NMT use by communities. Phase two will not be limited to pilot municipalities who participated in Phase one. \</doc>

The fifth annual 24 Hours of Reality webcast event, hosted by The Climate Reality Project and Live Earth, will be broadcast live on 13 and 14 November from Champ de Mars in Paris with video footage from around the world, including special live footage from South Africa... The aim of the project is to demand global leaders act to combat climate change at COP21 in December. Airing two weeks prior to the monumental Paris climate negotiations, the event will serve to remind global leaders that the world is watching. Featuring stories from around the world, presentations by global climate leaders, renowned musical acts, interactive components and celebrity video segments, this year's 24 Hours of Reality will be the most expansive yet. The time has come for countries, including South Africa, to take significant action and make strong commitments to reduce emissions, combat climate change and set us on a path towards a better future. Building political will "We have been focused during the last year on improving the chances for success at the Paris negotiations, and building the political will necessary for significant action at COP21 ," said Gore. "When global leaders arrive in Paris for the most significant round of climate negotiations for the last two decades, we will truly be at a turning point. Millions of individuals worldwide have called for a strong emissions reductions agreement at COP21 . We are working to make sure those requests are honored so we can move on to the next phase of our journey to a healthy and prosperous future." "Working with over fifty coalition partners towards more climate action and awareness, The African Climate Reality Project hopes that strong, equitable and binding agreements will come out of COP21 ," said Jeunesse Park, branch manager at the African Climate Reality Project, a programme of Food & Trees for Africa. "Our call for more renewable energy to lower South Africa's carbon emissions and address our energy crisis, improve lives and reduce poverty is being heard, and is one of our country's successful solutions to dealing with climate change." Adding South African voices to the global refrain ahead of COP21 will raise awareness of the significant impacts of climate change while also examining both local and global solutions to put us in the best position possible to make a global impact. \</doc>

PARLIAMENT will be holding marathon sittings tomorrow and Wednesday to finish the business of the year before MPs depart to spend two weeks in their constituencies ahead of their year-end holidays from December 16. Central to this week's workload was the medium-term budget policy statement (MTBPS) and its Adjustments Appropriation Bill, which authorises the expenditure changes announced by Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene at the end of last month. Unless the MTBPS is approved and the Adjustments Appropriations Bill adopted, the allocations may not be paid out. But amid the rush, questions remain over key draft legislation, like the Expropriation Bill, on which the public works committee spent considerable time. The National Assembly has to adopt a motion to ensure the Bill does not lapse this week; if this does not happen, the process on the draft law, already eight years in the making, would have to start afresh next year. However, the Performing Animals' Protection Bill, two tax-related Bills, the Disaster Management Amendment Bill and the New Development Bank Special Appropriation Bill have made it onto this week's schedule. One matter which seems to have fallen by the wayside is the appointment of a new inspector-general of intelligence. This post for civilian oversight over South Africa's intelligence services, has been vacant for eight months. Filling the position has been steeped in party politicking: the ANC in the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence ensured the nomination of Cecil Burgess, the committee's former chairman and chairman of the ad hoc committee which processed the Protection of State Information Bill. However, the nomination has failed to gain support from other opposition parties, and it remains unclear how far the ANC's publicly stated consultations with other parties in Parliament have progressed. Even if every single one of the 249 ANC MP is in the House, the governing party would still be short of 18 votes to reach the constitutionally-required two-thirds threshold stipulated in Section 210 of the constitution. Some five months ago a vote on the intelligence inspector-general was pulled after it became clear the required support would not be reached. The Right2Know Campaign over the weekend said at least three complaints of illegal surveillance filed with the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence are in limbo because staff there "feel that without an inspector-general in place, there is nobody with the authority to sign off on investigations". However, squeezed into the marathon sittings in the National Assembly is the nomination of a new member to the Magistrates' Commission, and a ministerial statement by Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa on climate change ahead of South Africa's attendance at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris from November 30. Despite the heavy pressure, Parliament has set aside two days for a conference on the role of legislatures in preventing and ending statelessness, co-hosted with the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. \</doc>

Research by NEPAD through the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme shows that climate change effects are becoming more frequent... "Collaboration by various stakeholders including governments, NGOs and research bodies is needed now to rapidly scale up the African agricultural sector to improve food security and resilience to climate change," said Estherine Fotabong, NEPAD programmes director, at the NEPAD Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) event held on the sidelines of COP21 in Paris on 7 December. The African Union's New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) is supporting the implementation of CSA in Africa through the Agriculture Climate Change Programme and other related initiatives. These efforts will sustainably increase productivity, resilience and adaptation, as well as build capacity at all levels, especially for smallholder farmers and institutions in order to attain the goal of 25 million African farmers practicing climate-smart agriculture by 2025. Climate change a major hurdle "The African agricultural sector employs 65 percent of the continent's population, 50 percent of them are women and climate change is predicted to have significant impact on agriculture, therefore, constituting a major hurdle for Africa," said Miti Chikakula, COMESA agriculture officer. "By adopting CSA practices, smallholder farmers can reduce the risks they face due to climate change, while enhancing food security and livelihoods," he added. As negotiations for COP21 draw to a close, participants raised concerns about the need to include climate-smart and gender appropriate policies in the COP21 agreements because women are the majority of African smallholder farmers. Participants also commended the NEPAD Agency's efforts in making climate-smart agriculture a reality for millions of smallholder farmers and forestalling the negative impacts of global climate change. Scaling up CSA The side event discussed the continent's approach to climate change and agriculture, showcased progress, experiences, and lessons from recent work to support the scaling up of CSA in Africa and the way forward beyond COP21 . Discussions also centred on what efforts are required by both Africans and development partners to bring about practical and grassroot-based actions on agriculture and climate change, and opening up new opportunities for African farmers. In closing, Martin Bwalya, NEPAD coordinator of programme implementation reaffirmed NEPAD's commitment to fighting climate change in Africa and to enhancing resilience and livelihoods through smart collaboration across all disciplines and sectors, evidence based processes, expanding the cadre of negotiators in terms of numbers and fields, strengthening capacities of smallholder farmers and institutions, embracing local knowledge and involving women who are active participants and players in agriculture. \</doc>

The fights against terrorism and global warming are closely linked, French President Francois Hollande said yesterday as world leaders met in Paris for climate change talks two weeks after deadly Islamist militant attacks in France's capital. More than 150 world leaders arrived at UN climate change talks in Paris armed with promises and accompanied by high expectations as they look to hold back the Earth's rising temperature. Hollande reiterated that a deal to try to keep any further increase in global temperatures to below 2\'b0C needed to be "universal, differentiated and binding", with richer countries contributing more than poorer ones. "I can't separate the fight with terrorism from the fight against global warming," he said at the opening of the talks. "These are two big global challenges we have to face up to, because we have to leave our children more than a world freed of terror, we also owe them a planet protected from catastrophes." World peace is at stake in the talks, he said. After decades of struggling negotiations marked by the failure of a previous summit in Copenhagen six years ago, some form of landmark agreement appears all but assured by the middle of the month. Hollande warned that there could not be a vague agreement. "To resolve the climate crisis, good will, statements of intent are not enough," he said, telling world leaders the future of humanity rests on their shoulders. "We are at breaking point." Some 150 heads of state, including US President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, were arriving at UN climate change talks in Paris armed with promises. Warnings from climate scientists, demands from activists and exhortations from religious leaders like Pope Francis, coupled with major advances in cleaner energy sources like solar power, have all added to pressure to cut the carbon emissions held responsible for warming the planet. Most scientists say failure to agree on strong measures in Paris would doom the world to ever-hotter average temperatures, bringing with them deadlier storms, more frequent droughts and rising sea levels as polar ice caps melt. Facing such alarming projections, the leaders of nations responsible for about 90 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions have come bearing pledges to reduce their national carbon output, though by different rates. For some, it has already become a pressing issue at home. As the summit opened in Paris, the capitals of the world's two most populous nations, China and India, were blanketed in hazardous, choking smog, with regulators in Beijing asking factories to limit output and halting construction work. Success in agreeing to what would be by far the strongest international pact yet to commit both rich and developing nations to the fight against global warming "is not yet achieved, but it is within reach", French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, the chairman of the meeting, told delegates. On the eve of the summit, hundreds of thousands of people from Australia to Paraguay joined the biggest day of climate change activism in history, telling world leaders there was "No Planet B" in the fight against global warming. "This past year has been a turning point," Christiana Figueres, the UN's climate chief, told delegates. Signalling their determination to resolve the most intractable points, senior negotiators sat down on Sunday, a day earlier than originally planned, to begin thrashing out an agreement. They hope to avoid the last-minute scramble and all-nighters that marked past meetings. Anxious to avoid a re-run of the 2009 Copenhagen disaster, major powers have tried this time to smooth some of the bumps in the way of an agreement before they arrive. For one thing, the presidents, prime ministers and princes will make their cameo appearances at the outset of the conference rather than swooping in at the end. Arriving in a sombre city where security has been tightened after Islamist militant attacks that killed 130 people on November 13, each leader will be allowed a brief |opening speech. The goal is to build momentum for consensus and avoid the messiness of past talks when diplomats put off the hard political choices until their bosses arrived. - Reuters \</doc>

Merian Kalala, a farmer in Solwezi, capital of the North-Western Province of Zambia, knows firsthand that climate change is posing massive problems for agricultural productivity. With its negative effects already being felt through floods, droughts, early frosts and increased incidences of pests and diseases, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts an increase in the frequency and intensity of such severe weather events across the globe, threatening to reverse global developmental gains. Although it falls at number 13 on the list of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), climate change is now being described as the greatest development challenge of the 21st century. Kalala hails from a region that gets normal to above-normal rainfall annually, but she understands the stress that her fellow smallholders affected by drought are going through, and believes the latest technology and innovations as highlighted at the World Farmers' Organisation (WFO) General Assembly in Zambia this week could be crucial to tackling the challenge. "Climate change is a serious threat to agriculture. I know how challenging it is for our colleagues in drought-prone regions of the country. It's about time we embrace water harvesting techniques to deal with the drought situations that have become more prominent in recent years," Kalala, who chairs the District Farmers Association, told IPS. She also thinks an integrated approach where farmers have a guaranteed access to finance, insurance and markets could be a solution to climate change impacts. "With insurance, smallholders are assured of some returns in case of disasters," said Kalala, whose association is on the verge of signing a financing agreement with NATSAVE and MFinance to grow soya beans with a market access guarantee. Globally, agriculture directly accounts for 13.5 percent of greenhouse gas emissions (methane from animals and nitrous oxide from agricultural soils) and another 17 percent indirectly through deforestation and land use change. However, it is also a crucial part of the solution through implementation of efficient climate-smart agricultural practices. This was the argument that the farmers' constituency, led by the WFO, advocated for at the COP21 climate talks in Paris last year, where they achieved the inclusion of a reference to 'food productivity' and 'food security' in the agreement. COP 21 gave the world a binding agreement that is seen as a pillar on which to build the fight against climate change. Nevertheless, the agreement is not the solution; it is a start towards the solution, in which farmers see themselves as agents of the solution--a sub theme that has been discussed here at the WFO General Assembly. Sok Sotha of the Cambodian Farmer Association Federation of Agricultural Producers says farmers could be agents of the solution to climate change through capacity building. "Farmers lack knowledge such that even if they are exposed to latest technologies, they don't know how to apply them for their sustainability," observed Sotha during a presentation on how agriculture can be turned into a solution to climate change. With the African agricultural sector employing 65 per cent of the coninent's population, half of whom are women, the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) is supporting the implementation of climate-smart agriculture in Africa, targeting the goal of 25 million African farmers practicing it by 2025. The biggest question now is still financing. According to the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), a consortium of environmental civil society organisations in Africa, the COP 21 Agreement is elusive on finance. "The Paris Agreement only commits to mobilizing 100 billion dollars per year by 2020, not just for emission cuts but also adaptation. This is far short of the support required, and there is no firm commitment to increase this figure," reads part of the PACJA analysis. The civil society group, Africa's forerunner on climate justice, warns that the use of the word 'mobilise' in the agreement is purposefully intended to include loans, grants - which usually come with strings attached - and re-allocation of aid budgets. As the WFO General Assembly closes, the question of building strategic partnerships for growth has been raised and delegates hope that farmers would be placed at the centre of the world's development agenda. Addressing the assembly on Friday, May 6, Zambian President Edgar Lungu stressed that the world must not leave farmers behind in its quest to achieve sustainable development. "ZNFU [the Zambia National Farmers' Union] uses a slogan which says: No Farmer, No Food, No Future. Indeed, without farmers there would be no future on this planet... We all need food, including presidents. I also eat," said President Lungu during his keynote speech to the WFO. He added: "As you deliberate on food matters, don't forget that the world is global. What happens in a small village here in Chief Mukuni's area could have worse or better effects for other regions of the world... Therefore, food security and climate change should not be looked at in isolation." \</doc>

The Minister of Environmental Affairs, Mrs Edna Molewa, has arrived in Paris, France to lead the South African delegation during the High Level Segment of the 21st Conference of Parties ( CoP21 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), from 6 December to 11 December 2015. In Paris the international community is expected to come up with a universal, legally binding agreement that will enable us to combat climate change effectively; and boost the transition towards resilient, low-carbon societies and economies. The Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has a number of simple messages that say that Greenhouse gas emissions (GhG) rose more rapidly from 2000 to 2010 than in the previous three decades, growing by roughly 1.0 Gigatonne per year. In addition, the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) Emissions Gap Report tells us that global emissions in 2030 will most likely be 14 Gigatonnes above the level that would be consistent with a 2-degree world. The UNEP Adaptation Gap Report concludes that by 2050, Africa's adaptation costs could rise to USD 50 billion per year, if global warming were to remain below 2 degrees C; and up to USD 100 billion per year for a temperature increase of 4 degrees Celsius. As part of the Africa Group, South Africa will negotiate for a Paris agreement under the Convention that is ambitious, durable, fair, and effective. The agreement must balance environmental and development imperatives, and ensure that global emission reduction efforts are adequate to keep global temperatures well below 2 degrees Celsius. The deal must have adaptation at its core, and there must be an ambitious outcome on finance, technology and capacity building to support the adaptation and mitigation efforts of developing countries. A key position of the Africa Group is that adaptation is a global responsibility. It is important to note that climate change impacts are being driven by global inaction on mitigation, the adaptation burden on developing countries is growing heavier. A Global Goal for Adaptation must therefore be part of the Paris Agreement. South Africa has been instrumental in the negotiations leading to the establishment of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, particularly in developing countries. South Africa will continue to do that because we understand and acknowledge that there are limits to adaptation, hence our support for Loss and Damage to be addressed in the Paris agreement. Addressing this issue must be done in a manner that gives assurance that the Warsaw International Mechanism will continue and be strengthened beyond 2017. South Africa will continue to negotiate in good faith and do everything in its power to reach a deal those results in a strengthened and durable international climate change regime. A deal that ensures the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention, through an agreement that is applicable to all. Paris presents a golden opportunity to build an ambitious and fair agreement that is effective, durable and strengthens the global approach.

Climate change? What climate change? There are still a few individuals (and even fewer organisations) who openly deny the reality of climate change. But there is a vastly larger number of people and organisations who proclaim their full acceptance of the scientific evidence, but nonetheless behave like climate change deniers. This |contradictory group of deniers includes most of the world's political leaders and representatives of the world's leading corporations. These leaders are now in Paris for COP21 - the UN annual Conference of the Parties. They are again acknowledging the growing threat to the survival of human kind, with the weather serving them as powerful reminders. The frequency of extreme weather events currently causing chaos across the globe ought to be sufficient to wake up all but the dead among those attending COP21 . Climate change is not the sole cause of the intensity or frequency of these extreme weather events. However, there are few of these events which are not linked to climate change. Climate science predicts that climate change will turn what today is seen as extreme weather into a new normal. This is now happening before our eyes. Our leaders see this perfectly. But they remain effectively blind. Why? The lead official in South Africa's Department of the Environment, responsible for drafting South Africa's position at COP21 , gave the answer in two words. She was responding to pressure from NGOs concerned about the weakness of the commitments the government intended putting forward. So she blurted out that COP21 was not about climate change; COP21 was about reaching (and now the promised two words) a "trade agreement"! The most important thing for the world's political and business leaders is, first, to minimise any concession that would disrupt their economies. Their second objective is to ensure that their own national trade suffers no competitive disadvantage. Thus, the Business Day Editorial warning, soon after COP21 began, that it would be "irrational" for South Africa to commit to the reduced greenhouse gas emissions required by science (3/12/15). Indeed, national leaders seek to use climate change as a means of promoting the competitive advantage of their own economies, in the ruthlessly competitive world of international trade (including services). Neither fairness nor climate change have any place in trade. Former Finance minister Trevor Manuel put it bluntly: "The problem is not that international trade is inherently opposed to the needs and interests of the poor but that the rules that govern it are rigged in favour of the rich." COP21 , as a trade conference, brilliantly illuminates the reality of climate change seen essentially as a business opportunity or threat. As an opportunity, it remains subject at all time to the logic - and contradictions - of capital. The world economy is in crisis. There are unimaginable amounts of idle capital, unused productive capacity. There are surplus workers in their tens of millions. What could be better than the entirely new - and potentially huge - market unexpectedly created by climate change? This new market is the world of the so-called "green economy". "Green" is the new good. "Green" is the marketers' gift. "Green" not only sells things, it often also allows producers and distributors to charge a premium because "Green" is supposedly healthy or good for the environment. More importantly, "Green" allows for the idea of a welcome and entirely new economy. The green economy provides the best of both worlds: abundant energy without climate change. And yet the "green economy" suffers from serious arrested development. Why? Worldwide, there are trillions of dollars that are idle because they can't find profit-maximising investment opportunities. The owners of these trillions are also the owners of even more trillions invested in the global coal, oil and gas industries. This includes the enormous capital value locked in the ore reserves that still lie buried underground. The world's political leaders - including the South African ones - are among the owners of this mineral-energy complex. In addition, they fear that the large-scale disruption to the extractive, refining, distributing and consuming economic sectors would have further unwelcome ripple effects throughout the rest of the economy. So they avoid these disruptions. Others will have to confront them at a later date. For now, politicians put their own re-election first. Two South African examples underscore how the workings of capital keep the green economy so under-developed. Eskom's inability to provide electricity is the first example. The government received a warning in 1998 of an impending electricity supply shortage. It did not ignore this warning. It invited capital to become private power producers. But the invitation went disastrously unanswered. Eskom's boast of producing the cheapest electricity in the world kept capital away. The very cheapness of our electricity was sufficient to ensure that no guests came to the government's intended electricity party for private capital. Capitalists do not invest when simple profit can be made, but only when profit can be maximised. Renewable energy is the second example. The government is jubilant about what it claims to be the success of its current renewable energy programme. But it is much less keen to publicise the delay of several years in this programme. International capital finally became interested in South Africa's small-scale programme only when: l Sufficiently maximised profit was guaranteed. This second example shows that the green economy is subject to the same imperatives as Eskom's carbon economy. Despite enormous promotion by governments worldwide, the green economy remains stunted, because it is a prisoner of the imperatives of capital. Even more notably, the green economy is not in the least concerned about what science requires as a response to climate change. Capital will ignore climate change for as long as possible. So, leaving everything to the market is a government cop-out of its overriding responsibilities. Governments and society at large recognise that governments, not the market, must prevail in times of war. Governments have no difficulty proclaiming "war on terrorism". After 20 years of talk, COP21 ought to declare "war on climate change". l Rudin is a Research Associate, Alternative Information & Development Centre.

The UN climate talks in Paris have ended with an agreement between 195 countries to tackle global warming. The climate deal is at once both historic, important - and inadequate. From whether it is enough to avoid dangerous climate change to unexpected wins for vulnerable nations, here are five things to help understand what was just agreed at COP21.1. This is a momentous, world-changing eventThe most striking thing about the agreement is that there is one. For all countries, from superpowers to wealthy city-states, fossil fuel-dependent kingdoms to vulnerable low-lying island nations, to all agree to globally coordinate action on climate change is astonishing.And it is not just warm words. Any robust agreement has to have four elements. First, it needs a common goal, which has now been defined. The agreement states that the parties will hold temperatures to "well below 2\'c2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\'c2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels".Second, it requires matching scientifically credible reductions in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement is woollier here, but it does state that emissions should peak "as soon as possible" and then be rapidly reduced. The next step is to: "Achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, on the basis of equity  "Third, as current pledges to reduce emissions imply a warming of nearly 3\'c2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels, there needs to be a mechanism to move from where countries are today, to zero emissions. There are five-year reviews, and "the efforts of all parties will represent a progression over time", which means at each step countries should increase their levels of emission cuts from today's agreements.Finally, this all means developed countries need to rapidly move from fossil fuel energy to renewable sources. But the challenge is larger for the developing world: these countries must leapfrog the fossil fuel age. They need funds to do so and a key part of the agreement provides US$100 billion per year to 2020, and more than that after 2020.There is a lot to like about this agreement: it gives a common goal to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the overall emissions cuts stated are reasonably credible, there is a mechanism to increase national emissions cuts over time towards "net zero", and there is funding secured to help poorer countries harness the power of the sun, wind and waves instead of coal, oil and gas. It provides a roadmap to get the world off its dangerous addiction to fossil fuel energy.2. It's not enough to avoid dangerous climate changeWhat constitutes dangerous climate change is different for different people. For some poor people climate change is already beyond dangerous, it's deadly. The threats escalate as the cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increase. Because this deal has been so long in arriving, the window of opportunity to limit temperature rises at 1.5\'c2\'b0C is closing fast; this spells trouble for many low-lying areas. Even the most ambitious pathways to zero emissions in the coming decades for a carbon budget associated with a reasonable (66%) chance of keeping 2\'c2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels are extremely challenging. Countries have a long way to go to get to these levels of reductions.Importantly, there are no penalties, except public shaming, for countries that do not meet their commitments to reduce emissions. To implement this deal the public, civil society organisations, opposition parties in politics and businesses will need to keep government policies in check. Essentially, it is the will of the people, most governments and enlightened businesses, pitted against the deep pockets of the fossil fuel industry.One future fear is that when the "global stocktake" happens in 2023, some countries may see that others aren't doing their bit, and may themselves then stop reducing emissions and the agreement will fall apart.3. We'll have to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphereThe warming we see from greenhouse gas emissions is dominated by the cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide. Given the emissions so far, limiting warming to "well below" 2\'c2\'b0C, and anywhere near 1.5\'c2\'b0C means reducing CO2 emissions to near zero extremely quickly.Then society will need to continue further, to negative emissions. That is, removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it somewhere else. There are various options here, from planting trees and keeping restored forest in perpetuity, enhancing uptake in soils, or using biomass energy in power plants then storing the carbon dioxide underground (so-called Bio-Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage). Expect to hear a lot more about this.4. Expect across-the-board policy changesTo get to zero emissions this century requires many policy changes. Fossil fuel companies must have their subsidies stripped. Investments in high-carbon emitting infrastructure must end, particularly World Bank loans and other regional multilateral bank support for countries. Zero emissions buildings will become the norm. Tropical forests will have to be protected to reduce and then eliminate deforestation.Expect a greater push on the technological limitations on renewable energy, with big new investments, mostly improving how to store power, for when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining. Expect the cost of renewables to sink much further as these technologies are scaled up and implemented worldwide. Expect significant areas of the world to be given over to wind turbines and solar farms.5. The world's most vulnerable countries got their issue centre stageParis was a high-stakes game of geopolitical poker. Surprisingly, those countries with the poorest hand came out better than expected. The climate talks were subject to a series of shifting alliances going beyond the usual income-rich northern countries and income-poor global south countries. Central to this has been US-Chinese diplomacy, both agreeing to limit emissions, and more recently the new Climate Vulnerable Forum grouping of countries. From nowhere, the forum has forced keeping global temperatures to 1.5\'c2\'b0C high on the political agenda.We haven't heard the last of this level of ambition - one of the decisions in the Paris agreement is to invite the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to produce a special report on the impacts at 1.5\'c2\'b0C, and emissions pathways consistent with this level of warming.These countries didn't get everything they wanted - the US would not accept liability in financial terms for states that may lose their territory to rising sea levels in the future. But they played their hand extremely smartly.Simon Lewis, Reader in Global Change Science at University of Leeds and, UCLThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

Dr Fabio Gabrieli, director: dry bulk and energy commodity strategist at Mercurial Energy Trading, poses some tough questions to the captains of the coal mining industry about the future of the sector in a time of changing global demand at Mining Indaba 2016... <h2>Setting the scene</h2> As with all commodities, coal is feeling the pinch. Thermal coal seaborne trade flows dropped by 60 million tons in 2015 to 870 million tons, he says. The growing impact of new markets, as opposed to the traditional markets of the EU and US, was evident in the past few years. China, for example, increased its thermal coal imports dramatically between 2009 and 2013, with volumes peaking in 2013. However, South Africa did not export any thermal coal to China last year. Predictions for the future "While EU and China thermal coal imports may falter further through 2016-2020, they may grow to markets such as Egypt, Iran, Kenya, Pakistan and the UAE," he says. Dr Gabrieli then posed some questions to coal-mining execs: Mike Fraser, South32 president and COO, Africa; Mxolisi Mgojo, Exxaro Resources Ltd CEO - designate; and Themba Mkhwanazi, Anglo American CEO - SA Coal. What should be encouraged for investment in coal? Mgoro: Government needs to create the right environment for investment. South Africa is fortunate to have the deep water port capacity for coal exports and if we can get the regulation and permitting in place, we'll be in a good position for investment when the downturn reverses. Fraser: Our strategy in the current environment is to be flexible and to recognise opportunities. Even in a low-carbon world, coal still plays a role as it is still the low-cost option. Mkhwanazi: Anglo is reconfiguring its asset base to generate cash flow throughout the year. Coal is a positive story and still a key driver in economic development. The African population is growing and only 50% have electricity. Coal is still important in terms of cost and abundance. How should Africa invest in a low-carbon environment? Fraser: COP21 Mgojo: We need to be cautious. We can't anticipate what technology will disrupt in the future, including solar power and other alternative energy sources. We don't need to panic, but we need to take note of these developments. If I'm going to spend a fortune in investment, I need to make sure its still going to be relevant in the future. Mkhwanazi: While we are talking about COP 21 , how do you balance its goals with the needs of the developing world? Coal prices will always be a supply and demand story. Africa is creating more demand for local power generation and South Africa is the only real supplier, while we do participate in seaborne trade, we are quite sheltered from the crisis.

'Gazillions' at stake in coal-fired clash Global stage is set for a battle over carbon reduction, writes A MAJOR battle in the war on the continuing widespread use of coal will take place in Paris in December and both sides are already arming themselves for it. For SA, the fight is significant not only because coal is a major provider of jobs and foreign exchange earnings, but also because the country remains heavily reliant on coal for power and liquid fuels. Coal has been identified as the major culprit in rising carbon dioxide levels, leading to global warming, and it is predicted that parts of SA will be worse hit by higher temperatures than the global average. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris from November 30 to December 11, 196 countries (including SA) are expected to commit to new plans on carbon reduction to meet the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC's) goal of keeping the rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees maximum by the end of the century. The target of keeping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to below 400 parts per million has already been missed. This year, the US government announced its Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon from coal-fired power stations by 32% by 2030 from 2005 levels. Shale gas breakthroughs have given the US an energy source that emits less carbon than coal. The assumption behind all these plans and commitments is that rising global temperatures are caused by humans burning fossil fuels (called anthropogenic climate change). The proponents of this argument are so vastly in the majority and well funded that they tend to drown out sceptical scientists who argue that rising global temperatures are not necessarily caused by higher carbon emissions. They argue it is a common logical pitfall to assume that because two events happen at the same time, one necessarily causes the other. Benjamin Sporton, CE of the World Coal Association, says it has not taken a position on the anthropogenic climate change debate. It wants the global community to achieve its objectives on limiting carbon emissions and rising temperatures, but also wants it to recognise that most countries seeking to develop their economies need to use coal because it is their cheapest and most available resource. These two objectives do not necessarily compete, Mr Sporton says. Both can be achieved by encouraging the greater use of clean-coal technologies such as building supercritical coal-fired power stations like Medupi that emit less carbon and other pollutants, and by using carbon capture and storage. The World Coal Association's Platform to Accelerated Coal Efficiency programme is designed to ensure that countries wanting to build coal-fired power stations use the best possible financing and technology. Retired nuclear physicist Don Mingay says & gazillions& of dollars are at stake for the IPCC in championing anthropogenic climate change. Every alarmist statement has caused a public outcry, prompting politicians to give the IPCC more money. So far, the UN and IPCC have spent $100bn on this campaign, he says. Professor Philip Lloyd of the Cape Peninsula University of Technology's Energy Institute says the IPCC should be called the & LiePCC& since only half of its authors are scientists and all their predictions have been proven wrong. mathewsc@fm.co.za Most countries seeking to develop their economies need to use coal because it is their cheapest and most available resource TOUGH CLIMATE : SA is among countries that are striving to strike a balance between their reliance on coal and their commitment to keep tabs on greenhouse gas emissions.

ELECTRIC buses, research into rooftop solar panels and renovation of old buildings to make them more energy efficient are among the projects being considered by the city council in a bid to address climate change. Mayor Patricia de Lille floated the plans at a meeting of the Cape Town Climate Change Coalition this week and reported back on her engagements at COP21 , the UN climate forum, which was held in Paris in December. At the UN talks, 195 countries adopted a historic deal which aims to abandon fossil fuels and keep global warming "well below" 2\'b0C and, if possible, below 1.5\'b0C. Hastings Chikoko, Africa director for a global network of mayors, told the meeting on Wednesday that over 400 mayors had signed a Compact of Mayors to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, track progress, and prepare for climate change. Although the Paris Agreement only comes into force in 2020, C40's mayors are looking ahead at what can be done. Chikoko said the COP21 agreement could not be achieved without cities because a third of the carbon budget needed to stay under 2\'b0C was controlled by cities and|local governments. "For example, over two-thirds of the energy consumption is from buildings, transport, and industries that are in cities." De Lille said she had joined events at COP21 specifically dealing with the role that cities could play in pushing a more ambitious agenda on climate change than that adopted by national governments. She said she had been struck by a message from London's mayor, Boris Johnson, who implored cities to steal ideas from each other. "He was encouraging a partnership with cities around the world where the best ideas can be shared and implemented." She said she came away with a number of ideas, including one from the mayor of Stockholm that sewage was used to|generate biogas to run their bus fleet. De Lille said the greatest growth in emissions was likely to come from the transport sector over the next 25 years. Tackling this would need major interventions to increase car occupancy, more|efficient vehicles and increasing public|transport. Earlier this month the council called for tenders for the procurement of electric buses for the MyCiTi service. The council is also retrofitting state-subsidised homes built between1994 and 2005 without insulated ceilings. De Lille said households and businesses which generated renewable energy through rooftop solar panels were now able to feed excess electricity back into the grid. \</doc>

Tsogo Sun has entered into a partnership with Generation Earth, a green networking platform that recognises and develops green thinkers who are tomorrow's global leaders... This partnership, which sees Tsogo Sun becoming the venue and accommodation partner to Generation Earth, including their annual summit in October this year, follows on several years of partnership with sister organisation Miss Earth, a leadership programme that empowers young South African women with the knowledge and platform to create a sustainable difference in combatting the destruction of our natural heritage. Generation Earth works with 80 school councils around the country, comprising about 1 700 learners, in a structured action plan for the youth to make a difference in the betterment of the environment. The students on the Generation Earth councils are expected to be studying the sciences, and to have expressed an interest in a career involving the environment. "It has been, and continues to be, a great pleasure working with Miss Earth and contributing to their stalwart efforts to involve young women in sustainable green initiatives," says Candy Tothill, Tsogo Sun's exec responsible for corporate affairs. "We're sure that the same will apply to our newly formed partnership with Generation Earth and their efforts to get bright young people to 'think green' in the interests of a sustainable future. Green issues are high on our corporate priorities and this work connects well with our CSI focus on youth development, making the partnerships with both Miss Earth and Generation Earth a good fit for Tsogo Sun." Generation Earth Summit At the Generation Earth Summit in October, the student councils will present innovations linked to COP21 's theme of food security and water and energy conservation, ahead of COP21 - the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change - from 30 November to 11 December in Paris. COP21 will aim to achieve a new international agreement on the climate, applicable to all countries, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2oC. "We're delighted to be welcoming Tsogo Sun to the environmental initiatives of Generation Earth," says Ella Bella Constantinides, Founder of Generation Earth and a UN Youth Mentor. "We have no doubt that the relationship will be as warm and rewarding as it is with the Miss Earth organisation - and that soon Generation Earth will also regard Tsogo Sun as 'home'." "Supporting youth in their efforts to build a sustainable future for us is the right thing to do - and we're proud to do it," says Tothill \</doc>

GREEN energy is now the second largest generator of electricity in the world after coal, and is set to become the leading source of new electricity within 20 years, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). In the IEA's World Energy Outlook 2015, published this week, the agency said renewable energy would overtake coal as the largest source of electricity generation by the early 2030s. Last year, renewable energy accounted for almost half of all new power plants built globally. The report said in the run-up to the COP21 climate summit in Paris next month that there was a "clear sign that an energy transition" was under way. "The climate pledges submitted in advance of COP21 are rich in commitments to renewables," the report said. The report said more countries were adopting policies to support a transition to greener energy, which included the US Clean Power Plan and China's carbon trading scheme, which would come into effect in 2017. These policies had led to a "record-high" installation of 130GW of renewable energy worldwide last year. Energy-efficiency regulations in industry, buildings and transport had nearly doubled, rising from 14 percent of the world's energy consumption in 2005 to |27 percent last year. Full implementation of the pledges made by more than |50 nations for COP21 would |need a cumulative investment of $13.5 trillion (R191.4 trillion) in low-carbon technologies and energy efficiency until 2030. The report warned that despite global progress made to cutting greenhouse gas emissions, "efforts are not yet enough to move the world on to a pathway consistent with the 2\'c2\'b0C climate goal". It said emissions from the energy sector were forecast to increase to 36.7 gigatons in 2040 - 16 percent higher than in 2013. IEA executive director Fatih Birol said the current pledges of emission cuts implied a temperature increase of 2.7\'c2\'b0C by 2100. Climate scientists have said the increase must stay below 2\'c2\'b0C to avoid dangerous climate change. "As the largest source of global greenhouse gas emissions, the energy sector must be at the heart of global action to tackle climate change. World leaders meeting in Paris must set a clear direction|for the accelerated transformation of the global energy sector," Birol said. The report warned that if the oil price remained at $50 for a decade or more, cheaper oil from the Middle East would come to dominate exports, with 75 percent market share. "The prospect of oil prices remaining low for an extended period cannot be ruled out," it said, and that oil would rise to $80 a barrel by 2020. \</doc>

Global warming all hype, MPs told Parliamentary Writer CAPE TOWN - Claims of catastrophic global warming were largely exaggerated, with many of them largely unsubstantiated, Professor Philip Lloyd told Parliament's hearings on climate change on Wednesday. The hearings were to inform the environment committee ahead of SA's participation at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's Conference of Parties 21 ( COP21 ) in Paris in December. Prof Lloyd is with the Energy Institute at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology and serves on the ministerial advisory council on energy. His comments were a lone and contrary voice among dozens of submissions warning of the dire consequences of global warming. Prof Lloyd challenged the Department of Environmental Affairs' draft report for COP21 , which claims & climate change is one of the major global challenges of the 21st century that requires a global response& SA is expected to play a leading role at COP21 as a constructive actor on behalf of the developing world. Member states will state their positions through intended national determined contributions, in which they indicate their goals. But environmental activists argued that SA was failing to hold two big polluters - Eskom and Sasol - to account. Prof Lloyd said the longest weather record in existence showed that in 250 years the trend, while slightly upward, indicated that rainfall over England and Wales had increased by only 4%. & Similarly, in the case of rising oceans, it has been rising for the last 20,000 years and the rate of sea level rise has dropped to about 3mm a year.& He also addressed the issue of ocean acidification saying before the industrial era began the pH level of the oceans was 8.2, which is slightly alkaline and & today it is about 8.1. which is alkaline and not acidic& quot;Thus it appears that the statement that climate change is one of the major global challenges is misleading at best. If that is so, it is a major question whether we should divert any resources whatsoever to trying to address a non-existent challenge. A misguided response would have a negative impact on our society,& Prof Lloyd said. He also questioned whether carbon emissions were having a significant effect. In 1996 global carbon dioxide emissions were 24-billion tonnes and 18 years later this had risen 45% to 35-billion tonnes but & global temperatures as measured by satellite barely moved& hartleyw@bdfm.co.za \</doc>

GLOBAL climate change was one catastrophe humanity had the power to stop, Nelson Mandela had said, and the South African public now have a chance to say how this should|be done, environmental portfolio committee chairperson Jackson Mthembu said. "As we go to Paris for COP21 , we would like to have a broad mandate from all our people," Mthembu said last week. For that reason, the committee is set to hold public hearings on September 22 and 23 to get the views of people on the Department of Environmental Affairs's discussion document on South Africa's negotiating position for COP21 . Mthembu said at the previous climate negotiations in Lima that it had been agreed that there must be a |"bottom-up" approach to determining the extent of emission cuts. The department, with provincial governments, had already held meetings in each province to discuss the document. The parliamentary public hearings were in addition to those consultations, Mthembu said. For further information, |contact Faith Kwaza at fkwaza@|parliament.co.za \</doc>

The pope's call to make September 1 "World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation" comes at an opportune time. As we draw closer to COP21 in Paris there is a new urgency in drawing awareness to the environmental degradation that is happening through climate change. It is high time that we open our eyes and acknowledge what is happening around us. In the letter Pope Francis wrote to Cardinal Koch and Cardinal Turkson, he writes that September 1 is the day on which we are "to thank God for the wonderful handiwork which he has entrusted to our care, and to implore his help for the protection of creation as well as his pardon for the sins committed against the world in which we live". No matter our religion or affiliation, we hope these words are taken to heart. We should be thankful for the beauty and bountifulness of nature, but at the same time also recognise that we have been reckless with it. COP21 provides us with a chance to remedy at least a few of the ills that we have perpetrated, but for this to happen we need to all rally together and demand that our leaders deliver on their promises. We are, as Pope Francis wrote, "faced with the same decisive challenges, to which we must respond together, in order to be more credible and effective". Only if we all take action and hold ourselves and our leaders accountable can we begin to address and reverse the damage that is being done and will be done because of climate change. Faith communities are beginning to recognise this, as is shown by the pope's Encyclical Laudato Si' and the positive response to it from many quarters. The World Council of Churches has endorsed the encyclical and the pope's call for a "World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation" and there is a surge of marches and pilgrimages being undertaken for climate justice. In southern Africa, the We Have Faith - Act Now for Climate Justice campaign is launching a Pan-African cycling caravan. The caravan will travel through nine countries in southern Africa, creating awareness about climate change and collecting petitions with demands for climate justice aimed at our leaders. These initiatives are exciting but this movement needs to grow. We urge everyone to take action, whether through a campaign, engaging in COP21 or by adopting more environmentally friendly practices. Climate change is a threat that we all face and we all should be working together to mitigate it.

It is too soon to know if the extravagant claims made about the impact of the Paris agreement on climate change are correct... The "standard" approach to international problems is for states to negotiate a treaty in which they all agree to undertake measures designed to solve the problems. They are then held legally responsible for failing to comply with these commitments. This works if states can effectively resolve the problem through their own efforts. But as the sins of our economic and political past catch up with us, this approach is losing its potency. Paris showed what is possible We now face a host of complex global challenges, such as climate change, global health, migration, cyber security and business and human rights. States cannot effectively resolve these problems by themselves. They must co-ordinate their actions with non-state actors. These include sub-national governments, civil society, the private sector, international organisations, private philanthropies and individuals. In other words, we need to develop new arrangements for global governance that enable multi-stakeholder responses to global challenges. These arrangements, which must still be constructed, will only emerge through a process of trial and error. The international community's approach to climate change, the most technically and politically complex of the challenges, establishes an important precedent. COP21 's strategy was to structure an international response around two things: - individual state's voluntary commitment; and - a combination of a binding treaty and a non-binding "decision". Both of these contain mixtures of loosely worded and specific commitments. They provide three important lessons for global governance. The limitations of binding treaties exposed First, it is a warning to all those who insist that only binding international agreements can deal with complex international problems. Treaties serve many useful functions. But they are not effective in dealing with problems that are technically, economically and politically complex and require actions by both state and non-state actors. This is because treaties are difficult to negotiate when states cannot confidently assess the scope of their obligations and the risks involved. And, treaties cannot control all the relevant actors. In these situations, treaties often resort to language so vague that the commitments of the signatory states are hard to enforce. On the other hand, when states negotiate non-binding international instruments they can afford to be more flexible and less risk-averse. Thus, these "soft" law documents can be more precise and clear in their language. This makes promises easier to understand and their implementation easier to monitor. Climate change negotiations were stalled for many years because states were focused on concluding a treaty. The Paris agreement overcomes this problem by creatively combining a binding treaty with a non-binding "decision". Both contain a mix of specific and loosely worded and hard-to-enforce promises, sometimes with clear cross-references between the two instruments. In the best case, this will allow states, as their experience with their promises grows, to make more specific and more restrictive commitments. They can also defer to peer and public pressure in monitoring compliance with their commitments. This approach, in the best case, will result, over time, in more effective monitoring and enforcement of more meaningful commitments than would have been the case with only a loosely worded treaty. Thus, COP21 will likely enhance the role of soft-law instruments in dealing with complex international problems. Combining state and non-state actors The climate meetings enabled the efforts of a range of different stakeholders, both before and during COP21 . Civil society organisations, city governments, philanthropists, business groups and international bodies all announced initiatives designed to reduce carbon emissions and promote research into renewable technologies. Ultimately, it is the combination of all these state and non-state actions that will determine if the international community has managed to effectively address the climate challenge. The non-binding decision adopted at Paris explicitly welcomes the efforts of non-state actors and provides for "effective engagement" with them. Thus, COP21 represents another step in the development of multi-stakeholder approaches to global governance, rather than exclusive state-based approaches. State sovereignty still matters It shows that while states have lost power and may no longer be the only actors in global affairs, they still have the ability to avoid making binding international agreements that they fear unduly restrict them. This means that any politically feasible approach to resolving complex global challenges must be built around respect for state sovereignty. The three lessons demonstrate that the outcome of COP21 is an important development in global governance. It shows paradoxically that, in the case of complex global issues, non-binding international agreements that allow individual states more discretion - that are more adaptable - may promote more effective global governance than binding treaties. Such agreements allow diverse initiatives to flourish. They establish benchmarks for holding all actors more accountable for the way in which they implement their responsibilities. Importantly this also demonstrates that the solution to these problems depends ultimately on individuals and other non-state actors as much as it does on states. \</doc>

It could change ecosystem and population dynamics IN THE past few weeks we have witnessed a heat wave that reached 35\'b0C in Johannesburg, which is unusual. As recent hosts to the COP 17 United Nations Climate Change Conference meeting held in Durban, South Africans received a bit of a wake-up call about some of the realities of climate change and how climate change will affect their lives. With global warming and climate change becoming more and more of a reality, SA is also experiencing a gradual, yet steady, change in climate. Temperatures have risen significantly over the last 60 years, and this rise is predicted to continue. A rise of 1\'b0C to 2\'b0C is expected in coastal regions and 3\'b0C to 4\'b0C for inland regions by 2050. By 2100 an increase of 3\'b0C to 4\'b0C is predicted for coastal regions and 6\'b0C to 7\'b0C for interior regions. Rainfall patterns are also shifting, although this is a little more variable and unpredictable. Considering its socioeconomic context, SA is particularly vulnerable to the effect of climate change for a number of reasons. A large proportion of the population lives in poverty, where informal settlements are set up in locations that are vulnerable to extreme weather patterns, and lack of adequate housing structures to offer adequate protection against rain, wind and cold. In addition there is a high incidence of disease, which places poor people at further risk. Much of SA experiences low and variable rainfall, with many communities struggling for access to safe drinking water. Agriculture and the fisheries industries both play important roles in food security. They also provide employment for a large percentage of the population. These sectors face climate change related threats. If our agricultural and fisheries potential is reduced, the socioeconomic impact would be severe. Agriculture is sensitive to changes in temperature. In some areas the change in weather patterns may spell doom to local agriculture. The current drought in provinces like Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal and North West, accompanied by high temperatures and a dry atmosphere has been detrimental to food production. Small-scale farmers and subsistence farmers are most vulnerable to the effects of water shortages and droughts because they have no means of irrigation other than natural sources. Commercial farmers have better infrastructure, such as boreholes, windmills, pumps and irrigation systems that might help them cope with water shortages, but they are also affected by water restrictions imposed by the state. The negative effects are not likely to be limited to the agricultural sector. The shift in rainfall patterns, together with rising temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide, is likely to enhance vegetation growth in some regions, which could result in bush encroachment in savannah regions. The Kruger National Park is one area at risk. This could change ecosystem and population dynamics, leading to a change in plant and animal life in communities. Forestry too is affected, as commercial forests place a large demand on water resources. With the shift in rainfall patterns, wetter areas where commercial forestry was traditionally undertaken might not have adequate water resources available to allocate to this sector. Furthermore, with an increase in temperatures and drop in rainfall, the frequency and intensity of wild fires will increase. The marine environment has also shown changes in physical characteristics. All these illustrate that climate change is not a myth. It is a threat to our very livelihoods. This should shake us into action. Deforestation, wastage, and pollution are human-driven ills. It will take humans to arrest them. The things we have taken for granted for many years - recycling, planting trees and conservation - are no longer a hobby associated with nature lovers, they are a necessity for the preservation and sustenance of present and future generations. l Tshingilane is a social commentator \</doc>

SOUTH Africa is experiencing its hottest year ever, says a climate expert as the country participates in a global summit on climate change which started in Paris yesterday. Wits University professor in systems ecology Bob Scholes said the country had experienced its hottest year on record. The country had experienced irregular weather patterns including severe heatwaves and droughts, with parts of the country having been declared drought disaster areas. In its official document to the conference, the South African government says it has observed and is projecting further trends of marked temperature increases, rainfall variation and rising sea levels as well as an increased frequency of severe weather events. The country's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution document accompanied Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa and President Jacob Zuma to COP21 yesterday. The document outlines South Africa's official stance on climate change and its approach to addressing it within a global context. Scholes, of the Wits Global Change and Sustainability Research Institute, said: "As far as COP21 is concerned, I think what South Africa should expect out of this are fair, sustainable and enforceable agreements. They must be binding, but ... fair. "There will be winners and losers, but a balance must be struck," he said, referring in particular to greenhouse gas reduction agreements for developed and developing nations. Nelson Mandela Bay "weather guru" and SA Weather Service client liaison officer Garth Sampson said July this year had been warmer than usual in the Eastern Cape. \</doc>

FOR THE nearly nine years that I have been UN Secretary-General, I have travelled the world to the front-lines of climate change, and I have spoken repeatedly with world leaders, business people and citizens about the need for an urgent global response. Why do I care so much about this issue? First, like any grandfather, I want my grandchildren to enjoy the beauty and bounty of a healthy planet. And like any human being, it grieves me to see that floods, droughts and fires are getting worse, that island nations will disappear and uncounted species will become extinct. As Pope Francis and other faith leaders have reminded us, we have a moral responsibility to act in solidarity with the poor and most vulnerable who have done least to cause climate change and will suffer first and worst from its effects. Second, as the head of the UN, I have prioritised climate change because no country can meet this challenge alone. Climate change carries no passport; emissions released anywhere contribute to the problem everywhere. It is a threat to lives and livelihoods |everywhere. Economic stability and the security of nations are under threat. Only through the UN can we respond collectively to this quintessentially global issue. The negotiation process has been slow and cumbersome. But we are seeing results. In response to the UN's call, more than 166 countries, which collectively account for more than 90 percent of emissions, have now submitted national climate plans with targets. If successfully implemented, these national plans bend the emissions curve down to a projected global temperature rise of approximately 3\'b0C by the end of the century. This is significant progress. But it is still not enough. The challenge now is to move much further and faster to reduce global emissions so we can keep global temperature rise to below 2\'b0C. At the same time, we must support countries to adapt to the inevitable consequences that are already upon us. The sooner we act, the greater the benefits for all: increased stability and security; stronger, more sustainable economic growth; enhanced resilience to shocks; cleaner air and water; improved health. We will not get there overnight. The climate change conference in Paris is not the end point. It must mark the floor, not the ceiling of our ambition. It must be the turning point towards a low-emission, climate-resilient future. Around the world, momentum is building. Cities, businesses and investors, faith leaders and citizens are acting to reduce emissions and build resilience. The responsibility now rests with governments to conclude a meaningful, binding agreement in Paris that provides clear rules of the road for strengthening global ambition. For this, negotiators need clear guidance from the top. I believe this is forthcoming. The leaders of the G20, who met earlier this month in Antalya, Turkey, showed strong commitment to climate action. More than 120 heads of state and government have confirmed their participation in Paris, despite heightened security concerns in the wake of the terrorist attacks. I see four essential elements for Paris to be a success: durability, flexibility, solidarity and |credibility. First, durability. Paris must provide a long-term vision consistent with a below two degrees trajectory, and send a clear signal to markets that the low-carbon transformation of the global |economy is inevitable, beneficial and already under way. Second, the agreement must provide flexibility so it does not need to be continually renegotiated. It must be able to accommodate changes in |the global economy and strike a balance between the leadership role of developed countries and |the increasing responsibilities of developing countries. Third, the agreement must demonstrate solidarity, including through financing and technology transfer for developing countries. Developed countries must keep their pledge to provide |$100 billion (R1.4 trillion) a year by 2020 for adaptation and mitigation alike. Fourth, an agreement must demonstrate credibility in responding to rapidly escalating climate impacts. It must include regular five-year cycles for governments to assess and strengthen their national climate plans in line with what science demands. Paris must also include transparent and robust mechanisms for measuring, monitoring and reporting progress. The UN stands fully ready to support countries in implementing such an agreement. It will accelerate progress towards all of the sustainable development goals. That is why I care so deeply about climate change. My message to world leaders is clear: success in Paris depends on you. Now is the time for common sense, compromise and consensus. It is time to look beyond national horizons and to put the common interest first. The people of the world - and generations to come - count on you to have the vision and courage to seize this historic moment. l Ban Ki-moon is UN Secretary-General. \</doc>

DELEGATES at the South African International Renewable Energy Conference have committed themselves to upscaling and taking renewables into the mainstream in order to achieve a global energy transition. The event came to an end at the Cape Town International Convention Centre yesterday, and tomorrow delegates will visit renewable energy projects in the Western Cape. More than 3 000 delegates, including cabinet ministers, government delegations, representatives of the private sector, non-governmental organisations, academia, business, industry and international organisations participated in the conference. "The future of Africa is placed fairly and squarely in the hands of energy. The future of our country and continent is about infrastructure, good governance and low poverty. Today we have come to ensure that energy will not only alleviate poverty, but eradicate poverty completely," said Minister of Energy Tina Joemat-Pettersson. She said that governments needed to actively pursue low-carbon policies, meet the greenhouse gas reduction objectives and mitigate global warming. "Africa remains one of the most unequal societies on the globe. This conference has assisted us in addressing those inequalities. In these three days, we have looked at the whole renewable energy value chain, focusing on our continent, on interconnectivity, regulatory frameworks which provide policy certainty," she said. The delegates also resoundingly accepted a declaration to take from the conference to COP21 . Irene Giner-Reichl, the Global Forum for Sustainable Energy's president, read out the decleration which said that to make the global transition to renewable energy happen rapidly, the following elements were crucial: promoting transparent and effective procurement processes; advancing renewable energy globally; promoting skills transfer and development; securing financial resources; conducting research and development; prioritising regulatory frame- works, localising supply chains and local investment; emphasising integrated planning; regionalising trade and energy resource development; conducting program- mes for infra- structural development in Africa; embarking on clean energy corridor initiatives and focusing on the Afri- can Renewable Energy Initiative; regional co-opera- tion and international co-operation. The South African National Energy Development Institute's chief executive, Kadri Nassiep, said the declaration came about after consultation with delegates throughout the conference. "We've had an amount of engagement with the stakeholders looking at what is important from this event that is going to take us forward into COP21 ," he said. "We want to take a positive message forward. In the course of COP21 , we will take our place with other countries in an effort to come to an equitable resolution to the problem of not having a global treaty in place." Earlier, Roberto Ridolfi, the head of the European Commission for Sustainable Growth and Development, called for public action on renewable action. "Where do we start with public action? We start in policy decisions. Policy starts from an enabling environment and that is the job of the state." Ridolfi said that there must a good political climate to allow for the introduction of the laws dealing with renewable energy. He said only 20% of the countries in Africa had this enabling environment for the introduction of laws on renewables. "We have to be very clear, there is no magic bullet. Electrification in Africa will not work if there is no legislation that would allow for the private-sector investment in renewables." \</doc>

MOST of the country woke up to chilly, wintry mornings on Tuesday and yesterday. In Kwazulu-Natal, Gauteng, the Free State, North West and Limpopo, among others, rains are long overdue, while other areas are experiencing floods and snow. Many parts of the continent are in the grip of debilitating drought. The majestic roars of the Victoria Falls have been reduced to a trickle. Weather patterns are definitely out of kilter. Many scientists agree that these are the results of climate change. That is why next month's UN Framework Convention on Climate Change meeting in Paris - known as the 21st Conference of the Parties, or COP21 - is so important. The Paris Climate Summit is the deadline agreed to in 2011, under what is known as the "Durban Platform", for the delivery of two objectives - increasing the level of climate action, including the strength of targets and the provision of climate finance, in the pre-2020 period; and developing a new agreement "with legal force" to apply to all countries from 2020 onward. Since talks intended to create a global climate commitment broke down in Copenhagen six years ago, negotiators have been holding a series of meetings from Cancun, Doha and Durban to Warsaw trying to find a way forward and bridge some pretty significant differences. In fact Kyoto, the existing international climate treaty that is supposed to cover developed countries' targets until 2020, has not formally entered into force because too few governments have made a proper legal commitment to it, despite promising to do so in 2012. In Africa it's the risk to crops and fish stocks that is really frightening - climate change could cause huge famines and food price hikes. In our backyard, authorities are darkly hinting at the prospects of water shedding in some parts if the situation worsens. COP21 offers the final stop and the best hope for a new international climate change agreement. \</doc>

A strike against the right of global citizens to protest about an impending "climate disaster". That's how Earthlife Africa Jhb has described the French government's clamping down on large-scale mobilisations in public spaces during at the upcoming international climate talks in Paris. "As an organisation founded in the anti-apartheid Struggle, we understand how fundamental the right to assembly and protest is," the environmental activist group said yesterday. It was responding to the announcement that, for security reasons, authorisation would not be granted for major marches that would coincide with the COP21 climate meeting in Paris. "This right is at the core of South Africa's democratic liberation, and we, as individuals, have this right not by virtue of its being granted to us, but as a fundamental part of our status as human beings. Simply put, we have this right independent of what any government says." While terrorism was a significant political and social problem in the world today, climate change was too. "We are in the middle of a drought exacerbated by climate change. "Unless there is a global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions dramatically, millions across our continent will die. Africa's poverty eradication measures will not be successful in a 2\'c2\'baC-plus world, and the continent's economic slavery, bound to the cruel yoke of poverty and conflict, will continue." By banning marches at COP21 , the French government was turning its back on freedom "and letting the Islamic State undermine the ideal of a free people able to gather and congregate as they wish". In effect, the West's response to terrorism had been to "abandon progressive morality and the Enlightenment". The West had become a mirror image of criminal fundamentalism. "We will not bow to attempts by IS or the French government to take us away from the common goal of saving the planet for all of humanity." \</doc>

Don't expect miracles. That's the best attitude to take to the mammoth UN climate conference opening in Paris today, where 195 countries will try to construct a comprehensive agreement to cope with the looming threat of global warming. It's being talked of in apocalyptic terms - "our last best chance to save the planet", and the like. Yet despite all the fervent hopes riding upon it and the presence of nearly 150 heads of state, from US President Barack Obama down, it is already clear that the optimum conference outcome - a deal to keep global warming below the 2\'c2\'b0C "danger threshold" in the years to come - is not going to be possible. The two-week Paris meeting, officially known in the jargon as COP21 - the 21st conference of the parties to the UN climate convention - will not, therefore, provide the solution to the problem of worldwide climate change at a stroke. But if all goes well, it may provide a significant step on the road to solving it, and COP21 will be judged as a success or failure by just how big that step turns out to be. Its principal aim, of course, is to cut the emissions of carbon dioxide from industry, transport and energy generation. It's the remorseless build-up of CO2 in the atmosphere that is causing the warming; when accurate measurement of atmospheric CO2 began in 1958, its level was 315 parts per million, and this year, the figure passed 400ppm. That calls for a halt to the burning of the fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - which produce it. But to switch to alternative forms of energy, to swop your coal-fired power stations for nuclear ones or for renewables such as wind and solar power, is a very expensive business, and the countries of the world have not yet shown themselves willing to do it fast enough. This became clear earlier this month, after an audit of all the voluntary pledges to cut CO2 that countries have been asked to make in advance of the conference. These pledges, or national climate plans, are officially known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs - boy, does the UN love its jargon. By last week, 149 of them had been submitted, involving \'c2\'b0 countries (the discrepancy in the figures reflects the fact that all the EU member states are covered by one INDC). The plans cover more than 93 percent of global CO2 emissions, including those of the three biggest emitters: China, the US and India. But when UN scientists analysed the total effect of these projected cuts earlier this month, they found that they would only hold the projected warming down to |2.7\'c2\'b0C, far in excess of the 2-degree danger threshold. Some analyses suggested they might even allow warming of 3.5\'c2\'b0C, which would be catastrophic for the planet (although not as catastrophic as doing nothing, officially known as Business As Usual, which would put us on the road to a 4 to 5-degree rise). COP21 's most important task, therefore, is to improve these pledges - remember, they are all entirely voluntary - and put the world on the "two-degree pathway". This cannot be done at once. So what is being proposed is |a ratcheting-up mechanism, under which all countries will come back to the table, probably every five years, with new and most importantly, improved INDCs, until the 2-degree pathway is reached. This is the crucial focus: if Paris achieves this, or something like it, it will be a success, in that it will be a major step towards the solution; if it doesn't, it will in essence be a failure. (Some other elements are also crucial, most notably |a transparency mechanism under which all countries submit reports on their carbon-cutting efforts, which will then be subject to international scrutiny.) It should be said, though, that the very shape of the Paris conference already represents a big step forward, in that the whole international community is now involved in the effort to cut greenhouse gases. The past 20 years of climate negotiations have been bedevilled by a damaging split between the rich developed countries and the poorer developing countries. The latter long took the view that the rich nations had caused most of the problem, so they should be the ones taking action to solve it. Thus the first emissions-cutting treaty, the Kyoto protocol of 1997, required only the developed countries to take action. But in those 20 years, circumstances have changed. Some of the developing countries are now themselves at the forefront of the carbon emitters, led by China, which produces more than 25 percent of the world's CO2 (the US is now only the second-biggest emitter; India is the third). So it is vital that all nations join in, and with their INDCs submitted in advance of COP21 , all nations have done so, for the first time. Two announcements in recent days have only reinforced the urgency of the task. The first, from the UK Met Office, revealed that world temperatures have already risen by one of the two degrees towards the danger threshold; the second, from the World Meteorological Organisation, disclosed that 2015 will be the hottest year ever recorded, by some margin. Yet, it should also be said that the outlook for COP21 is quite good. "We've seen a rising political will among many of the major players, especially the US and China," said one of the acutest observers of the climate-change negotiating process, Elliot Diringer of the Washington-based Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. "There is still an enormous amount of work to be done in translating that goodwill into treaty text. There's still a lot that can go wrong in the kitchen. But hopefully in Paris, we will have some master chefs." - The Independent l Michael McCarthy, formerly The Independent's longstanding environment editor and now its environment columnist, is one of Britain's leading writers on the environment and the natural world. \</doc>

WHEN the thousands of |delegates and hangers-on meet in Paris for the 21st UN conference on climate change in December, few of them will consider the amount of carbon dioxide they are to push into the atmosphere as they take trains, planes and motor cars to get there - and of course, talk, and breath out. But this is not the only irony. A bigger one is that millions of tax-paying citizens are paying for this circus. Some may have made individual donations to make it possible for delegates to make the trip, but a great many others have not - at least not voluntarily. At the last UN conference on climate change held in Lima, Peru, our own government spent taxpayers' money sending 80 government delegates to attend, 76 of them flying in from South Africa. The local diplomatic corps was there already. Add their travel time, some touring and shopping expeditions the 76 each probably spent 12 days in Peru at South African taxpayers' expense. Not too shabby, as they say. As it is highly likely that those who enjoyed the delights of Peru are now looking forward to a Paris sojourn, it is worth listing just a few of those 76 who made it to Lima last time, courtesy of Joe Public. Here they are. Read it and weep. Her Excellency, the Minister of Water and Environmental Affairs; Her Excellency, the Deputy Minister, Department of Environmental Affairs; the chief director of international climate change relations and negotiations, Department of Environmental Affairs; the deputy director-general Multilateral Agreements International Relations and Co-operation. The list continues And the deputy director-general of environmental advisory services, Department of Environmental Affairs; the deputy director-general of climate change and air quality, Department of Environmental Affairs; the chief director of international governance, Department of Environmental Affairs. And the chief director of climate change adaptation, Department of Environmental Affairs; the chief state law advisor, Department of International Relations and Co-operation; the chief director, senior specialist advisor monitoring and evaluation, Department of Environmental Affairs; the chief director of clean energy, Department of Energy. And, the chief operating officer, Environmental Affairs; the specialist scientist, Department of Water and Sanitation, Water Research Commission; the director of international climate change relations and negotiations, Department of Environmental Affairs. And, a man from the Department of International Relations and Co-operation; the director of atmospheric quality information, Department of Environmental Affairs; the director, Department of Environmental Affairs; and the director of climate change adaptation-socio-economic sectors, Environmental Affairs. And not to forget the office administrator from the Department of Environmental Affairs, and the registry clerk from the Department of Environmental Affairs. All the above are civil servants whose attendance is deemed essential since they deal with South Africa's response to the alleged world-threatening issue of climate change and the theoretically deadly effects of carbon dioxide. It would appear from their titles that none of these people were elected, holding their positions by virtue of the needs of us poor citizens who pay their salaries, that is, they are our servants. Nice work, if you can get it. Now imagine what this climate change junket cost the South African taxpayer by totting up the 76 airfares to get to Lima and back, the cost of 76 hotel rooms, 76 per diem expenses, entertainment allowances, meals, for example. We doubled that Britain sent only 36 government delegates. We doubled that. Assuming the British |delegation had the same travel and accommodation costs at the (then) exchange rate as our lot, we spent R6 840 000 on providing a jolly nice holiday for our servants. As an outraged South African environmentalist put it: "What contribution did these people make to improve our country for the benefit of its citizens? What did they bring back from the meeting in Peru that will help address the plight of poor people in this country? "What contribution did the 'office administrator from the Department of Environmental Affairs' make to the meeting? Or the 'registry clerk from the Department of Environmental Affairs'? "How can the use of public funds possibly be justified for such people to travel overseas to attend an international meeting supposed to address matters of science and technology?" Nobody seems to have asked such questions - not even someone in the Treasury, it would appear - because surely, surely, anyone who did ask would have cut the numbers at least in half and preferably much more. Greenpeace, WWF, Christian Aid, Friends of the Earth and Oxfam together sent 148 people. Did their donors know? Just asking. Seven attendees from the Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University were there too. Also to be seen in Lima was Mick Jagger's daughter representing the Bianca Jagger Human Rights Foundation. Her own research assistant accompanied her. So, what are the chances that this year our government will not be as generous with our money when the Paris climate conference tickets need to be booked? Let us hope that whoever signs the cheques this time makes a show of caring for the environment by cutting down the C02 emissions involved.

THE run-up to the climate talks in Paris in December appears to have created a new dynamic among South Africans. It seems they are not sitting back pinning their hopes on a good outcome at COP21 , but are looking beyond Paris and planning what action South Africa needs to take if the Paris talks fail. Over the last few weeks the Department of Environment Affairs has been consulting the public around the country about the greenhouse gas emission targets that South Africa will take to the UN climate talks. These are a requirement for all signatory nations to the UN Framework Convention on |Climate Change. Many nations have already |submitted their targets, which will form the base of tough negotiations as to who will cut emissions by how much and by when. Those who took part in the consultations in Cape Town this week took the task seriously, made suggestions regarding what was good about the department's proposals for Paris, what was lacking and how the document could be improved. But then they went further: one group after another said if the Paris talks failed - if COP21 could not achieve an effective deal to keep global temperature rise below 2\'c2\'baC - South Africa must make drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions anyway, just as if we were under an international legal obligation to do so. Their suggestions as to how to achieve these cuts were well considered, practical and achievable. According to Environmental Affairs officials, they echoed much of what others had said in consultations around the country. Perhaps the most important point to come out of the consultations was that government must no longer regard providing development and tackling climate change as competing demands on the public purse. That thinking was outdated. Real development, they said, was low carbon development. Addressing one, addressed the other. It is an excellent point and one which government needs to internalise and implement across sectors. We cannot afford to be locked into old ways of thinking. The costs of not tackling climate change - to society and to the economy - are just too great. \</doc>

EDITORIAL COMMENT. Ambitious but laudable COP21 , the latest iteration of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations due to take place in Paris in December, has been billed as the world's & last chance& to reach agreement on measures to reduce carbon emissions before global warming spirals out of control. Sceptics are likely to be wryly amused. After all, just about every COP meeting has generated warnings of dire consequences for humankind if action is not taken - and produced new deadlines that have invariably been missed. No wonder climate-change activists were starting to be treated like the little boy who kept crying, & Wolf!& Ironically, COP21 may just be the meeting where that all changes. Group of Seven (G-7) leaders who met in Germany this week pledged to work towards phasing out fossil fuels & over the course of this century& to support a worldwide reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 40%-70% by 2050. That might seem a conveniently woolly target, as usual, but there are indications that there is real intent behind the promises this time, for a number of reasons. The most important one is that a global agreement is finally appearing to be not only possible, but likely to be nailed down in Paris. Up to now, while the vast majority of countries were prepared to commit to specific emission-reduction targets with the goal of restricting anthropogenic warming to 2\'b0C, two of the world's biggest polluters - the US and China - were reluctant to get on board. Both have now been convinced to play ball, with the US volunteering to lower its emissions 28% by 2025 and China agreeing to cap its carbon output by 2030. The industrialised world has also committed to raising $100bn from public and private sources to finance climate change mitigation measures, a key requirement for a number of developing countries - including SA - to deliver on their emission-reduction pledges. Of course, achieving global agreement is one thing; getting everyone to stick to their promises is quite another. SA is not the only state that cannot possibly reach its targets without committing wholeheartedly to nuclear power - and not the only one where this will spark fierce public resistance. \</doc>

AHEAD of nearly 150 global leaders gathering in Paris today to attend a critical climate meeting organised by the UN, more than 1 000 Capetonians marched through the streets of the CBD yesterday in a display of solidarity. Today's gathering, known as COP21 , will attempt to craft a long-term deal to lessen carbon emissions around the globe. In Cape Town, demonstrators marched from the Cape Peninsula University of Technology toward Parliament as part of the Global Climate march campaign to hand over a memorandum of demands that asked the government to take "drastic" steps to stop carbon emissions. March organiser Justin Friedman said there had been ongoing conversations between various countries about the issue of climate pollution for more than 20 years. "Both developing and developed countries were having discussions around carbon emissions and other climate goals. They are hoping that in this COP21 , there will be a consensus and agreement that will be legally binding. "It is important to push that agenda. It is one of the things that affect us all. It affects developing countries in the world, the poor more than anyone, as we are seeing with the drought right now. Those who do not have, do not have access to be able to mitigate. We have to actually commit to a different way of living. Commit to generating our own energy. We have to think of different ways when dealing with our waste and dealing with our carbon footprint." Some of the non-profit organisations that marched yesterday included Avaaz, 350.org, the Wildlife and Environmental Society of South Africa (Wessa), the Southern African Faith Communities Environment Institute, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), MillionClimate.Jobs and Biomimicry-SA. The march also received an overwhelming amount of public support. Wessa's Patrick Dowling said: "This march is important because at least 20 years of negotiation has been wasted with very little meaningful resolution and it's more and more important for the people of the world to rather call for change themselves than to wait for their so-called leaders." James Reeler, from WWF, said climate change was "probably" one of the biggest issues facing humanity at the moment. \</doc>

THE forthcoming climate talks were not strictly about the environment - they were about the right of poorer countries, like South Africa, to develop. This, said the director-general of the India-based Centre for Science and Environment, Sunita Narain, would be one of the key issues discussed by climate negotiators at the UN Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) in Paris next month. She was speaking at the annual media briefing on climate change in New Delhi held on Thursday and Friday last week. Narain was addressing journalists from various areas in the "Global South", including Kenya, Afghanistan and Indonesia. The Mercury represented South Africa. "The poor are not responsible for the problem but will suffer its impacts. The historical burden of the problem falls on the shoulders of developing nations," she said. Emphasising Narain's point, the organisation's deputy director, Chandra Bhushan, said carbon dioxide, once released into the atmosphere, continued to be present for up to 150 years. "So technically, the gases released in the 1850s after the height of the industrial revolution are still in the atmosphere, meaning that even if we curbed emissions to zero tomorrow, the climate will continue to change," said Bhushan. Narain said that developed nations like the US had been allowed to develop unimpeded, leading to the problems the world now faced. " COP21 will be about freezing inequity." She used South Africa as an example. The country, while developing and part of the Brics (Brazil, Russia, India and China) coalition, contributed 0.9% to the world's harmful gases responsible for climate change. It was also the highest emitter in Africa, contributing, as at 2012, a whopping 462.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide. In comparison, Egypt contributed 288.19 units while Kenya emitted 59.48 metric tons. "Just because South Africa contributes to emissions on a fairly large scale, it does not mean it is not entitled to do so. All developed nations have a need to develop." Narain said: "We can't say: 'Well, South Africa, you've had enough. No more for you.' The country is in the process of addressing its problems with inequity. Climate change, in fact, is the latest challenge in the long list of struggles, including apartheid and colonisation." She said as the rest of Africa continued to develop, emissions would continue to increase. "The rich are continuing to contribute, while the poor are increasing their emissions," said Narain. \</doc>

SA's climate change efforts too weak, MPs told Parliamentary Writer CAPE TOWN - SA's targets for the global climate change negotiations in December were unlikely to succeed because the country was going in the wrong direction with the construction of huge fossil-fuel power stations, Parliament's environmental affairs committee was told yesterday. A Department of Environmental Affairs delegation led by director-general Nosipho Ngcaba said at the public hearings that the negotiations under the United Nations' Framework Convention on Climate Change were set to finalise a new legal instrument for the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. SA was on track to achieve the 2% target. SA is expected to play a leading role at the Conference of Parties 21 ( COP21 ) as a constructive actor on behalf of the developing world. Member states at COP21 will state their positions through what are known as intended national determined contributions, in which they indicate what they intend to achieve. But environmental activists argued that SA was failing to hold two of its biggest polluters - Eskom and Sasol - to account. Tristan Taylor of Earthlife Africa said: & SA is on the wrong trajectory with the upward emissions that will result from the building of Medupi and Kusile power stations.& He added that a & hard look& needed to be taken at the use of coal if the 2% target were to be met. Louise Naude, of the World Wildlife Fund, said SA should be investing its hard-earned tax money differently and & not in going in the wrong direction& with fossil fuels. Her colleague, Tasneem Essop, said the South African intended national determined contributions were weak. & We urge SA to take strong positions,& she said. The young and thriving renewable energy sector should be championed by the government, she said. Ms Cooke said there were not enough details in SA's intended national determined contributions. She also dismissed nuclear energy as the solution to the global change targets, saying that building nuclear power stations and disposing of the waste were highly carbon intensive. Hameda Deedat of the Congress of South African Trade Unions' research arm also took aim at the nuclear plan. This plan did not create jobs, while renewable energy plants did, she said. Ms Deedat warned that global warming would have a devastating effect on employment. hartleyw@bdfm.co.za START: Picture: \</doc>

This year brings many new global milestones and opportunities, in particular at the meeting of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties. At the COP21 This is critical but far from easy. Most countries, scientists and people agree our emission pathways are unsustainably high. What is left, however, is how to act on this information - and that hinges on how we assess the risks and opportunities, especially how we can quantify the risk and cost the impact of climate change. Unlike threats such as conflict and terrorism, which cause immediate loss of human life, the dangers of desertification or more turbulent weather seem less important than risks that give rise to the human "fight or flight" response. Our inability to quantify the risks and tendency to under-estimate the costs involved make it harder to nail the international will to make the concessions to deal with them. A group of international experts have sought to address the analysis gap, to try to equip us better to quantify and address the risks of climate change. Sir David King, the UK Foreign Secretary's Special Representative on Climate Change, Daniel Schrag from Harvard University, Zhou Dadi from China's National Expert Committee on Climate Change, Qi Ye from Tsinghua University and Arunabha Ghosh of the Indian Council on Energy, Environment and Water have written a joint report, titled "Climate Change: A Risk Assessment", which offers a framework for conducting risk assessments by country. It considers three main aspects: what we are doing to our climate, how climate might change as a result, and what that, in turn, could it do to us and the way we interact as humans. The report provides a starting point for countries to work from. It recommends we assess the risks of climate change in the same way we assess risks to national security and public health - by considering the worst-case scenarios and using a consistent set of indicators to track expert opinion over time. It advises that, given the wide-reaching impact of climate change, these assessments be presented regularly to heads of state to take leadership in responding to the projected changes. Variation From this, a more evidenced global dialogue should be possible. Against this background, South Africa and the UK are working towards securing an ambitious, legally binding deal at COP21 . Global greenhouse gas emissions have already caused an average 0.65\'c2\'b0C increase in temperatures. But that level varies dramatically across the world. A global 0.65\'c2\'b0C rise has actually meant a 0.95\'c2\'b0C rise in South Africa, where increasing rainfall variability and drought have resulted in water rationing in KwaZulu-Natal, traditionally the wettest province. In Pakistan, we have seen tragic fatalities as a consequence of heat waves. But we should also not lose sight, in the midst of all these worries, of the opportunities that will arise as we work to combat climate change. Even small efforts can have lasting results that protect our natural spaces, economies and people. The latest new climate economy report, commissioned by a multi-lateral group, including the UK's Nicholas Stern and South Africa's Trevor Manuel, recommends ways we can capitalise on a low carbon transition while aiding development. These include addressing short-term development needs in a way that safeguards our children's future through investment in technology, the expansion of our financial systems and protection of our natural resources. We have supported mitigation initiatives, such as the carbon tax, with a carbon trading pilot project in partnership with the JSE, business and government. And we are working hard to better understand adaptation in South Africa's context. The biggest environmental danger of global climate change is its threat to organisms and ecosystems that are unable to adapt. People, too, will not survive the impending storm without decisive action. COP21 provides an opportunity to take that action. \</doc>

NEW DELHI: India and Germany pledged yesterday to revive efforts to reach an Indo-European free trade pact after talks fell apart this year, and struck deals to promote clean energy and make it easier to do business. Although German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made no mention in conversations with journalists of resuming talks on a free trade agreement between India and the EU, it was perhaps the most significant "deliverable" of her trip to New Delhi. The leaders "committed themselves to bringing about the earliest possible resumption of talks", said a joint statement issued after the talks. Asia's third-largest economy has been relatively insulated from a slump in global trade, but Modi still needs to boost exports for his pitch to investors to "Make in India" to create skilled jobs for millions of young Indians. Germany, Europe's largest economy, is looking to expand its presence in India to compensate for a slowdown in China. Merkel's delegation was joined by bosses from names such as Siemens, Airbus, E.ON and Thyssenkrupp. Germany, a world leader in renewable energy, will also provide more than e2 billion (R30.5bn) in aid for solar projects and green energy corridors, or high-efficiency power grids, as part of a broader push for sustainable development. The assistance, part of a raft of agreements signed in New Delhi, dovetails with efforts to bind India into a global debate that will culminate in the COP21 climate change summit in December. "We look forward to a concrete outcome at COP21 in Paris that strengthens the commitment and the ability of the world, especially of poor and vulnerable countries, to transition to a more sustainable growth path," Modi said. India, the world's third-largest greenhouse gas emitter, was the last major country to submit its energy plan ahead of the UN climate conference. Its plan seeks to boost energy efficiency, but makes no promise to reduce emissions - reflecting its view that richer nations are the most responsible for global warming. Merkel said: "We have understood, prime minister, that climate protection needs to be embraced by the people - who also have to reap a benefit." India and Germany also signed an agreement to fast-track business approvals, providing German firms with a single point of contact to help them navigate a web of red tape. - Reuters \</doc>

As drought grips South Africa, a fair and ambitious global climate deal is critical to limit the future impacts of climate change on vulnerable people. With parts of South Africa in the grip of one of the worst droughts in 30 years, civil society organisations have called on the government to stand for climate justice at the upcoming climate negotiations by securing finance for adaptation and increasing ambition to cut emissions at home. With KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga facing severe water shortages and maize production falling to its lowest level in eight years, water shortages and food price rises threaten to hit the poorest South Africans hard and affect food exports to neighbouring countries. This drought is just a taste of things to come. Globally, governments, including our own, must act now to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by stopping fossil fuel burning and changing agricultural methods. Otherwise, we could see devastating 4-6\'c2\'b0C increases in temperature in some parts of South Africa in the next 50 years. The most vulnerable people are already hit. Drought makes it harder to grow your own food, falling crop yields raise food prices, and water is becoming scarcer. The current droughts are caused by a combination of the impacts of human-created climate change and the natural, global El Ni\'c3\'b1o weather cycle. El Ni\'c3\'b1o occurs every two to seven years and is affecting large parts of the world, causing higher temperatures and changing rainfall patterns. Nasa data shows that October this year is the hottest month ever on record, continuing the upward trend in global temperatures of the past 10 years. The next round of climate negotiations, COP21 (UN Framework Convention on Climate Change 21st Conferences of the Parties), begins in Paris today, and as chair of the G77+China group made up of developing countries, South Africa has a critical role to play. What is not up for debate |is the need for global responsibility to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. Central to the negotiations will be the adequacy of commitments to date made by countries to cut emissions (mitigation plans) and the financing that must be made available for countries affected by the worst climate impacts to adapt (adaptation plans). Countries are obligated to submit their domestically determined "commitments" for mitigation, and many developing countries have included their adaptation needs as well, in the form of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). South Africa submitted its own INDC last month, and the government's delegation has now also communicated its intended negotiating position going into COP21 . COP21 and calling for a greater ambition to cut emissions. The "climate red lines" include: l Greater ambition at home. South Africa's position must preserve the principle of national sovereignty, but too much emphasis is placed on mitigation and adaptation plans being conditional on international funding. There must be a more ambitious, raised baseline for emission reduction, regardless of international funding. l Equal financing to mitigate and adapt. Annual climate finance should be dedicated equally to adaptation and mitigation for developing countries including South Africa, and the initial target of $100bn a year by 2020 should be met, and then increased. l Inclusion of South Africa and other emerging economies for eligibility for climate finance for both adaptation and mitigation. The full list of organisations that have come together is, the Adaptation Network, BirdLife South Africa, Earthlife Africa JHB, Ekurhuleni Environmental Organisation, Khoelife Co-operative, Gauteng Climate Group, Greenpeace Africa, One Million Climate Jobs Campaign, Oxfam, Project 90 by 2030, SAIIA youth, South South North, Southern African Faith Communities Environmental Institute, Vaal Environmental Justice Network, WWF and YouLead-Collective. l Project 90 by 2030 is based in Cape Town and will be sending three representatives to take part in discussions at the COP Climate Change Conference.

IT'S a mystery what has happened to the fleet of 92 bicycles that were presented to the city by the UN during the COP17 climate change discussions four years ago. The idea was a promotion of pedal power - personal physical fitness and a cutting down on noxious motor vehicle exhaust emissions. Durban setting an example, taking the lead. But have we since seen the mayor and his cohorts riding to work? Er, no. Have we seen the full council riding the beachfront promenade at weekends? Er, no. Have we seen the metro police on bicycles - fitted with blue lights and sirens as they escort the mayor and his cohorts, all pedalling furiously? Er, no. We've seen the city pay R97 500 for reflector jackets, bicycle racks, pumps and toolkits. But not a glimpse of the bikes themselves or their riders. Now the city is looking for somebody to "maintain" these mystery bicycles for R200 000 a year. R200 000? That's a lot of John Bull puncture repair outfits. Where are these bicycles? Is anyone using them? I think we should be told. Object lesson Could there have been a better object lesson, as COP21 opened in France this week, than TV footage of the choking smog that had enveloped Beijing. China is a sudden convert to the search for alternatives to fossil fuels. And there's surely some hope in this. The Chinese are an intelligent and determined people. If there is an alternative in areas such as solar energy, the Chinese can be expected to be in the forefront of attempts to find it. The Beijing smogs illustrate an important secondary truth in the discussion of climate change. The industrial practices that are thought to be the cause of global warming are at the same time toxic, deeply unpleasant and probably also fatal to mankind's future because they poison the atmosphere, our rivers and our oceans. If the COP21 Car race TWO cars raced from London to Paris the other day as a prelude to COP21 . One was powered by hydrogen, the other by electricity. Hydrogen won but because the electricity-driven car was unable to find a place to recharge its batteries. However, the point was made. Non-petroleum cars are the future. In fact in the 1920s steam-driven cars far out-performed the internal combustion engine. Imagine if research had focused on developing the steam car. But here's a puzzle. We're told that modern industry is producing carbon dioxide at a rate that promotes global warming, killing off the Amazon rain forests which convert CO2 back into oxygen. But cars don't produce CO2. Exhaust fumes are carbon monoxide (CO), which is actually poisonous. Presumably the rainforests don't convert CO? What happens to it? Does it just hang around poisoning things? The more you think about it, the worse it gets. Oz incident NEWS from Australia. People in a Sydney apartment block heard a woman scream, then a commotion of furniture being thrown about and a man shouting: "I'm going to kill you, you're dead! Die! Die!" They called the cops. But the occupant of the flat had no wife, no girlfriend. He'd been killing a spider with a spray can. The woman's scream? Oh, that. He was very frightened of spiders. They made him scream like a sheila. It was a very big spider, he said. Tailpiece THE local banker, out west in the US, spots his friend Tom, an |80-year-old rancher, in town. Tom lost his wife the year before. Rumour has it that he's marrying a "mail order" bride. "Sure is." "May I ask the age of your new bride to be?" "She'll be 21 in January." The banker wants Tom's remaining years to be happy. He tactfully suggests that he should get a hired hand to help out on the ranch (and perhaps in other areas though he doesn't say it). Tom says that's a good idea. He'll look for a hired hand that very afternoon. Four months later, the banker sees Tom in town again. "How's your new wife?" "And how's the hired hand?" "She's pregnant too!" Last word History teaches us that men and nations behave wisely once they have exhausted all other alternatives. - Abba Eban \</doc>

SOUTH Africa has announced its intention to sign the Paris Agreement, but there is still a long road ahead before it can be trans-\'e2\â¬ \Â£8lated into constructive action domestically. The Paris climate change conference (UNFCCC COP21 ) stood out as not only a symbol of global solidarity, but also a beacon of hope for the then-flailing international climate change negotiations. It was an opportunity for the international community to show it resolve and further define its role in governing global commons. So it came as no surprise when COP21 ended with a new international climate deal - the \'e2\â¬ \Â£8Paris Agreement - and the world celebrated, with South Africa playing an instrumental role in closing the deal. Although many question its value, the Paris Agreement sets up an international legal framework for countries to shift towards a zero-carbon and climate-resilient world, and signals a turning point in the international community's commitment to addressing climate change. The Paris Agreement, put simply, is an implementation tool. It is a legal instrument that enhances the implementation of the UN's Framework Convention on Climate Change, without prejudicing the convention's objective and aim to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty. The Paris package (of which the Paris Agreement forms part) was adopted by South Africa along with 195 other countries at the end of COP21 . Adoption of the Paris package is a point in the process where parties to the negotiations formally establish the form and content of the agreement. Now, South Africa, like other countries that are party to \'e2\â¬ \Â£8the UNFCCC, needs to take steps to give effect to the Paris Agreement internationally and domestically. Before the agreement can be made relevant at a domestic level, South Africa needs to take a number of administrative and procedural strides. Although there are still various processes that need to be followed at the global level before the agreement comes into effect, South Africa can take charge and get its legislative and regulatory house in order in the meantime. For a start, this requires an \'e2\â¬ \Â£8analysis of South Africa's climate change legal regime, bearing in mind that some domestic legislation and regulations may require supplementation or adjustment to be consistent with the procedural requirements of the Paris Agreement. UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon has invited world leaders to a high-level signing ceremony for the Paris Agreement in New York today - with the UNFCCC's participating parties given until April 21 next year to ratify the Paris Agreement. If the international community is to succeed collaboratively to tackle the impacts of climate change, the first step would be to get at least \'e2\â¬ \Â£855 signatories - which make up 55% of global emissions - to the Paris Agreement. This is because the Paris package clearly stipulates that the agreement would only come into effect and be legally binding once the threshold is reached. However, signature only serves as a commitment to refrain from acts that would defeat the objective and purpose of the agreement. Signature does not automatically mean that a country becomes party to the agreement. In order for the agreement to come into force, countries must first sign the agreement and then indicate their consent to be bound by the agreement (this is referred to loosely as ratification). As the champion of the Durban platform from COP17, South Africa should be among the first countries to sign the Paris Agreement. As a front-runner signatory, South Africa will be able to communicate its legislative peculiarities, as well as formally make reservations on aspects of the Paris Agreement that are either contentious or inconsistent with South Africa's supreme law, while developing solutions for those challenges. This can be prior to embarking on an arduous constitutional mandated ratification process. COP17 in Durban fundamentally changed the tone of the international climate change negotiations. Closer inspection of the Paris Agreement will reveal many of its characteristics and outcomes were determined at COP17. South Africa has a duty and an obligation to continue to lead by example. Also, to actualise the domestic operationalisation of the Paris Agreement in a transparent and ambitious manner. It is time that South Africa embraced the shift to low-carbon development. This should be done not just in rhetoric but institutionally, legally and politically. l Khambule is the policy and research co-ordinator for the Cape Town-based environmental NPO, Project 90 by 2030. \</doc>

Climate change is a subject that no sector can afford to neglect. In less than six months, Paris promises to be a battlefield of agendas as the United Nations COP21 kicks off... The 2015 SACAU Annual Conference, held in Mahe, Seychelles on 25 and 26 May 2015, left delegates with the realisation that farmers and researchers need each other and should work together towards combating the challenges of climate change. SACAU CEO, Mr Ishmael Sunga, emphasised that the organisation is aiming to increase the capabilities of farmers and farmer organisations to navigate their way into the future in order to efficiently deal with the unique and complex challenges ahead. "Agriculture is a long-term journey and we believe in the role of science to propel our members into the future. The reality of climate change will have a huge impact on the sector, and as such not spare our soils, forests or fisheries' which form the basis of discussions at this year's conference," he said. Climate change on the international agenda The conference was officially opened by Mr Wallace Cosgrow, Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture of Seychelles, who highlighted the importance of political support for Africa's climate change initiatives and the need for an inclusive process for progress. Agriculture has been cited as one of the main contributors to greenhouse emissions and a major driver of deforestation. The sector continues to be painted as both the villain and hero in the climate change debate, despite it having the most to lose from changing weather patterns. Deliberations at the conference set the foundation for a united and firm position from Southern Africa's farmers for COP21 at the end of the year. SACAU President, Dr Theo de Jager, informed delegates that the organisation managed to decisively put climate change on the international agenda over the years, insofar as it impacts on farmers. "This year is the final round, we must make this work. Discussions from the conference will go into COP21 as the voice of farmers of Southern Africa. What we need is a firm agreement, which must be digestible to the smallest of farmers in the region," he emphasised. Africa will need to adapt Dr James Kinyangi, from CGIAR Climate Change Agriculture and Food Security (CCFAS) set the scene on the climate change debate by pointing out that large parts of Africa will no longer be suitable for maize production in the coming years due to climate change. "A focus on adaptation and diversification from maize is required. A transition to livestock based systems is inevitable as well as a need to promote transformation to animal protein, through improved livestock farming systems," he explained. Africa is facing a serious challenge of a rapidly growing young population with low-calorie intake confronted by increased climate changes (floods, cyclones, and drought) that is negatively affecting production. Fisheries and forestry Dr John Mmochi, from the Institute of Marine Resources at the University of Dar es Salaam, informed delegates that aquaculture is the fastest growing source of animal protein, increasing 12 fold over the past three decades. However, Africa's contribution to world fish trade is very small despite its huge resource base. "This is due to our limited access to deep water fishing due to lack of appropriate vessels and low capacity for policing exclusive fishing zones. This has led to foreign vessels exploiting lucrative deep waters while Africans end up fishing in breeding zones close to the coast. We are fishing in the breeding zones, fishing the juveniles. We need to empower ourselves to fish in open seas/deep waters," he explained. Agroforestry at the conference was widely recognised as "climate smart" and it's potential to be a major additional source of income was highlighted. It was noted that farmers can get more money from forestry than crops if they plant the right trees and use good quality seed. Tree or crop systems (agroforestry) also offers viable opportunities for a transformation towards climate-smart agriculture. Speakers at the conference also emphasised a need for innovation in the management of rangelands, as the conventional understanding of the carrying capacity of rangelands needs a review. Delegates were informed that ultra-high density grazing offers immense opportunities for maximising the use of rangelands, whilst minimising selective grazing, bush encroachment, and improving the quality of grazing and profit per hectare in livestock systems. \</doc>

Cities are stepping up to the plate to battle climate change, an influential new report reveals. Speaking at the AfriCities Summit, Hastings Chikoko, the C40 Cities Climate |Leadership Group Regional Director for Africa, said cities are innovative and are in a unique position to act as |catalysts in wider climate action. And, he said, African cities are a beacon of hope. The new report from C40 Cities and Arup - released this week - described the climate efforts that cities are making. Africa is reporting the greatest increase in the |proportion of adaption actions being taken, the report revealed. The report will be officially launched at COP21 in Paris. It presents major new insights into the current |status, latest trends and future potential for climate action at the city level. |Documenting the volume of action being taken by cities, it provides compelling evidence about cities' commitment to tackling climate change and their critical role in the fight to achieve global emissions reductions. Since the Copenhagen |climate talks in 2009, cities in the C40 network \'e2\â¬  which include Johannesburg, Lagos, London, Hong Kong, and New York, among 78 others \'e2\â¬  have committed to cutting their greenhouse gas emissions by at least three gigatons of CO2 equivalent in the next 15 years. This is equal to India's annual emissions, or half those of the US. Advocates of city climate action should be immensely proud of this progress, said Chikoko. He said cities across the world, but particularly in Africa are scaling up action, and they are increasingly |collaborating. In fact, one in three of the actions cities took were achieved through |collaboration. "They are not working alone," he said An example is where |Johannesburg collaborated with Washington DC to help facilitate a new financial |structures. The city is working with local partners as well as the World Bank to implement new structures for |neighbourhood improvement, learning from Washington's own experiences. Johannesburg, in turn, passed on its lessons with waste management to Rio de Janeiro. Through the C40 |Sustainable Solid Waste |Systems Network, Rio learned about Johannesburg and Jakarta's management of waste cooperatives. Cities are also putting their money where their mouths are. The report revealed that 64 percent of cities' actions to combat climate change were delivered through their own budgets. Also, cities are building on their success stories. The report showed that 88 percent of the reported actions were due for expansion. Chikoko said the report showed that money is needed and that going into COP21 , Africa and its local government must be more vocal about climate financing. \</doc>

Climate fight to hit firms Companies in SA face huge costs in reducing greenhouse gas emissions MATTHEW THORNTON-DIBB & TINA COSTAS Norton Rose Fulbright THE Paris Agreement, adopted by the negotiating parties at COP21 , has been hailed by many as a historic step in addressing the risks posed by global climate change. SA's representative at COP21 , in a statement made at the closing meeting of the negotiations in Paris, stated that it & can mark the turning point to a better and safer world& While optimism remains high, the agreement is not beyond criticism. The most common criticism is that the Paris Agreement consists of only & promises or aims& not firm commitments; that the compliance mechanism is not strong enough in that it is nonadversarial and punitive; and that a vast amount of work will be required to implement the agreement at an international and national level. The core aim of the Paris Agreement is to enhance the implementation of the United National Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) by holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. To achieve this aim, the agreement provides for a mechanism to achieve a global reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). States that ratify the Paris Agreement will be obliged to submit nationally determined contributions where they will set out their contribution. to achieve the aims of the agreement. Prior to the commencement of negotiations at COP21 , SA submitted its intended nationally determined contribution. This contribution, which may be reviewed prior to ratifying the agreement, sets out SA's plan on what it is able and willing to contribute to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the agreement and the UNFCCC, based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities provided for developed and developing countries. SA's contribution sets out both adaptation and mitigation components. In terms of the adaptation component, the country is developing a national climate adaptation strategy and plan that will be integrated into all relevant sector plans. SA's mitigation component moves from a deviation from business-as-usual commitment to a commitment to a peak, plateau and decline in GHG emissions. SA's GHG emissions are expected to peak between 2020 and 2025, plateau for a decade, and then decline. Therefore, SA's total GHG emissions are only set to fall from about 2040. Various policies and measures will be introduced to achieve this. These measures include the proposed carbon tax, sector specific desired emission reduction outcomes, company level carbon budgets, and regulatory standards and controls for specifically identified GHGs and GHG emitters. One such mitigation measure is the declaration of GHGs as priority air pollutants in terms of the National Environmental Management: Air Quality Act, 2004. On January 8, the Department of Environmental Affairs published notice of its intention to declare carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride as priority pollutants. Once the GHG declaration is promulgated, firms which emit any of the declared gases in excess of 0.1 megatonnes annually, or which undertake a production process listed as a primary activity will be required to prepare GHG pollution prevention plans. The activities listed as production processes include coal mining, crude oil production or refining, electricity production, production of liquid fuels from coal or gas, and production of various goods such as cement, glass, and pulp and paper. The range of industries targeted is therefore wide and will affect a significant number of companies operating in SA. It is intended that the GHG pollution prevention plans will be required to establish specific reduction targets aimed at reducing GHG emissions. Annual monitoring on the implementation of the plans will be undertaken and the plans will be updated every five years. No industry-specific desired emissions reduction outcomes have been specified by the Department of Environmental Affairs. However, the five-year targets set out in GHG pollution prevention plans of individual emitters will need to be informed by national government policy considerations, which will need to recognise the outcomes agreed to in terms of the Paris Agreement and SA's intended nationally determined contribution. Therefore, industries identified in terms of the proposed declaration of GHG as priority pollutants will have to start planning to reduce GHG emissions in the immediate future.

The Group of 20 (G20) leaders have called for more collective action to achieve strong, sustainable and balanced growth that can be universally beneficial. In a communique issued at the end of the summit, the leaders agreed that not only do they have to do more to spur growth, they have to make sure that the growth is inclusive and delivers more and better jobs. They pledged to remain committed to achieving the goal of lifting the collective Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the G20 economies by an additional 2% by 2018, an agreement reached at the 2014 summit in Brisbane, Australia. To do that, the leaders said G20 member economies will continue to monitor the implementation of the commitments and adjust their strategies in accordance with economic conditions. The summit came at a time when the world has been struggling to materialise a strong, sustainable and balanced growth, with weak trade and falling investment. Some even suggested that a recession is imminent. Early in November, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) trimmed its forecast for global economic growth in 2015 to 2.9% and 3.3% in 2016, down from the previous predictions of 3% and 3.6%. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also made similar pessimist projections recently. The leaders said the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is the backbone of the multilateral trading system and should continue to play a "central" role to promote economic growth and development. "We will continue our efforts to ensure that our bilateral, regional and plurilateral trade agreements complement one another, are transparent and inclusive... and contribute to a stronger multilateral trade system under WTO rules," the leaders said. SA on board with expanding economy In statement after the summit, President Jacob Zuma acknowledged South Africa's domestic factors that constrain growth and also indicated how the country is resolving these. He said government was dealing decisively with the energy generation through building coal-fired power stations Medupi and Kusile. South Africa also has one of the largest renewable energy programmes, which currently contributes 2 000 MW and will expand to 6 000 MW by 2017/18. Another sector identified to boost growth is tourism. President Zuma said South Africa had changed its approach to the immigration regulations, which will have a positive impact on tourist flows. To boost growth, we agreed to redouble our efforts to implement our growth strategies, which we had agreed in Brisbane last year during the Australian Presidency, as well as the Antalya Action Plan we agreed to at this summit. In our case, this means we must accelerate the implementation of the NDP [National Development Plan], said President Zuma. The long-stalled Doha round of trade talks has prompted many countries to engage with each other either through bilateral or regional trade arrangements. Analysts believe that such a trend is not good news for promoting global trade. To reform the international tax system, the leaders endorsed the measures under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, and urged wide and consistent implementation. The BEPS rules are designed to attack tax avoidance, improve transparency, close loopholes and restrict the use of tax havens. According to the OECD, once the project is implemented, companies, especially multinationals, will find it harder to concentrate their profits in low-tax countries and tax havens, a shift that promises to raise up to US$250 billion a year in extra tax revenue. President Zuma said South Africa's officials from the South African Revenue Service (SARS) and Treasury have been working with the OECD on this issue of base erosion and profit shifting. South Africa has signed agreements with over 51 countries on the sharing of information on multinational companies. So there will be no place to hide for tax dodgers. Arising from the work of the G20, this sharing of information is going to be automatic, he said. On IMF reforms, the leaders said they are "deeply disappointed" with the continued delay in carrying out the 2010 quota reforms and urged the US to ratify these reforms as soon as possible. Additionally, the leaders also reaffirmed that they will remain committed to boosting job creation, investment and promoting cooperation on eradicating poverty, combating corruption and improving energy efficiency. Preparing for COP21 Climate change was also a key item on the G20 summit agenda, as preparations pick up for a key international conference on the issue scheduled to start later this month in Paris. "We recognise that 2015 is a critical year that requires effective, strong and collective action on climate change and its effects," the leaders said. "We affirm our determination to adopt a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the UNFCCC [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] that is applicable to all parties. "We affirm that the Paris agreement should be fair, balanced, ambitious, durable and dynamic," the communique said, stressing the need to reach an ambitious agreement in Paris that reflects the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. President Zuma said South Africa fully supports France in its capacity as incoming Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC ( COP ) 21 /CMP11 President, and will work towards finding fair compromises and consensus between parties, which will hopefully lead to the adoption of an ambitious and legally-binding outcome in Paris that is applicable to all. This is important for South Africa's legacy as the hope of COP17, which set out the mandate for COP21 The leaders said they will instruct their negotiators to "engage constructively and flexibly" in the coming days to discuss key issues such as mitigation, adaptation and finance. According to President Zuma, this was going to help in finding the right balance. Terrorist attacks The leaders also discussed the fight against terrorism and the refugee crisis. President Zuma emphasised that despite anger over the Paris attacks, we must not confuse migrants with terrorists. On the eve of the summit, a wave of terrorist attacks rocked the French capital of Paris, killing 129 people and injuring many more. The Islamic State (IS) militant group has claimed responsibility. The G20 leaders condemned the attacks in Paris and in Ankara, and reaffirmed that "terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any religion, nationality, civilization or ethnic group". "We remain united in combating terrorism," the statement said. Job creation Other key issues discussed at the summit that speak to South Africa's development agenda were energy, youth employment as well as the focus on small, medium and micro-sized enterprises (SMMES). With regards to energy, President Zuma said this was a very important matter for sub-Saharan Africa and South Africa. The challenge, he said, was finding the right balance between the development ambitions of developing countries with the need to protect the environment. The G20 leaders said another key issue was the identification of a numeric and quantifiable youth employment target based on national circumstances as a way to reduce high unemployment rates among young people in their countries. South Africa welcomed the adoption of a target to increase youth employment by 15% by 2025. Domestically, the achievement of this objective will be facilitated through the National Youth Policy 2020 and the Presidential Youth Working Group, said President Zuma. Looking ahead, we believe it would be particularly important for the G20 to also prioritise working to meaningfully address aspects related to equity, justice and dignity as they relate to employment and income distribution. The Ministers responsible for SMMEs in the G20 countries also met and agreed on measures to support SMMEs. The G20 Summit agreed to establish a private sector-led World SME Forum. \</doc>

THE global demand for coal has stalled after more than a decade of "relentless growth", the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its annual coal market report. One of the reasons was economic restructuring in China, which represents half the global coal consumption, as the country was shifting from an economy based on energy-intensive industries to one based more on services. COP21 agreement in Paris, was also expected to dent coal demand. The IEA had cut its estimates on the coal market over the next five years by 500 million tons in recognition of the "tremendous pressures facing coal markets". Preliminary data showed that the decline in China's demand for coal in 2014 has accelerated in 2015. Faith Birol, IEA executive director said in a statement: "The coal industry is facing huge pressures, and the main reason is China, but it is not the only reason. The economic transformation in China and environmental policies worldwide - including the recent climate agreement in Paris - will likely continue to constrain global coal demand." The report said development in China of new hydro power plants, nuclear, wind and solar had also curtailed coal power generation significantly. The shift in new power sources was driven not only by energy security and climate change concerns, but by attempts to reduce air pollution. It forecast that coal demand outside China would increase modestly until 2020, driven mainly by industrial growth in India and south-east Asia. Preliminary data showed India overtaking China as the world's largest coal importer this year. The report said the Indian government's push for universal energy access and an expansion of manufacturing, would drive electricity growth, and coal would provide a significant share of the extra power requirements. India already had ambitious renewable energy targets of 175 gigawatts by 2022, of which 100 GW was solar PV. The region with the highest growth rate in coal over the next five years was in south-east Asia, where Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines all planned new coal power plants. About half of the coal-fired power stations currently being built in south-east Asia still used old, inefficient technology. The slowing energy consumption in China would have an impact on the seaborne coal trade, especially on Indonesian exports. Coal prices continued to remain low: this month the price of imported coal in Europe fell below $50 a ton, "levels not seen in a decade". "Persistent oversupply and shrinking imports in China and elsewhere suggest prices will remain under pressure to 2020," the report said. The IEA said the climate agreement at COP21 in Paris, where nations had agreed to keep rising temperatures to below 2\'c2\'b0C, meant that carbon capture and storage technology would have to be developed and implemented to cut emissions from coal. \</doc>

URBANISATION and poverty were among the chief threats to the livelihood of the country's people. These also hindered the fight against climate change, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Bheki Cele, said yesterday. Cele was among speakers at an event to assess the country's readiness for the Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP21 ), the climate change conference being held in France next month. Cele said the move to develop urban areas took away the scarce commodity that was fertile land. "Agricultural life and the livelihoods of those who depend on the land are being displaced by urbanisation, and this is just part of the raging war between development and living off the land," Cele said. The issue of food, its availability and accessibility to everyone was important and had to be dealt with before concentrating on climate change. "This is about the production of food; without food we won't even be flying to Paris," he said to the delegation at the climate change discussion hosted by the Department of Environmental Affairs. Stakeholders A variety of stakeholders participated, among them business entities, civil society and non-governmental forums and organisations. Speakers included the department's deputy director-general, Judy Beaumont, who explained the need for a strong team at COP21 in Paris. "We need activists from the business community, labour, civil society and local government if we are to work as effectively and efficiently as possible," she said. Advocate Sandea de Wet, the chief state law adviser for the Department of International Relations and Co-operation, said the creation of jobs and equipping of communities to survive would be of benefit to the conference. Cele also said poverty played a major role in the atmospheric dilution, because when people were hungry and had no sources of energy while a forest of trees stood nearby, they would cut down trees and make fires. He proposed an #EmissionsMustFall movement to spread the word about climate change. Cele also spoke about the exclusion of young people in climate change activities. The relationship between energy poverty and climate change needed scrutiny, said Tshwane executive mayor Kgosientso Ramokgopa. He said the starting point had to be ending poverty locally and not the global footprint. "The real situation is poverty and we need to resolve that," said Ramokgopa, who sits on the country's mayors' conference on climate change. He said climate change efforts had to include investing in young people, who would ensure the world was secure for their future. \</doc>

REACTION to COP21 's global climate accord that signals a move away from the fossil-fuel economy mid-century has ranged from the euphoric "victory for the planet" to the damning: "Polluters' great escape". The UN agreement concluded in Paris at the weekend, formally adopted by 195 countries, is the first in which every country in the world has pledged to cut emissions and to phase out fossil fuels. But the timespan is open, with the agreement committing nations to reach a maximum level of greenhouse gas emissions "as soon as possible", and then to reduce emissions rapidly "in the second half of this century". The purpose was to reach a point of climate neutrality where emissions from human activity did not exceed what the natural processes could absorb. While US Secretary of State John Kerry called the Paris Agreement "a victory for all of the planet and for future generations", the International Forum on Globalisation called it the polluters' great escape as it put the world on to a warming path of 3\'c2\'b0C or more. Scientists believe a rise above 2\'c2\'b0C will result in dangerous climate change. It was acknowledged before the start of COP21 talks that the voluntary pledges to cut emissions would put the world on a trajectory of between 2.7 to 3.7\'c2\'b0C warming. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) sees the Paris Agreement as the foundation for long-term efforts to fight climate change. However, the urgency of delivering action was not strong enough. Tasneem Essop, head of WWF's delegation, said: "We need to secure faster delivery of new co-operative efforts from government, cities, businesses and citizens to make deeper cuts. Countries must come back next year with an aim to rapidly implement and strengthen the commitments made here." Niclas H\'c3\Â£4llstr\'c3\'b6m, of What Next Forum, said developed countries needed to commit to cutting emissions "close to 100 percent by 2030 for a reasonable chance of 2\'c2\'b0C". Friends of the Earth said the deal was too weak and had come too late, while Teresa Anderson, of ActionAid International, said it had failed to deliver the rules and tools to keep climate change from spiralling out of control. Countries lacking the money to invest in green economies would be left behind. "The deal won't help farmers in developing countries whose crops are failing as a result of climate impacts. There is no certainty about finance, no real means to ensure that loss and damage will be dealt with." Jeffrey Sachs, of Columbia University, said the deal pointed the world in the right direction, but did not ensure implementation... "Which necessarily remains the domain of politicians, businessmen, scientists, engineers and civil society." \</doc>

MORE than 1 000 Capetonians took to the streets in soaring heat yesterday as part of the global climate march on the eve of the COP21 climate talks that begin in Paris today. The global initiative by civil society is designed to put pressure on negotiators at the Paris talks to come up with a climate deal that would see nations make deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. Cape Town marchers were togged out in hats and sunglasses in 32\'c2\'baC heat. As they walked through the CBD they chanted "keep the oil in the soil, keep the coal in the hole". Placards called for "100% renewable energy", "less talk, action now" and "#emissions must fall". One boy carried a placard that said "March 4 Veronique" - part of an online initiative, March4Me, where people around the world could march on behalf of those who had planned to do so in Paris, but could no longer do so as the French authorities had banned marches in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks that killed 130 in Paris two weeks ago. His mother, Melissa Pascoe, said she had taken part in the online initiative which paired volunteer marchers around the world with those who could not march in Paris. "I just know her name and that she lives about 4km outside Paris and that she wanted to march." In Paris about 20 000 pairs of shoes - including a pair from Pope Francis - were laid outside the Place de la Republique to symbolise absent marchers. Patrick Dowling, one of the organisers of the city march, said the turnout had been "three or four times" bigger than the climate march last year. Marcher Sibusiso Khuz-wayo said he was marching "because emissions must fall, we must be as environmentally friendly as we can". Liz McDaid said the global marches were like "a wave" that started in the countries to the east and moved to cities around the world as the day wore on. "The thousands marching around the world is a sign that ordinary people are standing up to say we want action now. We're saying it's no good having top government people sitting in air-conditioned rooms talking and talking, and coming out with business-as-usual emissions for the last 21 years. This global action is a sign of hope that something really may happen at COP21 ," McDaid said. The marchers had invited mayor Patricia de Lille, Premier Helen Zille and Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson to receive a petition. As none of the politicians replied, the marchers stood behind cardboard cut-outs of the three and delivered "the ideal response to our petition", Dowling said. The De Lille caricature committed to reducing the city's greenhouse gas emissions from eight tons a person to five by 2014. "Oops, our bad. We will try again!" The Joemat-Pettersson caricature agreed that it was |far better for coal to stay in |the hole, adding: "Solar power to the people!"

THE TWENTY-FIRST Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) takes place in Paris at the end of November till mid-December. This is a historic opportunity for the international community to respond to the challenge of climate change collectively and with a renewed sense of urgency by adopting an agreement with supporting decisions under the convention that will contain legal obligations for all countries to take actions to address climate change. This agreement has to set the world on a trajectory to keep the increase in average global temperature since the start of the industrial era to below 2\'b0C. For South Africa, a fair and ambitious agreement will mark the successful conclusion of a mandate agreed to by consensus at the Durban conference in 2011 to enhance implementation of the existing convention. Having launched the negotiations that will conclude this year, South Africa has a special interest in doing all that it can to ensure the success of the Paris COP and is providing its full support to the incoming French presidency. The Paris Agreement needs to be as ambitious as possible and to address the environmental challenge, while protecting the development space of developing countries. It is in our national interest to have a legal agreement that is fair, strengthens the multilateral rule of law, provides predictability and allows us to respond more effectively to our pressing socio-economic challenges and acute vulnerability to climate change. As the current Chair of the Group of 77 and China and an active member of the Africa Group of Negotiators (AGN) and Brazil, South Africa, India and China (Basic) Group, South Africa also has the special responsibility of advancing the collective and shared interests of developing countries in the negotiations for the Paris Agreement. This necessitates defending the legal rights of developing countries under the convention, including to receive the support they require to make the transition to a low carbon economy and to adapt to the reality of a climate that is already changing and the loss and damage that is associated with this. It is also a fundamental principle of the convention that our actions must be based on equity and differentiation of action and support, given different capacities and national circumstances and different responsibilities for causing climate change. The provision of financial resources, technology transfer and development and capacity building, is central to the Paris Agreement. The reality is that without adequate, predictable and sustainable means of implementation, it will be impossible to reach our agreed temperature target. This is because key mitigation potential is in developing countries, such as South Africa, and these countries are not able to realise this potential on their own. We also have to be guided in Paris by the latest science on climate change. The Fifth Assessment Report of the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that each of the past three decades has been successively warmer than the preceding decades and exceed levels reached at the height of the industrial revolution. The evidence of accelerating global warming and its devastating impacts are clear for all to see. It is in this context of the need to urgently address the global problem of climate change that South Africa has submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the UNFCCC Secretariat well ahead of the Paris|conference. The level of ambition contained in our INDC is an affirmation of the seriousness of our commitment as the government to deal with climate change. The INDC builds on a strong basis of existing national policies and actions, given that as an African and developing country, climate change is not a new issue for us. Our society has long since been forced to adapt to the reality of a changing climate and increasingly frequent extreme weather events that are the result of emissions of greenhouse gases generated over centuries, predominantly by developed countries. The impacts of a changing climate affect nearly every sector of our economic and social development, governance, as well as the delivery of services to our people - from health care to agriculture, to infrastructure and human settlements, to defence, water and sanitation. Effectively managing this challenge requires a national response that builds and sustains social, economic and environmental resilience as well as our emergency response capacity. The South African INDC therefore sets out our national adaptation and mitigation plans and emission reduction targets, and indicates the financial and investment requirements. It is the product of an extensive nationwide public participatory process, within the short time period provided by the UN. Over the past four months the government held a series of provincial conferences, engagements and stakeholder workshops with business, labour, academia, and civil society groupings. The result, in our view, is an INDC that is ambitious, fair and pro-development. It takes into account South Africa's triple challenge of poverty, inequality and unemployment, but yet still represents a progression beyond the voluntary pledge we announced at the Copenhagen COP in 2009. The UNFCCC Secretariat has just released a synthesis report on the aggregate impact of all the INDCs received ahead of Paris, and civil society groups have produced their own independent and impressive scientific analytical works on the INDCs. These studies show that we are not on track to meeting the less than 2\'b0C goal and that there is a serious disparity between the ambitious plans submitted by developing countries and the far less ambitious plans from developed countries. These studies show that for the Paris Agreement to be effective and equitable, it must unlock substantial public finance for mitigation, both to fulfil developed countries' fair share and to help unlock greater ambition in developing countries. Our message ahead of Paris is that climate change is a global problem, requiring a global solution, which can only be effectively addressed multilaterally, under the broad-based legitimacy of the UNFCCC and with all Parties contributing their fair share. \</doc>

Johannesburg City Mayor Parks Tau has declared the first week of Johannesburg's EcoMobility World Festival 2015 a success and has thanked residents who are participating and changing the way they move around the Sandton CBD. We had about 400 cars using our park and ride facilities on Thursday alone and there has been an 8% increase in Gautrain bus and train use, said the Mayor. During the month of October various streets in Sandton have been closed to traffic to encourage people to switch from using their private vehicles to using public transport, walking and cycling. Mayor Tau said the city had received positive feedback from many cyclists who have tested the new cycling infrastructure in Sandton. He encouraged those resident who have not yet participates in the festival to show their commitment to eco mobility. The Mayor was speaking on Friday at the Johannesburg Declaration on EcoMobility in Cities briefing. The declaration draws on the week of talks around eco mobility that was held as part of the month-long festival. The declaration is expected to be taken to the UN Climate Summit ( COP21 ) in December 2015 to convey the message that urban transport is key to addressing climate change. The transport sector is already responsible for 16% of the global greenhouse gas emissions and accounts for 27% of global energy consumption. A relevant and growing share of this comes from transport in urban areas. By 2050, two thirds of the world population will live in cities. Without changing transport policies and patterns, most urban areas will continue to be major drivers of climate change, while pollution and congestion will only increase, said Mayor Tau. He said supporters of the Johannesburg Declaration on EcoMobility in Cities called on all spheres of government to do their part in enabling the transition to low carbon urban transport. Together with Local Governments for Sustainability (ECLEI), we will be lobbying cities and local government organisations to endorse this declaration in the run up to COP21 , he said. Reading parts of the declaration, ECLEI Deputy Secretary General Monika Zimmerman said city leaders had committed to adopting urban mobility policies that replace automobile centred cities with people friendly cities, by increasing the share of walking, cycling, public transport and other forms of shared mobility. Mobility in our cities needs to be integrated, safe, comfortable, equitable, environmentally friendly, low carbon, low cost and effective. The declaration refers to public transport as the backbone for urban mobility and promotes investment in low carbon vehicles. The City of Johannesburg has been a member of ECLEI for 19 years. Gauteng Roads and Transport MEC Ismail Vadi called on other cities and small municipalities in the province to take from Johannesburg city and encourage residents to change their behaviour towards new transport initiatives. \</doc>

President Jacob Zuma has congratulated the delegation representing South Africa at the 21st Conference of Parties ( COP21 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in France following the adoption of the new Paris Agreement on climate change. Late on Saturday evening, the UNFCCC adopted the historic agreement to address greenhouse gas emissions for the post-2020 period, while increasing countries' ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change during the next session. Parties pledged to curb emissions, strengthen resilience and take common climate action, following two weeks of tireless negotiations. The Paris Agreement and the outcomes of COP21 cover all the crucial areas identified as essential for a landmark conclusion: mitigation - reducing emissions fast enough to achieve the temperature goal; a transparency system and global stock-take - accounting for climate action; adaptation - strengthening ability of countries to deal with climate impacts; loss and damage - strengthening ability to recover from climate impacts; and support - including finance, for nations to build clean, resilient futures. This would not have been possible if South Africa had not delivered the outcomes it did as President of COP17/CMP7, held in Durban in 2011. The success in Paris is the culmination of the watershed Durban Climate Change Conference in 2011 where Parties to the Convention agreed to the mandate for the Paris Agreement. We congratulate South Africans for this contribution to finding solutions to a global challenge. We also thank the United Nations for the opportunity provided to us to play this role, said the President on Sunday. The group is comprised of a diverse group of countries, but united by the goal to protect their vulnerable and poor. Under South Africa's leadership, the Group of G77 plus China was more united than ever before in the history of the climate change negotiations and South Africa managed to rally this group of developing countries, which made a decisive difference in building the political will that was required to reach agreement on this important issue, said President Zuma. He added that climate change poses a grave threat to developing countries' ability to ensure that their people are lifted out of poverty. It has therefore been a great honour for South Africa to play such a key role at both the beginning and at the end of the process through which the international community worked toward reaching this historic solution. The agreement presents a big step forward in committing all countries to act decisively against climate change. Through this agreement, hope has been restored for a safe and prosperous future, where climate change will be adequately addressed. The South African team was led by Minister of Environmental Affairs Edna Molewa, who was supported by Minister of Transport Dipuo Peters, Minister of Water and Sanitation Nomvula Mokonyane and Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Senzeni Zokwana, as well as Ambassador Nozipho Mxakatho Diseko from the Department of International Relations and Cooperation and other senior officials. \</doc>

As thousands of Africans arrive in Europe every month, often risking their lives aboard shaky boats to get to a better life, lack of access to energy could be one of the reasons for their exodus. Africa's poverty challenges are well documented. In recent years there has been much discourse around how climate change worsens these challenges and could reverse the continent's economic fortunes. Lack of access to energy, for example has been mentioned here at COP 21 as one of the reasons why Africa's young people leave the continent in search of opportunities, mostly in Europe. While the International Organisation for Migration outlines that the linkages between human mobility and climate impacts are highly complex, it is critical to point out that, in most situations, people choose or are forced to migrate due to a number of factors and climate change could be the primary one or the key to many secondary factors. Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank agrees with this reasoning by highlighting lack of electricity in Africa as a reason for young Africans' mass movement to Europe. "Droughts all across Africa, the Sahel is burning, Lake Chad is dried-up, livelihoods are devastated, young people across Africa are jumping on boats, jumping to go to Europe because there are no economic opportunities," Dr. Adesina told IPS at the COP 21 talks in Paris, France. He says Africa's lack of access to electricity is stopping the continent's industrialization, costing Africa up to 4 per cent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). "Africa has no electricity. And therefore, industrialization is not happening, the small and medium enterprises are not functioning at their full capacity. As a result, Africa today loses 3 to 4 per cent of its GDP for lack of electricity," he said. Linking his argument to migration, the AfDB President believes lighting-up Africa could transform the continent's economic fortunes thereby according young people massive opportunities within their own countries. "So by lighting up and powering Africa, our young people will be staying on the continent because they can use electricity to do many things. Nobody works in the dark and succeeds, you walk in the dark you always stumble, you fall, that's why we must light up and power Africa," he said of the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative which was launched at the COP 21 talks, targeting 10 gigawatts in the next five years and 300 gigawatts by 2030. This massive initiative dubbed Africa's commitment to an ambitious outcome of the COP 21 climate deal will require billions of dollars to materialize. Juxtaposing Europe's migrant crisis that is set to cost as much as 5 billion dollars, and the cost of climate financing for Africa, there could be an opportunity for longer term investment in Europe addressing the migrant problem at its source. Niclas H\'e4llstr\'f6m, Director of What Next, a Swedish think-tank, says the renewable energy initiative provides an opportunity for Europe to make serious investments in its own interest. "It is a moral imperative for developed countries to support Africa's climate adaptation, but it is also in their interest. "Take the newly launched Africa Renewable Energy Initiative. This bold effort by African countries is set to reach universal access for all Africans by latest 2030... It requires billions of dollars in climate finance, but will create jobs and enhanced well-being for people across the whole continent. Apart from the need to handle the refugee situations acutely, this is the best longer-term action one can think of," said H\'e4llstr\'f6m. Climate finance has remained a sticking point in the climate negotiations for years. With few days to go before the end of COP 21 , the trend has not changed much. Dan Bodansky, Foundation Professor of Law and Faculty, Co-Director of the Center for Law and Global Affairs at the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law at Arizona State University, shares insights on day 8 of the negotiations. "Of the 'crunch issues,' finance is the most difficult... unlike the other issues, it may not be possible to paper over through artful wording, although the use of terms like "should" and "strive" may provide a middle ground," he said, pointing out that the negotiating text that emerged from the ADP over the weekend still has many other brackets and options. As negotiations enter the final frenzy hours with the text expected on Day 9, the African Group of Negotiators and other key stakeholders' anxiety is reaching tipping points. "The present reality at the conference confirms that countries have spent the first week restating their old positions leaving most of the key debates unresolved," said Sam Ogallah of the Pan-African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), calling on Ministers to urgently inject energy into the process for a fair deal that would reflect the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibility-CBDR and addresses the issues of loss and damage, finance for adaptation and mitigation and keeping the global warming well below 1.5 Celsius. In adding impetus to the climate change and migration nexus, a report released by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) at the COP 21 Talks, accuses world's top media of failing to identify climate change as a contributor to some of the world's biggest crises, including migration, food insecurity and conflict. IFAD President, Kanayo Nwanze, said "If the world becomes aware of how climate change threatens our food security or why it is a catalyst for migration and conflict, then we can expect better support for policies and investments that can pre-empt future crises." Will developed countries at COP 21 recognise this argument? The world will know in a matter of hours. (End) \</doc>

TOP South African scientist Dr Bob Scholes says unless we manage the problem of climate change, it will probably be the end of civilisation as we know it. Scholes, who last week launched his book Climate Change: Briefings from Southern Africa, co-authored with Mary Scholes and Mike Lucas, said |at the launch if global greenhouse gas emissions were left unchecked and the average global temperature rose by 6\'c2\'baC by the end of the century, it would not be the "end of the planet", which would survive this climate change as it had done in the past. "It will probably not even be the end of Homo sapiens - although there is a question mark about that. But unless we manage the problem properly, it will probably be the end of civilisation as we know it... By the time people realise this is a big problem, it will be a huge problem. So we need to do things to deal with it now, before 2050, while we still can." Scholes, a professor of systems ecology at Wits, a lead author of several of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) assessments, is among the top 1 percent of environmental scientists worldwide based on citation frequency. One of the points he stressed was that although the earth's climate had seen big changes in the remote past, our civilisation had developed during the Holocene, a time of a remarkably stable climate. From the time of the agricultural revolution 10 000 years ago to our modern society and economy today, there had been no major shifts in climate. The agriculture that we had developed, the food we produced, had all evolved within this period of stable climate. Now this was changing and the speed at which the |climate was changing was something new. "We know with complete certainty that the principle driver of climate change is human action. We know that it is not a good idea, and we know the things we can do about it - without huge economic sacrifice - to bend the curve to keep away from dangerous climate change." This could be done at a cost of less than 0.5 percent of global GDP. "What is missing is a global political will to solve it. It requires everyone, from government and the private sector." Scholes said that was what should be happening for the next two weeks at the global climate talks at COP21 in Paris, which began on Monday. He believes there has been a "seismic shift" among many people regarding climate change and the pressing need to cut emissions. Many had realised that the world was facing crunch-time and if we did not make changes no we would not be able to do |so later. However, the voluntary cuts in greenhouse gas emissions that countries had put on the table for COP21 Coupled with this were the rapid technological developments, and decrease in costs, of renewable energy, the shift among many businesses that they had to reduce carbon and the emergence of faith leaders - like the Pope - saying "you've got to get serious guys".

If business as usual continues, the world will warm by an average of up to 6\'c2\'b0C this century, according to the United Nations' climate unit. In a report released last year, it said this change would be "severe, pervasive and irreversible" and lead to the large-scale collapse of ecosystems. It placed the blame for this squarely on the burning of fossil fuels by humans, or anthropogenic global warming.To avoid this, world governments have been gathering for the last 21 years in an attempt to create an agreement that would force every country to lower their carbon emissions. Most of these emissions come from coal-fired power stations, heavy industry and from chopping down large swathes of natural forests.No global agreement has been signed to date. But an agreement should be signed this year, when countries meet at COP21 in Paris. Thanks to work done at COP17 in Durban, the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action says an agreement must be signed in 2015 and come into force in 2020. At the heart of this process is the symbolic target of lowering carbon emissions enough that average global temperatures do not increase by more than 2\'c2\'b0C. In South Africa temperatures have already increased by 0.8\'c2\'b0C, which has shifted rainfall patterns and led to unpredictable rain and drought cycles. COP20 in Lima in 2014 agreed that before COP21 , each country would submit its plan for lowering carbon emissions and adapting to climate change, known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. But on Monday a report by the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment found that if every government implemented the plans it had in place, there would only be a 75% reduction in the emissions required to keep temperature increases below 2\'c2\'b0C.It said, "While collectively these pledges are unlikely to be consistent with the international goal of avoiding global warming of more than 2\'c2\'b0C, the existence of national legislation and policies should provide the opportunity for countries to strengthen the ambition of their emission cuts." Christina Figueres, the executive secretary of the UN Framework Con\'c2\Â£dvention on Climate Change, said last month that 37 countries had submitted their plans and it seemed likely that these would not be ambitious enough to keep temperature increases below 2\'c2\'b0C. South Africa will submit its intended contribution later in the year. But it has already committed to lower its carbon emissions by 42% by 2025 - provided there is technical and financial assistance from developed countries. Several other large polluters have agreed to voluntary reductions. In November the United States and China - two countries traditionally loathe to sign agreements on climate change - announced that they would both lower their greenhouse gas emissions. The US said it would lower its emissions by 28% by 2025, with China capping its emissions by 2030. China's transformationA report released by the London School of Economics on Monday said China would probably meet this goal five years ahead of schedule. The authors said this would stimulate the global market for renewable technology - with the world's largest polluter shifting towards a renewable economy - and dampen the market for fossil fuels. "China's transformation has profound implications for the global economy, and greatly increases the prospects for keeping global greenhouse gas emissions within relatively safe limits," the report said. And it was in this atmosphere that the G7 gathering in the Bavarian Alps released a statement saying, "Urgent and concrete action is needed to address climate change." Under the heading of "climate change, energy and environment", the grouping of the world's seven largest economies said there needed to be a 40% to 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. After that, world economies should aim to be completely free of fossil fuels by the end of the century, the statement said. "This should enable all countries to follow a low-carbon and resilient development pathway in line with the global goal to hold the increase in global average temperature below 2\'c2\'b0C." The announcement is significant as it includes Canada and Japan, two countries which have recently worked against any global agreement to lower carbon emissions. The text also called on all countries to submit ambitious Intended Nationally Determined Contributions well before COP21 in November. To help developing countries lower their emissions and adapt to climate change, the statement said the G7 "reaffirms our strong commitment to the Copenhagen Accord to mobilize jointly $100-billion a year from 2020". These funds would then go to developing countries through the Green Climate Fund, which will start operating later this year. The draft text for the Paris agreement still runs to 86 pages, with thousands of square brackets (indicating disagreement) and dozens of options for how strong the agreement should be. The scope of its ambition depends on political compromise at the November meeting. But it now has the momentum behind the process to ensure an agreement will be signed. \</doc>

PARIS: The "Paris Agreement", adopted in a plenary session at the COP21 climate talks on Saturday, represents the first time the world has united on a deal to combat climate change and its effects. As French Foreign Minister - and COP21 President - Laurent Fabius pounded the gavel, signifying its adoption, the |plenary halls at Le Bourget erupted with unmitigated joy. Hundreds of delegates from 195 countries, including UN climate chief Christiana Figueres and Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, cheered, embracing and wiping away tears. The atmosphere was one of relief, and near disbelief. It had been a long road to Paris. Addressing an earlier plenary to introduce the text, Fabius quoted Nelson Mandela, saying "It always seems impossible until it's done." Indeed, the accord contains a number of elements that, two weeks ago, observers might have described as improbably ambitious. The Paris Agreement aims to limit global warming to "well below" 2\'c2\'baC, with a promise of "efforts" to try to keep it below 1.5\'c2\'baC; a much tougher ambition than what was agreed to six years ago. It includes a five-yearly global "stocktake" of how countries are doing with their climate plans, with the first set to happen in 2023. There is also a request for countries to revisit their voluntary domestic plans for emissions cuts in 2018, before they come into effect after 2020. The accord also specifically mentions "loss and damage", a reference to the devastation wrought by climate change, despite attempts to adapt to its impacts, and speaks of support for the countries who will suffer. But it "does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation" - a red line for the US. The final version of the text was released with no square brackets - or options - remaining. Compiled by Fabius's office, it was an attempt at creating consensus between all 195 parties. Addressing delegates, French President Francois Hollande pleaded for them to be unselfish when they read the draft agreement, considering the planet and not their own country agendas. "On 12 December, 2015 we can have a historic day, a major date to go down in the history of mankind," he said. "The date can become a message of life. I will be delighted, relieved, proud, that it be launched from Paris, because Paris was attacked almost exactly a month ago." There were mixed reactions from civil society. Large observer NGOs, many of whom have been very involved in the multilateral negotiation process, overwhelmingly welcomed much of the document, going as far as to describe it as "the end of the era of fossil fuels", but alliances of climate justice activists from developing nations condemned it, saying they needed more concrete details of how it would help the most vulnerable. South Africa has been vocal in support of the draft text - and has played an enormous role in the process. Given the floor immediately after the accord was adopted, Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa spoke, too, of Mandela. "I have walked that long road to freedom..." she quoted, "...I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb... but I can only rest for a moment, for with freedom come responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not ended." South African senior negotiator Alf Wills - himself a veteran of 11 COPs - told ANA, "This is where the hard work begins." \</doc>

After months of wrangling the all-important eThekwini regional elective conference sat amid simmering tensions at the Moses Mabhida stadium yesterday. The contest saw mayor James Nxumalo, who did not attend the conference, lock horns with councillor Zandile Gumede for the position of regional chair. Nxumalo was attending the COP21 conference in Paris. Disgruntled party members aligned to Nxumalo first lodged an urgent court interdict to stop the conference from going ahead, citing a string of irregularities. However, the interdict was dismissed in the Durban High Court, with costs. In retaliation, the members snubbed the conference and convened their own meeting in Bolton Hall in Magwaza Maphalala (Gale) street, where they planned to disrupt the conference. Police dispersed them with stun grenades. What was poised to be a heated elective conference was reduced to a "one horse race" after some of Nxumalo's supporters boycotted it. Irate Nxumalo supporters also called for the nullification of the provincial conference which sat last month. They claimed that the conference, which saw former provincial secretary Sihle Zikalala unseat premier Senzo Mchunu as chairman, was riddled with errors. They alleged that the delegate nomination process in some branches was manipulated to favour of Gumede. \</doc>

I think it was Helen Keller who said "keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see a shadow". That is precisely what I decided to do on my return from COP 21 in Paris this week, when I was confronted by that rating-downgrade-inducing announcement from the Union Buildings. It was me being energy-efficient instead of joining the chorus of condemnation. I had just met hundreds of energy efficiency buffs at the climate change summit, so I was not about to burn a lot of fuel on spilt milk, electing to leave the haggling to those more adept at making people fall with a mere hashtag. It is my interaction with these experts that made me realise that South Africa could do a lot more. At COP 21 I met, among others, the President of Iceland - the enthusiastic \'c3 lafur Ragnar Gr\'c3\Â£dmsson. This is a man in his fifth term as head of state, because the country's constitution does not restrict the number of times one can be president as long as they are popular. That is a far cry from what former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene will ever know and get to experience, but what's with the digression? President Gr\'c3\Â£dmsson was not at Le Bourget to talk about constitutional matters. He was a guest on a panel discussion because his country gets almost 100 percent of its energy from renewables, including geothermal. This is another clean energy source, which merely taps into the heat that is trapped underground. He spoke so convincingly about it, even estimating that with the amount of heat under the surface of the earth the world could generate electricity for 10 000 years. Each time I heard of such advancement I wondered where South Africa fitted in. Although at the summit South Africa was very ably represented by the award-winning City of Joburg among others, receiving an award for the world's first listing of a municipal green bond, I was curious to know if we were to reap anything concrete from COP 21 . Rwanda took only 12 months from the official signing of the Power Purchase Agreement with a developer called Gigawatt Global to conclude everything, raise capital, build and connect to the grid - all of the $23.7-million (R377m) solar energy plant in one short year. Besides, I got nervous when I saw 2019 as the earliest possible interconnection date because, who knows where Minister Joematt-Pettersson will be next week? I am just saying. If the most seasoned of analysts confessed that they did not see the dropping of the Treasury pilot coming, who am I to hold my breath that she will last long enough to cut the ribbon at the launch of these solar energy projects? She will probably have long vanished in the quicksand of South African politics. Meanwhile, as I listened to the announcements about renewable energy by countries much smaller than my own, I became green with envy. I was like a kid from a poor family eating pap and potatoes on Christmas Day, while their more affluent neighbours are hacking a scrumptious turkey in the midst of a seven-course feast. Except my country is not poor. Yet I live for the day when we will convert our abundant solar, geo-thermal, wind, biomass potential into real energy and stop announcing tentative load-shedding schedules. I must actually not jinx the power situation because we have not had power outages for quite some time now. By the way, on the subject of looking on the bright side, I am told that the new Finance Minister - David Douglas Des van Rooyen (not the bogus Twitter prankster called @daviddvanrooyen) - is pro-local government. Some of the local government officials I met at COP 21 expressed frustration that there are many restrictions from national government on their discretion on how to source electricity - making it difficult to innovate. Perhaps, if anything, Minister Van Rooyen will listen to the fired-up mayors when they all return from COP 21 to plan a greener and more sustainable energy mix for local government. There is a teeny-weeny-itsy-bitsy proviso, though: he had better last long enough to even sort out his Twitter account, let alone talk to the mayors about green energy. I used to hear that a week's a long time in politics. What an understatement of sinful proportions. n Kgomoeswana is author of Africa is Open for Business and anchor of Power Hour, broadcast from Monday to Thursday, on Power FM.

All delegates also acknowledged the success of the South African renewable energy initiative. In |the space of only five years, the department's Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer (IPP) Procurement Programme has contributed 4 294GWh to the national grid. Total payment to IPPs stands at R9.2 billion and the initiative has also saved 4.4 million tons of |carbon dioxide. South African National Energy Development Institute chief executive Kadri Nassiep said the declaration came about after consultation with delegates. "We want to take a positive message forward. In the course of COP21 we will take our place with other countries in an effort to come to an equitable resolution to the problem of not having a global treaty in place," he said.

GLOBAL organisation Avaaz took over East London on November 29, as part of the launch of the biggest climate change mobilisation in history. The group called for action against climate change, making a personal statement by wearing green or painting their faces with green hearts, carrying banners and posters and marching from Nahoon River to the Lifesavers' Hut. This was done in order to help influence the ordinary individual to commit themselves to this as well. The objective of the day was to call for action on climate change from world leaders attending the COP21 The leaders are meeting to negotiating the next global climate deal at the conference. The focus is on achieving an agreement on a climate that would strive to see global warming below 2\'b0C. A beach clean-up followed after the march as part of the locals' initiative to "Save Nahoon". The march, which took place worldwide, made history as the biggest climate march in history. \</doc>

WITH COP21 under way in Paris, a new survey has revealed that students from the UCT Graduate School of Business (GSB) and other top-ranking business schools across the world are demanding that business must lead on solutions to climate change and sustainability to attract and retain talent. The study was conducted by Yale University in collaboration with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the Global Network for Advanced Management, and includes more than 3 700 students at 29 business schools - including the UCT Graduate School of Business. GSB's director, Professor Walter Baets, said business schools can play an important role in driving business solutions for social and environmental issues. "Business schools are shaping the minds and the thinking of future business leaders and are ideally placed to direct new thinking around climate change, sustainability and corporate|responsibility." The study found that corporations unwilling to act on environmental issues are increasingly punished by the men and women they would like to recruit. Forty-four percent of business students reported that they would be willing to accept a lower salary to work for a company with better environmental practices. Conversely, about one-fifth of respondents expressed an unwillingness to work for companies with bad environmental practices no matter what the salary. Students also overwhelmingly consider environmental action a profitable stance, noting that environmental protection will improve economic growth and provide new jobs. "We often talk about transformational change to our society when talking about climate action. And that transformation will affect both business as well as the institutions that educate the leaders in business," said Peter Bakker, president and chief executive of the WBCSD. "The role of business in society is changing. Business leaders need to understand the complex nature of sustainability issues and integrate solutions for social and environmental challenges, with the need for good financial results. The summary of survey results brings a clear call for change, demanding action on environmental sustainability. If business schools and business can deliver against this call for change, the necessary transformation toward a sustainable future will clearly be much more impactful." The study shows that the next generation of leaders expect business leaders, and in particular the C-Suite, to prioritise and responsibly lead in the search for environmental sustainability solutions, and they are willing to assume leadership roles themselves. More than two-thirds of participants said that they want to incorporate environmental sustainability into whatever job they end up in, regardless of their role or industry. All else being equal, 84 percent of students would choose to work for a company with good environmental practices. While voicing a need for future employers to act on the environment, business students also demand action from the schools they attend; students want a more thorough integration of environmental issues into the core operations and curricula of business schools. A total of 61 percent of|survey respondents thought that business schools need to hire more faculty and staff with expertise in sustainability; 64 percent want more career services and counselling on sustainability-related jobs. "These results highlight the rising priority of addressing climate change among future leaders," Baets said. "The study is especially important in our emerging market context where business has a key role to play in addressing the continent's biggest challenges. Aside from being an ethical and moral imperative, this study shows that it is also going to become the new frontier for the recruitment of top talent."

Honing climate policy for Paris SA contributions document is in the making, writes SINCE the Lima negotiations last year, when countries were asked to communicate their intended nationally determined contributions ahead of the COP21 meeting in Paris later this year, 29 countries have submitted theirs to the United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Department of Environmental Affairs has prepared SA's proposed contributions and it is undergoing a stakeholder consultation process before the document is sent to the Cabinet for approval. Several civil society organisations and groupings are preparing responses. SA's contributions document is framed by the National Development Plan and the National Climate Change Response, and states an intention to develop a national climate-change adaptation strategy. The unwillingness of some developed countries to commit to mitigation targets unless less developed countries also do so led to a stalemate in previous negotiations. This was broken at COP17 in Durban in 2011 when the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action was established. The platform commits parties to negotiating a new global agreement that includes all countries and covers mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology transfer, capacity building and transparency, with a deadline of COP21 , which is scheduled for December in Paris. Uncertainty about the legal form of the new agreement, as well as reluctance from many countries to make binding commitments, resulted in agreement that all countries would submit contributions. Countries were asked to communicate their contribution documents to the UN framework convention in advance of COP21 . THE document outlines the country's investment in adaptation to date, and the investment it requires from 2021 to 2030. From 2010 to this year, investment in national adaptation has increased from $640m to $2.31bn. The intention is to scale up a number of programmes beyond 2020 as part of the country's adaptation efforts, including Working for Water, Working on Fire, Working on Wetlands, LandCare and Water Conservation and Water Demand Management. Under mitigation, SA's contributions document refers to the peak, plateau and decline emissions trajectory committed to in its national policy, with emissions contained within a range of 398 tonnes to 613 tonnes of CO\'b2-equivalent by 2025 and 2030. The contributions document shows the country's investments in mitigation to include 79 independent renewable energy projects with more than 5,000MW capacity - with a contribution from private investment of R168bn. Public transport infrastructure received a R5bn boost in 2012, and investments have also been made in green economy initiatives. SA states that its & aspirational& long-term goal is to bring total emissions to within the range of 212-428 tonnes CO\'b2-equivalent by 2050, reserving the right to adjust this goal depending on factors such as other countries' actions, socioeconomic implications, technologies, and outcomes of the new climate agreement. It also claims that, according to a carbon budget produced by South African experts, its mitigation contribution is greater than its fair share, as determined by using principles of responsibility, capability and sustainable development. However, it acknowledges that other researchers have produced different results, and expresses willingness to engage further on ambition and fairness, & if others do so as well& The contributions document is & premised on the finalisation of an ambitious, fair, effective and binding multilateral agreement& in Paris, & to enable the delivery of ambitious mitigation, adaptation, climate finance, technology, capacity building and effective transparency arrangements& SA requires support for adaptation and mitigation in the form of finance, technology and capacity-building. A civil society caucus, facilitated by Project 90 by 2030, has developed a set of benchmarks against which the quality, appropriateness and adequacy of the contributions document will be assessed. THE caucus requests that SA clarifies the link between its contributions document and the new climate agreement - as yet, there is no agreement on whether the new agreement or the contributions that countries commit to will be legally binding. Contributors to the civil society submission include the South African Climate Action Network, World Wide Fund, Adaptation Network Secretariat, and Alternative Information and Development Centre. Under adaptation, the submission calls for adaptation programming to support mainstreaming of climate change concerns into all aspects of development; to enhance existing development programming as a way of reducing vulnerability to climate change; to support investments in long-term local and national planning; to be supported by viable costing and resourcing; and to be oriented towards building local knowledge and capacity in adaptation. It also requests that adaptation should not be premised on short-term project-based efforts and employment, and that it should favour labour-intensive initiatives over economic efficiency. The caucus rejects genetically modified organisms, extended commercial agriculture, desalination and large dams as adaptation solutions. It calls for increased transparency in the disbursement of adaptation funds. THE caucus calls on SA to provide a clear signal of commitment to containing global warming to 1.5\'b0C - consistent with a fair share of the science global emissions trajectory; present a clear carbon budget with a mitigation target linked to a specific base year rather than an uncertain business-as-usual trajectory; and outline its potential financial trajectory to support greater efforts towards a low-carbon economy. Fracking, carbon capture and storage, and nuclear power are rejected as mitigation options. The caucus also calls for SA to express its intention to participate in a global reform of fossil fuel subsidies. A number of submissions from other civil society organisations are also being prepared, and the stakeholder engagement meetings are open to all interested parties. The full documents should be read for a comprehensive understanding of the positions they present. & 8226;Dada is a member of the Adaptation Network Secretariat.

ANTON Bredell, the MEC of Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning, said an ongoing battle for his|department was creating economic growth to get people out of poverty while at the same time lessening the country's carbon footprint. Bredell was delivering the keynote address at a gathering in Woodstock yesterday to discuss South Africa's official position which will be adopted at the UN climate change talks, known as COP21 , in Paris in December. The meeting was also attended by representatives from the national government and|local and international NGOs. In December, all nations will present their greenhouse gas emissions reduction and|climate change adaptation needs. During his speech, Bredell questioned whether all the UN climate change talks over the years had really made a difference. "Or are we bigger contributors to green house gas emissions by arranging all of these COPs and not coming out with|solutions we can implement?" "How much of our luxury lifestyle are we willing to offer so that future generations can also have a good healthy environment to live in? "What we know is that food security, water and energy is going to be|crucial for a successful future. "Climate change will impact on all of that." Bredell said despite all the hard work being done across the country, more needs to happen especially at local municipal level. \</doc>

Agriculture not hot enough topic for climate talks Sector will be overlooked in Paris, writes WITH the Conference of Parties 21 ( COP21 ) climate change talks under way in Paris, the draft text for a new legally binding climate agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol has been published. Despite being the most climate sensitive sector, agriculture is once again being overlooked in this agreement that will guide a global response to climate change. While many of the clauses are still open to further negotiation during the talks, which began yesterday in Paris and continue until Friday next week, the battle lines are already drawn as the farming community feels agriculture risks being locked out of the global agreement. Farmers and other stakeholders in agriculture insist that the vulnerabilities of farmers, the dire consequences on food security and livelihoods, and the urgency of the necessary response by the sector need to be fully acknowledged and attended to more directly and decisively at the highest level. Without this overarching framework that broadly defines the scope of action on agriculture, the protracted technical negotiations under way within the subsidiary body for scientific and technological advice of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are unlikely to be mainstreamed into the binding decisions of the convention. After notable progress at COP17 in Durban in 2011 - which saw agriculture getting onto the climate agenda for the first time - the lack of attention to agriculture in the draft agreement is a worrying regression. Since Durban, agriculture-related issues have received attention within the subsidiary body for scientific and technological advice. These technical deliberations are now likely to continue beyond next year. Both the pace and scope of these negotiations have been a cause for much discomfort among farmers. Even more worrying is the lack of clarity on how these technical elements will be adopted into the binding agreement of the convention. Some sceptics have described the agriculture-related negotiations as a diversionary side show meant to keep agriculture on a parallel track with no defined mechanism for integration within the climate agreement. By not offering high-level commitment to support necessary actions in agriculture, the draft agreement misses an opportunity to dissipate the fears. Although the draft agreement emphasises the need to align actions with the goal of promoting food security, it stops short of committing to take action to protect agriculture, and the millions of households who depend on it for a livelihood, from the devastating effects of climate change. Without a spirited push by farmers and their allies in Paris to put agriculture back on the agenda, the climate deal will most certainly sideline the world's food producers. Equally concerning is the scope of the draft agreement, which is quite limited. Much of the detail focuses on setting up institutional and implementation modalities. One would have expected the content to set broad guidelines for tackling contentious issues within the convention. An example is the perception of bias towards mitigation at the expense of adaptation, which is the priority for most developing nations. Failure sufficiently to outline such crucial aspects of the convention leaves the door open for even more protracted negotiations in the future. The generally noncommittal tone of the draft agreement is another red flag. Many crucial aspects, such as financial commitments by developed nations come across as optional, littered with escape clauses such as & parties in a position to do so ...& or & parties should strive to ...& setting the stage for a potentially bruising confrontation in Paris. During COP21 WE NEED a sense of urgency at COP21 . The view that nothing else can be discussed until after the planned workshops needs to be challenged. While there are continuing workshops focusing on technical issues, many structural and implementation-related modalities specific to agriculture remain untouched. For instance, transparent negotiations and forward-thinking about how outcomes from the subsidiary body for scientific and technological advice processes will be integrated into the legally binding climate agreement need to start now. So far, there is no discussion on a financial mechanism that works for agriculture. The assumption that financial support from the Green Climate Fund (or other financial mechanisms of the convention) should somehow find its way to farmers and others who need the support is dangerous and insincere. It is well-known that the bulk of those resources will be channelled through government systems - the same governments who have a history of failing farmers, particularly in Africa. More than a decade later, the much-publicised rhetoric by African governments in the Maputo Declaration to increase budgetary support for agriculture remains just that; good intentions with precious little on the ground. The same can be said about bilateral and multilateral development assistance programmes that will also manage climate finance resources. Isolated & success stories& are all the development sector has to show for decades of funding, far from the stated objective of a systematic transformation of African agriculture. These two mechanisms have failed African farmers for too long; trusting them to deliver climate finance to farmers is wishful thinking. Without innovation and tight ring-fencing, transparent reporting and tracking of financial resources flows to farmers, climate finance will never reach those who need it most to support their adaptation efforts. Extension support for farmers in Africa, is largely in a state of collapse. The question remains how all the promising ideas and technologies on adaptation to climate change will be rolled out to farmers at the scale and pace required to overcome the climate challenge. Assuming that these issues are being dealt with elsewhere by someone else is not only dishonest, but also irresponsible. The subsidiary body for scientific and technological advice needs to harness all the resources at its disposal to ignite a rethink on how technology transfer and capacity issues for farmers will be dealt with. After many decades of failure, the urgency of the need for climate change adaptation should be a wake-up call to revisit these issues. Agriculture in the developing world, particularly in Africa, has unique and persistent challenges that should not be forgotten. Success in tackling these long-standing issues will be the difference between whether Africa wins or loses the climate challenge. & 8226;Mutamba is an analyst for economics and policy at the Southern African Confederation of Agricultural Unions. The draft agreement ... stops short of committing to take action to protect agriculture, and the millions of households who depend on it, from the devastating effects of climate change Farmers and other stakeholders in agriculture insist the dire consequences on food security and livelihoods need to be tackled more decisively at the highest level.

The world will be up to an average of 5\'c2\'b0C warmer by the end of this century. Science says this will utterly change the world and the environment that human beings rely on to live. Numerous reports on that change paint a dystopian future, where humans are constantly assaulted by floods, droughts, crop failures and myriad other ecosystem failures. In the last month several reports have tried to look at the impacts that this change will have on human health. These all point to a world where the diseases are exacerbated in both impact and the resultant death toll. Most affected will be children. Emergency response requiredThe Lancet commission on health and climate change had similar warnings in its findings, published late last month. It looked at current deaths from global warming - such as record-breaking heatwaves in Europe killing tens of thousands of people - and flooding from hurricanes hitting higher ground thanks to increased sea levels. Professor Hugh Montgomery, the commission's co-chair, said at the launch, "Climate change is a medical emergency." This required the same kind of response that was traditionally reserved for short-term emergencies, using all the technologies available now to lower carbon emissions and adapt to the change, she said. That technology could avert serious health disaster in the future, the commission found. By cutting carbon emissions within the next few decades, it said premature deaths from air pollution could be cut by 500 000 a year by 2030. Two-million deaths could also be saved each year by 2100. Last year the World Health Organisation said that one in eight premature deaths each year are due to a combination of indoor and outdoor air pollution. This equates to seven-million deaths a year, it said. In another report, it calculated that 88% of the years of life lost as a result of climate change - through ill-health, disability or early death - fell on children in developing countries. The causes of death ranged from malaria, malnutrition, diarrhoea and inland flooding, it said. "Climate change opposes the health gains achieved by social development, and may hold back progress in the poorest countries." Children to be most affected No Time For Games, a report by Australian-based Doctors for the Environment, said that climate change poses a significant and growing threat to public health. But it would be those who did little to cause the change who would be the most affected: "It is our children who, despite being the least responsible for causing it, unfairly bear the brunt of the impact." Children were already vulnerable to failings of the economy, society and ecosystems, the report said. "Children are more liable to succumb to bacterial or viral food and waterborne infections." This was due to their consuming more liquids, placing contaminated objects in their mouths, and their higher metabolic and breathing rate, it said. Diarrhoea is the second-leading cause of death for children under the age of five, according to the World Health Organisation. Around 750 000 children a year die from this alone, and the WHO predicted that this number would only increase thanks to a changing climate. The reports also point to the less physical impacts of disaster. In 2001 the World Health Organisation warned of the psychological dangers of climate change exacerbated disasters. It said that up to half of all people exposed to natural disasters develop mental diseases. These range from depression or anxiety, to post-traumatic stress disorder. Irreversible climate change In its five-yearly report on climate change report, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said last year that the world would be up to an average of five degrees warmer this century. This change would be "irreversible" and would completely change life on earth, it warned. Until 2050 the majority of climate change health impacts would be felt through the exacerbation of existing problems, it found. This ranges from more conditions such as asthma to heatstroke. Beyond 2050 temperature increases would substantially change life, it said. Temperatures would be so high that the human body would be unable to handle the heat. This would mean unprotected outdoor labour -- as well as recreation -- will be impossible, it warned. South Africa's main climate change research and planning -- the Long-Term Adaptation Scenarios -- warn that the interior of the country will be up to 6\'c2\'b0C warmer by the end of this century. Coastal regions will warm by half that, but will have to deal with increasing sea levels. The impacts of this change will be numerous and profound, the scenarios warn. Communicable diseases (TB, cholera and HIV/Aids) and noncommunicable diseases (respiratory and cardiovascular) would be the most keenly-felt. But there would be myriad other health problems -- from mental and occupational health stresses to heat stress and malaria. These would be put on top of existing stresses, such as low crop yields and water scarcity to create an environment in which people struggled to survive, the scenarios warn. Solutions Every single research group concluded that these potential health disasters could be avoided by lowering carbon emissions. Before the Industrial Revolution kicked off, carbon emissions in the atmosphere were at a level of 250 parts per million. This year they reached an average of 400 parts per million. At this rate, the UN warns that average temperatures will increase by up to 5\'c2\'b0C this century. To avoid this, world governments are holding global climate negotiations in Paris in November - at COP 21 - in order to reach some sort of an agreement to lower carbon emissions. By cutting emissions by up to 80% by the middle of the century, negotiators have said temperature increases could be kept below 2\'c2\'b0C. But the consensus on COP21 seems to be that an agreement will be signed, but without the ambition required to lower carbon emission to a level that would keep the world below such a temperature increase. \</doc>

PARIS: The French government and nine other partners have renewed their commitment to injecting a cumulative US$10 billion (R145 billion) between 2015 and 2020 to boost access to energy in Africa. Canada, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US, Sweden, the Netherlands and the EU will jointly provide the money which will help developing countries adapt to global warming and build renewable energy sources. The announcement was made during the ongoing climate talks at COP21 , the 21st Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Africa Renewable Energy Initiative aims to achieve at least 10GW of new and |additional renewable energy generation capacity by 2020, sufficient to generate at least 300GW by 2030. The partners said they supported Africa's leadership and would work closely with African partners to bridge the access gap and develop |renewable energy potential in the |region. They said: "In this context, we |welcome the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative as a transformative, Africa-owned and led inclusive effort to accelerate and scale-up the harnessing of the continent's renewable energy potential. We welcome the contributions from countries interested in helping Africa harness its renewable energy potential and improve access to sustainable energy for all. We welcome the financial commitments already made by a number of countries." - ANA \</doc>

Weak coal prices set to last as challenges mount for miners Carbon reduction in COP21 pact is the latest blow to industry suffering from lower demand from China and India, writes AFTER a year of sliding prices, mining policy uncertainty and labour unrest, the JSE's coal mining index has taken a severe bruising. It was 5,102 on Tuesday, 60% down from 12,643 at the beginning of the year. The outlook for next year is no better, as China's coal offtake remains weak, nations have agreed at the recent climate talks to cut carbon emissions, and SA faces increased political flux. The latest International Energy Agency report, released in the middle of last month, suggested that by 2040, oil and coal would lose 9% of the global energy mix, offset by increased share from renewables, nuclear and gas. Renewables would overtake coal as the main source of electricity by the early 2030s. By 2040, coal would account for only 30% of electricity generation. For coal companies operating in SA, challenges have mounted this year. Benchmark coal export prices at the Richards Bay Coal Terminal have fallen to $49/tonne from about $66/tonne in January. The Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act Amendment Bill has stalled and a new minerals minister with no mining background was appointed in September. A new CEO, Brian Molefe, was appointed at Eskom, which accounts for most of the domestic coal market. Mr Molefe is taking a hardline position on new coal contracts. For all mining companies, the costs of electricity, labour and imported materials have risen faster than inflation this year. The biggest contributor to the JSE's coal index is Exxaro, which is under pressure from its iron ore earnings as well as coal. The news from smaller coal miners has been mixed, with boardroom upheavals at Wescoal and Resource Generation, but progress by Coal of Africa in advancing its Makhado project and funding. In an environment of weakening prices, all companies are trying to improve their margins. Glencore put its loss-making Optimum Coal mine into business rescue in August and Anglo American plans to sell some of its thermal coal interests in SA. Xavier Prevost of XMP Consulting says the weak coal price was likely to persist. The earliest improvement will be in 2019, and then it will not be a return to more than $100/tonne but a small increment of $10/tonne or so. The world's biggest coal importers are China and India. China's coal imports are unlikely to return and within a year or two, India should have developed enough of its domestic coal resources to feed its power stations, he says. But there are still opportunities for South African exporters in smaller countries such as Pakistan and Turkey. Pakistan takes only 3- to 4-million tonnes of South African coal a year, but is planning to develop coal-fired power stations because they are affordable and it is more concerned about power than climate change. It has coal resources that it intends to develop, but little is known about their economic viability and quality. Mr Prevost says many of SA's coal mines are not making a profit and there has to be industry rationalisation. Eskom's offtake is in a state of flux, with Mr Molefe wanting to move away from & cost plus& coal mines to buying on the open market. But no investments will be made in substantial coal production without a capital contribution from Eskom. There is hope for South African coal miners, though. Mr Prevost says the future market may well lie in building independent coal-fired power stations on a small scale to meet the needs of industrial customers rather than selling power to the grid. World Coal Association CE Benjamin Sporton says after the carbon-reduction agreement at the COP21 conference, the intended nationally determined contributions by each country included, for many, a role for low-emission coal technologies. He calls on governments to support investment in carbon capture and storage. mathewsc@fm.co.za There were still opportunities for exporters in countries such as Pakistan \</doc>

Be realistic on climate pledges AS THE 21st Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) on climate change opened in Paris this week, the southern Indian city of Chennai was suffering floods so devastating that 188 people died and motor manufacturers and other businesses were shut down. Meanwhile, in Southern Africa we are suffering the worst drought in more than two decades. These severe weather conditions come as a new report shows the years from 2011 to 2015 have been the warmest in history, underlining just how much devastation climate change could wreak in decades to come. After many failed attempts, there are high hopes that at COP21 , a deal will finally be reached to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that have caused global warming by 2% compared to preindustrial levels. Negotiators are still struggling to agree on almost all the core clauses of a 54-page resolution that would commit each nation to targets to reduce carbon emissions. But there are key questions about which countries should bear most responsibility for the threat of global warming, where the action to mitigate it should primarily come from and how to share the burden. These questions are particularly salient for SA, because when it comes to climate change, SA is often none too clear whether its loyalties are with developing countries or advanced ones. Everyone agrees that rich countries are the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases and poor countries are the major victims. Particularly vulnerable is Africa - evident in severe droughts and floods in recent years - as well as the chronic shortage of water in much of the continent. The poorest people and countries are likely to suffer most from the effects of global warming. That divide between rich and poor has been a central theme of the COP talks in recent years, with commitments to provide billions of dollars worth of funding to help developing countries mitigate the effects of climate change. SA is on the same side as China when it comes to making demands for more money for the victims of climate change. Although SA has often aligned itself with Beijing on global matters, following it on climate change is uncomfortable given that China, with the US, are the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. SA is hardly blameless when it comes to emissions of greenhouse gases and other noxious gases. Relative to our gross domestic product, we are in the top 20 in the greenhouse gas rankings, reflecting how energy-intensive SA's economy is and how much of our power comes from coal. But that still puts SA far down the rankings on total carbon emissions - SA accounts for 1.2% at most. Therefore, it is irrational for SA to commit to steep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. These reductions require measures that an ailing economy with huge developmental demands simply cannot afford. At the Copenhagen COP in 2009, SA committed to reduce carbon emissions 34% by 2020 and 40% by 2025. China, by contrast, has committed to reductions of 60% or more, but only by 2030. But it is the first to class itself as a developing country and put out the begging bowl when it suits it. SA's commitments are a big factor in the government's stubborn commitment to a carbon tax, which will be likely to cost jobs and output in beleaguered sectors such as mining and steel. Those commitments are also part of the rationale for an unaffordable nuclear programme. Everyone must share the responsibility of tackling climate change. But that needs to be carefully balanced with SA's need for economic growth and jobs. The government needs to learn from peers such as China to consider its own interests before making commitments in forums such as COP, just as every other country does. SA accounts for 1.2% of total carbon emissions, so it is irrational to commit to steep reductions in greenhouse gases \</doc>

The draft climate agreement in Paris aims to limit global warming to well below 2\'c2\'baC and to pursue efforts to limit a temperature rise to 1.5\'c2\'baC. But in reality it puts the world on track for a temperature rise of between 3\'c2\'baC and 4\'c2\'baC because it "cuts all links with the means of doing this", according to an environmental lobby group. And that, notes Bobby Peek, of Friends of the Earth South Africa, means a rise of between 5\'c2\'baC and 8\'c2\'baC for Africa, with "terrible" heatwaves, droughts and floods. "It means our coastal cities will drown. It means hundreds of millions of people will die in this century as our food and ecological systems collapse." For the past two weeks, climate negotiators from nearly 200 countries have been working through the night to finalise an ambitious climate agreement at the COP21 conference. This was expected to be outlined in Paris today. But for Peek and other environmental groups hope was fading late yesterday. "Africa has done little to cause global warming. Over the past two centuries and more, imperial powers and corporations have plundered Africa. "The draft agreement avoids recognition of the climate debt owed to the people of Africa. It sees the need for adaptation, but provides paltry resources. It absolves the imperial powers of any liability for loss and damage resulting from climate change." The draft promises to "mobilise" resources, but Peek says the imperial powers are committed to nothing but photo opportunities. "We call on African governments to negotiate as if our lives mean something. If they cannot put a good deal on the table, we call on them to walk out of the Paris talks." Geoffrey Kamese, of Friends of the Earth Uganda, says: "After 23 years of negotiations we are facing a 4\'c2\'baC (warmer) world... "We have 12 hours left to ensure Africa does not burn with increasing temperatures." The WWF-SA questioned why South Africa was "glaringly absent" from a new "high-ambition" coalition of 100 countries - which include the US, EU and several African, Carribean and Pacific nations - that pledged support for a goal below 1.5\'c2\'baC and said they would block a minimalist agreement. At the climate negotiations, South Africa chaired the G77+China, a powerful block of developing nations, but Louise Naud\'c3\Â£9, of the WWF-SA, wondered why South Africa, Brazil, China and India were not part of it. This week, the South African delegation said the talks were a "golden opportunity" to "come up with a legally binding agreement that will enable us to combat climate change effectively, and boost the transition towards resilient low-carbon societies". Naud\'c3\Â£9 says any legally binding deal will be hollow if it does not bind countries "to anything of substance" and binds countries "to do too little". " COP21 ," says Makoma Lekalakala, senior programmes officer at Earthlife Africa, "is bound to fail. Urgent action must be taken at local level." Increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is altering the balance of trees and grasses to favour trees, causing savannahs to close and form dense woody thickets. Savannahs were born under low atmospheric carbon dioxide (levels) and could disappear under high carbon dioxide," says Professor William Bond of the South African Environmental Observation Network (Saeon). Africa has the most extensive savannahs. Simulation models predict they will be replaced by scrub woodlands and thickets by the end of the century. "We have to blame increasing carbon dioxide for promoting tree growth to a level not seen before," said Professor Guy Midgley of Stellenbosch University. \</doc>

IF MAN-made climate change is not reduced, temperatures in Southern Africa could increase by up to 6\'b0C at the end of the century, leading to drought, decreased crop production, heatwaves and food insecurity. CSIR researcher Dr Francois Engelbrecht and his colleagues have just published a paper modelling temperature changes on the continent and in Southern Africa, and the results reveal a dire future. The paper, titled "Projections of rapidly rising surface temperatures over Africa under low mitigation", shows that Southern African temperatures rise at a much faster rate than elsewhere. The modelling of increased temperatures is consistent with measurements taken over the past 50 years. Engelbrecht said Southern African temperatures were already rising more than twice as fast as the global average increase. Globally over the last century temperatures had risen at 1\'b0C per century. "But in Southern Africa the increase has been more than two degrees." He said the CSIR had one of only two supercomputers in Africa that had the capacity to do the data crunching and modelling needed to make climate change predictions on the continent. The data showed that the continent would be three to six degrees warmer by the end of the century. "In South Africa, in the interior places where we have 10 days per year that are regarded as heatwaves, this could increase tenfold," Engelbrecht said. The warnings come ahead of the United Nations COP21 climate change summit in Paris in November and December. \</doc>

IF THERE was ever any doubt that we should start taking the serious hazards posed by global warming a lot more seriously, the projected impact of sea-level rise as illustrated alongside today's front-page story should be a definitive wake-up call. In a world faced with many more imminent threats - particularly now as governments deal with the ever-increasing menace of terror attacks, religious fanaticism and radicalisation - it's inevitable the environment will far too often be placed on the back burner. But we can no longer shrug off extensive scientific research as mere fodder for scaremongers who paint disaster-movie scenarios. The impact of the rise of the sea level if the global temperature rises by 4\'b0C is based on climate- change research by the respected US-based Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and there can be no escaping the long-term effects of rampant carbon emissions which ultimately threaten to submerge land currently home to hundreds of millions on six continents. And we haven't even begun to take into account the droughts, fires, floods and species extinction which also loom large. In South Africa - quite apart from sea-level rise - the implications for wildlife and eco-tourism if global warming is not contained could be disastrous. This is why it is absolutely vital that Cop21 , the Paris Climate Conference which starts next week, knuckles down to ensure the more than 166 countries responsible for over 90% of emissions are held to account when it comes to their planned targets to curtail this deadly spiral. Our planet is in peril - the evidence is there, we can no longer pay lip service to protecting it. It is a dire emergency and must be treated as such. \</doc>

Without partnerships between business, government, academics and civil society, the international accord reached at December's climate negotiations in Paris will produce little more than hot air. At a meeting of the Climate Change Coalition hosted by the City of Cape Town last Wednesday, Professor Harald Winkler, of UCT's Energy Research Centre, observed that COP21 in Paris arrived at "an international treaty in all but name". We now have a bottom-up set of binding emissions targets, meaning that each country has determined its own target, but is obliged to report on progress. To achieve our national target, each city will need to develop strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The City of Cape Town and the Western Cape have expressed commitment to developing the green economy. While this means that announcements by companies like Tesla to set up shop in Cape Town have been welcomed, there is more to it than developing technology. Steve Nicholls, of the National Business Initiative, said at Wednesday's meeting that business now understands that climate change is a risk and an opportunity requiring transformation of the global economy. He said that a couple of thousand big businesses around the world wrote a letter to the G20 group of the world's largest economies, saying they want more ambitious goals, and for the first time |at COP21 business presented text on |the core issues they wanted to see agreement on - issues that go beyond emissions. Mayor Patricia de Lille told the coalition: "We have already started this journey as Cape Town, but our approach to climate change is to put specific priority to those projects that can deliver co-benefits." In other words, the City must not only mitigate climate change and adapt to its worst effects, but ensure that projects reduce poverty, deliver jobs and address other pressing concerns. Municipal government will need to invest responsibly, but other actors need to leverage this investment to effect meaningful change. The C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, of which the City of Cape Town is a member, is a strong advocate of |the partnership approach. Hastings Chikoko, Africa regional director of C40 Cities, observed that just as business and civil society are not waiting for government action, cities are not waiting for national governments but are developing new ideas and strategies. Cities and their mayors have greater flexibility than their parent nations. They can facilitate the transfer and application of best practice in ways that nations cannot, by engaging with other cities, obtaining finance and entering into a wide range of partnerships. For renewable energy projects, for example, Cape Town has the ability to enter into agreements with independent power producers, regardless of the status of the nation's sovereign guarantees. The City's director of trade and investment, Lance Greyling, says the City has told national government: "We can help you increase renewable energy in South Africa using our good credit rating at financial institutions to procure that energy." De Lille spoke of a number of initiatives designed to enhance energy security, to reduce carbon emissions and to position Cape Town as a green manufacturing hub in Africa. Cape Town, she says, is determined to obtain national Department of Energy permission to purchase renewable energy from independent sources to reach a target of sourcing 10 to 20 percent of energy from renewables by 2020. De Lille said: "I have this dream where I can see every single household in Cape Town generating their own electricity though photovoltaic panels, and then putting that back into the grid where the City can buy back the extra unused energy." It is already possible for homeowners to generate power and offset excess energy against their account with the municipality, but the contract terms are not favourable for the homeowner, so|it will take time for this dream to become reality. Another challenge is that the City relies heavily on revenue from selling Eskom's electricity to residents and businesses, so improved energy efficiency and rooftop generation by consumers is not in the City's financial interests, unless an innovative business model can be found. Without a creative solution, whether the City replaces 20 percent of Eskom supply with its own power (it is setting up an electricity generation department in preparation) or buys it from others, it will lose out if we consume less energy from the grid. The City is already squeezed by lower sales, and higher prices to offset reduced consumption would make matters worse. Energy security is about affordability as much as availability, so this is a challenge for creative collaboration. @carbonsmart \</doc>

CLIMATE change is one of the most significant challenges facing our planet. In December, I participated in |a number of events in Paris at COP21 specifically dealing with the role that cities can play in pushing a more ambitious agenda on climate change than that |which national governments have committed to. I have come away from those deliberations more convinced than ever that cities have a pivotal role to play in both mitigating climate change and adapting to its worst impacts. The engagements that |I took part in were very different to the international negotiating process, in that we weren't arguing over commas and brackets but were actually discussing tangible projects that had been implemented or conceived of in cities around the world. One of the overriding messages of all these engagement was in fact one from the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, who implored cities to steal ideas from each other. He was encouraging a partnership with cities around the world where the best ideas can be shared and implemented where appropriate. One of the ideas I got from the Mayor of Stockholm, where they are utilising sewage to generate biogas to run their bus fleet. We are comprehensively looking at ways in which we can use all of our waste streams in the city far more effectively as a resource particularly for energy generation. We have already initiated pilot projects in this regard. I was especially grateful that Hastings Chikoko, from the C40, was part of the Climate Coalition meeting because this is precisely the role that the C40 plays in ensuring that leading cities around the world can be spurred to greater action and inspire new sustainable ways of doing things. The C40 is a valuable network of the world's finest and pioneering cities and there is much to learn from one another. It was so good sharing a platform with other mayors at COP21 , where the language we spoke was about doing rather than just talking. While we have come away from Paris with the sense that the world is finally taking climate change seriously, what still remains is a major emissions gap in terms of the national commitments that countries have |committed to. This emissions gap will have to be bridged by cities across the world, taking actions that will put their urban populations on a far more sustainable trajectory. The message that I took to Paris is that we have already started this journey, but that our approach to climate change is to give specific priority to those projects that deliver co-benefits. It is important that Cape Town leads the way in delivering projects that not only mitigate against |climate change and adapt to it, |but also simultaneously reduces poverty and creates much needed jobs. This is already evident in our ceilings retrofitting project, where the City is retrofitting state-subsidised homes that were built between 1994 and 2005, which were constructed without insulated ceilings and weather-proofing as this was not included in the RDP subsidy provided by the national |government at the time. With City funding and capital raised from the Green Fund, our large-scale retrofitting programme will be rolled out to all 40 000 units at a cost of R400 million. This large-scale retrofit project has health, social and environmental benefits. The first phase of retrofitting 8 000 homes is under way and will create around |800 job opportunities through |the Expanded Public Works Programme. I am extremely proud of this project because it is a prime co-benefit example which also supports our climate change actions to improve energy efficiency through a reduction in carbon emissions and electricity consumption. For the 8 000 units which will be retrofitted with insulated ceilings, there will be a reduction of approximately 5 600 tons of carbon per annum. On the electricity front, we have a number of initiatives designed to enhance energy security of the city and reduce emissions. Cape Town is determined to move ahead with procuring power from renewable, energy independent power producers so that we can reach our target of sourcing between 10 to 20 percent of our energy from renewable sources |by 2020. We have initiated discussions with the national Department of Energy as cities in South Africa currently have to obtain permission if they wish to procure power from any other entity besides the state electricity utility Eskom. A potentially huge source of untapped energy is also staring at us from the rooftops of Cape Town, which can accommodate both solar water heaters and photovoltaic (PV) systems. Households and businesses which generate renewable energy through rooftop PV panels are now able to feed excess electricity back into the City's grid, allowing us to diversify our energy supply. We have already seen an uptake of these solutions in Cape Town, but we are currently considering ways in which it can be made easier and cheaper for households and businesses to implement these solutions on a wider scale. It projected that the greatest growth in emissions will come from our transport sector over the next 25 years and tackling this will require, among other things, changes in our urban form, coupled with major interventions to decrease car occupancy, more efficient vehicles and increasing public transport usage. The City recently issued a call for tenders for the procurement of electric buses for the MyCiTi service as we extend the footprint of the MyCiTi service across the city. We also have a responsibility to lower our carbon emissions and the impact of pollution on the urban environment. If all goes according to plan, Cape Town will be the first municipality in the country to benefit from the latest alternative fuel technology and we will be one of the first cities in Africa to use electric buses for public transport. We have also just appointed a contractor to start the roll-out of |wi-fi provision on MyCiTi buses so that we can lure more people on to public transport and out of their private cars. This is another step towards reducing local greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing resilience to climate change. It also supports the City's commitment to the Paris Pledge for Action at COP21 and as a member of the C40 Cities to take progressive action and lead the way in reducing energy consumption and emissions. Our successful Water Conservation and Water Demand Management Programme (WCWDM) has been an instrumental adaptation measure and was announced as |the winner in the Adaptation Implementation Category in the 2015 C40 Cities Awards in Paris. This is another example of co-benefits as up to 1 000 Expanded Public Works workers were employed to conduct ongoing door-to-door awareness campaigns to promote water conservation practices. Through effective resource management and a shared responsibility with residents over a |15-year period, the WCWDM programme has resulted in a reduction in demand or water savings of more than 30 percent. It has also resulted in massive carbon emission savings due to the City's ability to avoid infrastructure expansion which would have been required if water consumption had not been reduced. We are determined to continue leading the way and being more progressive with our action and targets to address climate change. If we are going to be more ambitious, the City will not be able to |do it alone. This will require partnerships with citizens, businesses and various stakeholders if we are going to tackle climate change effectively, protect our planet while improving the lives of our residents. l De Lille is the Executive Mayor of Cape Town \</doc>

Tyburn Primary School in Chatsworth is to make a presentation at the COP21 climate change conference in Paris. Pupils from the school will participate in a live webcast tomorrow, starting with a video presentation on environmental preservation and going on to showcase some of their projects. On Thursday, they will hook up to the conference again to speak to pupils from all over the world on climate matters. Project coach Gonasudrum Reddy said the team - Tyburn Transformers - consists of 10 pupils from Grades 4 to 7. "They will talk about the sustainable aquaponics site at the school, recycling projects and how we can contribute to keeping the change in global warming from exceeding 2\'c2\'b0C." Shanelle Chinnasamy, who is on the team, said she enjoyed taking part in climate and recycling projects. "It increases my knowledge and I'm able to go back home and teach my family what I've learnt at school. "I look forward to talking to pupils from other countries," she said. \</doc>

In the late 20th century, those who stood against globalisation were charged with swimming against an unstoppable tide, caricatured as "Stop the world, I wanna get off!" But in the 21st century, history is running with the anti-globalisers. World trade talks have gone nowhere, immigration controls have shot up the agenda, and two post-national EU projects - the euro and Schengen - are under strain. Figures like Donald Trump, Nicola Sturgeon, and Marine Le Pen - who failed to convert a remarkable first-round victory in French regional elections into any outright wins - are all peddling one form of nationalism or another. Rumours of the death of the nation state, then, have proved exaggerated. When problems from the overuse of antibiotics to terrorism refuse to respect national borders, the retreat from the dream of global governance has some frightening consequences, especially in connection with climate change. The Paris COP21 Fortunately, it proved possible to work within the fudged alternative framework of a "legally binding instrument". Everyone offered up voluntary emission targets, and agreed to a five-yearly review of these. While the targets are not yet adequate to avoid the disaster of more than 2\'c2\'baC of warming, the surprise inclusion of an aspiration to cap temperature rises at 1.5\'c2\'baC signals a shared understanding that the targets will have to be tightened at each successive review. The destructive stand-off between developing and developed countries that doomed Copenhagen six years ago has been transcended. One anxiety is whether this fortuitous alignment of political and economic stars will remain, as nations move towards real action. Paris has given the world new hope. \</doc>

The Minister of Environmental Affairs, Mrs B E E Molewa, has arrived in Paris for informal Ministerial Consultations ahead of the 21st Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to be hosted in France from 30 November to 11 December 2015. The informal Ministerial Consultation is being hosted by the incoming COP 21 President, the Foreign Minister of France Mr. Laurent Fabius from 6 to 7 September 2015. The meeting is the consultation is the third Ministerial consultation following the last two held in Lima, Peru, and Paris, France, in March, May and July 2015, respectively. The aim of the Paris consultations on 7 September is to support the formal process under the UNFCCC in order to ensure the broad outlines of the draft agreement may be clear as early as October in order to maximise the chances of a success at COP 21 . The Ad-hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action agreed at a meeting in Bonn last week to provide the Co-Chairs of the ADP to revise the negotiations text, or what is known as Co-Chairs' tool, with a view of tabling the revised Co-Chairs tool before the next session of negotiators which will take place in October in Bonn. The Ministers must decide on aspects on adaptation, loss and damage and the means of implementation to be captured under the core agreement and those that can be captured under Decisions Text. Finally the outcomes of the discussions by the Ministers will give direction to the formal ADP negotiations under the UNFCCC negotiations.

RIGHT OF REPLY The article 'Too much wiggle room' on emissions regrettably did not give the department of environmental affairs the right to reply to a number of sweeping statements and generalisations \- namely, that the country's climate change response policy favours large corporate polluters and that we have one of the most energy-inefficient economies in the world. In December, at the 21st Conference of Parties ( COP21 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, parties will work towards a new legal agreement to apply to all countries from 2020. In preparation, countries have agreed to publicly outline what post-2020 climate actions they intend to take under this new agreement, known as intended nationally determined contributions. Prior to communicating these to the convention secretariat, we convened a series of stakeholder workshops around the country. A number of sector role-players, civil society organisations, academic institutions, community groups and ordinary South Africans made submissions based on the draft document. It is unclear, then, why your correspondent surmises that communities have not been consulted. We are well on track to submit our intended nationally determined contributions before the October 1 deadline, demonstrating political commitment to tackling climate change. Like most developing countries, we are vulnerable to the effects of climate change owing to our resource extraction-based economy and our developmental challenges. Unless urgently addressed, we could see the developmental gains scored by our young democracy eroded as increased food and water insecurity exacerbates poverty, hunger and disease. Our national climate change response policy is guided by the imperative to protect those most vulnerable. We have stressed throughout that our approach is in the context of sustainable development. While we can do more to scale up our effort, to claim that we have disregarded the impact of climate change on our people is unfair. For instance, several projects are being piloted in KwaZulu-Natal, the Northern Cape and Limpopo that increase resilience through interventions such as early warning systems, climate-smart agriculture and climate-proofing settlements. This is in addition to the substantial adaptation projects being rolled out by the departments of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, and land and rural development. The claim that our climate change response policy "favours large corporate polluters" is also unsubstantiated. Most emission reduction measures in the policy will be implemented by the economic sectors and companies. We are currently allocating carbon budgets to companies, which will contribute to the country's emission reduction goals. The claim that South Africa has "one of the most energy-inefficient economies in the world" is a half-truth. A recently published report by the energy department indicates that we have improved significantly \- not only with regard to the energy intensity of our economy, but also in implementing general energy-efficient measures countrywide. Between 2000 and 2012, the energy intensity of the economically productive sectors was reduced by more than 28%, while that of the residential sector fell by more than 15%. Although this can be attributed to a host of factors, total energy savings due to efficiency improvements in various sectors is to be welcomed. South Africa remains on track to meet the energy efficiency targets set under our 2005 strategy. Furthermore, we continue to attract major investment through the renewable energy independent power producers programme. South Africa is a developing country and will continue to push for space to develop \- while transitioning to a lower carbon- and climate-resilient economy and society. It is in our national interest to consider our developmental requirements and our obligation to reduce poverty, unemployment and inequality while not impeding economic development. This is why at COP21 we will push for an agreement that is fair, effective and ambitious \- and strengthens a multilateral response to the global climate change challenge. Commitments under the Paris agreement will be nationally determined and in accordance with the convention principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities. Countries like ours, with a host of developmental challenges and priorities, require the means to be able to significantly reduce emissions and adapt to an ever-changing climate. It is assumed that the Paris agreement will provide the mechanisms and tools to enhance international and regional co-operation on mitigation and adaptation. The success of Paris ultimately rests on a recognition that climate change is a global problem requiring a global solution. Edna Molewa is minister of environmental affairs.

Day 2 of African Utility Week looked at the cornerstones of sustainable development - energy, water and food security - and how they need to developed in unison to achieve the ambitious goals of COP21 ,,. Monika Weber-Fahr, COO of Sustainability for All (SE4All) played on the African proverb mentioned yesterday, saying, we need to go far, fast and together. She explained that central to the COP21 goals were energy and water, and that they exist together and need to be developed hand in hand. The perception exists that economic growth is linked to being energy intensive, but various countries are showing that this is not necessarily true by using different approaches, she said. Different forms of energy generation consume different amounts of water, and this impacts on decisions around what energy source to use. Women pay the highest price Weber-Fahr mentioned that women pay the highest price for the lack of water or energy, particularly in underdeveloped countries. The time wasted on collecting water and chores such as cooking usually using biomass fuels when they could be productive could be reduced by simple energy solutions. If men were to cook, we would have clean stoves everywhere. On a higher level, she said that there were very few women serving on boards of companies including utilities, and if this was addressed, it could change the focus on priorities regarding energy solutions. Climate change is a reality now He said that there are some worrying trends in practices in all three of the water usage areas, namely agriculture, domestic and industry. Water is getting dirtier, so we need more energy to clean it. Speaking of energy, Naidoo said there is still too much reliance on fossil fuels, and even though there is a move towards renewables, it s happening slowly. When it comes to solutions, Naidoo said there should be a focus on resource wise behaviour and innovation to move to high resource security. Strategies and interventions must be converged on all three risk areas to achieve long-term outcomes. Paris is a mirror of our failure In addition, 50% of the world s aquifers are past their tipping point, and therefore can t never be recovered. He paints a grim picture, and said that although the outcomes of the Paris Agreement are ambitious, it is a mirror to our failure. Ovink suggested that a transformative approach that is long term and comprehensive, while incorporating short-term goals and innovation, inclusive collaboration, public private partnership funding and accountability was the way forward. More specifically Ovink said water pricing will create level playing field and there needs to be an energy leapfrog to renewables in which South Africa can play significant role. Every spot lit up Africa is home to approximately 1,2bn and under 40% of the population has access to a modern form of energy, said Akinwole Omoboriowo, CEO: Genesis Electricity. The potable water supply is getting stressed and the continent is largely reliant on biomass as a primary form of energy. But the electricity and potable water production and supply challenges on the continent not insurmountable. He used the term coopetition , referring to innovative collaborative commercial solutions working for the common good in place of negative competition. This requires a stronger adherence to rule of law and continuity from responsible governments and a responsible private sector. Omoboriowo s envisioned future includes every spot lit up on the map of Africa. It starts with baby steps through small projects. Working in a world of such complexity, water and energy can t be mutually exclusive, he said. African Utility Week takes places at the CTICC in Cape Town from 17-19 May, 2016. {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell \</doc>

The Portfolio Committee on Water and Sanitation supports Operation Hydrate and views it as a noble initiative that must gain societal support. The initiative has up to date distributed over 350 000 litres of water to drought stricken areas in the country. The Committee views this initiative as a true embodiment of the spirit of Ubuntu that has made South Africa a unique and great country it is today. The Committee urges everyone, from individuals to big business, to contribute to this gracious course. It is only through a commitment to mutual action that the country will overcome the current challenge of water scarcity, said Mr Mlungisi Johnson, the Chairperson of the Committee. As the country tries to find workable solutions to the drought challenge, the Committee views the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as central. The Committee is hopeful that the deal reached at the recently concluded COP21 climate change summit will create a foundation on which the effects will be reduced and eventually eliminated. The Committee further urges all South Africans to recommit to a culture of prudent water use. This recommitment, coupled with vigilance in relations to water leakages will ensure that the country saves water that is currently being lost. Government, particularly the local sphere of government, must strengthen its capacity to maintain the water related infrastructure to ensure longevity. The Committee is hopeful that all these initiatives will ensure that the country successfully navigates the drought challenge.

THE COP21 climate change deal |is surely one of the most remarkable feats of international co-operation - the most remarkable since humankind ate of the fruit of knowledge of good and evil and began developing the technology to destroy its own existence. There have been other achievements, of course. Who would have given a fig - following the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the almost immediate lapse into a Cold War that could have turned thermo-nuclear in an instant - for civilisation not being simply blown away. It didn't happen and credit has to be given to the UN and the extremely skilful game of brinkmanship that was played on both sides. But now it turns out that humankind was engineering its own destruction (or near-destruction) anyway by burning fossil fuels and creating the carbon greenhouse gases that are heating the world beyond endurable limits. It took a long time for the message to get properly across. But there was something awesome in the accord - and the magnanimity - of last Saturday's agreement of 196 nations, each of which will have sacrifices to make. This time, humanity surely deserves a round of applause. Alternative view THERE are, of course, scientists who believe global warming began about 300 years ago as a natural cycle; that the industrial revolution has had little or nothing to do with it and the present efforts are therefore pointless. They could be right, who knows? Anyone who has read Gavin Menzies's fascinating book, 1421: The Year China Discovered The World, will know this great Chinese fleet sailed up the Pacific coast of America and down an ice-free North-West Passage to an ice-free Arctic. That was about 600 years ago, long before industrialisation. It does suggest natural cycles of warming and freezing. But even if humanity's current efforts to halt warming should |turn out either misguided (very much a minority view in the scientific community) or insufficient - they are still directed at secondary evils; the poisoning of the atmosphere, our oceans and rivers by irresponsible industrial and agricultural practices. People are dying from poison smog, toxins in the atmosphere. In fact, are those evils really secondary? Their curbing would surely alone make COP21 worthwhile. Far Left The political far Left are enlivening the scene in Britain right now. Jeremy Corbyn, new leader of the Labour Party - and Leader of the opposition in the House of Commons - is part of that Left. You seldom see Corbyn - a man of the people - wearing a tie (just as Tory prime minister David Cameron sheds his tie whenever he can, to be also a man of the people). Last Saturday, when Corbyn was a guest speaker at a fund-raising dinner of the Stop the War Coalition (to the despair of many of his MPs because the coalition includes a whole raft of Trotskyites and other way-outs), it wasn't at all a black tie do - they all seemed to be wearing open-neck shirts, donkey jackets and those funny little Lenin caps, so beloved of the far Left. Will old Etonian and Oxonian David Cameron adopt a Lenin |cap? It seems unlikely - but |watch this space! Song T J BRISTOL, a gospel singer and chaplain of Orange County Jail, in California, was stopped by police for not wearing a seat belt while driving. But the good chaplain was all charm and the two female officers let him off, provided he sang them a song. Bristol obliged by giving them Joe Cocker's You Are So Beautiful, which just about had them swooning.What a wonderful wheeze. If the metro cops stop me for any reason, I'll just sing Girls Are Made To Hug And Kiss. I tried it out the other evening at the Street Shelter for the Over-Forties. But it was not well received. In fact they said if I sang that to the metro police they'd throw the key away. Tailpiece IT'S so cold in Europe right now that the politicians have their hands in their own pockets. Last word Critics search for ages for the wrong word, which, to give them credit, they eventually find. - Peter Ustinov \</doc>

The Minister of Environmental Affairs, Mrs Edna Molewa has arrived in New York for the high-level signature ceremony of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Minister Molewa is leading the South African delegation to the ceremony, being hosted by United Nations Secretary-General, H.E. Ban Ki-moon, on 22 April 2016. The signature ceremony is a confirmation that states intend to be bound by the Paris Agreement and is an affirmation that they remain committed to addressing climate change. Minister Molewa will sign the Paris Agreement on behalf of the Republic. The Paris Agreement was unanimously adopted by Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in December 2015. The adoption of the Paris Agreement is the culmination of the historic and bold decisions taken in 2011 in Durban when South Africa served as President of COP17/CMP7. While the Agreement itself will come into force in 2020, the Parties also agreed to accelerate and enhance climate action in the pre-2020 period. This is particularly important to developing countries, especially those on the Continent who are already experiencing the effects of climate change, such as the current drought that South Africa is experiencing. Within this pre-2020 period developed countries have commitments to provide support in the form of financial resources, technology transfer and capacity building support to developing countries to assist them to meet the climate challenge. Under the Paris Agreement these commitments will continue post-2020. South Africa looks forward to being one of the countries that will sign the Paris Agreement on this historic day, as it has participated throughout the negotiations leading to the adoption of the Paris Agreement. This included President Zuma delivering South Africa's national Statement during the Leaders Event at COP21 and with South Africa chairing the biggest negotiating group of 134 countries in the negotiations, the Group of 77 and China.

THE Cities of Cape Town and Joburg have been named international winners for climate action at the Paris Climate Conference ( COP21 ). The two cities were Africa's only winners. The C40 Cities Awards spans 10 categories, all recognising cities demonstrating "climate action leadership", says the awards' website. Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille was at the awards ceremony in Paris to accept the accolade on behalf of the city, and said: "We are extremely proud of the city's WCWDM programme which has been instrumental in establishing Cape Town as a national leader in reducing water demand and losses." "I was greatly honoured to receive this award on behalf of all residents of Cape Town who have worked with us to reduce water demand and implement water conservation measures," she said. The WCWDM programme began in 2007 and focuses on water conservation and water demand management, aiming to minimise water waste and promoting the efficient use of water. The programme includes raising public awareness, free-of-charge plumbing repairs for low-income households, and the training of "community plumbers". Joburg's award-winning Green Bond is a funding model for green projects which previously did not have any financing and could thus not be implemented. Other categories awarded on the night included carbon measurement and planning, adaptation planning and assessment, building energy efficiency, green energy, solid waste, smart cities and smart community engagement, sustainable communities, and transportation. The jury included representatives from the World Bank, Bloomberg Associates, World Wildlife Fund Canada, and the University of Cape Town. - ANA \</doc>

Jozi is the coolest city in the southern hemisphere. This is the opinion of top UK magazine GQ, which has a monthly readership of 1.2 million. It said that although there are many "cool cities" south of the equator "ripe for one's travel considerations", Joburg is - at the moment - the best place to visit. This is just one of a string of accolades the city received recently. GQ fashion editor Nick Carvell said Joburg might not boast white sands and pristine beaches, but it can hold its head high as it has |"a clever way" of making up for a loss of nature's endowments. "Though South Africa's first city lacks in beaches, it more than makes up with a seriously buzzing urban landscape packed with superb bars, inventive restaurants, cool hotels and one of the world's most exciting theatre, art and music scenes - not to mention safaris just outside if you want to spend some time with the country's most recognisable furry residents." GQ's write-up comes hot on the heels of Joburg winning the prestigious C40 Cities Award for tackling climate change through its successful green bond initiative during |the COP21 summit in Paris in December. Last year, the Global Financial Centres index ranked Joburg the number one city in Africa and 33rd most economically powerful metropolis in the world. Joburg's Maboneng Precinct was named one of the world's coolest New Tourist Attractions last year by Travelandleisure.com, while the city walked away with the Rough Guide's No 1 position as the top city to visit last year. Mayco member for economic development Ruby Mathang said: "One aspect that never gets |mentioned is our human element in the city. "Every resident of Joburg must know that they are the city's tourism ambassadors. "Not only has tourism created job opportunities in the city and nationally, but it has also surpassed mining as the key generator of |revenue for the fiscus." \</doc>

The climate agreement in Paris needs to be as ambitious as possible and to address the environmental challenge, while protecting the development space of developing countries. This was what South Africa hoped the outcome of the UN Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) climate change meeting would take into consideration. President Jacob Zuma said it was in the country's national interest to have a legal agreement that allowed the country to respond more effectively to "pressing socio-economic challenges and acute vulnerability to climate change". South Africa is the chair of the Group of 77 and China and a member of the Africa Group of Negotiators and Brazil, South Africa, India and China group. "South Africa also has the responsibility of advancing the shared interests of developing countries in the negotiations for the agreement. This necessitates defending the legal rights of developing countries, including to receive the support they require to make the transition to a low-carbon economy and to adapt to the reality of a climate that is already changing and the loss and damage that is associated with this." The AU Commission and Oxfam International called for an equitable and legally binding agreement. Desire Assogbavi, head of Oxfam Liaison Office to the AU, emphasised that the climate variability was having damaging consequences on people across |the continent. He said that Africa should be at the forefront of the negotiations since it was one of the world's most vulnerable continents to climate change. Mithika Mwenda, secretary-general of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance, urged African countries to remain united during the talks. He argued that justice should be at the centre of the agreement. "Climate justice means that those who have caused the damages of the climate change should also provide means to solve the consequences on other people." - Kamcilla Pillay \</doc>

1. 120 YEARS OF TALKING: The first scientific inkling that humanity was altering the Earth's complex climate system emerged almost 120 years ago. Way back in 1896, Swedish chemist and Nobel prizewinner Svante Arrhenius began to develop the "greenhouse" theory. He argued that the temperature of the Earth would heat up perceptibly as greater volumes of coal and other fossil fuels were burnt by |industry. But it would take many more decades before scientists started to ring the warning bells more loudly, when the first World Climate |Conference was held in Geneva in 1979. Finally, in 1994, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change came into effect, with the aim of preventing "dangerous" levels of climate change. Since then, there have been 21 meetings in cities around the world (including Durban) to encourage 195 countries to co-operate with each other to curb rising carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. Before this, most of the richer |industrialised nations (with the notable exception of the US) had agreed to reduce emissions in terms of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. However, without the US, the first stage of the Kyoto agreement hardly made a dent in global emission levels and by the time delegates met in Durban, China had overtaken the US as the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. While the Durban agreement was hailed by many politicians and negotiators as a significant turning point, it delayed the final negotiations to the Paris meeting and used language which preserved plenty of wriggle room. Under the current UN agreements, member nations have set an average 2\'c2\'b0C global temperature increase as their yardstick - the line in the sand which must not be crossed. It has been argued that crossing this threshold opens the door to a range of unacceptably dangerous changes to the climate system - |including a significant rise in sea level, dips in food crop yields, more frequent droughts or an increase in storm events. However, unless emissions are reduced dramatically, scientists believe the world will cross the 2\'c2\'b0C line quite soon. Some argue that people are dying already from climate change - though others may have been spared from freezing to death because of warmer temperatures. 4. RISING SEA LEVELS: The leaders of the world's small island states are calling for a new temperature threshold of 1.5\'c2\'b0C to ensure that their nations are not drowned or flooded by rising sea levels. Tony de Brum, foreign minister for the Marshall Islands, says: "For atoll island countries like mine, lying less than two metres above the rising oceans, the new (Paris) agreement will play a big part in determining whether our countries survive into the second half of the century ... It's a matter of life or death." The UN's expert panel on climate change says sea levels are rising at a faster rate compared with the past 2 000 years and will continue to rise for centuries, even if all greenhouse gas emissions cease tomorrow. If the Greenland ice sheets were to melt entirely, sea levels would rise about 7m - but the expert panel says they have been unable to pinpoint the exact temperature point that could trigger irreversible melting. 5. EARLY WARNINGS FROM REMOTE ISLANDS: Two remote and tiny islands - more than 2 000km south of Durban - became part of South African territory in 1948. Since then, Marion Island and Prince Edward Island have been studied intensively by local scientists to reveal strong evidence of a rapidly changing climate system. Over the past 60 years, the sea surface temperature around these islands has risen by more than 1\'c2\'b0C and rainfall has declined by nearly 500mm. Sunshine hours have increased by more than 200 hours annually and the temperature of the islands' interior has risen nearly 4\'c2\'b0C. The mountain-top glacier on Marion Island is melting and shrinking and some plant species are "migrating" to higher altitudes to stay within their chosen temperature niches. 6. BIRDS AND FISH ON THE MOVE: Closer to mainland South Africa, several fish species are also on the move. One is the cat-faced rock cod. Once found only along the Mozambique coast, they are now common between Durban and Richards Bay. Recently they have moved as far south as the De Hoop marine reserve near Cape Agulhas. In their new book Climate Change, leading SA climate scientists Bob and Mary Scholes and Mike Lucas say a variety of sea plants and animals are relocating as the sea becomes warmer. Large numbers of anchovies in the Western Cape have been shifting towards cooler waters, while off the KZN coastline, corals are moving south. Several bird species are also changing their migration habits. European barn swallows are leaving South Africa 11 days earlier than 15 years ago and returning nine days later - though it is less clear whether they are responding to climate changes in Europe or South Africa. 7. HOW MUCH GAS DOES SA PRODUCE? Overall, South Africa generates nearly 1.5% of the world's greenhouse gases. It might not sound like much, but considering that South Africa is home to just 0.7% of the world's human population, these emissions are way above what they should be. South Africa is also the biggest emitter in Africa, and depending on what figures are used, is ranked at somewhere between the 10th and 17th biggest emitter in the world. We are still far behind China (about 23%) and the US (about 16%) when measured by total emissions, but in the same league as the UK and Australia (both close to 1.5% of total global emissions). One of the main reasons for these high emissions is South Africa's heavy dependence on coal-fired power stations. To curb emissions, still rising about 3% each year, radical changes will be needed in how we generate electricity. Emissions could also be slashed by building better public transport systems. In the Nigerian capital of Lagos, a new Bus Rapid Transport system has led to a 13% reduction in carbon emissions and reduced journey times by up to half. 8. WHY IS AFRICA SO VULNERABLE TO CLIMATE CHANGE? A recent study led by Professor Francois Engelbrecht of the CSIR suggests temperatures in subtropical Africa will rise at about 1.5 times the global rate. Even if temperature increases are kept below 2\'c2\'b0C globally, temperatures in parts of Africa could rise by 4\'c2\'b0 to 6\'c2\'b0C by the end of the century. Engelbrecht and his colleagues also expect a drastic increase in the number of heatwaves, fires and droughts in parts of Africa. Tens of millions of African subsistence farmers still depend on rain-fed crops such as maize. They would be particularly vulnerable to heatwaves, less rain and reduced soil moisture. 9. WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR SOUTH AFRICA? The current drought in KwaZulu-Natal and other parts of the country provides an unwelcome glimpse into what could lie ahead. Scholes and Lucas suggest if temperatures rise above 6\'c2\'b0C there will be "serious questions" about our ability to cope with such heat. Significantly less rain is also projected for the Southern Cape, Limpopo and Mpumalanga by the middle of the century, although the Free State and KwaZulu-Natal could benefit from significantly more rain. But higher rainfall does not automatically mean there would be more water available. Those places receiving 10% more rain could end up with the same or less soil moisture. For South Africa, each 1% drop in rainfall translates into a 1.1% decrease in summer maize harvests and a 0.5% decrease in winter wheat. Each 1\'c2\'b0C increase in temperature spells a 5% decrease in both maize and wheat production. Livestock, meat and milk production also begin to fall steeply when daytime temperatures rise above 30\'c2\'b0C . 10. WHAT COULD COME OUT OF PARIS NEXT WEEK? Optimists suggest that as the climate change clock ticks ever closer to the 2\'c2\'b0C "midnight point", negotiators are more likely than ever to put aside the historical divisions |between rich and poor nations and agree to more ambitious emission cuts by all. Environmental author George Monbiot believes the lobbying power of big oil and big coal remains a major hurdle. "These companies have in the past financed wars to protect their position; they will not surrender the bulk of their (fossil fuel) reserves without a monumental fight." He points to the recent VW emissions scandal to demonstrate the weakness of self-regulation. French economists Jean Tirole and Christian Gollier fear the Paris negotiations will boil down to countries presenting a list of good intentions and then claiming victory. "Participating countries will do their best to ensure their commitments can't be compared with those of others, rendering them unverifiable and thus unconstraining." David Hallowes, a researcher for the groundWork environmental group, says: "The parties will at all costs avoid any obligations whatsoever. They will reaffirm the goal |of keeping global warming to less than 2\'c2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels, but will do nothing to secure that outcome. "In effect, they will agree to warming of 4\'c2\'b0C or more as the corporate economy - or rather, the accumulation of capital - is given absolute priority over the planet." \</doc>

We have concluded the G20 Summit in Antalya, Turkey, having covered several issues that are of concern with regards to the global economy. Under the Turkish Presidency, G20 this year has covered lots of issues especially pertaining to development. The work of the Development Working Group has been mainstreamed into the work of the G20 which has enabled issues such as women in the labour market, youth employment, SMMEs and others to receive prominence. A number of areas were discussed extensively. We discussed the very important matter of how we can act collectively and in a coordinated manner to lift growth and to make sure that growth is truly inclusive. We also discussed how we can make sure that we implement what we agreed in Addis Ababa at the Conference on Financing for Development. And we connected this to the commitments we made in New York with regard to the global agenda on Sustainable Development. We must aim to eradicate poverty and inequality. We must make sure that all the peoples of the world have access to basic services: health, clean water, and so on. We need growth so that we can create job and expand tax revenues, which we can spend on economic and social infrastructure investment. In support of this, the G20 committed to double efforts to reduce youth unemployment by 15% by 2025, through skills development and various training programmes. The leaders reflected on economic challenges affecting large economies which have an impact on the global economy. These include: (i) the possible increase of interest rates in the United States which will lead to currency depreciation, inflation and a rise in the cost of borrowing (ii) the slowing down of the Chinese economy. Of course, President Xi assured us that they are doing everything to keep the Chinese economy strong so that it continues to contribute meaningfully to global growth (ii) the fall in commodity prices which affects many countries on the continent including our own. This is a double edged sword. On the one hand, oil importers benefit from a low price of oil. But low oil revenues hurt the countries that depend on oil revenues. South Africa acknowledged the domestic factors that constrain growth and also indicated how we are resolving these. For example: We indicated that energy generation is a challenge we are dealing with decisively in South Africa. We are building coal fired power stations - Medupi and Kusile. We also have one of the largest renewable energy programmes, which currently contribute 2000 megawatts and will expand to 6000 megawatts by 2017/18. We also alluded to other efforts like the change in the approach to the immigration regulations which will boost tourism. We agreed to redouble our efforts to implement our growth strategies which we had agreed in Brisbane last year during the Australian Presidency, as well as the Antalya Action Plan we agreed to at this Summit. In our case, this means we must accelerate the implementation of the NDP. Terrorism, migration and other global challenges All leaders condemned the recent terror attacks in Paris, France. They also expressed their sympathies and heartfelt condolences to the people of France, Turkey and Russia for the loss of life they suffered recently. Beirut, Lebanon also suffered an attack which led to loss of life and injury to scores of people. We discussed aspects that underlie the terrorism and migration, which include poverty, violence and insecurity among many things. South Africa emphasized that despite anger over the Paris attacks, we must not confuse migrants with terrorists. International tax issues Another very important area that the G20 has been working on is the issue of how we can work together to put an end to base erosion and profit shifting. As you know, South Africa, other countries in Sub Sahara and many countries around the world have companies that do business in many parts of the world. Often, they get tempted to shop around for the place where their taxes can be lowest. They look for tax heavens. This practice is bad. Companies must pay their taxes where the profits are made. This is a topic that we as the G20 we have been busy with for several years. Our own officials from SARS and Treasury have been working with the OECD on this issue of base erosion and profit shifting. South Africa has signed agreements with over 51 countries on the sharing of information on multinational companies. So there will be no place to hide for tax dodgers. Arising from the work of the G20, this sharing of information is going to be automatic. Energy For the first time the G20 discussed the issue of energy. This is a very important matter for Sub Saharan Africa and South Africa. Under the Power Africa initiative, Sub Saharan Africa must build around 30 000 megawatts of addition energy generation capacity to power the economy of the region. This will require good planning and disciplined execution, it will require financial resources, and we must do this in a way that does not impact negatively on the environment The challenge is finding the right balance between the development ambitions of developing countries with the need to protect the environment. Climate change In the lead-up to the COP21 in Paris in two weeks' time, the G20 Summit outcome on climate change was the most difficult to negotiate. South Africa fully supports France in its capacity as incoming COP21 /CMP11 President and will work towards finding fair compromises and consensus positions between Parties that we hope will lead to the adoption of an ambitious and legally-binding outcome in Paris that is applicable to all. This is important for South Africa's legacy as the hope of COP17, which set out the mandate for COP21 , as it would mark the successful conclusion of the mandate from the Durban COP17, hosted by South Africa. G20 leaders acknowledged that there is a huge expectation that the outcome should be binding on all Parties. We have agreed to instruct our negotiators to engage constructively and flexibly in the coming days to discuss key issues, in order to arrive at Paris with a way forward. I think we are finding the right balance! Youth Employment Key for the Turkish G20 Presidency was the identification of a numeric and quantifiable youth employment target based on national circumstances as a way to reduce high unemployment rates among young people in G20 countries. South Africa particularly welcomes the adoption of the youth employment target of a 15% increase by 2025. Domestically, the achievement of this objective will be facilitated through the National Youth Policy 2020 and the Presidential Youth Working Group. Looking ahead, we believe it would be particularly important for the G20 to also prioritise working to meaningfully address aspects related to equity, justice and, of course, dignity as they relate to employment and income distribution. Focus on SMMEs For the first time, the G20 focused its attention on SMMEs, especially in developing countries and Africa. Ministers responsible for SMME of the G20 countries met and agreed on measures to support SMMEs. The G20 Summit also agreed to establish a private sector-led World SME forum. The G20 also agreed and recognized the importance of encouraging firms of all sizes, particularly SMEs in developing countries to participate at higher value added stages of global value chains. This will boost our efforts for beneficiation and industrialization, job creation and skills development. Trade The Summit also noted the forthcoming 10th WTO Ministerial Council Meeting (MC10) which will take place in Nairobi from 15 to 18 December 2015, the first WTO Ministerial to be held on African soil. It is clear that the Doha Round negotiations will not be completed in Nairobi. Cyber Security The Summit also discussed the key priority area of global threats to the security of, and the use of ICTs, with the risks that undermine our collective ability to use the Internet to bolster economic growth and development around the world. Of importance for South Africa, we committed ourselves to bridge the digital divide. In the ICT environment, just as elsewhere, we recognised that States have a special responsibility to promote security, stability, and economic ties with other nations. \</doc>

Growthpoint Properties is now embarking on its largest rooftop solar installations yet... Power for 2,500 homes Werner van Antwerpen, head of sustainability, reports: Growthpoint has already passed the halfway mark in achieving its goal to install rooftop solar farms capable of generating an impressive 6MWp. Or, in other words, enough solar energy to power nearly 2,500 average South African homes. Harnessing energy from the abundant South African sunshine, the company has already completed the installation of photovoltaic solar panels with the capacity to generate over 3,2MWp at seven of its office, retail and industrial properties. Landmark assets These solar farms are at its landmark assets across the country, including Cape Town s V&A Waterfront, Constantia Village, Bayside Mall and Airport Industria. Its InfoTech building in Pretoria, Waterfall Mall in Rustenburg and Lincoln on the Lake office building in Umhlanga also benefit from solar power generating installations. A further four projects are underway, expected to generate some 2,7MWp of renewable energy. Besides its Northgate and Brooklyn Mall installations, it is also establishing solar farms at Kolonnade Shopping Centre in Pretoria and its office property at 33 Bree and De Waterkant in Cape Town. And this is only the beginning, over 70 buildings have been identified across its portfolio for possible future solar PV installations. A more sustainable built environment Our solar farms are one way we are creating a more sustainable built environment for South Africa. It also delivers on our ambitious commitment to sustainability, energy efficiency and green building, made on Buildings Day at COP21 in Paris last December We are committed to increasing solar energy generation, making all our 185 office buildings energy and water efficient, and ensuring all our long-term office investments and new developments are certified green buildings. We re already putting our commitment into action. We want to create buildings and workplaces that support the health, happiness and well-being of the people who use them places for people and businesses to thrive, Rudolf Pienaar, divisional director: office sector says. {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell \</doc>

HUNDREDS of pensioners were treated to a Christmas party hosted by President Jacob Zuma yesterday. The annual party was held at the Mnyakanya High School Sports Ground in Nkandla. Guests, some hobbling with walking sticks and in wheelchairs, enjoyed entertainment and gifts, including blankets and electrical appliances. The party was one of a number hosted by the president this past week to celebrate Christmas and the end of 2015. In a message to the nation, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said 2015 had brought the country closer to achieving a non-racial, non-sexist, democratic South Africa in which everyone, black and white, could live in peace, harmony and prosperity. "In a difficult global economic environment, we have been working to strengthen our economy through investment in infrastructure, providing support to key industrial sectors and developing our agricultural value chain. He said significant progress had been made in working with labour, business and communities towards introducing a national minimum wage, which he said was one of the key ways to reduce income inequality. He pointed out that Zuma led an engagement with major stakeholders to address key issues arising from the #FeesMustFall protests. "We are confident that working together with student organisations and management, we will find long-term solutions to all these challenges." Ramaphosa said South Africa was working with like-minded countries who had persisted to bring about fundamental transformation of the UN and other institutions of global governance. "Our country participated at the highest level in the COP21 Climate Change Conference in Paris, France. We have begun to feel the effects of climate change, which is impacting on water security, food security and economic development." A highlight for the country had been hosting the Forum for China-Africa Co-operation and the African Union Summit, and the country's ability to host major events. "The hosting of events of these magnitudes, coupled with the world-class infrastructure at our disposal, is an expression of the confidence that the world has in our country and its people," Ramaphosa said. \</doc>

AS WORLD leaders set out their plans to combat climate change at COP21 in Paris this week, an event closer to home has concentrated the minds of many on the benefits of renewable energy. On Monday, MEC of Economic Opportunities Alan Winde switched on a R20 million solar system at the V&A Waterfront that will reduce the carbon footprint of the popular destination. The 7 500m2 rooftop solar electricity system will power several key buildings, with an estimated total output of 1 640 000kWh of clean energy a year. It's true that renewable energy is not a cheap option, but prices have been dropping and the long term financial benefits are certain. Despite the costs, intermittent load shedding, a bad drought and a growing awareness of the necessity to cut an over-reliance on fuel-based energy which has been disastrous for the environment and climate, are some of the factors convincing local businesses and residents to turn to renewable energy. Solar systems are playing a major role in this slow but sure transformation. This is good news for the climate and environment, but there are other gains to be made too. It is estimated that over 2 000 jobs could be created in the manufacturing and installation of solar components over the next three to five years. Climate-related events cost the Western Cape R3 billion between 2003 and 2008, and there are indications that the last few years have been much worse. SEVERAL local concerns have become involved in the sector and are doing well in a slow and difficult economy. Overseas companies specialising in solar systems and other renewable energy strategies have moved into the province, bringing with them foreign investment, jobs and expertise. At a national level, South Africa has huge potential to make a difference using solar energy because of regular sunshine, a fairly good skills base and reasonable infrastructure. However, the future of our environment rests with every individual. It is time for more people who can afford it to turn to renewable energy. It is well worth the price. \</doc>

Climate change is changing the world we know and love. Our land, homes and food are at risk. With nearly a billion people already living in poverty, it is also the single biggest threat to the fight against hunger. As world leaders gather in Paris this December to hammer out a climate deal at the Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ), those representing Africa need to take a bold stance. Pastoral and indigenous communities across Africa are highly vulnerable to changes in climate. In December, Africa needs to stand together and negotiate for more funding for adaptation that will be adequate, predictable and much greater than what has been forthcoming up until now. Tough times Across the continent of Africa, we are already seeing threats to our food supply due to less reliable rainfall patterns, rising temperatures and a greater number of extreme weather events. Millions of Africans are already living with extreme poverty and our future as a continent depends on their survival. One such person is Mary Matupi, a farmer from the Rumphi district of northern Malawi. Matupi grows maize on a small piece of land, with a normal harvest yielding almost 80 bags weighing 50 kg each. However, in the last growing season she managed to produce only 15 bags due to a delay in the rains. Matupi told us that "if we don't act to stop climate change, harder times are still to come and we will suffer." Women like Matupi are the majority of smallholder producers across Africa - they are the face of 60 to 80 per cent of food production labour across sub-Saharan Africa. Erratic rainfall substantially impairs their capacity to provide for their families and their communities. Like millions of others, Matupi is simply trying to feed her family, her community and, ultimately, her country. Climate Change Impact Many places in Africa could experience even greater warming than the global average - a 4C warmer world could potentially be 6C warmer in some African countries. According to the United Nations' climate agency, the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP), changes in water availability and temperature will have a huge effect on African agriculture (where 97 per cent of production is rainfed and 60 per cent of the continental labour force works in this sector). With sea levels rising, many African low-lying countries are at risk of losing their farmland. The financial losses could be especially great in the coastal areas of Mozambique, Senegal and Morocco. According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), if global warming exceeds 3C globally, maize, millet and sorghum cropping areas will be unviable across much of Africa. We can also expect more frequent and more severe extreme weather events, with huge social and economic costs. Extreme weather conditions will also affect our diets, and likely result in more undernutrition and disease - a fact which governments cannot ignore. Therefore financing for technology (i.e. new drought-resistant crops, new farming techniques, early warning systems, seed storage protection programs, etc.), which could help African farmers cope, needs to be top of the agenda in Paris. One example of how technology and new methods have assisted farmers is the story of Kabugho Ruth from Uganda. Ruth says that adopting new methods of farming has already 'done wonders for her'. By constructing terraces in her coffee/banana garden, Ruth was able to triple her production. Imagine what financing can do for other small-scale farmers across the continent. Citizens are Taking Action African farmers are demonstrating both their resilience and commitment to climate action and they deserve our support. They are not alone. Across the continent the Africa People's Petition is aiming to collect one million signatures ahead of COP21 to demonstrate African support to prioritize climate change. Across the continent, organizations are mobilizing on World Food Day this 16 October as part of the Women Food Climate campaign, which highlights the role of women small scale producers in meeting food needs in Africa and their struggle against the impacts of climate change. Farmers like Matupi and Ruth need their governments to play their part by fighting for funds that can help mitigate the impact of climate change. Conservative estimates predict that Africa will need approximately US$95 billion a year by 2050. African leaders must avoid the same path of profit-led, destructive high-carbon development - formerly pursued by rich countries - which brought us to the current crisis. To achieve this we need visionary leaders who will go to the Paris negotiations calling for a global shift to renewable energy use. And they should be unrelenting in claiming the climate financing and technology that we need. Small-scale farming provides most of the food produced in Africa, as well as employment for 70 per cent of working people. On this World Food Day, we cannot allow our small scale farmers to be forgotten in Paris. A significant climate adaptation financing deal in Paris could change the lives of farmers like Mary Matupi and Kabugho Ruth forever and ensure the continent is able to feed itself. We cannot ignore this opportunity. \</doc>

Nominations for the WWF's Climate Solver 2016 competition in South Africa are now open. The initiative, now in its third year in South Africa... With record temperatures recorded during heatwave conditions in South Africa this January, and in the wake of promises made at COP21 in Paris, the need to reduce carbon emissions implicated in global warming could not be more urgent. In this respect, innovative technologies have a critical role to play. Climate Solver, now run in China, Sweden, India and South Africa, seeks to identify entrepreneurs developing innovative technologies to reduce carbon emissions and support energy access. The closing date for nominations is 14 March 2016 and the finalists will be announced in April/May 2016. The awards are a valuable opportunity for small businesses to showcase and develop partnerships to roll out their innovative technologies. Competition organiser Louise Scholtz, a project manager at WWF-SA, says: "Working collaboratively, the idea is that the Climate Solver initiative should impact positively on the capacity of small and medium-size enterprises to develop and roll-out innovative technologies that will help us tackle the climate crisis." Who is eligible to enter?  Small and medium enterprises whose technology could provide sustainable solutions to enhance energy access or lower carbon emissions by 20 million tonnes annually from 2023 onwards.  Companies that own their technology, have developed the product to post-pilot stage and have clear business plans for developing and promoting the product. Following a rigorous adjudication process, up to four Climate Solvers will be selected and their technologies showcased at an award ceremony in April/May 2016. WWF-SA will also produce a short video of each of the selected technologies that will be featured on the South African and International WWF Climate Solver webpages, and which the enterprise can use for promotional purposes. Previous winners In 2015, MellowCabs, a prototype for a public transport micro vehicle, Findmyway, a smartphone app to help commuters navigate public transport, and Eco MC2, a hydraulic energy storage system, were named as Climate Solvers.

At the end of the South African International Renewable Energy Conference (SAIREC), 3 600 delegates from 82 countries adopted a declaration expressing their conviction that the increased deployment of renewable energy will have a direct impact on improved global energy access, improved energy security, on mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and on climate change and sustainable economic development. SAIREC was the sixth meeting in the series of International Renewable Energy Conferences (IRECs) building upon successful outcomes in Abu Dhabi in 2013 (ADIREC), New Delhi in 2010 (DIREC), Washington in 2008 (WIREC), Beijing in 2005 (BIREC), and in Bonn in 2004 (Renewables 2004). SAIREC 2015 was hosted by the South African Department of Energy and the South African National Energy Development Institute (SANEDI) supported by the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st century (REN21). The delegates, including cabinet ministers, government delegations, representatives from the private sector, non-governmental organisations, academia, business, industry and international organisations, who participated in the SAIREC 2015 (October 4 - 7) in Cape Town, declared to upscale and mainstream renewables in order to achieve a global energy transition. As of today 2.9 billion people lack access to clean forms of cooking which needs to be addressed in order to achieve the universal access target. We note that to make universal access a reality by 2030, 1.3 billion people, out of which 621 million live in the sub-Saharan region, should be provided access to electricity, the delegates said in the declaration. The scale of the challenge requires that all approaches, including grid and off-grid solutions are taken into account and adopted based on an efficiency principle. Rural and urban demands can best be met with a diverse technology mix that takes full advantage of sub-Saharan Africa's exceptional and sustainable solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, and hydropower resources, the declaration said. The delegates declared that in order to make the global transition to renewable energy happen rapidly, the following elements are crucial: promoting transparent and effective procurement processes; advancing renewable energy globally; promoting skills transfer and development; securing financial resources; conducting research and development; prioritising regulatorywork Convention on Climate Change ( COP21 ) in Paris in December. \</doc>

Your Excellences, This year will go down as a watershed moment in global cooperation and coordination in the area of development. I have in mind the conference held in Addis Ababa in July 2015 which deliberated the very important matter of how we finance development. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in September 2015, laid out a promise to the 7.3 billion people living in this planet. Leaders committed to end poverty and hunger everywhere; combat inequalities within and among countries; build peaceful, just and inclusive societies; protect human rights; promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; and ensure the lasting protection of the planet and its natural resources. As leaders of G20 we have a moral responsibility to lead in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In this regard the Financing for Development Outcomes and the Addis Ababa Action Plan are extremely important to enable us to achieve these ambitious goals. Excellencies, South Africa is deeply honoured to be co-chairs of the G20 work on Development and Climate change. We have covered a lot of ground in this area of our work during the Turkish Presidency. I am happy that on development our deliberations here in Antalya mirror and take forward the Sustainable Development Agenda. The key highlights thereof include the following; Finance, Labour and Employment ministers taking firm steps to reduce youth unemployment by 15%, especially for the most vulnerable youth. The W20 met for the first time and came up with a programme on women and girl empowerment. The energy access plan focussing on Sub Saharan Africa and Reducing the cost of remittances; and enhancing financial inclusions which target SMMEs We also welcome the work on inclusive business which has the potential to enable business to increase their contribution to poverty eradication and reducing inequality. South Africa fully supports proposals for future work of the G20 on development. It would be important for the G20 to determine the unique value addition that the G20 brings to facilitating the implementation of relevant Sustainable Development Goals and associated targets. In this way, we would avoid duplicating what is being accomplished in other forums, while, at the same time, honouring our commitment to take decisive action to end poverty everywhere. In Africa, we took our 2063 Development Agenda a step further by adopting the 2015 year of women's empowerment and development towards agenda 2063. That empowerment framework contains a commitment to amongst others, push forward the economic empowerment of women; enhancing women's contribution and benefits from formal agriculture/agribusiness value chains and so on. In South Africa, we are implementing the National Development Plan, Vision 2030, which aims at eradicating poverty and reducing inequality by 2030. The plan focuses on many aspects that seek to improve the quality of life of our people by building infrastructure and improving the quality of social services such as education and health. With regard to climate change, South Africa fully supports France in its capacity as incoming COP21 This would mark the successful conclusion of the mandate from the Durban conference in 2011 which has significant meaning for South Africa. The mandate from that meeting was to adopt an internationally legally binding instrument under the UNFCCC that can comprehensively address climate change. For South Africa it is important that the multilateral process on climate change be respected and that it leads to the adoption of a fair agreement in Paris. This agreement should serve our twin objectives of ensuring environmental integrity, whilst protecting the development space of developing countries. A key element of the Paris Agreement would be the provision of financial resources, including technology transfer and capacity building to development countries. It is essential that existing financial commitments be honoured and that a clear roadmap be agreed to, on how the 100 billion US dollars in climate finance per annum by 2020, committed by developed countries, will be realised. It is essential as well that existing commitments covering the pre-2020 period are honoured and that the second commitment period to the Kyoto Protocol comes into force - preferably before COP21 /CMP11. In South Africa we are taking steps to reduce our carbon footprint. We have managed to attract investment of over fourteen million dollars for the construction of about six thousand megawatts of renewable energy. Colleagues, I am sure you will agree with me that Turkey has indeed the promise to have a presidency characterised by the three Is: Inclusiveness; Implementation, and Investment for growth. Please join me colleagues in extending our sincerest gratitude to Turkey as we welcome the Chinese as President. We cannot rest until growth is inclusive, sustained and high such that no human being suffers the indignity of poverty. I thank you. \</doc>

The International Council of Forest and Paper Associations (ICFPA) released a statement on climate change... The ICFPA will elaborate on the forest products industry's efforts at a COP21 side-event - "Assessing transparency and ambition in the land use and forestry sector", held at the EU Pavilion on 1 December at 2.30 pm. The side-event will be hosted by the ICFPA and the EU Joint Research Centre. The Paper Manufacturers Association of South Africa (PAMSA) promotes the renewability and recyclability of paper products both locally and in collaboration with global ICFPA members, says Jane Molony, PAMSA executive director. "Key to PAMSA's agenda is upholding sustainable forest management and paper production as an efficient and cost-effective solution to climate change mitigation." PAMSA's core focus areas include lobbying for fair and applicable legislation, boosting education and skills development as well as investing in research and innovation. The industry has made significant contributions to mitigate climate change. In addition to greenhouse gas (GHG) removals and stocking carbon in products, ICFPA members have achieved an impressive drop in their GHG emissions intensity: five percent since 2010/2011 and 17 percent since the 2004-2005 baseline year, as shown in the ICFPA 2015 Sustainability Progress Report (2013 data). The statement calls on governments and the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to recognise sustainable forest management and reforestation activities for their contribution to the global climate effort. It also requests the recognition of the efforts and achievements of the forest products industry to mitigate climate change. This includes the carbon neutrality of biomass harvested from sustainably managed forests and the need to provide for market-based mechanisms capable of valuing mitigation actions to incentivise the industry's potential contribution. The ICFPA's statement is the latest in a series of policy statements underwritten by its members associations. The ICFPA serves as a forum of global dialogue, coordination and cooperation. Together, ICFPA members represent over 90 percent of global paper production and more than half of global wood production. For more information, visit icfpa.org. Full policy statement \</doc>

CLIMATE change is a global challenge that will require an unprecedented |level of international co-operation to prevent the planet from warming more than 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. The 2\'b0C level is what global scientists have calculated to be the point at which a dangerous destabilisation of the Earth's climate system will really start to be felt. The projected impacts range from extreme weather events to an increase in vector-borne diseases and devastating impacts on biodiversity and the world's food production system. These impacts will differ across the globe, with many poorer countries tragically suffering the most from a problem they had the smallest role |in creating. It is therefore vitally important that an agreement is struck in Paris at COP21 that gives the world a sense of hope that this issue is finally being addressed and given the global political priority it deserves. The overall ambition for COP21 was set at COP17 in Durban, where it was agreed that a global treaty would be agreed upon by 2015, with all countries of the world having to make "intended nationally determined commitments" based on their specific conditions and abilities. Unfortunately, the emission reduction commitments which have so far been communicated will not be enough to keep us below the 2\'b0C warming level and could, in fact, put the world on a 3\'b0C warming trajectory. At the moment there is a carbon emissions gap of 12 to 14 gigatonnes between what science requires and what the different nation states of the world are putting on the table. The question that begs to be asked is: how can this gap can be closed if national governments are not prepared to do it? The City of Cape Town believes that tackling climate change is too much of an important issue to be left solely in the domain of international negotiations. A global climate change agreement that sets legally enforceable emission reduction targets in line with what science requires would certainly be a good first step, but it is at the local level where real action can be driven on this issue, and cities need to be empowered to do so. Already progress is being made in Cape Town in that we have seen our electricity usage decrease in the city as a whole from a 2007 level, while still enjoying economic growth of over 3 percent. Interestingly, it is projected that the greatest growth in emissions will come from our transport sector over the next 25 years, and tackling this will require, among other things, changes in our urban form, coupled with major interventions to increase car occupancy, more efficient vehicles and increasing public transport usage. A new "energy 2040" strategy, which sets carbon targets, has been adopted by the council. This makes Cape Town one of the first cities in the world to adopt carbon targets, but making sure we now reach them will require a major effort from all stakeholders. On the electricity front, Cape Town is determined to move ahead with procuring power from independent producers of renewable energy so that we can reach our target of sourcing at least |10 percent of our energy from renewable sources by 2020. We have initiated discussions with the National Department of Energy as cities in South Africa currently have to obtain permission if they wish to procure power from any other entity besides the state electricity utility, Eskom. This kind of monopoly control of our national energy system needs to be reformed if South African cities are to play a more meaningful role in securing their own clean-energy future. A potentially huge source of untapped energy is also staring at us from the rooftops of Cape Town which can accommodate solar water heaters and photovoltaic systems. Households and businesses which generate renewable energy through rooftop photovoltaic panels are now able to feed excess electricity back into the city's grid, allowing us to diversify our energy supply. Our ultimate goal is to see all residents generate renewable energy. We have already seen an uptake of these solutions in Cape Town, but we are currently considering ways in which it can be made easier and cheaper for households and businesses to implement these solutions on a wider scale. The assistance of national government in |these endeavours would be welcomed, and |we look forward to finally receiving the long awaited guidelines on small-scale embedded |generation from the Department of Energy |along with clarity over its national solar water heater programme. The city council is also preparing to roll out more energy-efficient solutions aimed at low-income households such as our ceilings retrofit programme which has improved energy usage, improved the health conditions of poor households and reduced our carbon emissions. We are committed to doing everything in our power to ensure that we live up to our global responsibility in tackling climate change. Our vision is to grow Cape Town into the green economy hub of Africa, where the ideas and the technologies for mitigating and adapting to climate change can be generated. We trust that the citizens of Cape Town will become active partners in all our endeavours. l Patricia de Lille is the mayor of Cape Town. \</doc>

The Minister of Environmental Affairs, Edna Molewa will attend the high-level segment of the 6th Special Session of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) in Cairo, Egypt from 18 to 19 April 2016. The special session is being held under the theme: "Agenda 2030 and the Paris Agreement: from policy to implementation in Africa." The meeting will provide an opportunity for ministers and experts to deliberate on how to move forward with regard to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by the 193 members of the United Nations. The global climate deal reached at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC) ( COP21 ) last year, and its implications for Africa, features prominently on the AMCEN agenda. Other priority issues and initiatives on the agenda for the AMCEN include the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative and the implementation of the African Common Strategy on Combating Illegal Exploitation and Trade in Wild Fauna and Flora "This issue is of particular importance to South Africa considering that we are hosting the 17th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES COP17)," says Minister of Environmental Affairs Edna Molewa. "The African common strategy facilitates and harnesses the collective action needed for us to combat the illicit trade in wildlife that is decimating species on our continent, by disrupting and dismantling the transnational, organized criminal syndicates involved," adds Minister Molewa. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and INTERPOL estimate that "wildlife crime, comprising fauna and flora and including logging, poaching and trafficking of a wide range of animals, amounts to between USD70bn and USD213bn a year." At the end of the special session AMCEN 'will adopt a declaration, a set of decisions and key messages reflecting the discussions under the various issues on the agenda.'

As President Jacob Zuma touched down in Paris before the UN climate talks, environmental organisations descended on Durban's beachfront to raise awareness about the event. The action, from Suncoast Beach to uShaka, which was part of the People's Global Climate March taking place at the weekend, saw representatives of Environmental Network KZN, South Durban Community Environmental Alliance, Greenpeace Volunteers Durban, 350.org Durban, LaMercy Action Group, Biowatch SA, Earthlife Africa Durban, and Community Connect join forces to draw attention to the start of the UN Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) today. They joined activists from Australia, S\'c3\Â£3o Paulo, Berlin and Hong Kong, among others. Durban-based Greenpeace Africa volunteer Delwyn Pillay said the march was not simply for those present, but for millions of others all over the world, especially those in Paris where a march had been forbidden by the French government for security reasons owing to the recent terrorist attacks. Action "Every step we took, we marched for millions of people ... We are building momentum ... Hopefully this helps to take bums off seats and galvanises people into action. We can't wait on the politicians. They are failing us." He said what happened in Paris would be a significant step in determining the direction for international climate action. "The effects of climate change such as increased temperatures, rising sea levels, unstable weather patterns are already being experienced around the world. "KwaZulu-Natal is already suffering an historic drought and water shortages. In rural districts the drought is creating havoc for people, livestock, wild animals and ecosystems." Vee Govender, the Environmental Network KZN co-ordinator, said it was up to everyone to play a role in halting climate change. "We cannot do it simply by changing light bulbs and recycling paper; we have to stop prioritising big business profits over the planet and its people's future." He said unless carbon emissions were capped, the 2\'c2\'baC benchmark to "save the planet"would be far exceeded. "We are coming to the end of the road now where looking the other way will no longer help us. "Unless all the countries with huge emission like China and the US decide to take serious steps, we do not have a chance," Govender said. \</doc>

Huge solar power projects take a shine to the Northern Cape Arrays of curved mirrors near Upington collect the sun's heat and store it in molten salt until needed, writes Clean energy was high on the agenda of the COP21 climate change summit NANDU Bhula started work as an engineer underground in the mines. Now he is chasing the sun, among those at the forefront of South Africa's renewable energy programme - acclaimed as one of the best and biggest in the world. Standing amid a quarter of a million gleaming mirrors in the Northern Cape, Bhula, the CEO of Acwa Power Solafrica Bokpoort Concentrated Solar Power, points out its "green" power plant on land that was empty fields just two years ago. "I believe this plant can revolutionise thinking since it has the potential to show what concentrated solar power can deliver," said Bhula. At Bokpoort, curved mirrors collect the heat of the sun, which gets stored in molten salt at 400\'b0C. When needed during peak times, the heat is released to make steam and drive turbines - like a traditional power plant, but with zero emissions into the atmosphere. The plant, which went live on November 13, can supply the equivalent of 100000 small households. It is the third of its type in South Africa; all three are in the Northern Cape. Heinrich van Niekerk, a manager at Bokpoort, said: "What we are building now would have been science fiction five years ago, and what we will be building in five years hasn't been invented yet." To most South Africans, "solar power" means photovoltaic panels mounted on rooftops with battery storage, as can be seen in projects such as the low-income Kuyasa project in Cape Town. Dozens of photovoltaic projects have been approved for South Africa's renewable energy programme, in addition to the household panels already in use. Solar-thermal plants such as Bokpoort, which are more expensive to build than photovoltaic projects and sell power at higher tariffs, have the potential to hit the big league, with the added bonus of promoting industrialisation and creating jobs. Climate change expert and former minister of environmental affairs Valli Moosa, a minority investor through Lereko Metier in Bokpoort, said: "Concentrated solar power is the renewable technology of choice. It has real potential to supply electricity on an industrial scale, and with storage it can supply electricity during peak demand." The Bokpoort plant, 125km southeast of Upington, has the biggest storage capacity in the world for its type of power station, at 9.3 hours. Another solar-thermal plant with tower technology dominates the horizon on the other side of Upington, like a periscope above the red sand. As South Africa's ageing coal-fired power stations lumber around the energy field struggling to perform, these new players are changing the game. Renewable energy used to be on the fringes of the action. However, nearly 100 projects - solar, wind, hydro, landfill gas and biomass - have been set up or will be. Green power projects already supply electricity to South African consumers on the grid, reducing load-shedding. The hub of the solar rush is the Northern Cape, rated one of the best places in the world for sunlight. It has already attracted billions in investment. Flights to Upington are full of foreign engineers in khaki pants and boots and the occasional Stetson, as contractors flood its one-donkey towns. The menu of a guesthouse in Groblershoop is in English and Spanish. Even though a project like Bokpoort is small scale at 50MW - compared to South Africa's peak demand of up to 38000MW - Bhula is confident it will prove that renewable energy can be supplied reliably and around the clock. "There is definitely an appetite to bring in more renewables and quickly," he said. "At the moment it is sufficient to build small projects concurrently, take small bites at the [energy deficit] cake and finish quickly, rather than trying to swallow the cake in one go." Bhula, who used to work for Eskom, still sees a role for fossil-fired and nuclear stations in the energy mix. "In my view, by the time Medupi is fully operational, the tariffs for [concentrated solar power] will reach parity with the fossil-fired stations." Eskom is among the players in the mix to construct six more concentrated solar power plants in the Northern Cape. Saliem Fakir, head of the policy and futures unit at the World Wide Fund for Nature South Africa, said: "South Africa is pioneering some of the largest solar-thermal projects in the world. The renewable energy procurement programme is ... stimulating a whole new economy." Pancho Ndebele, the local developer behind the concept of a "solar valley" near Upington, said there was one operational job per megawatt of concentrated solar power produced. "South Africa could become the global leader in manufacturing most of the concentrated solar power components if we seize this opportunity." For example, about 1000 people have been employed and roughly R1.6-billion invested locally by Bokpoort to date, benefiting seven of the small towns nearby. Clean energy was high on the agenda of the COP21 climate change summit in Paris this week. The Department of Energy has a target of 30% renewable energy by 2025 and it looks like these phenomenal independent projects under its direction deserve their place in the sun.

PARIS: The Paris Agreement on climate control was a step on a long road, and there were frustrating and disappointing parts, but it was progress, Greenpeace International executive director Kumi Naidoo said yesterday. "It sometimes seems that the countries of the UN can unite on nothing, but nearly 200 countries have come together and agreed a deal," he said. The human race had joined in a common cause, but it was what happened after the conference that really mattered. "The Paris Agreement is only one step on a long road, and there are parts of it that frustrate and disappoint me, but it is progress. This deal alone won't dig us out the hole we're in, but it makes the sides less steep," Naidoo said. One hundred and ninety-five countries at the 21st Conference of Parties ( COP21 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted the historic agreement in Paris on Saturday to address greenhouse gas emissions for the post-2020 period, while increasing countries' ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change. The agreement aims to limit global warming to "well below" 2\'c2\'baC, with a promise of "efforts" to try to keep it below 1.5\'c2\'baC. Naidoo said the deal set out the objective of limiting temperature rises to 1.5\'c2\'baC, but the emissions targets on the table "take us closer to three degrees". "That's a critical problem, but it's one with a solution. Renewable energy is already doing heavy lifting across the globe, but now its moment must come. It's the only technology mentioned in the Paris Agreement. There's a yawning gap in this deal, but it can be bridged by clean technology. "We're in a race between the roll-out of renewables and rising temperatures, and the Paris Agreement could give renewables a vital boost. The wheel of climate action turns slowly, but in Paris it has turned," he said. "This is a time for urgent action. The climate clock is ticking and the window of opportunity is closing fast." - ANA \</doc>

AHEAD of COP21 - also known as the 2015 Paris Climate Conference - South African environmentalists say negotiators need to adopt at least five top issues if climate change is to be tackled successfully. World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) South Africa national climate change officer Louise Naude said the issue of equity when it came to developing and developed countries needed to be resolved. "The rules are different. While the developed countries like the US and most countries in the European Union are historically responsible for our current situation, developing countries are saying they still need room to develop and grow their economies." Naude said South Africa was one of the countries, along with China, India and Brazil, that believed they still needed to continue emerging into a developed nation and thus needed to continue their emissions. Wildlife and Environment Society of South Africa spokesman Morgan Griffiths said there needed to be more commitment from developed nations to assisting developing nations to reduce their emissions by contributing to the green climate fund. He said developed nations had promised to contribute a total of $100-million (R1.4-billion), but this funding had still not materialised. "There have been so many promises about funding in the past. In some cases the funding never turns up, or if it does, it comes with certain limitations, such as the developing nation must first open up trade. "Receiving this funding will help this country adapt better towards climate change." Wilderness Foundation Africa chief executive Andrew Muir said another issue that needed to be tackled was the challenge faced by low-lying counties, especially islands put at risk by climate change. He said that last year the Carteret Islanders of Papua New Guinea had become the world's first entire community to be displaced by climate change. In the next decade or two, more islands would be at risk of displacement. "Climate change is happening a lot faster than scientists have estimated ... There will be record-high temperatures and droughts will occur more frequently. South Africa is already 2\'b0C hotter," Naude said. \</doc>

SOLUTIONS for the massive drop in coal exports to countries like China were discussed at yesterday's panel discussion on the future of Africa's coal industry. This was tackled during the second day of the Investing in African Mining Indaba. Panel moderator Fabio Gabrieli said coal trade had decreased by 60 million tons to 870 million tons last year. It is expected that the EU and Chinese imports may |dip further between 2016 |and 2020. Under these circumstances, Gabrieli posed the question to the panel on what Africa can still do to encourage investment in coal. Exxaro Resources chairperson Mxolisi Mgojo said |government legislation was one of the key ways to improve the current situation in mining. "Things like permits for new mines should also be processed timeously," said Mgojo. He added that the industry should also not underestimate the effect technology can |have in disrupting coal demand. He said that a few years ago, few people would not |have believed connectivity would be inexpensive enough to make it accessible for |everyone. "Today, every person on the street has a cellphone." "As coal producer, you shouldn't underestimate the power of technology. Solar cities are already self-|sustained and selling power back into the grid. "If you spend billions on a resource, you want to know it is still relevant in the next 10 to 30 years," said Mgojo. Metals and mining company South 32 chairperson Mike Fraser said that although there is a challenge for the future of coal and investment opportunities, one solution would be to focus on a variety of markets. "When you consider investment in carbon conservation, coal is still important. Part of the conversation at COP21 was the support for low-carbon options, and coal is part of this energy mix," said Fraser. He added that coal's low cost still makes it a viable investment. Anglo American chairperson for SA Coal Themba Mkhwanazi also said coal still had its place in the economy. "We live in a world that will have 2 billion more people living on it by 2050. Globally, only 50 percent of people have access to electricity. "In emerging markets, coal is still a positive energy |supply being low on cost, reliable and abundant," said Mkhwanazi.

The column by Keith Bryer on October 28 refers. Yes, CO2 is necessary for life, so is water, but both can be destructive in too large quantities. The consensus among climate scientists is that the changes being experienced globally are due to people and our propensity for fossil-fuel use. At more than 400 parts per million carbon dioxide equivalent gases in the atmosphere, more solar energy is being absorbed by the planet than is being reflected away from it, leading to gradual but accelerating warming that is increasingly expressed in the much-discussed problems of flooding, wildfires, droughts, crop failure, disease spread and migration; topics that often confuse and depress. The writer makes much of the fallout between Patrick Moore, who is not a climate scientist, and Greenpeace. This is a distraction that proves nothing more than that humans are political animals with opinions and motives. What is of real consequence is that many of those political animals in the form of world leaders and negotiators are meeting in Paris in early December for the 21st Conference of Parties ( COP21 ), and that despite the increasing solid evidence that we are fast approaching a climate tipping point, they are, again, unlikely to make the radical decisions that could possibly help avert catastrophic consequences. Cape Town is a high-energy use city in a country with a very unhealthy reliance on fossil fuels. It is fitting that the residents, businesses, politicians, officials and visitors do not wait passively to be led into a very uncertain future, but take a firm stand and demonstrate an unequivocal demand for the necessary policy changes. To symbolise this and join in solidarity with communities round the planet, many Cape Town NGOs, environmental and social, as well as ordinary concerned citizens, will be marching to Parliament on November 29 after gathering near the CPUT at 11am. Permission has been granted. There will be an informal picnic at the Company's Garden afterwards, where there will be an opportunity to discuss concerns for the present and future.

Orange and ENGIE have signed a partnership covering the expansion of the rural electricity grid and ENGIE's optimisation of energy supplied to Orange's telecoms infrastructure in Africa... The deal was signed by St\'e9phane Richard, CEO of Orange, and Isabelle Kocher, deputy CEO and chief operating officer of ENGIE. The deal between Orange and ENGIE - both official partners of COP21 - reasserts the companies' willingness to use their technological knowledge to achieve sustainable progress and economic and social development in Africa. The strength of the partnership is based on Orange's expertise as an international telecoms carrier present in 19 countries in Africa and the Middle East, and ENGIE's know-how as an international player in the the energy sector. Major challenge Orange is keen to take part in such a major challenge to expand the electricity grid in Africa and encourage responsible power consumption on the continent based on the expertise of ENGIE, one of the world's leading energy companies. ENGIE currently supplies 760MW of power in Africa and aims to become one of the major energy leaders on the continent by 2025 with several major projects planned. To reinforce its position as the leading independent producer of electricity in Africa, ENGIE has created a dedicated Business Unit with around a hundred employees. Based on Orange's expertise as a telecoms carrier and ENGIE's experience in renewable energy production, aggregation and maintenance, the two Groups will trial a range of domestic power supply solutions for rural populations that could then be marketed by Orange. Individual solar kits These solutions could, for instance, include individual solar kits and small-scale, local electricity networks. The service could then be billed via mobile using Orange Money. The trials will allow the companies to validate the technical solutions, the sales and distribution models, and the economic feasibility of the service before making it available on a larger scale. Orange and ENGIE are keen to play their role as socially responsible players in Africa, where an estimated 69% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa and 90% of the rural population in the same region have no access to the electricity grid. ENGIE supports Orange with its ongoing project to optimise the power supply of its technical infrastructure in Africa. ENGIE will offer its expertise to improve Orange's energy efficiency. Orange's objectives are to pursue its stable and secure power supply programme, reduce its energy footprint, and contain costs despite rapidly growing energy requirements. \</doc>

UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon pleaded with world leaders to put a stop to more than 20 years of "half-measures and indecision" at the opening of Paris climate change talks yesterday. "This is a pivotal moment for the future of your countries, your people and our common home. You can no longer delay," Ban declared on the first day of the 21st conference of the parties ( COP21 ) of the UN Convention on Climate Change. "I urge you to instruct your negotiators to choose the path of compromise and consensus. Bold climate action is in the national interest of every single country represented at this conference." The time for brinkmanship was over, the former South Korean foreign minister declared as nearly 150 world leaders lined up to each give three-minute messages on their expectations for the Paris conference. "You are here today to write the script for a new future ... a political moment like this may not come again." Although more than ' nations had now submitted national climate action plans to reduce emission levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, Ban said this was not enough to prevent a 2\'c2\'baC annual temperature increase by the turn of the century. "The world's small island developing states have even less room to manoeuvre, and are desperately asking the world to keep the temperature rise to 1.5\'c2\'baC. "Let me be clear: the fate of the Paris agreement rests with you. We cannot afford indecision, half-measures or merely gradual approaches ... History is calling," he said. In his three-minute speech yesterday, President Jacob Zuma said the Paris meeting was of "immense importance to South Africa" as it maintained the momentum reached at the COP17 climate summit in Durban four years ago. As Ban was speaking, Danish artist Jens Galschiot was putting the finishing touches to a sculpture that depicted a 6m-tall polar bear impaled on an oil pipeline in the shape of a graph of carbon emissions dating from 1850. The copper sculpture is due to be unveiled at the Cit\'c3\Â£9 Universitaire in Paris on Thursday. The two-week conference ends on December 11. \</doc>

President Jacob Zuma says climate finance must be scaled up significantly beyond the $100bn mark for the post-2020 period... "It is a legal obligation to support all developing countries under the UN Convention. Should the developed nations fail to play their part, an impression will be created that the climate change crisis was caused by a few privileged nations who are not sympathetic about its impact on the majority," said the president. He urged developed countries, given their historical responsibility, to take the lead and honour their existing commitments. South Africa has released its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) which is in accordance with national circumstances and priorities. These include poverty eradication, job creation, energy security and environmental protection. Zuma said the INDCs of the members of the Group of 77 plus China, chaired by South Africa, also reflect the overriding priorities of poverty eradication and the need for sustainable development. "We must succeed for the sake of future generations," said Zuma. He said COP21 is of immense importance to South Africa as it builds on the historic and bold decisions that were taken at COP17 in Durban in 2011. "Our mandate from Durban includes three critical areas: closing the ambition gap in the pre-2020 period, urgent entry into force of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, and the adoption of a new agreement for the post-2020 period. "Paris must deliver a legally binding agreement, which is based on equity and differentiation, and which will enable ambitious implementation actions through the provision of finance, technology and capacity-building support from developed countries," said Zuma. Since developing countries already experience climate change impacts, Zuma said the Paris agreement cannot focus only on mitigation. "A Global Goal for Adaptation must be part of the agreement. Solidarity with developing countries that suffer loss and damage also needs to be reflected in the agreement," said the president. Meanwhile, he reiterated South Africa's deepest condolences to the government and people of France following the recent terrorist attacks in Paris. "Our thoughts are also with all other nations that have faced tragic terror attacks. Global unity and action against terrorism within the ambit of the United Nations is imperative and urgent," said the president. \</doc>

With the U.N. Climate Change conference later this year in Paris fast approaching, Zimbabwe's climate change commitments face the slow progress on an issue that continues to stalk other developing countries - climate finance. As it prepares for the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ), Zimbabwe - like many others in the global South - is grappling with radical climate shifts that have seen devastating exchanges of floods and droughts every year, and still awaits green bailout funds from developed nations, with officials here telling IPS, "this support should come in the forms of technology." The country's halting progress on the climate front is being blamed by local climate researchers on the country's failure to invest in state-of-the-art climate monitoring technology. More still needs to be done as the country heads to Paris, says Sherpard Zvigadza, Programmes Manager, Climate Change and Energy, for the Harare-based ZERO Regional Environment Organisation (ZERO). "The country [Zimbabwe] needs to partner with those in the private sector who are making an effort to develop projects or reduce their footprint, and implement a reward-based strategy so that both individuals and corporates are encouraged to support the government's policies" - Steve Wentzel, director of Carbon Green Africa "Zimbabwe should strengthen systematic observation, ensuring improved real-time observations and availability of meteorological data for research," Zvigadza told IPS. These concerns arise from what is seen here as repeated failure by the poorly-funded Meteorological Services Department to adequately monitor climate patterns and put in place effective early warning systems for disaster preparedness. However, these constraints have not stopped Zimbabwe, which for the past two decades has seen a wilting of international financial support for crafting ambitious climate change interventions. Recurrent climate-induced disasters have shown that this not the time to treat anything as "business as usual", says Elisha Moyo, principal climate change researcher in the Climate Change Management Department of the Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate. And these efforts have brought together civic society organisations (CSOs), farmers and ordinary Zimbabweans in what is expected to shape the country's negotiations in Paris. CSOs point to the fact that Zimbabwe has been identified by GLOBE International, which brings together legislators from all over the world, as having on the most comprehensive environmental laws in southern Africa, and say that this should be a stimulus for helping the country make greater strides in climate governance. According to a climate ministry brief issued last month, Zimbabwe's climate policy seeks, among others, weather and climate modelling, vulnerability and adaptation assessments, mitigation and low carbon development. "There is a need to expand current projects as well as develop new projects throughout the country for the country to position itself to be able to raise funding for these developments," said Steve Wentzel, director of Carbon Green Africa, a Zimbabwe-based company established to facilitate the generation of carbon credits through validating Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) projects. "The country needs to partner with those in the private sector who are making an effort to develop projects or reduce their footprint, and implement a reward-based strategy so that both individuals and corporates are encouraged to support the government's policies," Wentzel told IPS. "If the country is serious about moving away from business as usual, awareness raising is key for all stakeholders, including the general population as well as industry," Zvigadza told IPS. "A vigorous campaign is needed across the country. More importantly, Zimbabwe's national climate change response strategy has to be operationalised so that the challenges are addressed according to different local circumstances." Yet, by the climate ministry's own admission, progress has remained slow due to the continuing problem of lack of funds, which Moyo believes should be tapped from the richer nations. "As Africa, and supported by other developing countries from other regions, we believe the rich countries have not yet shouldered a fair share of the burden and should lead by example, in terms of cutting emissions and also providing financial support to poorer nations as stated in the Climate Change Convention," Moyo told IPS. And Zimbabwe certainly does need the money. The climate ministry is already wallowing in reduced state funding after the Finance Ministry slashed its national budget from 93 million dollars in 2014 to 52 million this year. Meanwhile, domestic economic considerations are one of the obstacles to implementation of the country's troubled climate change policy. Despite seeking to promote clean energy, power generation is still largely fossil fuel-based, where instead of cutting emissions, relatively cheaper coal feeds power generation. The climate ministry policy brief says the country needs to "reduce greenhouse gas emissions from energy production transmission and use", but economic hardships have made this a tall order where millions also rely on highly-polluting firewood for fuel. "We are compiling the "intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) and have been conducting consultations and data collection around the country especially with reference to the energy sector, which has a high potential of emission reductions through adoption of renewable energy wherever possible," Moyo told IPS. COP21 in Paris, and to be submitted to the United Nations by September. For its climate change ambitions to succeed, Zimbabwe must go back to the grassroots, says Wentzel, but unfortunately "there is a lack of knowledge of climate changes issues," he told IPS. As Washington Zhakata, Zimbabwe's lead climate change negotiator put it: "The road to the Paris summit remains unclear with many stumbling blocks on the road." Edited by Phil Harris \</doc>

KEITH Bryer's: Agreeing on Climate Change will be a very costly affair for all of us applies. First let me state up front, that my opinion is neither, for, nor against the whole sorry misunderstanding of what I call the Â£sinine and puerile bun fight' about 'global warming'. If it's going to be all 'jaw' and no Â£ction with positive, confident alternative solutions', what's the point? We all know, from previous Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP, over the years that COP21 in Paris will be an abysmal failure, and a great indictment not of the 'toothless' UN, but of the West's cynical, power and money manipulators, who use taxpayers' money ultimately to pay UN salaries. In response to the advertisement for 'public hearings' to 'stop negative impact of climate change' put out by the Department of Environmental Affairs, my written submission, stating an entirely feasible alternative strategy to roll back at least half of all greenhouse gas emissions presently entering the atmosphere to 'pre industrial revolution' levels in 15 to 20 years, has been ignored entirely. Can you see a pattern emerging here? So much, for the 'narrative of concern' for the environment, by environmental scientists and government-sponsored greening strategists. They have no idea of what causes climate change, they just assume they do, if taking 'positions for leverage' to Paris is anything to go by. Let me try and understand where Keith Bryer is coming from, as stated with his 'blindingly obvious' oxymoron. n "Agreeing on climate change will be massively expensive and turn the world economy upside down." I would have thought that someone in Mr Bryer's position would have guessed by now that the 'world economy' has been terminally 'upside down' since the 'criminally sponsored' world financial melt down of 2008. I suggest that "massively expensive" without even a summary of a 'bad plan' to 'manage the limits' agreed on for an increase from present 'limits' of carbon emissions, demonstrates a great and total loss of traditional human intelligence and wisdom in seeking solutions to all our 'self-inflicted challenges'. n "The cost of food, fuel, building costs, just about everything would rise." I would have thought it 'blindingly obvious' that prices of everything, have spiralled out of control from way back in the 1970s of the last century. Comment: In 1972 I bought an 'out of the box' SWB Land Rover for R2 500 cash. I was young and excited about the world. n "Taxes will rise too." Income tax, and all other indirect and hidden taxes have risen exponentially in line with monopolistic practices and the cost of government services for the last 20 years. When does the gold laying goose lie down and say: no more!! n "The private sector will be faced with yet more regulations and backed by the draconian threat of fines." I tell you, Mr Bryer there are dragons cancerously eating away at us while the 'private sector and government lackeys' of those who control the money supply, feast on champagne and caviar. The very people who don't give a hoot about funding welfare, COP21 or anything else, are recipients ultimately, of the hard-earned 'taxes' we pay. "Cast thy bread upon the waters, and it shall return in many days with fat commissions and interest." The 'saintly' moneylenders' refrain!!! Which brings me to the 'pressing matters' Mr Bryer brings up about the 'Middle East, mass migrations into Europe, the Ukraine shambles, and the Taliban resurgence in Afghanistan'. Can you believe that there are people cashing in, wholesale and retail, from war, refugees 'people smuggling', the Ukraine and the poppy fields in Afghanistan? Don't you see a pattern emerging here? Whatever happens at this much vaunted, upcoming Paris "whore fest", nothing will change. The token $2 billion (about R27bn) will hardly cover the 'party'. The UN will still be toothless, the participants "shagged" to a standstill, and not one soul will be any the wiser - in the 'developing' or the 'developed' world - about the direction in which we the sheep, and the planet, are being led. Can it be the precipitous vortex of a 'black hole' in distant space? Be of cheer Mr Bryer, no offence, your opinion about COP21 will be exonerated, but for all the wrong reasons. Ultimately our voices of reason are never heard. n Why don't we have a clarification session about 'climate change' not 'global warming' because that is something we can't at this stage, influence if it's occurring? My e-mail is: HYPERLINK mailto:biocap200390@yahoo.com biocap200390@yahoo.com Paul Driessen's opinion piece (Business Report, September 28) tries to use a basic principle of capitalism - the company is entitled to maximise its profit - to show that climate change is not a problem, prophets of doom are. How the problem of profiteering can be solved I cannot say. But the existence of one problem does not disprove the existence of another. The Earth's climate is changing rapidly and this change will affect people all over the planet. Driessen does not include in his sums the massive profits to be made by companies rebuilding flooded coastal cities. Driessen is correct in saying that climate change has been real throughout Earth and human history. Until now, however, there have been natural causes and significant changes have been gradual, allowing humans, animals and plants to adapt. Now change is taking place over a couple of centuries. In the last paragraph of his piece Driessen demonstrates his ignorance of the climate change problem. "It has little or nothing to do with carbon dioxide," he writes. Physicists know carbon dioxide is central to the problem. He mentions the sun but does not realise that energy from the sun is absorbed by carbon dioxide atoms. More carbon dioxide atoms in the atmosphere mean there is more energy stored in the atmosphere and movements in the atmosphere become more energetic. Put simply, rain that fell in a fertile valley may land somewhere else. That is climate change. The first calculations of this effect resulting from human emissions of carbon dioxide were published in 1896 by Swedish physical chemist Svante Arrhenius. And still many people have not got the message. Since Paul Driessen's anti-climate change piece flew directly in the face of the overwhelming majority of climate scientists I was at a loss to categorise it scientifically. However, persevering to the end through his disturbing anxieties about the worldwide green takeover (the greens under the bed!), I came to the conclusion that it would do rather well as a case study in severe paranoia. As regards the articles by Paul Driessen and Keith Bryer, it is well to comment on an article dated March 14, 2011 by Drew Zahn of Worldnet Daily titled, "Look how much it costs to lower temp by one degree". New calculations applied to a US Senate report, reveal the Environment Protection Agency's (EPA) plan to combat global warming through regulation of greenhouse gases would, theoretically, take over $700 trillion (R9 quadrillion) to drop the earth's temperature only 1\'c2\'baC. The report released in 2010 by Republican senator James Ihnofe of Oklahoma, then a ranking minority member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, quotes the EPA's statistics and experts to break down the numbers, including one researcher who called the plan of the administration of President Barack Obama "absurd". Citing a study by the EPA's Dr Linda Chappell and various other sources, the Senate report asserts: "EPA has called the consequences of regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, Â£bsurd', affecting 6.1 million sources, introducing $78 billion in annual costs, causing Â£t least a decade or longer' of permit delays, 'slowing' construction nationwide for years, 'introducing burdens that are administratively infeasible, overwhelming', that will Â£dversely affect national economic development', while impacting sources 'not appropriate at this point to ever consider regulating'." And the net effect of the greenhouse gas regulations that the Republican senators are decrying? The EPA calculates in 75 Federal Register 25 495: "Global mean temperature is estimated to be reduced by 0.006 to 0.015\'c2\'baC by 2100." So, in effect, by the year 2100, 90 years worth of $78bn per year in spending would have lowered the earth's temperature by about one-hundredth of a degree Celsius. In other words, the US would be paying for a global warming elixir that reduces temperatures at the net rate of $700 trillion per degree. The author goes on: "You've suspected it, now is the proof: A top meteorologist's documents on how 'global warming' is just a cynical wealth grab." Since obviously the above will be impossible, the global warming lobby will in time tell us that global populations will have to be reduced to some 500 million "to save the planet". This was a proposal at the Global 2000 conference in the 1980s. This was supposed to be achieved by war, starvation, diseases, poisoning of the environment and the victims will be blamed for it. Brave New World indeed! \</doc>

South Africa and the European Commission on Thursday, 16 July 2015, stressed the importance of intensifying urgent action to address the issue of climate challenge at international, regional, national and grassroots levels... Minister of Environmental Affairs Edna Molewa and Maros Sefcovic, VP of the European Commission for the Energy Union, met to discuss cooperation on climate change in Johannesburg. Minister Molewa conveyed government's appreciation to the EU for its ongoing support to a number of environmental projects in South Africa and elsewhere in Africa. The two confirmed that environment and climate change remain a priority area for bilateral cooperation, as outlined in the South Africa - European Union (SA-EU) Strategic Partnership of 2007. The Department of Environmental Affairs said they agreed to enhance their dialogue in these areas, notably covering the green and ocean economy in the context of the SA EU Forum on Environment and Sustainable Development. Minister Molwea and Sefcovic noted progress in development cooperation with EU support through non-governmental organisations to projects ranging from waste management to eco-tourism and permaculture gardens to carbon farming, with many of these projects being co-funded by the South African government. The department said the EU reiterated its support to South Africa's infrastructure development through the Infrastructure Investment Programme for South Africa (IIPSA), which is managed by the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA). The programme focusses on sustainable energy, transport, waste and water management. South Africa is also one of the six beneficiary countries under the EU-funded SWITCH Africa Green programme implemented by UN agencies, targeting sustainable consumption and production practices. The department said the minister and VP reaffirmed their shared commitment to secure the adoption of an ambitious new protocol under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at COP21 /CMP11 in Paris in December. "This would mark the successful conclusion of the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, upon which the current round of multilateral negotiations is based," it said. South Africa welcomed the EU's pledge to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030 as compared to 1990. South Africa is finalising its preparations to submit its INDC to the UN in time for inclusion in the UN's synthesis report on the aggregate effect of the INDCs. The contribution would include not only mitigation, but also adaptation and means of implementation, which are of central importance in the current negotiations, said the department. The minister's and VP's delegations also visited the Khangezile School in Springs to get a practical example of South Africa-EU cooperation with regard to the application of green technologies in community centres. \</doc>

The City of Cape Town notes the discussion and narrative surrounding the Cape Flats Aquifer (CFA), the Philippi Horticultural Area (PHA) and our water management efforts. Our sustainable water management efforts permeate through all of our operations and this also holds true |for our commitment to the PHA and aquifer. For instance, through partnership with our residents and the implementation of the water conservation and water-demand management strategy in 2007, we have managed to keep our overall water loss down to 15 percent. This is lower than all other metros in the country, which maintain a combined average water loss of up to 30 percent. In fact, the success of the City's Water Conservation and Water Demand Management Programme was lauded at COP21 in Paris late last year. In addition, due to the drought conditions, Level 2 water restrictions were implemented at the start of January. This has been a proactive step with a view to sustainable water management. In light of our overall approach to water-demand management, it must |be emphasised that the CFA is highly valued and well understood. A strategy is in place to enhance the functioning |of the CFA, to improve maintenance of the ecosystem, to expand small-scale community supply, and to enhance |the use of bulk water supply through artificial recharge. Short-, medium- |and long-term recommendations were made to improve the condition of |the CFA. In general, with regards to the protection and conservation of the CFA, and in particular the PHA aquifer, any proposed urban development would be approved or turned down based on |the principles of sustainable drainage-system (SuDS) practices. This includes water management practices and facilities designed to drain surface water in a manner that will provide a more sustainable approach than has been the conventional practice of just routing stormwater run-off through a pipe to a water course. Any proposed developments would also include stormwater storage and infiltration tools, comprising ponds, swales, permeable paving and other sustainable drainage features that |will encourage the infiltration of rain water into the PHA aquifer and also encourage the reuse of grey water. The City remains committed to sustainable economic and urban development, the design of which is best implemented through due process - a system which the City has become renowned for within South Africa. Our decision-making structures are built to consider the contextual demands of Cape Town's urban environment within the broader municipal framework, thereby ensuring that actions consider the broad and long-term interests of Cape Town residents in a balanced manner.

As world leaders prepared to discuss a major climate change treaty in Paris, Germany had several especially windy days, which drove the share of wind energy in the German grid above 50% and the spot price of electricity to zero, or so close to it as to make no difference.All that's missing to make 100% renewable energy feasible is cheap and ample storage that would help to smooth supply. That requirement no longer looks impossible. Read: India can cut carbon output - with helpFew countries have the political will and resources for something like Germany's ambitious, painful and expensive energy transition programme, known as Energiewende. But, by going through with it, Germany has helped to spur the development of technology that may soon work for others without massive subsidies.On Sunday night November 29, Germany's wind farms produced 35.25 gigawatts of energy, an all-time record; for most of the weekend, more than half of Germany's electricity came from wind, and it was so cheap as to be almost free:Germany is depressing in late November: the sky is a super-efficient cloud factory in overdrive. Little solar energy is produced. In sunnier July, though, solar can combine with wind for more than three-quarters of Germany's power. On July 25, a new record was set: a combined 78% of consumed power was provided by renewables, including hydro and biomass. These are, of course, only temporary peaks. There are quiet, gray days when very little wind and solar energy is produced. For the year, however, Germany was on track for a 33% renewable share even before last weekend's wind surge. The jump from 27.4% last year shows that Germany's 2020 goal of 40% may be achieved earlier than planned.Only a year ago, critics of Energie\'c2\Â£dwende said it had failed, claiming that Chancellor Angela Merkel had derailed it by pledging to give up nuclear power in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. Phasing out "clean" nuclear energy drove up the use of Germany's primary source of traditional energy - the dirtiest one, coal - and, for a few years, the country's carbon emissions actually increased. The trend ended last year, however, as emissions dropped almost to the 2009 level, the lowest since 1990. Constantly increasing solar and wind installations - Germany now has about 45% of Europe's total wind generation - were the main reason for that.That growth was fuelled by massive subsidies. Last year, German households paid \'e2 \Â£c23-billion, about \'e2 \Â£c572 a family, in feed-in tariffs, or surcharges on energy bills that guarantee "clean power" producers can cover their costs. The results were, in the sceptics' eyes, less than optimal. Though solar generation accounts for 19% of Ger\'c2\Â£dmany's total capacity, it produces just 5% of the country's electricity. For wind, these shares are 18% and 8%, respectively. By contrast, lignite (so-called brown coal, which has high carbon dioxide emissions when burned) accounts for 12% installed capacity but 25% of electricity output.Cost and the unreliable supply are Energiewende sceptics' biggest problems with wind and solar as replacements for coal- and gas-fuelled power plants. In Italy and Spain, the development of wind and solar has almost completely stopped after reaching about 25% of total supply: these countries cannot afford to subsidise further expansion and power companies cannot see these sources replacing efficient, reliable traditional production. The United Kingdom, too, appears poised to curb wind and solar with subsidy cuts. In Germany, there's continued public and political support for the subsidies. They were slightly reduced in 2015, but they will increase next year as wholesale energy prices fall (the total energy bill for the typical family will thus remain the same). There's a good reason the Ger\'c2\Â£dman government feels confident about pushing on with renewables. Energy storage may soon be able to level out the weather-related supply jumps at prices that will make it attractive to energy companies. Europe's first commercial battery storage system went online in Germany a little over a year ago and more projects have since joined it. It's a hot market. Earlier this month, investment bank Lazard published its first analysis of the costs of various storage technologies, and it showed that for some of them costs were rapidly declining. The bank said the energy storage industry was at an "infection point" similar to the one renewable energy saw eight years ago.Even without subsidies, some storage technologies are already cost competitive with some conventional alternatives (for example, lithium-ion batteries for some power-grid support applications). Other storage technologies are close to being cost competitive in other applications, and costs are expected to decline in coming years.Germany has an incentive scheme for households that want to install storage systems combined with solar panels (millions of homes have them). The government planned to scrap the support starting next year, but has apparently decided against it. There's also a research and development initiative for energy storage. Energiewende has been a brave move. The German government started out with a lot of unknowns, and the decision to close down nuclear plants reshuffled the deck in unpredictable ways. Energy companies have suffered; last year, E.ON, the country's biggest power supplier, posted a net loss of \'e2 \Â£c3.2-billion, the biggest in its history, and decided to split in two, one part focusing on renewables and the other on fossil fuels. But it's clear now that the programme has been a success and that, as long as there is a well-defined goal and a determined effort to reach it, the necessary technology will present itself. The most heated arguments at the COP21 climate change conference in Paris, which got under way on Monday, will be about how to split the cost of reducing emissions among richer and poorer countries. Germans have already answered the question by unilaterally shouldering the energy transition burden. It's a matter of resolve, and the degree of resolve required goes down each year as technological advances make renewable energy an economically viable alternative to fossil fuel. - \Â£9 Bloomberg \</doc>

The Minister of Environmental Affairs, Edna Molewa has signed the Paris Agreement on climate change at the United Nations in New York. The Paris Agreement is universally regarded as a seminal point in the development of the international climate change regime under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Paris Agreement was adopted on 12 December 2015 at the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC CoP21 , held in Paris from 30 November to 13 December 2015. The Agreement was adopted after four years of intense negotiations mandated by the 17th UNFCCC CoP held in Durban in 2011. UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-Moon, acting in his capacity as depository of the Agreement convened a high-level ceremony for the opening for signature of the Agreement on Friday. Parties to the Convention are able to sign the Agreement until 21 April 2017. Minister Molewa signed the Agreement on behalf of the South African Government. The Agreement is a comprehensive framework which will guide international efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to meet all the associated challenges posed by climate change. It signals the change in pace towards the low carbon development from 2020 onwards through commitments of countries in ambitious national plans called Nationally Determined Contributions. This outcome recognises that climate change represents an urgent threat to human societies and the planet, requiring the widest possible cooperation by all countries and other stakeholders. The main objective of the Agreement is to limit the global temperature increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius, while pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees. The recognition of the 1.5 degree target is of central importance to South Africa as an African and developing country that is highly vulnerable to climate change. The Paris Agreement is also an important tool in mobilising finance, technological support and capacity building for developing countries, and will also help to scale up global efforts to address and minimise loss and damage from climate change and increase climate resilience. Signing the Agreement requires that countries will later need to adopt the agreement within their own legal systems, through ratification, acceptance, approval or accession. The agreement will enter into force when ratified by at least 55 countries, which together represent at least 55% of global emissions. South Africa is already acting on climate change. The country has significant investment in renewable energy, public transport, energy efficiency, waste management and land restoration initiatives. South Africa is also striving to enhance efforts to transition to a lower carbon economy and society, as well as to adapt in the short, medium and long term to the impacts of increasing temperatures, and reduced rainfall in many parts of the country. \</doc>

Strong message sent ahead of Paris meeting TENS of thousands of people, from Sydney to Berlin, joined one of the biggest global days of climate change activism yesterday to put pressure on world leaders to unite in fighting global warming at a summit in Paris. About 20000 pairs of shoes were laid out in the Place de la Republique in the French capital, from high-heels to boots, to symbolise absent marchers after attacks by Islamic State militants killed 130 people on November 13 and led France to ban a protest that was meant to be at the heart of the global action. Organisers said the Vatican sent a pair of shoes on behalf of Pope Francis. More than 2000 events were being held in cities including Sydney, Berlin, London, Sao Paulo and New York, making it perhaps the biggest day of climate action in history on the eve of the Paris conference which runs from today until December 11. In Sydney, about 45000 people are estimated to have marched through the central business district towards the Opera House. Among them was Sydney's mayor Clover Moore, who tweeted it was the largest climate march ever held in the harbour city. Protesters held placards reading: "There is no Planet B" and "Say no to burning national forests for electricity". One activist, dressed in white as an angel with large wings, held a sign: "Coal Kills". COP21 summit. Activists in France scaled back their plans when the government imposed a state of emergency after the Paris attacks and banned the march in Paris on security grounds. But they plan to form a human chain, with about 3400 people joining arms along a 3km route through central Paris from the Place de la Republique to Place de la Nation. Underscoring security worries, France put 24 green activists under house arrest before the summit, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said on Saturday, saying they were suspected of planning violent protests at the talks. Alix Mazounie, of French Climate Action Network, said a human chain would not violate the state of emergency. "This is not civil disobedience," she said. Many activists want a phase-out of fossil fuels and a shift to 100% renewable energies by 2050. - Reuters HOT UNDER THE COLLAR: A melting planet in an ice-cream cone is held up during the Global Climate March in Berlin on the eve of the official opening of the 195-nation UN climate summit in Paris today Picture: AFP \</doc>

Combating the impacts of climate change and other urgent environmental realities is what Nedbank and WWF-South Africa responded to when the WWF Nedbank Green Trust was founded 25 years ago... The trust is funded through the Nedbank Green Affinity programme, and since inception, has contributed in excess of R211m to over 200 conservation projects. The Trust takes a community-based approach to fund projects in marine, freshwater, land stewardship, species, climate change, environmental leadership development and community engagement. "One of our deep green aspirations is to be highly involved in our communities and the environment. This aspiration has helped inform our approach to sustainability by way of integrating the social, economic, cultural and environmental imperatives. Not only have we as a bank entrenched these four pillars of sustainability into our own operations, but we have also committed ourselves to using our leadership position to place sustainability at the centre of modern-day South African consciousness," says Mike Brown, chief executive of the Nedbank Group.The trust's programmes and projects aim to protect wild places, achieving environmental sustainability and ensuring the long-term integrity of species and people that inhabit natural systems.Forging the way"From the early days of conserving the Kalahari lions and sea turtles to pioneering research in climate change, water conservation and environmental leadership, the WWF Nedbank Green Trust has been forging the way," says Augustine Morkel, executive manager of operations at WWF-South Africa and manager of the WWF Nedbank Green Trust. "The Green Trust recognised that the survival of our planet depends on the coming together of governments, businesses, organisations and civil society and we are proud to have played a role in bringing people and nature together, and in harmony for 25 years. In 2012, WWF revised its strategy to be more proactive in how it works in South Africa and the new strategy was focused on delivering impact at the scale of the problem. The WWF Nedbank Green Trust was already well positioned to respond to this new ambition that WWF and its partners have set out to achieve." As the world prepares for the Congress of Parties ( COP21 ) in Paris, climate change will once again be in the spotlight, and it requires courageous leadership and our ability to consider the whole rather than narrow pursuit of self-interest to gear us towards realising a sustainable future. Nedbank Fair Share 2030 is the bank's strategic response to this challenge, which will see the organisation lending differently to address society's unmet needs. {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell \</doc>

CONCERNED cyclists on a 6 500km journey across nine countries in the name of climate awareness and saving Mother Earth arrived in Pretoria yesterday afternoon. The team of nine had left Maputo for South Africa earlier in the week, enduring the gruelling uphills and rough terrain. The cycling journey is designed like a relay. They spent the night in |Lynnwood, east of Pretoria, and are carrying on this morning, heading off to Rustenburg along the N4. The team will continue to travel through South Africa until tomorrow. From Rustenburg, they plan to cycle to the Botswana border. From there, the team will continue in relay-style through Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi and Tanzania, ending in Nairobi, Kenya, on November 8. Some of them will go to Uganda. Each of the nine countries has its own team waiting at the border post. As soon as the one team gets to the border, the other team takes the baton and carries on cycling. The cyclists move through cities spending hours on the road and collecting signatures on their memorandum. They hope to get more than a million signatures and intend handing it over at the Conference of Parties, COP21 in Paris in November. It is expected that this is the year a legally binding commitment on climate change among world leaders will be made. The cyclists are cycling under the banner of "We Have Faith - Act Now for Climate Justice", a multi-faith campaign seeking to mobilise faith communities and youth across Africa and raise awareness on climate issues. "We manage to get some sleep along the way at B'nBs. But we get up early in the morning and carry on with the business of the day," said organiser Shaka Dzetu. Fashion designer and member of the cycling team, Welcome Manganyi, said climate change was a burning issue that needed to be tackled. Children in the future would suffer the consequences if the climate problem was not rectified. "The moment one cycles, people ask, what is going on? Then you can tell people about climate change. "Cycling for me is like a prayer, showing that I am committed through taking action." "We believe that local communities and youth have the integrity to put the much-needed moral and ethical considerations back into the |negotiations. "Together, we must jointly push the world leaders to take the right decisions," said Dzetu. \</doc>

NEW YORK: President Jacob Zuma has called on developed countries to honour their commitments to developing countries now that the world has agreed on a plan for the next 15 years. "Events in the recent past have demonstrated that the countries of the developed North cannot insulate themselves from the challenges facing countries of the developing South," he told world leaders, gathered at the United Nations to adopt this body's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), yesterday. "We call on development partners to not only meet their current commitments, but also to upscale Overseas Development Assistance, with binding timetables," he said, adding that this financing was the main source of development assistance for developing countries. He praised the UN's plan for having a specific goal aimed at implementation. Zuma committed South Africa to the UN's goals, also known as Agenda 2030, adding that these had already been incorporated into South Africa's National Development Plan as well as the African Union's Agenda 2063. These goals are set to take over from the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals, which Zuma said had helped improve education, health, and gender equality in South Africa. Child and maternal deaths had declined, and the fight against HIV and Aids had saved many lives, he said. Zuma admitted, however, that Africa was still lagging behind in the achievement of these goals "due to historic reasons of underdevelopment". The 17 SDGs are aimed at ending poverty, upgrading healthcare, achieving inclusive and equal quality education for all, achieving gender equality, conserving and sustainably using the oceans, and addressing climate change. Zuma read from his speech, and like all the other heads of state that have so far spoken on the development goals, did not depart from the script. He has been battling the flu since arriving in New York City on Friday, which affected his voice, but yesterday his voice seemed to have recovered. When he walked up to the podium, he put his hands together in a gesture to thank UN officials for allowing him an opportunity to speak. Zuma was set to hold a bilateral meeting with French President Francois Hollande yesterday, presumably to discuss the COP21 climate change conference due to take place in France in December, and he is expected to give a lecture at Princeton University. Zuma met UN General Secretary Ban Ki-Moon on Saturday, where they discussed peace and security on the African continent. He also reiterated South Africa's stance on expanding the UN Security Council to include African countries as permanent members. - ANA \</doc>

CLIMATE change will have far-reaching impacts on food security - not only at the farm level but on the entire food chain, from farm to fork, according to an international report released at COP21 climate talks in Paris. The report, published under the auspices of the US Global Change Research Programme, warned that warmer temperatures and altered rainfall threatened food production on farms, transportation systems, food storage and food safety. Because of this, the progress by world governments over the last few decades towards improving food security would be difficult to maintain. One of the authors, Claudia Tebaldi, said that if the world continued on a path of high greenhouse gas emissions, "there is no way around the fact that climate change is going to be a primary challenge for producing and distributing food. If society lowers emissions, climate change will still be a stress on food security, but other factors, such as socio-economic conditions, could be more critical." The report points out that food security - the ability of people to get sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food - would be affected by many factors other than climate change, including advances in technology, population increase, the distribution of wealth and changes in eating habits. Researchers found that the impact of climate change on crop and livestock productivity would be larger for tropical and subtropical regions such as Africa and South Asia, with regional variations. Wealthy populations in temperate regions were less |at risk and some of these regions may even see a productivity increase, partly because of warmer temperatures and increased rainfall. "However, if society continues to emit more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that cause climate change, even those regions will face damaging outcomes during the second half of this century," the report said. "This would reverse recent gains, as the number of people at risk of undernourishment has dropped from around one billion since the early 1990s," the report said. Co-author Brian O'Neill said changes in society and in the climate would be important to food security in the next few decades. "This means we have to do a better job of anticipating possible changes in income, governance, inequality and other factors, and do a better job of understanding how they interact with food security and climate change," O'Neill said. \</doc>

CIVIC organisations told MPs of the disconnect between the commitments South Africa will make at the UN's COP21 in Paris and the reality of the government's carbon intensive decisions taken at home. This was one of the themes in the submissions made by environmental and civic groups which responded to a call from the environment portfolio committee for public input into the government's intended commitments it will table in Paris. Nicole L\'c3\'b6ser, of the Centre for Environmental Rights, told parliamentarians South Africa was taking decisions - particularly about energy - which would make it impossible to meet targets to combat climate change. "It is clear South Africa is operating at cross purposes, expressing international and domestic commitments to fight climate change while simultaneously making decisions which completely defeat these objectives," she said. Earthlife Africa's Tristen Taylor said South Africa's "supposed commitments" to combating climate change in effect meant it would continue business as usual with the same industrial policy. Bobby Peek, director of groundWork, said South Africa needed to summon the political will to move towards a clean energy system. "Climate change is already upon us and while some serious damage is now unavoidable, certain losses can still be reduced in the short term." The Southern African Faith Communities' Environment Institute said South Africa could play a pivotal role in unblocking barriers that have dogged finalising a binding international climate change agreement. Spokesperson Liziwe McDaid said South Africa needed to own up to the fact that our historical carbon emissions were way above the rest of Africa, and to take extra measures to cut emissions above those required by the rest of Africa. She said within South Africa's "intended national determined contributions" - the climate change combating commitments the government will put on the table in Paris - it appeared that most of the commitments were dependent on others agreeing. "This can lead to a stalemate where no one does anything. Such a conditional commitment is neither in South Africa's nor the rest of Africa's interest," McDaid said. Portfolio committee chairperson Jackson Mthembu said yesterday the submissions had been characterised by "very earnest and robust debate". "The majority of submissions recognised that the best way to decrease greenhouse gas emissions was by stopping dependence of the country's energy generation on coal resources. There was also a unanimous call for the country to move away from fossil fuel as a source of energy to renewables," he said. \</doc>

The City of Cape Town has approved its new energy and carbon emissions targets. These targets will pave the way for the implementation of a long-term Energy 2040 Goal... The 2020 and 2030 targets form part of the city's compliance with the Compact of Mayors, which will be announced at the COP21 Paris Climate Change meetings to be held between November and December 2015. The Compact requires the city to establish new carbon emission targets. The Energy 2040 Goal, which is based on the premise that a business-as-usual approach will have severe negative impacts on Cape Town and the Western Cape, will serve as a strategic tool for decision-making into the future and it will inform the full review of the city's Energy and Climate Action Plan (ECAP), which was approved in 2010. The city exceeded the city-wide and municipal operations energy efficiency targets which were set in the 2010 plan. "Following a business-as-usual trajectory indicates a doubling of energy consumption and emissions and a tenfold increase in energy costs to the Cape Town economy by 2040. Such a future would make the city extremely vulnerable to external impacts and shocks and the increased emissions would further contribute to human-induced climate change. The economy would be placed under pressure due to unsustainable input cost burdens," said the city's Mayoral Committee Member for Energy, Environmental and Spatial Planning, Johan van der Merwe. Leading city "The Energy 2040 Goal models a more resilient, lower carbon, resource-efficient and equitable future for Cape Town which grows the administration's stature as a leading and innovative city. City economies, which are heavily dependent on energy, require a strong commitment to identify and to enact innovative and sustainable responses for their energy and climate futures. "In Cape Town, for instance, it can be seen that as the population increases and incomes grow, the demand for energy is escalating. The current electricity supply constraints, tariff increases, the increased burden of transport congestion, increasing fuel costs and battle to transform our city spatially, need immediate as well as a long-term solutions," said Van der Merwe. It is proposed that the city's Energy 2040 Goal comprise, amongst others: - a 37% reduction in carbon emissions (21% from energy efficiency alone); - less dependency on coal, with extensive embedded renewable generation in the commercial and residential sectors as well as diversified large-scale energy supply with photovoltaics, wind, storage and possibly natural gas; - over 500,000 solar water heaters and heat pumps would be installed by residents; - a modal shift from private to public transport with increased access to public transport and motorised passenger-travel in efficient vehicles with higher occupancy levels; - a remodelled city with increased densification and mixed use in areas of economic activity; and - increased energy savings from efficiency and cheaper energy. \</doc>

Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere reached new record levels in 2015, says the South African Weather Service (SAWS). The weather service on Wednesday said this is according to data released by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). Nations can expect hotter temperatures, more intense drought and more intense rainfall and flooding episodes directly threatening lives, livelihoods and property. According to the climate records of SAWS in 2015, South Africa experienced the driest year on record since 1904, said the weather service. It said this can be attributed to variability in weather patterns due to climate change and the El Nino phenomenon, which is expected to subside by June 2016. The weather service said the resultant drought has been associated with an unprecedented frequency of heatwaves. It said South Africa recorded 48.4 \'b0C in Vredendal in October, the highest recorded temperature in the world for October, according to the WMO, while 31\'b0C maximum temperature records were shattered across South Africa in early January 2016, during yet another strong heatwave. WMO revealed that globally, the period 2011 to 2015 has been the hottest on record, with the year 2015 the hottest since modern observations began in the late 1800s. January and February 2016 are said to have been recorded as the hottest months to date. South Africa is a signatory to the Paris Agreement concluded at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP21 ) in December 2015. The Paris Agreement is a legally binding agreement that commits all countries to cut carbon emissions. The Department of Environmental Affairs and SAWS will continue to support the production of climate information and services to support Climate Resilience, Adaptation and Mitigation, said the weather service. Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa has underscored the important role of weather forecasting in government planning, as South Africa and the world continue to feel the effects of climate change. The application of vast data resources to the analysis of weather conditions cuts across government departments - ranging from energy, infrastructure, transportation, agriculture, to disaster management and planning. This is particularly pertinent as changing rainfall patterns impact agriculture, food and water security, said the weather service. On 23 March South Africa marks World Meteorological Day under the theme 'Creating a weather-smart nation - Innovating, Adapting and Facing the Future together'. World Meteorological Day commemorates the entry into force of the convention that created the WMO in 1950. South Africa is a member of the WMO and has served on the Executive Council since 1994. \</doc>

The International Resource Panel (IRP), hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), says decoupling economic growth from escalating resource use should be an integral part of climate policy... As nations gathered at COP21 in Paris for their first day of deliberations to determine a new, global climate regime, the IRP said a 'whole system perspective' was crucial when considering climate policy. Releasing its Ten Messages on Climate Change, the IRP said natural resource management and climate change were intrinsically linked, with a large part of global energy use, and therefore greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, tied directly to the acquisition, processing, transport, conversion, use and disposal of resources. Raising resource productivity through improved efficiency and reducing resource waste could lower resource consumption and GHG emissions, bringing economic gains and promoting more equitable access to resources, the IRP said. Moreover, through decoupling, developing countries could cut the increase in annual energy demand by more than half over the next 12 years, while realising their development goals. Stability of climate "Policy changes aimed at mitigating GHG emissions affect not only the stability of the climate, but also other environmental aspects and resource use, positively or negatively," the IRP co-chair, Janez Poto\'e8nik, said. "A whole system approach that connects production, consumption and their impacts on the environment and resources helps prevent adverse unintended consequences of GHG emission mitigation." This argument is further underpinned by the new IRP report, Green Energy Choices: the Benefits, Risks and Trade-offs of Low-Carbon Technologies for Electricity Production. This assesses nine low-carbon energy technologies, which will be essential for meeting 2\'b0C objective and growing energy demand. For the first time, countries making the decision about which renewal energy technology to use have clear, comparative science-based information about not only their GHG reduction benefits, but also about other positive and negative environmental, human health, and natural resource use impacts. Clean energy "Clean energy technologies such as photovoltaic and wind power have clear benefits in terms of tackling climate change and air pollution, and providing access to clean and affordable energy," Achim Steiner, executive director of UNEP, said. "These technologies will be critical to keeping global warming under 2\'b0C, but we need to remain cognisant of their effects on the environment, such as their higher use of metals like steel and copper in manufacturing. As countries look to meet their energy needs while combating climate change, this report can help identify the most sustainable mix of energy technologies to accomplish that goal." Global demand for energy is expected to require an estimated investment of $2.5 trillion a year over the next 20 years in new energy installations and energy conservation initiatives. This report presents a unique opportunity for countries to carefully select the electricity production technologies in which they invest. \</doc>

THE Western Cape MEC for Environmental Affairs, Development Planning and Local Government, Anton Bredell, took a swipe at international attempts to tackle climate change and questioned what world politicians had achieved in global negotiations over the past 20 years. Bredell said the UN's climate talks in Paris in December presented what was possibly the last chance for the global community to push for real agreement on an effective new instrument to tackle climate change. "Maybe a lot has happened, but I can tell you it has not happened at scale, and we need it to happen at scale." Bredell gave the keynote address at a Department of Environmental Affairs workshop in Cape Town - one of several organised by the national department to gather input from provinces and civil society into what commitments South Africa would put on the table in Paris about greenhouse gas emissions. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change requires all signatory nations to submit these targets - known as intended nationally determined contributions - by October. The cabinet has approved a discussion document but ruled that Environment Affairs consult extensively and then make adjustments to South Africa's position. Sacrifice Bredell also asked how much of our luxuries we would be willing to sacrifice in order to reduce our carbon footprint. Were people willing to make changes such as living off-grid or using waterless lavatories, and were they willing to put in the effort required to maintain these systems? He said officials across the board had done good work and come up with great strategies to combat climate change and to adapt to the effects of a changing climate. "But we must now implement these strategies. We can't now rewrite them after COP21 ." Judy Beaumont, Deputy Director-General of Environmental Affairs, said once all the nations had submitted their greenhouse gas reduction targets, the UN would need to add them up and see if this was sufficient to keep the average global temperature increase below 2\'c2\'ba C. The Africa Group had set a target of keeping to below |1.5\'c2\'ba C, and South Africa agreed with that target. However, the kind of action needed to keep below 1.5\'c2\'ba would require "radical transformation". "We're not afraid of radical transformation, but as a country with a coal base we are aware of the need for flexibility and space to say: 'Two degrees is where we could retreat to'," Beaumont said. \</doc>

THE SA International Renewable Energy Conference, which starts on Sunday, will focus on the government's commitment to diversify the energy mix through renewable energy. The conference at the Cape Town International Convention Centre is hosted by the government, the SA National Energy Development Institute (Sanedi) and the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21). It ends on Wednesday. President Jacob Zuma and Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson will be some of the keynote speakers. Delegates from the private, public and academic sector will discuss strategies to accelerate the use of renewable energy. Ren21chairman Arthouros Zevos said renewables already played a major role in the energy mix in many countries. "South Africa's rapid investment totals $5.5 billion (R65Bn) in clean energy. This is an impressive demonstration of how stable renewable energy policies can shape the market," Zevos said. Some of the ministers attending this week's event include Albania's chief of cabinet for the ministry's energy and industry, Ardit Kamberi, Germany's state secretary of economic affairs and energy, Rainer Baake, and Malawi's minister of natural resources, energy and mining, Bright Msaka. Dr Stephan Singer, director of global energy policy for the World Wildlife Fund in Belgium, will be a panellist in Monday's discussion on "Road to COP21 : Renewables solution agenda". "WWF has been actively campaigning worldwide to boost renewable energy as a key component of sustainable development and climate protection. Our rallying cry has been a call for a world powered by 100 percent renewable energy by 2050," he said. Singer said using renewable energy is economically and technically possible as each year the prospects for renewables become brighter as technology has become cheaper, more efficient and more reliable. "We have witnessed the rapid decline of renewable energy manufacturing costs |by about 80 percent for solar PV in the past five years, and new developments in more efficient and larger wind turbines and geothermal energy." Based on economic capabilities, Singer said, the countries that have been leading renewable energy source investments are Uruguay, Mauritius, Costa Rica, South Africa and Nicaragua. "These five countries spend about 0.8 to 1.6 percent of their GDP on renewables. And most of these countries have already very ambitious short-term renewable energy source targets of between 60 and 100 percent renewables in the power sector between 2015 and 2025." Singer said South Africa is poised to overtake Germany and Italy soon with its highly successful domestic solar power programme. "It is estimated that by the end of 2015, South Africa will have solar power on 5 million rooftops, almost every third roof in the country," he said. Singer said for the past two years the country has had the largest renewable energy investments per GDP of close to 1 percent among the powerful G20 nations.

French ambassador to South Africa Elisabeth Barbier said the whole world, not just France, has been affected by the terrorist attacks in Paris. She was speaking to the media at the French embassy in Pretoria following the Paris terrorist attacks on Friday that killed 132 people. "We are all affected, regardless of our citizenship, our colour, our religion," Barbier said. She said France was attacked by the jihadist army of Daesh - the word she used to describe Isil (Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant) - because the country stood for freedom and human rights. On Friday night, a series of co-ordinated terrorist attacks were carried out in locations across the city, including a concert hall and a soccer stadium where French President Francois Hollande was watching a match. "This act of war is an attack against our values that we share and defend everywhere in the world. To this extent, it is not an attack against France, but against the world... of tolerance, respect and diversity," she said. Barbier was seemingly addressing people who have been very vocal, particularly on social media, suggesting that people should focus more on the problems in Africa than throwing all their public support behind Paris. "Right now, it may seem as if the support is addressed to Paris, because it is a cultural and tourism centre, an international landmark. But it is actually a message of solidarity to all the victims of these fanatics. We are united." She echoed Hollande's earlier declaration that revenge is imminent. "Though France is wounded, France will not yield. We will fight back. As our president has declared, France will respond with all its might, and its response will be fearless." She said they have called upon the international community to join and fight with them and a coalition will be formed by those willing to destroy Islamic State. "To this extent, France has already asked for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council. Our democracy, our country, has defeated enemies that were far more powerful than these assassins. We overcame in the past and we will overcome once again." She said the French borders are open and have always been open, although the security measures have been tightened, and South Africans are welcome to visit the country as the visa regulations between the two countries have |not changed. The city will also continue with plans to host COP21 , the UN Climate Change Conference, from November 30 to December 11. See Page 8 \</doc>

Bredell said the UN's climate talks in Paris in December presented what was possibly the last chance for the global community to push for real agreement on an effective new instrument. "But if we look at the results of COP 17 (in 2011) in Durban, did we really make a difference? Or are we just contributing more to greenhouse gas emission by arranging more COPs and not coming up with a solution? "Maybe a lot has happened, but I can tell you it has not happened at scale, and we need it to happen at scale." Bredell gave the keynote address at a Department of Environmental Affairs workshop in the city - one of several organised to gather input from provinces and civil society into what commitments South Africa will put on the table in Paris regarding its greenhouse gas emissions. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change requires all signatory nations to submit these targets - known as intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) - by October. Cabinet has approved a discussion document on INDCs, but ruled that Environment Affairs consult extensively and then make adjustments to South Africa's position. Bredell also raised the question of how much of our luxuries we would be willing to sacrifice to reduce our carbon footprint. Were people willing to make changes such as living off-grid or using waterless lavatories, and were they willing to put in the effort required to maintain these systems? He said officials across the board had done good work and come up with great strategies to combat climate change and to adapt to the effects of a changing climate. "But we must implement these strategies. We can't now rewrite them after COP21 ." Judy Beaumont, deputy director general at Environmental Affairs, said once all the nations had submitted their greenhouse gas reduction targets, the UN would need to add them up and see if this was sufficient to keep the average global temperature increase below 2\'c2\'baC. The Africa Group had set a target of keeping to below 1.5\'c2\'baC, and South Africa agreed with that target. However, the kind of action needed to keep below 1.5\'c2\'baC would require "radical transformation". \</doc>

With two months to go before a Paris meeting on global climate change, the government has been accused of engaging in doublespeak - proclaiming its commitment to fighting climate change on one hand, while simultaneously building some of the biggest coal-fired power stations in the world. This criticism has been made by the Centre for Environmental Rights, a Cape Town-based environmental law clinic. In a submission to Parliament's portfolio committee on environmental affairs, centre attorney Nicole L\'c3\'b6ser said South Africa was building at least two major power stations, contradicting the country's objectives to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. "It is clear South Africa is operating at cross purposes, expressing international and domestic commitments to fight climate change while simultaneously adopting policies and making decisions which defeat these objectives," said L\'c3\'b6ser in a submission which forms part of the hearings ahead of the UN Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) annual climate change negotiations that start in Paris on November 30. "We are already seeing a trend - pushed by industry - towards regulation by negotiation, where industry negotiates emission reductions with the state." She also pointed to the recent landmark ruling by a Dutch district court which ordered the Dutch government to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% before 2020 on the basis that the government had a duty of care to current and future Dutch citizens to avoid "hazardous" levels of climate change. Duty Three district court judges in the Hague made the ruling on June 24 following an application by the Urgenda citizen foundation. "What this case confirms is that adopting effective and adequate climate change mitigation measures is not just a matter of policy, or a matter to be negotiated, but in fact a legal and constitutional duty on the state," she said. The Dutch judges said their decision did not amount to an unwarranted interference in political matters. "It is worthwhile noting that a judge, although not elected and therefore having no democratic legitimacy, has democratic legitimacy in another vital respect. His authority and ensuing 'power' are based on democratically established legislation, whether national or international, which has assigned him the task of settling legal disputes. "This task also extends to cases in which citizens, individually or collectively, have turned against government authorities. The task of providing legal protection from government authorities, such as the state, pre-eminently belong to the domain of a judge," declared judges H Hofhuis, J Bockwinkel and I Brand. L\'c3\'b6ser told the portfolio committee South Africa's recent draft report on greenhouse gas emissions reporting required local companies to report their total gas emissions - but there was no requirement for companies to report emissions from individual facilities. "Unless this data is totally open and easily available for analysis and scrutiny, it will be impossible for the public to perform their crucial watchdog role and hold companies accountable." \</doc>

Three quarters of CEOs surveyed by PwC are developing new products and services to respond to climate change, while a third say it's helping them grow their business... Following research by PwC earlier in the year that showed CEOs seeing more opportunities for growth today than there were three years ago, PwC polled international business leaders on their views on growth prospects in the context of climate change. The results suggest an emerging group of leading CEOs, confident about economic growth prospects more widely, forming a business case for action on climate change based on cost efficiency, stronger risk management and new market opportunities. <strong>Main findings</strong> - Three out of five CEOs surveyed say they are acting on climate change to create a reputational advantage. - Over half are motivated by improving shareholder value (53%) and building trust in their organisation (52%). - 58% say their companies are partnering with suppliers and business partners to address climate change risks and opportunities; 55% with consumers. - 89% have made energy efficiency improvements; 74% have set recycling targets. - 61% have changed how they monitor and manage risk. &ldquo;80% of CEOs told us what motivates them personally on climate change is their desire to protect the interests of future generations. But look beneath this headline and you see a smaller, emerging group of leading CEOs making the connection with growth, costs, risk and shareholder value," Jayne Mammatt, partner at PwC sustainability and climate change, said. "Far more need to be motivated by business as well as moral issues, and make the connection between climate change and financial performance, particularly in the context of an ambitious deal on climate change this year." <strong>Tick list</strong> &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s short-term issues, such as energy cost and regulatory concerns, will become tomorrow&rsquo;s longer-term and strategic threats to competitiveness and growth. The implications of a changing climate are a tick list of critical business issues ranging from commodity pricing and energy, to logistics and sourcing, to investment, talent and customer retention.&rdquo; With less than 100 days to the UN Climate Summit in Paris ( COP21 ) in December, an international agreement on climate change looks set to increase both the risks and opportunities of a changing climate for global companies. Among the main concerns identified in the survey: - CEOs&rsquo; top climate concerns are impacts on energy prices (61%) and the potential increase in government regulation (56%). - Longer-term climate impacts are a lesser concern with impacts on supply chains and infrastructure at 51% and 35% respectively The most important drivers for climate action for CEOs identified are greater public awareness and engagement (80%) and a clear, consistent and long-term national government policy framework (77%). In contrast, only 46% identified a binding agreement on climate change as the main driver for action in their sector. \</doc>

The WWF EcoMobility Challenge, a WWF South Africa initiative held in association with the City of Johannesburg, recently took place in Johannesburg... The challenge was aimed at demonstrating the solutions available to tackle climate change, while at the same time highlighting the benefits in shifting to public from private transport. Held during the month-long global EcoMobility World Festival, the challenge saw teams of racers navigating a series of destination checkpoints across Johannesburg using only public transport, minibus taxis, or electric or non-motorised transport. Kicking off at the WWF building in Braamfontein, Lisa Seftel, executive director of Transport for the City of Joburg, opened the race and gave teams their first clue. Lowest carbon footprint The teams worked hard puzzling out clues which led them to Hector Peterson Square, to Orlando Stadium, to Maponya Mall and on to the Sanlam building in Sandton. Armed only with maps, public transport timetables and other tools to guide them, and their commitment to the cause, all strategised with the end goal in mind - to be the team with the lowest carbon footprint to cross the endpoint before the cut-off time. Racers' adventures included tackling the Rea Vaya interchanges, fighting off other commuters for spots on eTukTuk, learning the signs to 'uptown' and 'downtown' when hailing minibus taxis, walking for kilometres in the heat, and riding bicycles - something many racers admitted to not having done in several years. At the end it was a team comprising Graeme Stephens (CEO of Sun International), Liesl Laurie (Miss South Africa), Bongani Xakaza (South African National Energy Development Institute) and Innocent Nkosi (University of Johannesburg) who came out tops. Valli Moosa, chair of the WWF South Africa board, handed the team that won their prize, but it was not all fun and games. MMC of Transport, Christine Walters, who also took part in the challenge, then addressed the awards ceremony on the city's Strategic Integrated Transport Plan and how this addresses climate change. Increased commitments "There is a serious need for national governments at COP21 to increase their commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - the gases driving climate change," Louise Naud\'e9, WWF South Africa's lead on low-carbon transport and climate change, said. "The pledges they have put on the table fall far short of the reductions we need if we are to keep average global warming below 2\'b0C. What's scary is that at 2\'b0C globally, Africa will be up to between 3\'b0C and 4\'b0C. Climate change could reverse all the developmental gains we have made." CEO of WWF-SA, Morn\'e9 du Plessis, was surprised to see the willingness of the people of Johannesburg to engage with strangers who wanted to ask them questions about transport. "As individuals, we can reduce our own carbon footprint in many ways. But the single biggest contribution we can make is to 'change the way you move' as the city's theme says. Our race today showed the way," he said. \</doc>

This year has picked up where last year ended, continuing the trend of record-setting hot months. Nasa data shows that 2015 was the hottest year ever recorded, breaking the same record set by 2014.Ten of last year's 12 months set records for being the hottest ever, with the last three months of 2015 setting an even bigger record - by being more than 1\'c2\'b0C \'c2\Â£dhotter than the global average. The rate of record setting has not slowed down in the new year. The average global temperature in January was 13.04\'c2\'b0C, 1.04\'c2\'b0C hotter than the 20th-century average of 12\'c2\'b0C - the temperature it would have been had global warming not increased temperatures, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The average for January - globally - should have been 12\'c2\'b0C. The previous record for January was set in 2007, when the month was 0.8\'c2\'b0C hotter than the average. This January also set the record for the second-hottest month ever recorded - the hottest was July last year when the average global temperature was 16.61\'c2\'b0C. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says this has a lot to do with a combination of a warming world - thanks to human emissions of greenhouse gases - and the ongoing El Ni\'c3\'b1o phenomenon that rapidly warms the Pacific Ocean and brings about hotter weather worldwide. Data released by the United Kingdom's Met Office in January showed that 2014 was 0.57\'c2\'b0C hotter than the long-term average for the planet, and 2015 was 0.75\'c2\'b0C hotter. These were also the biggest single increases on record. The office predicts that 2016 will break the annual record set by 2015, creating the hottest three consecutive years on record. Heatwaves and drought For South Africa, this temperature increase has seen temperatures consistently heading into the high 30s and low 40s - with heatwaves being declared regularly.Recent rain has brought some relief to farmers, but the weather service gives a sobering prediction for the rest of the year: "Drier and warmer conditions are expected to be extreme  and may worsen the current drought conditions." The latest temperature records mean that the world is, on average, 1\'c2\'b0C hotter than it was before the Industrial Revolution. That moment coupled the burning of fossil fuels to economic growth, a relationship that is only now starting to unravel. Worried about record temperatures? Read our handy guide to surviving the apocalypse.The Paris Agreement, accepted by world governments at COP21 last year, set a goal of ensuring average temperatures do not increase by another 1\'c2\'b0C this century. But environment watchdogs say the sum total of countries' pledges will see the world warm by an average of 3\'c2\'b0C this century. This will lead to irreversible climate change, says the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. \</doc>

The world is now nearly 1\'c2\'b0C hotter than it was before human beings started burning fossil fuels. While appearing small, that number is a big jump from the 14.3\'c2\'b0C average that the world should be. For countries on the equator it has meant an increase of double that - and 1.5 times that for Africa. An increase of that magnitude means 2015 will go down in history as the hottest year ever recorded, taking that record from 2014. January and April of this year were the only months to not break their own records.Since 2000, average global monthly temperature records have been \'c2\Â£dbroken 32 times. The last time an average monthly cold record was broken was during World War I.The Met Office - one of a handful of institutions that have reliable temperature records going back more than a century - says most of this temperature increase was down to global warming, but an unusually strong El Ni\'c3\'b1o had given it further impetus. This phenomenon warms the Pacific Ocean and causes drought in the southern hemisphere and flooding in the northern hemisphere. In South Africa, El Ni\'c3\'b1o has exacerbated an existing drought and pushed five provinces into being declared drought disaster areas.Met Office research fellow Professor Chris Folland says "2015 is on track to be the warmest year on record". It has also seen temperature records tumble - on October 27 the small Western Cape town of Vredendal set a global temperature record for that day, hitting 48,4\'c2\'b0C.Read: How to spot climate change denialDuring spring, dozens of temperature records were broken across the country with a corresponding dearth of rainfall. Highest maximum temperature and highest minimum temperature records were set. The South African Weather Service says that this will only get worse in the coming months as El Ni\'c3\'b1o continues to increase temperatures until winter. "Drier and warmer conditions are expected to be extreme ... and may worsen the current drought conditions the country is experiencing." 2016 to top 2015 The Met Office has predicted that - as a result of El Ni\'c3\'b1o continuing next year - 2016 stands a good chance of setting the record for being the hottest year on record. That means 2014, 2015 and 2016 will stand as the hottest consecutive years on record. It predicts that 2016 will be 1.14\'c2\'b0C hotter than pre-industrial levels. The Paris Agreement - passed last week at the end of COP21 - has as its main goal the task of limiting average global temperature increases by 2\'c2\'b0C, with an aspirational goal of limiting those increases to 1.5\'c2\'b0C. The agreement was slammed by non-government groups for not giving any of the details of how this would be achieved, with research suggesting that to reach the 1.5\'c2\'b0C target, the world would have to go fossil fuel-free by 2030. \</doc>

President Jacob Zuma says the lack of cooperation between international partners and the African Union (AU) risks a reversal of achievements that Africa has registered over the years. Delivering his remarks on Thursday during the credentials ceremony held at the Sefako Makgatho Presidential Guesthouse in Pretoria, President Zuma said it is important that international partners support regional initiatives to bring about peace rather than imposing their own initiatives. President Zuma received Letters of Credence from Ambassadors and High Commissioners-designate at the credentials ceremony. The AU Agenda 2063, which was adopted by the AU Summit in June 2015 in Johannesburg, is achievable. We need to strengthen partnerships between ourselves as Africans and work in collaboration with our international partners. We must forge ahead with efforts to find solutions to African problems. We have tested our capabilities to bring sustained peace on the continent in order to create favourable conditions for increased prosperity, said President Zuma. He said the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises (ACIRC) and the multinational African Standby Force successfully held its first joint exercise in South Africa in October 2015. The force has been established by the African Union to intervene when conflicts arise in the continent. Peace, security and humanity We have witnessed how lack of peace and security in some parts of the world can present challenges to stable countries. The current refugee crisis in Europe as a result of continuing conflicts in Syria and other parts of the world is one case in point. We acknowledge that management of refugees is an immediate challenge. However, we all have a responsibility to address the root causes, said President Zuma. He said the Middle East has been yearning for peace, and progress has been very slow. While we are committed to finding lasting solutions to challenges facing humanity, we must be conscious that some issues are urgent and pressing. Climate change is one of those issues which need our urgent attention in order to preserve human lives, said President Zuma. He said South Africa fully supports France in its capacity as incoming COP21 /CMP11 President and will work towards finding fair compromises and consensus positions between parties. We therefore hope for a collective will to adopt an ambitious and legally-binding outcome in Paris that is applicable to all, he said. During the ceremony, Heads of Mission-designate from 15 countries presented their credentials to the President, and reaffirmed the commitment of their countries to further strengthen the existing historic relations that their countries have with South Africa. They came from the Republic of Mali, Republic of Cyprus, Republic of Zambia, Federal Republic of Switzerland, Republic of Canada, Republic of Mauritius, Republic of Panama, Republic of Mozambique, European Union, Hellenic Republic, Czech Republic, Federation of Malaysia, State of Palestine, Federal Republic of Somalia and Republic of Sri Lanka. They also thanked President Zuma and South African government for the support it has shown to their respective countries, and for contributing towards bringing solutions to challenges facing their countries. \</doc>

The De Ville Shopping Centre in Durbanville, Cape Town, now features a bank of highly efficient solar panels on its roof... The project was managed by Spire Sustainable Solutions on behalf of the Tower Property Fund who owns De Ville. Simon Penso, head of Sustainability for Spire's Sustainability Division, explains that this is the largest solar installation undertaken by his team to date and initial results are very exciting. "The system went live on Wednesday, 11 November and within a few hours had produced a peak production of 317Kw - in overcast conditions. The installed peak is 319Kw so we are very pleased with these early results." Weather station The De Ville PV solar installation is being monitored through a roof top weather station that feeds results through to an online portal that allows Spire Property Management to check how the system is performing at any time. In addition to the installation at the De Ville Shopping Centre, solar panels are also being installed at the sites of 382 Jan Smuts and 6-8 Sturdee Avenue in Johannesburg. These various installations are expected to supply approximately R1.2m worth of electricity in the first year of operation. "The value of this power will increase in direct proportion to electricity price increases," says Penso. "This power is resold on to the tenants and so will no longer need to be purchased from Eskom." Gregg Huntingford, CEO of Spire Property Management, explains that Spire's Sustainable Solutions Division contains some of the best available skills, as well as access to the best resources and best of breed practises, through their relationship with the Green Building Council South Africa (GBCSA). This focus is essential in the present business environment, with constraints on energy supply being a foremost concern in the property industry. New campaign "Spire's newly launched Sustainable Solutions division, and our focus on green retrofitting, such as the recently completed PV solar installation at De Ville, is in keeping with a new campaign that is being launched by the WGBC at the COP21 Climate Change Talks called #betterbuildgreen," says Huntingford. "The focus of this necessary campaign is to bring awareness to the role that buildings play in global warming. The built environment is a significant contributor to energy use and emissions. The campaign further highlights that if we are to limit global warming to 2\'b0C, seen as a manageable increase, we need to dramatically reduce emissions, and better address energy and water use. "Spire is pleased and excited to be doing its part in moving the built environment in South Africa towards a more sustainable future through the work undertaken by Spire Sustainable Solutions. We look forward to rolling out further green measures on behalf of our clients and for the market at large," concludes Huntingford. \</doc>

Whatever political leaders agree on or fail to do at COP21 in Paris will not matter as much as the decision by Bill Gates and other super-rich individuals to put their money where their mouths are. Money is what talks loudest. The days of dirty energy are fast drawing to a close. Dirty energy will increasingly become a liability and a socio-political hot potato for governments. The fact that chronic smog continues to hang thick and unrelenting over Beijing and New Delhi, aggravating respiratory problems, has begun to anger and disgust residents. Even at midday, the sun remains hidden in the cloud of smog. No human being will continue to accept living in a smog-ridden city. The emergence of the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, led by Bill Gates, is the best news for humanity as well as for the planet. With serious money going into research and development, great new strides in clean energy now clearly come into the offing. The age of renewables has begun. December 2015 will be remembered as its birth date. As the super-rich invest in clean energy companies and breakthroughs occur quick and fast, renewable energy will get a tremendous spurt. It is the energy of tomorrow and forever. Zuckerberg, of Facebook fame, stated very bluntly that "We won't be able to make meaningful progress on other challenges - like educating or connecting the world - without secure energy and a stable climate". He is spot on. We concur fully with him. A Cope-led government would have used tax concessions and a raft of other contractual inducements to encourage the formation of a mega clean-energy company on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange to lead the charge in Africa. It would pay handsome dividends in many ways. As we face the greater risk, we will need to do much more and a lot more expeditiously. Waiting is not an option for South Africa. South Africans, if given the opportunity, would willingly invest in a massive clean-energy company because it would give attractive returns and more importantly it would allow this generation to preserve the country for those who will come after. Now is the time for the national as well as all provincial governments to pull out the stops and back clean-energy solutions to the very hilt. We are already 20 years late and any feet dragging now will only bring calamity and chaos to our country and the world at large. The age of renewable has begun. Let us be in the vanguard as the proud flagbearers of the new revolution. Cope fully supports the rapid search for clean energy solutions. Go Back. Dennis Bloem Cope spokesperson \</doc>

PEOPLE around the world will take to the streets on Sunday on the eve of the two-week UN climate talks in Paris to urge world governments to clinch a global deal to limit greenhouse gas emissions. About 2 000 rallies have been planned under the banner of the Global Climate March, organised online by a range of organisations, but those scheduled for Paris have been cancelled in the aftermath of the attacks which killed 130 people. The global march website describes the marches as "our chance to help set an ambitious agenda for the conference: 2015 is on track to be the hottest year in recorded history. Our message: keep fossil fuels in the ground and finance a just transition to 100 percent renewable energy by 2050". In Cape Town the climate march will start outside CPUT at noon and end at Parliament at 1pm. It is being organised by the COP21 Climate Action NGO Alliance, which has invited mayor Patricia de Lille, Premier Helen Zille and Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson to receive a memorandum. Key points are the need |for South Africa to increase |its commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and to move away "more determinedly" from fossil fuels. It calls on the provincial government to put into practice its own report on climate change by re-evaluating policies related to land-use change, economic development and conservation of coastal, wetland and biodiversity-rich areas. It calls on the City Council to revise its policy on electricity generation from rooftop PV solar installations, which "inhibits" citizens from being able to contribute electricity to the grid. "As Naomi Klein says: 'Climate change isn't an 'issue' to add to the list of things to worry about, next to health care and taxes. It is a civilisational wake-up call'," the alliance said. The climate summit, which begins on Monday, hopes to map out a global agreement to limit greenhouse gas emission beyond 2020, when the Kyoto Protocol commitment period ends. So far the voluntary pledges made by countries to cut emissions are not sufficient to keep the average global temperature increase to below 2\'c2\'baC, and would put the world on a path to a 2.7\'c2\'baC increase. Climate scientists have labelled anything above 2\'c2\'baC as "dangerous" climate change. South Africa's target is to reduce emissions by between 398 and 614 metric tons of |carbon dioxide equivalent (mtCO2e) between 2025 and 2030. This is consistent with the pledge South Africa made under the Copenhagen Accord to reduce emissions below "business as usual" by 34 percent in 2020 and 42 percent by 2030. The online Climate Action Tracker has rated South Africa's commitment as "inadequate". "If other countries were to follow South Africa's approach, global warming would exceed 3\'c2\'baC to 4\'c2\'baC." It said South Africa's emissions were expected to increase on 1990 levels by 110 percent by 2020 and 141 percent by 2025.

Ethiopia needs more money now to get through the drought, which has left about 10.2 million people without food. This is up from the three million people, who suffered food shortages at the beginning of last year, Kang Kyung-Wha, ASG for humanitarian affairs and deputy emergency relief co-ordinator at the UN office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs, said. Briefing journalists before the AU summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Kang said the El Ni\'b1o weather phenomenon that was sweeping the world was not new, "but what is new is its strength". She said some estimated it was as strong as the El Ni\'b1o of 1997 and 1998 that killed 23 000 people and displaced over a million. "The cost was huge. In damage alone it cost $45 billion. This could be equal in its destructive power," she said. Kang said although the current El Ni\'b1o was getting weaker, the cost was lasting. "The humanitarian and development response have to be sustained at a very robust level," she said. She said in Ethiopia the number of hungry people would grow if no efforts were made to restore the livelihood of people in the agricultural sector, because seeds needed to be bought now, distributed and planted. That required forward planning. "The humanitarian community has been following and tracking the situation very carefully and our main call at this point is we need more resources. "The donors have stepped up but we need more," she said. Kang said $1.4bn was needed. She, however, said Ethiopia was better prepared for the drought now than it was during the famine in the 1980s. "The (Ethiopian) government has taken steps and provided $360 million of its own money, and it is doing all it can. It is very different from the 1980s when we didn't have any government preparedness." Kang said Ethiopia now had a food programme, which helped prepare the country, but the international community still had to come in behind the government efforts "to mitigate the long-term impacts and to ensure that the gains the government has made in the past decade is not lost". She said an additional challenge was that Ethiopia was hosting the largest number of refugees in the region. AU commissioner for rural economy and agriculture, Rhoda Peace Tumusiime, told a separate press conference that El Ni\'b1o has impacted Africa negatively. The drought in Ethiopia had undermined the positive work done over time. "To be practical, water is very key as far as this drought is concerned. "If you haven't built systems for water retention technology, you have to manage. "We have to ensure that all countries have systemic change at all levels, at leadership, institutions, and community," she said. Tumusiime also spoke about the COP21 climate change conference, which took place in Paris, France in December. Tumusiime said, however, some of the agreements were unfair towards Africa because they prohibited the use of coal, which was a cheap source of energy. "We are coming in, and we're not developed. Now they are saying don't use what other developed countries used, for example, don't use coal. "And yet for them coal is the cheapest source of energy, they developed using coal. "We are going into industrialisation, and you cannot industrialise if you don't have energy. In Africa for us energy is a challenge," she said. - ANA \</doc>

The impact of climate change is being felt across the world. As a coastal city at particular risk in the event of rising sea levels and increased storm surges and one that has faced repeated flooding from extreme weather conditions in recent decades, Cape Town has taken the lead in meeting this global challenge. I'm pleased the City of Cape Town played an active role during the COP21 negotiations in December, supporting the Paris Agreement with commitments to limiting the global temperature increase through lowering global carbon emissions at local government level and improving the resilience of our city to the impacts of current and future climate changes. Our residents are finding ways to contribute. Many have made small changes in their homes, including turning geyser temperatures down, insulating water pipes, installing solar water heaters, replacing traditional incandescent light bulbs with LEDs and switching off unused appliances at the wall. Radical change is required in the realm of mobility, however, as transportation accounts for a third of Cape Town's carbon emissions and 64 percent of all energy used in the metropole. While the city is investing in the expansion of its integrated transit system, it will be individuals who make the difference by choosing more sustainable transport options. On April 3, there is a great opportunity at Open Streets in Mitchells Plain to go car-free. Open Streets Day started in Observatory in 2013 and has grown with more people taking part in this initiative. Open Streets days have been held in Langa, Bellville,the CBD and now Mitchells Plain. The city is working with Open Streets Cape Town to explore alternatives to turn Open Streets Days from events into a programme that happens on a regular basis in different parts of the city. Next Sunday Capetonians are invited to try other modes of transport and experience a vibrant city neighbourhood in a different way. By catching a MyCiTi bus or a Metrorail train, or joining the groups of cyclists riding from Claremont and Khayelitsha to Mitchells Plain, Cape Town residents can rediscover some of the existing possibilities for moving in a low-carbon way around their city. On the day, residents can continue their car-free journey by walking, cycling, skating or even dancing along Merrydale Avenue. Open Streets is a simple concept with a powerful message: by repurposing streets as public space, our taken-for-granted concept "streets belong to cars" is challenged. The challenges of climate change cannot be addressed by governments alone and will require substantial community participation. Open Streets Days provide a unique platform for methods of interaction and enjoyment which can help build strong communities and make them realise the power of collective action. Residents of Mitchells Plain will open their streets to the rest of the city in an effort to dream up a different future. Ultimately, climate change action requires everyone to take part, and Capetonians will have the opportunity to take an important step together in Merrydale Avenue next Sunday. Come and join us and show your support for a lower carbon, more resilient future while enjoying the streets, having fun and games with fellow residents. l Patricia de Lille is the executive mayor of Cape Town. \</doc>

The international climate deal agreed to in Paris has "failed to include meaningful mechanisms" to guarantee financial support for poorer countries adapting to global warming, according to a report by Oxfam. In the study, Unfinished Business, the aid charity claims the high cost of climate adaptation measures, such as creating flood defences and drought-resistant crops, means smaller-scale farmers across the world are "being left on their own". The 2015 Paris Climate Conference ( COP21 ), held last December, was at the time heralded by some as an "historic" agreement. But Oxfam has criticised the West for failing to commit to any concrete investment targets. The report, released as UN officials recommence climate negotiations in the German city of Bonn, states: "If global co-operation on climate change is to be inclusive, durable and fair, it must leave no one behind - particularly not those who are most vulnerable to its impacts and least able to cope." Oxfam estimates that just 16% of the $100bn a year pledged by rich nations in 2009 to help poorer countries adapt to climate change and cut carbon emissions has been paid. It has called on countries to target 35% by 2020, and 50% by 2025, via grants and other forms of financing in order to avoid the burden of "heavy repayments". The cost for developing countries to adapt to climate change could go as high as $500bn a year by 2050 - four to five times larger than previous estimates, according to a report released last week by the UN. Tracy Carty, Oxfam's policy adviser on climate change, blasted the lack of commitment to developing countries, warning the issue "cannot be kicked down the road" for any longer. She also emphasised the impact of El Ni\'c3\'b1o, a climate cycle in the Pacific Ocean which can influence the weather. Carty said: "We have known about the growing gap in adaptation funding for years now, and we were dismayed when the Paris deal failed to fix it. We need to see specific commitments in Bonn to increase adaptation finance and for that money to be spent supporting small farmers who are on the front lines of the climate crisis. We are already seeing the price of failure: tens of millions of people around the world face hunger and poverty from the droughts and crop failures caused by El Ni\'c3\'b1o." In an interview with The Independent, Lord Stern, the world's most authoritative climate economist, called on rich countries to do everything they could to help poorer nations weather the storm of global warming - warning that a failure would escalate poverty and conflict. He said: "Equality is a big issue. The rich got rich on high-carbon growth and it's the poor people of the world - whether they be poor people in rich countries or poor people in poor countries - who suffer earliest and most. "The defining challenges of this century are overcoming poverty and managing climate change: if we fail on one we fail on the other. Clearly if we fail to manage climate change we create an environment so hostile that development will be undermined, leading to hundreds of millions having to move because their environment has been devastated." New data released by Nasa revealed that last month was the hottest April ever recorded. The next climate summit, COP22, will be held in Morocco in November. - The Independent \</doc>

Fetching a lost soul or having breakfast in three steps. These are just some of the tales that can be told about trees and plants in Durban's Botanic Gardens. And it's these tales that keep children captivated and help senior horticulturist and education officer, Jody Fuchs, spread his message about biodiversity and conservation to the many school pupils who visit the gardens. And with COP21 Fuchs confirmed that over 34 schools and some 1 700 children had passed through the Botanic Gardens gates this year. Many came from marginalised communities particularly KwaMashu, Inanda and Ntuzuma "It's about breaking down barriers and providing access for kids to the biodiversity in our region, and also cultivating social cohesion and sense of citizenship," said Fuchs. And showing the children how to take ownership of, and care for their environment starts on the main path into the gardens where Fuchs sparks their attention - within three steps along the path he introduces the Cabbage Tree, the Sausage Tree and the Chinese Egg tree, or as he likes to say "breakfast in three steps". The children are then introduced to Wood's Cycad, which at over 100 years old, is believed to be one of the rarest, if not the rarest, plant in the world. It was originally found in the Ngoye Forest in 1895 and is also the symbol of the Botanic Gardens. There are numerous heritage trees from the oldest Jacaranda in the country - it was planted in 1885, the lychee near the Sunken Garden, and of course, the grand giant Yellowood tree which is 81 years old. Sharing nature's rich biodiversity, including food and symbiotic relationships, are key to creating that spark of interest in the young visitors. "We take on 'green blindness' in which people tend to see no differences between all the trees and plants and we introduce the children to nature's diversity and show them that it does not work in isolation, but is all connected," said Fuchs. This is highlighted when the children visit the reservoir, which was Durban's first reservoir and holds 300 000 litres of water. It is a buzz of activity from the fish below the water lilies to the busy insects above. To conserve and recyle are also important lessons passed on during the school visits, which are done in an interactive way with Wessa's "puzzling climate change game" which all the kids play during a visit to the gardens. "We show them in a fun way the cause and effect of climate change and what they can do to mitigate the impact of climate change, from recycling to saving electricity," said Fuchs. The Botanic Gardens is home |to a wide variety of birds with many resident species breeding in the gardens. There's no doubt that the school children leave the garden having experienced nature's timelessness which is filled with many unusual tales. \</doc>

Africa could leapfrog into a low a carbon economy, with its cities taking |the lead. As the world searches for |solutions to manage the consequences of climate change at COP21 in Paris, an AfriCities |discussion on climate change heard that local governments in Africa could ensure that a green economy becomes part of their future. Hastings Chikoko, the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group Regional Director for Africa, said cities are taking leadership, and taking steps to address climate change. "National government should recognise the international role cities are playing," he said. Matshidiso Mfikoe, Member of the Mayoral Committee (MMC) for Infrastructure Services and |Environment in Johannesburg said that cities find themselves at |the coalface of climate change because they are not only |engines of growth but also big sources of the greenhouse gas emissions. Mfikoe said Johannesburg was one of the biggest city emitters in Africa, but that the city had drawn up an ambitious plan to both |mitigate and adapt to climate change. Already the City of |Johannesburg is feeling the impact of climatic changes in the form of frequent floods, drought, heat waves and extreme thunderstorms. The city predicts that it will have to battle significant increases in both temperatures and rainfall over the next forty to fifty years. This will have a major impact on infrastructure, health, |biodiversity, human settlements, and industry and food security. "In October this year we had one of our worst heat waves where temperatures rose to 38\'c2\'b0C. We nearly ran out of water. Last year the city was struck by floods that devastated many homes," she said. Johannesburg's response is to create a liveable and resilient city, which is climate-proof against these extreme weather conditions through adaption and mitigation. Mfikoe said Johannesburg's focus is on resource efficiency. This included the development of green transportation like the Rea Vaya rapid bus transport |system, climate resilient and energy efficient buildings like the Cosmo City housing project or the Alexandra urban renewal project, investing in water infrastructure and tackling the city's waste |problems. Local governments serve |70 percent of people on Earth and as such have the power to lead climate change adaptation in a dynamic world, a necessary |precondition for sustainable |development. "We believe sustainability is very important for Africa in |structural transformation," said Arthur Minsat, an economist at the Organisation for Economic |Cooperation and Development Centre. He said African cities had to choose their developmental |pathways. "We have to tackle |environmental issues hand-in-hand with developmental issues," he said. He said Africa's urban poor were among the most vulnerable to the symptoms of climate change due to poverty, marginalised communities and increasing urbanisation rates, and that the trade-offs between unchecked development and environmental consequences affected them the most. Most of the future's urbanisation in African cities still has to take place. "We can decide now what kinds of infrastructure we want, and plan to build green cities with green infrastructure," he said. \</doc>

The latest Economic Report on Africa states that the economic and environmental benefits stemming from greening Africa's industrialisation make the environmental approach the only viable option for the continent's continued development... The report, titled Greening Africa's Industrialisation, was launched on 3 April during African Development Week. Global commitments to addressing climate change, such as the agreement reached at the Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) during the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in December, set the stage for partnerships to transform Africa's growth prospects. Africa's move to greener industrialisation is not just a step towards meeting global carbon emission targets - it is a precondition for sustainable and inclusive growth. Late-runner status Dr Fatima Denton, director of the ECA's Special Initiatives Division, said that green initiatives offer the continent the opportunity to move from the periphery of the global economy to the centre. "Now we have an incredible opportunity to configure our own industrialisation. Africa has an opportunity to take advantage of its 'late-runner' status and it has huge potential to become a front-runner in this new pathway, to basically reshape its own economies and reshape it in a way that it can own." Although African countries' carbon emissions are low compared to other countries, going green can boost growth, Denton continued. "This is no longer an issue of choice. We have to take this pathway because it makes good economic sense," she said. The report says Africa can leapfrog traditional carbon-intensive growth methods and champion low-carbon development. It notes that Africa's growth has largely been unequal, has been based on the extraction of raw materials, and has damaged biodiversity and natural resources. How, it asks, can these patterns be transformed while ensuring steady supplies of water, food and energy? "Africa's move to greener industrialisation is not just a step towards meeting global carbon emission targets - it is a precondition for sustainable and inclusive growth," it says, noting green initiatives, particularly in energy, can benefit manufacturing and other sectors. Focus on climate change Russell Bishop, a senior economist from the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate Change, said Africa's future must include a focus on climate change issues. "Africa has the opportunity that has never been achieved in any other economy in the world, which is to grow in a clean way." Dr Celestin Monga, managing director of the UN Industrial Development Organisation, however, said the goals are noble but questioned whether they're realistic. "I think we all agree that going green is a wonderful goal but we also need to be realistic and honest about the trade-offs that it involves. What are we going to do with the fossil fuels that we currently have? Some of these excellent goals need to be presented in a very realistic way so that we can see the trade-offs." The report also includes studies on 12 African countries where green industrialisation is gaining momentum. It calls for government leaders to support the transformation, develop green visions and strategies, translate them into policies, and engage stakeholders. Central to green industrialisation is decoupling energy, investing in infrastructure, and greening cities. While funding such measures will be difficult, it is important to start now, the report says. \</doc>

OVER the coming weeks, about 100 Greyton homes will be |sporting mini-wind turbines with blades made from plastic bottles. They will be attached to broom handles and can be mounted anywhere on the house. The turbines have USB ports to allow residents to charge their cellphones, LED lights and possibly even a laptop. It is one of the initiatives of Greyton Transition Town, a non-profit organisation, which has teamed with a company called Miniwind to test in the community. Greyton is the only transition town in Africa but part of a global movement of about 3 000. Its aim is to create a sustainable, equitable, integrated community that is self-sufficient and focuses on reducing the cost of living while also looking at ways to reduce energy costs. Nicola Vernon, the chairwoman of Greyton Transition Town, lives in a farmhouse in Greyton built out of straw bales and clay. It is "off the grid". Vernon said initially, when she chose to build with clay and straw, there was a perception in the community that it was a step backwards. But she said when people realised it was material that was widely available and that it provided amazing insulation, they|wanted to follow suit. Many people are now extending their RDP houses using eco-bricks made from plastic bottles and stuffed with anything from chip packets and cling-wrap to sweet wrappers and the plastic around cigarette boxes. These turn waste into a highly insulating building material. Hendrik Davids, one of a team of eight who built Vernon's farmhouse, immediately saw the benefits. He has been extending his home in Heuwelkroon using eco-bricks, which he makes. There are three houses on the farm, all run off solar, and it is used as a base for educational programmes run with local schoolchildren. Vernon also runs the Greyton farm animal sanctuary where there are an array of rescued pigs, geese and sheep mingling with the dogs and cats at the farm. Marshall Rinquest, the director of Greyton Transition Town, heads up environmental education and works with children from the surrounding schools. Part of the Greyton dumpsite has been turned into a green park for the community and has an outdoor classroom built from eco-bricks. The initiative has planted trees and also makes compost, which is sold to the community. The long-term plan is to have more of the town using solar power. The initiative is working with the municipality and the Industrial Development Corporation to come up with a plan to get the Emil Weder High School in Genadendal, which currently pays R45 000 a month in power bills, to use solar power. This would not only reduce their bill but provide an opportunity to sell surplus power. Greyton Transition Town has transformed an old school hostel into a 60-bed eco-lodge, which is run as a business to support its work. It has a grey-water reticulation system linked to a permaculture garden. Rinquest, who is also a UN ambassador for sustainable communities, said the initiative had planted a fruit forest garden with a range of fruit trees, vegetables and|medicinal plants. The initiative has been invited to make a presentation at COP21 , the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris. \</doc>

Political scandals. Investigations to uncover a wide variety of wrongdoing. Corporate malfeasance. These all demand our attention as a news publication. But they pale in comparison with an environmental catastrophe looming on a planetary scale. Which is why the Mail & Guardian chose to lead this edition with our eight-step plan to wage war on rising temperatures. We want to help our readers agitate for change before it is too late. Whatever the deniers and self-deluders may claim, the warming of our planet is a fact - and the overwhelming consensus in the scientific community is that it is rooted in human agency. The effects of climate change will be felt only gradually, but it threatens to disrupt ecosystems, undermine global food production and, as droughts, floods and other extreme weather events become more widespread and the oceans rise, displace human settlements on an unprecedented scale. The United Nations climate agency warns that climate change in the 21st century will be "severe, pervasive and irreversible". There is one consolation. In contrast with other planetary climate events such as ice ages, humans are not entirely powerless. They have a degree of control over the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving the rise in global temperatures. And they can take remedial action to mitigate their effects. In a last-ditch effort to stop the world warming by more than 2\'b0C, diplomats have gathered in Paris for the 21st Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ). But short-termism and political pressures at home may stand in the way of decisive steps being taken. Somehow, the gulf between the world's wealthy and poorer nations, which have radically divergent agendas, must be bridged. Each nation has to pass and implement climate legislation: aspirational pledges are not enough. In Africa the impact of warming is already starting to become apparent. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research points out that "annual temperatures have been rising at an alarming rate across the continent" since 1961, equivalent to a 3.2\'b0C increase every 100 years. Livestock and crops stop producing and breeding properly when average temperatures exceed 30\'b0C. From next week, South Africa's interior will see temperatures stay above that figure for a sustained period. Our government's commitments to dealing with climate change are ambitious - a 42% reduction in emissions by 2025, and an emissions peak followed by a plateau and decline. But, as with all South Africa's good intentions, the goals are consistently undermined by a lack of implementation. The development of renewables is bedevilled by the monopoly Eskom has over electricity transmission lines. The same utility has been given a reprieve in complying with air quality legislation that it knew was coming. A key emitter, Sasol, went to court and was granted a compliance holiday. Behind the scenes, vested interests lobby for the weakening of climate legislation, and tend to prevail. In public, think-tanks and columnists muddy the water by trying to persuade people that global warming is not happening. Yet South Africa - one of the few countries to constitutionally guarantee citizens a healthy environment - is alive with possibilities. Technological innovation and strong legislation have placed us in the vanguard of the world's nations. In our short history as a democratic state, we have a proud track record of confronting and overcoming impossible odds. Ke nako. \</doc>

The upcoming Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) Summit, which starts on Friday in Sandton, will be a milestone and historic event which will usher in a new era for development of China-Africa relations. Government says the summit will also send a strong message to the world that China and Africa are working hard to achieve "win-win" cooperation and common development. This is according to China and South Africa, who will co-chair the China-Africa leaders' summit in Johannesburg. This will be the second summit in the 15 years since the forum's inception, and the first to be held in Africa. The summit is seen as a crucial platform for collective dialogue between China and Africa and an effective mechanism for closer practical cooperation. Speaking to media on Wednesday at the Union Buildings, President Xi Jinping called on leaders of African countries to use the summit to renew friendship and explore cooperation with China, while charting the course for China-Africa friendly and practical cooperation in various fields. The summit, he said, is important for the relationships of development with China and a more inclusive and sustainable development summit of the world. President Xi was confident the summit will be a success, and so is President Jacob Zuma, who said South Africa looks forward to hosting the event. The two leaders met in Pretoria on Wednesday for President Xi's State visit ahead of the summit. The visit saw the two countries sign agreements worth R94 billion in various fields such as industrialisation and processing; enhancement of cooperation in Special Economic Zones (SEZs); marine cooperation; infrastructure development, human resources cooperation and financial cooperation. Both Presidents were upbeat, saying relations are at their best level ever. The two developing giants also used their meeting to discuss international developments such as the UN climate change conference - COP21 - which is currently taking place in Paris. The impacts of climate change affect everyone, said President Zuma. He said African countries are already experiencing some of the worst effects of climate change. We must anticipate that these impacts will worsen over time, unless global greenhouse gas emissions are drastically reduced, with developed countries taking the lead. We urge all parties in Paris to put the interests of the world first and not allow national interests to make it difficult to reach an agreement. President Zuma was optimistic that a legally binding agreement will be reached in Paris. We have to act now before it is too late," said President Zuma. President Zuma and President Xi also touched on BRICS as well as the reform and expansion of the UN Security Council to include other regions of the globe, especially Africa with its one billion people. They also discussed the need to promote global peace and security and condemned the recent acts of terrorism in France, Nigeria and other countries, saying global action against terrorism is necessary within the ambit of the United Nations. Ahead of the talks, President Zuma hosted a welcome ceremony for President Xi, who arrived in Pretoria earlier on Wednesday. He was welcomed by the traditional guard of honour and a 21-gun salute. A State banquet was held for President Xi and his delegation. \</doc>

Pope Francis has urged world leaders to seal a strong agreement at the Paris climate change meeting... While visiting the global headquarters of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in Nairobi, Pope Francis said that transforming current development models was a 'political and economic obligation'. Speaking to an audience of thousands, which included UNEP executive director, Achim Steiner, and United Nations Office at Nairobi director-general, Sahle-Work Zewde, Pope Francis placed particular emphasis on the need to adopt low-carbon energy systems and end the 'throw-away culture' that contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. "In a few days, an important meeting on climate change will be held in Paris. It would be sad, and I dare say even catastrophic, were particular interests to prevail over the common good," Pope Francis said. "In this international context, we are confronted with a choice which cannot be ignored - either to improve or to destroy the environment." New energy system " COP21 represents an important stage in the process of developing a new energy system which depends on a minimal use of fossil fuels, aims at energy efficiency and makes use of energy sources with little or no carbon content. We are faced with a great political and economic obligation to rethink and correct the dysfunctions and distortions of the current model of development." UNEP's Emissions Gap report, released in early November, showed that the expected Paris commitments from member states will cut up to four to six gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year from global emissions in 2030. This, however, is 12 gigatons short of the level that will keep the world on track to stay below the 'safe' limit of a 2\'b0C temperature rise this century. Steiner praised Pope Francis's moral leadership on the environment - which the Pontiff has already displayed with his encyclical 'Laudato Si' calling on the faithful to embrace their responsibilities to the environment - saying it added global momentum to efforts to close this emissions gap and implement the Sustainable Development Goals. "Addressing the world just a few days before the Paris climate conference, with the future of this planet hanging in the balance, you remind world leaders, business leaders and individual citizens that we each have not only a responsibility, but an obligation to act on what our conscience tells us to be right," Steiner said. Practical and ethical challenges Pope Francis also touched upon the need to create a world in which unsustainable consumption and production patterns - which contribute to pollution, ecosystem degradation and climate change through the wasteful use of resources in the production of food and other goods - are ended. "This calls for an educational process which fosters in boys and girls, women and men, young people and adults, the adoption of a culture of care - care for oneself, care for others, care for the environment - in place of a culture of waste, a 'throw-away culture' where people use and discard themselves, others and the environment." As a further symbol of his environmental commitment, Pope Francis planted an Olea capensis, an indigenous tree found across the continent of Africa, on the grounds of the UN headquarters before his talk. \</doc>

Sustainability and technology will continue to be trend growth points in SA's building and construction industry... 1. Sustainability Green remains the number one bestseller. This is backed up by the World Green Building Trends 2016 report by Dodge Data & Analytics, which says that more than 60% of the respondents' projects would be green by 2018, with a doubling from current projects across the Middle East, North Africa, Asia, South America and sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, the largest percentage of green building activity continues to be in the commercial building segment, comprising 46% of respondents' future green building projects. 2. Green certification A by-product of the sustainability revolution is that construction companies and developers are not only seeking out products and processes that comply with green specifications, but also certification that their practices are sustainable through green-star ratings by the Green Building Council South Africa (GBCSA). In addition, the GBCSA committed to introducing a net zero/positive building certification scheme by 2020 at the COP21 conference held late last year. 3. Technology rules Today and in the future, building and construction is far more than mere bricks and mortar with the growing influence of technology. According to blog Whirlwind Steel: "The construction industry was slow to jump on the technology bandwagon but its sure making up for it now. From construction management software programs to smartphone apps that make it easy - and instantaneous - to access communication, photos, plans, details and so on - even small builders are taking advantage of this trend. Perhaps one of the most universally appreciated innovations is building information modelling (BIM), which provides 3D representations, facilitating project managers and crews as they assess risks and plan the most efficient way to scaffold and stage jobsites." 4. Tiny living One very interesting trend emerging in the States is the Tiny House Movement, which includes micro-apartments that provide affordable living in densely populated cities, as well as independent tiny homes that are built on mobile trailers and installed on a piece of property for just a fraction of the price of a typical single family home. The movement's website says this social trend is: "A result of environmental concerns, financial concerns, and the desire for more time and freedom. For most Americans 1/3 to 1/2 of their income is dedicated to the roof over their heads; this translates to 15 years of working over your lifetime just to pay for it, and because of it 76% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck." Working towards a greener environment, while harnessing the possibilities that technology has to offer in terms of design, security and administration will be the focus of the building and construction industry in 2016. {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell \</doc>

To many eyes, India looks like a roadblock to an effective world climate deal. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's demand for "climate justice" - meaning that rich nations should reduce their carbon emissions even as India and others continue to pollute - reprises the polarising rhetoric that sank previous international attempts to battle global warming.But there's merit to Modi's argument, and success in Paris requires that all countries recognise it. Read: Germany's renewable energy strategy pays offThe first thing to appreciate is that India's fuel mix is growing steadily greener. Coal is still the cheapest and most abundant domestic fuel source, but it's getting more expensive and harder to dig from the ground. Many banks already see more potential in funding solar projects than new coal-fired power plants. That said, Modi's central argument is sound: India can't accept a hard limit on emissions when it's still trying to lift hundreds of millions of Indians - more than 20% of whom lack electricity - out of poverty. Western nations are most responsible for the greenhouse gases now in the atmosphere; the average American accounts for 10 times the annual emissions of the average Indian. But, politically, the chances that the United States and other Western nations will commit to lowering their own emissions fast enough to prevent dangerous climate change are slim. So it's essential that they also help fund emissions cuts in the developing world. Money devoted to mitigation in poorer countries is well spent. In India, solar power costs $96 a megawatt hour, compared with $107 in the US, according to data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Building a new solar plant costs 70% more in the US despite much lower financing costs. Because most of India's infrastructure is only now being built, smart investments can set the country on a sustainable and energy-efficient course. What the country needs more is access to cheaper capital. And it's taken welcome steps in this direction by authorising tax-free investment bonds and by setting up programmes to encourage private investment in renewables. Western nations could help by mobilising both public and private sources of funding, including soft loans from institutions such as the US Export-Import Bank. As much as money, India and other developing countries need assistance with clean technology. Better grid technology could allow India to tap its potential for rooftop solar projects, for example, and access to next-generation solar cells could lower costs further. This is not to say that India itself doesn't have work to do. If it can't raise its climate targets immediately, it should at least not block efforts to scrutinise the progress that all countries are making. Gas and electricity pricing and, in the nuclear-power sector, liability concerns need to be addressed to better encourage investment. And India could co-operate with Western companies by offering itself as a test bed for new technologies.In the short term, India's carbon emissions are almost certain to rise. But that doesn't mean the country can't help move the world toward a clean-energy future. - \Â£9 Bloomberg \</doc>

It's official: 2015 was the hottest year ever recorded, by a huge margin. The world is 0.75\'c2\'b0C hotter than the long-term average, and 1\'c2\'b0C hotter than it was before people started burning fossil fuels on an industrial scale.This is according to data sets released on Wednesday by the United Kingdom's Met Office, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States, and Nasa. They gave credence to what daily temperature records and altered weather patterns have been signalling - that 2015 took the previous record set by 2014 and broke it. The margin by which 2015 beat the previous year has been flagged by the three agencies as cause for great concern; 2014 was 0.57\'c2\'b0C hotter than the long-term average for the planet, and 2015 was 0.75\'c2\'b0C hotter. Even in the midst of climate change the increase between years is normally smaller than this. That 2015 was so much hotter than it should have been had a lot to do with the effect of the most powerful El Ni\'c3\'b1o ever recorded. The phenomenon warms the Pacific Ocean and brings about hotter weather worldwide. This dovetailed with long-term warming to bring torrential rainfall and a hot Christmas to the northern hemisphere. The UK was, on average, 10\'c2\'b0C hotter this December than it usually is. Instead of snow, several countries experienced flooding as the warm air drove the rainfall. In the southern hemisphere, El Ni\'c3\'b1o has meant drought and extreme heat. In South Africa, temperatures consistently headed into the high 30s and low 40s, when they should have been in the low 30s.In October, Vredendal, near Cape Town, set a global temperature record for that day by hitting 48.4\'c2\'b0C, which so alarmed the South African Weather Service that it rechecked the town's measuring instruments. Worldwide, January and April were the only months of 2015 that did not break their own monthly records. Since the year 2000, average global monthly temperature records have been broken more than 30 times. World War I had just started when the previous average monthly cold record was broken. In South Africa, recent lower temperatures and rain have brought relief, but the weather service gives a sobering projection for 2016: "Drier and warmer conditions are expected to be extreme  and may worsen the current drought conditions." The UK Met Office says 2016 will beat 2015's record, creating the hottest consecutive years on record. Those records mean that the world is, on average, 1\'c2\'b0C hotter than it was before the Industrial Revolution. That moment coupled the burning of fossil fuels to economic growth, a relationship that is only now starting to uncouple. The Paris Agreement, accepted by world governments at COP21 last year, set a goal of ensuring average temperatures do not increase by another 1\'c2\'b0C this century. But environment watchdogs say the sum total of countries' pledges will see the world warm by an average of 3\'c2\'b0C this century. This will lead to irreversible climate change, says the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. \</doc>

Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson says renewable energy is a basic need that should feature in all countries' energy mix plans. The Minister said this when she made closing remarks at the South African International Energy Conference (SAIREC) 2015 at the Cape Town International Convention Centre, on Tuesday. The conference, which officially started on Monday, deliberated on various topics and innovations in renewable energy and was attended by thousands of delegates from 82 countries. This has been a significant event - being the first of its kind on African soil and at a crucial time - a time where energy is a necessity to alleviate poverty and fast track sustainable development in a climate resilient manner. In South Africa, energy is a basic need, she said. The Minister said as countries prepare to meet at COP21 in Paris later this year, they need to be decisive in dealing with global warming. To meet the greenhouse gas reduction objectives and mitigate global warming, as governments we need to actively pursue low-carbon policies. On our respective journeys to lower carbon pathways, renewable energy has a major role to play in the energy mix, she said. While multinational corporations have converged on Africa to invest in renewable energy ventures - from wind turbines from off-shore winds to solar farms at strategic areas - the Minister said South Africa was committed to providing a long term solution to energy security across the continent, a continent where energy supply is limited. The success story of the South African government's Independent Power Producer programme dominated discussions at the conference, with some experts indicating that while it may not be possible to model it in other countries in its current form, it would assist in formulating tailored programmes based on their climate conditions. The Minister said the roll-out of clean, affordable renewable energy was important to the continent's development. In sub-Saharan Africa, the epicentre of the global challenge is to overcome energy poverty. However, I must say the challenges are surmountable and the benefits are immense. Energy contributes to a better quality of life. To those that have it, modern energy unlocks access to improved healthcare, improved education, improved economic opportunities and, even longer life. To those that don't, it is a major constraint on their social and economic development. Africa's energy sector is vital to its development, the Minister said. She also said that South Africa was committed to greening its economy and to shifting away from a heavy reliance on fossil fuels and heavy reliance on a resource extraction economy. Renewable energy offers a major opportunity to further develop our country into the lower carbon and climate resilient vision we have set out in our National Development Plan. It has the potential to stimulate job creation, skills development and a broader local economy as well as positively contributing to our national energy mix, she said. \</doc>

Tomorrow in the city of Marie-Antoinette, the Paris Commune and the guillotine, some of the world's biggest corporations will go on trial before a "People's Court of Mother Nature", chaired by a South African attorney. The 13 distinguished judges of the "International Tribunal on the Rights of Nature" will be hearing six cases in short order at Paris's Maison des M\'c3\Â£9tallos in Rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud tomorrow and on Saturday. There are no guillotines or jail terms for those convicted by "the people" - though the tribunal may call for financial reparations, mitigation, restor-ation or the prevention of |further damages and harm. Heading the tribunal is Cormac Cullinan, a Cape Town |attorney and author of the book Wild Law: A Manifesto for Earth Justice. Cullinan also helped to draft the new "rights of nature" provisions in the constitutions of Ecuador and Bolivia, inspiring similar protection-of-nature |ordinances by several US |municipalities, including Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Negotiators from nearly 200 countries gathered nearby at the UN's COP21 Climate Change summit at Le Bourget, will also be on trial indirectly, as tribunal leaders have already pronounced this conference to be a failure, in advance. Jokes and sniggering aside, Cullinan believes the world's current governance system |is "an arid wasteland devoid |of leadership and of any |discernible track towards a |viable future for most of |humanity". Most legal systems, he |argues, have been designed to serve "the imperial project of extending human control over every aspect of the planet". Most current laws, he says, disrespect the rights of nature - for example, the rights of a river to flow unimpeded by dams, or for natural forests not to be obliterated for profit. "The law is used to suppress those who take action to defend Earth and other beings, and to convict them as criminals guilty of anything from property damage to terrorism." His dream is for an international tribunal that concerns itself with the fundamental rights of all beings, including humans, that makes decisions on the basis of what is best for the Earth community as a whole, regardless of politics. His aim - shared by most of the approximately 32 000 people who ratified the Earth Rights Declaration in Cochabamba, Bolivia, in 2010 - is to ensure that plants, animals, rivers and other non-human "beings" have an inalienable right to exist and to survive. The Paris trials that start tomorrow relate to a variety of environmental and social issues, including hydraulic fracturing (fracking), mega dams in the Amazon, the cultivation of genetically modified crops, mining and oil exploration in Yasuni National Park. Cullinan's vision is for a tribunal to investigate and decide cases of alleged violations of the Earth Rights Declaration, and to promote universal acceptance that people "have a duty to respect the intrinsic rights of all natural beings". Tribunal members would be elected every three years. There would also be a "Mother Earth Defender's Office" to initiate cases and lead evidence on behalf of Mother Earth.

The South African Government and the European Commission discussed today the pressing issue of climate change and stressed the importance of intensifying urgent actions to address the challenge at the international, regional, national and grassroots levels. Ms Edna Molewa, South African Minister of Environmental Affairs, and Mr Maros Sefcovic, Vice President of the European Commission for the Energy Union, met to discuss cooperation on climate change. The Vice-President and the Minister's delegation also visited the Khangezile School in Springs near Johannesburg to see at first hand a practical example of South Africa-European Union cooperation with regard to the application of green technologies in community centres. Minister Molewa conveyed the South African government's appreciation to the EU for its ongoing support to a number of environmental projects in South Africa and elsewhere in Africa and - commenting on the Khangezile School initiative - commended in particular its strong focus on enhancing public awareness of the climate change challenge and on the important role of women and youth. The partners confirmed that environment and climate change remain a priority area for bilateral cooperation, as outlined in the South Africa - European Union (SA-EU) Strategic Partnership of 2007 and agreed to enhance their dialogue in these areas, notably covering green and ocean economy in the context of the SA EU Forum on Environment and Sustainable Development. In this regard, they noted progress in development cooperation with EU support through non-governmental organisation (NGOs) to projects ranging from waste management to eco-tourism and permaculture gardens to carbon farming, with many of these projects being co-funded by the South African Government. The EU reiterated its support to South Africa's infrastructure development through the Infrastructure Investment Programme for South Africa (IIPSA) managed by the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA). Sustainable energy, transport, waste and water management are among the focal sectors of the programme and a number of promising proposals are being considered. South Africa is also one of the six beneficiary countries under the EU-funded SWITCH Africa Green programme implemented by UN agencies, targeting sustainable consumption and production practices. In their discussion on multilateral cooperation, the partners reaffirmed their shared commitment to secure the adoption of an ambitious new Protocol under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at COP21 /CMP11 in Paris in December. This would mark the successful conclusion of the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, upon which the current round of multilateral negotiations is based. The partners discussed their respective Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to the new global agreement on climate change. South Africa welcomed the EU's pledge to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030 as compared to 1990 and informed that it is finalising its preparations to submit South Africa's INDC to the United Nations in time for inclusion in the UN's synthesis report on the aggregate effect of the INDCs. The contribution would include not only mitigation, but also adaptation and means of implementation, which are of central importance in the current negotiations. The South African Government and the European Commission will continue to cooperate with each other and to engage other partners ahead of the Paris Conference to help ensure its success.

THE world would miss a historic opportunity at the Paris climate talks if governments failed to cut greenhouse gas emissions to the level that science had indicated was necessary, Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa said. Speaking in Johannesburg on what South Africa hoped to see in Paris in December, Molewa said the negotiations needed to recognise that a solution to global climate change was relevant only if it were responsive to the scientific evidence. Scientists had confirmed that each of the past three decades was successively warmer than the preceding ones, a process that started with the Industrial Revolution. Although nations had made commitments to cut emissions, scientists said these were not enough. Molewa said while South Africa had made a commitment at the climate talks in Copenhagen in 2009 to cut emissions by 34 percent below "business as usual" by 2020, and by 42 percent by 2025, success depended on |the help from developed countries to poorer countries financially and technically. This obligation was also set out by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. "Climate change poses one of the most serious threats to Africa's long-term sustainable development, economic growth and qualify of life," Molewa said. South Africa is already experiencing the effects of climate change, with the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather around the country. Parts of the country have been in the grip of drought, while others experienced flash floods. The climate talks at Cop 17 in Durban set the path for a new legally binding agreement to be clinched at Cop 21 in Paris. The agreement, under the Kyoto Protocol, would end in 2020, after which the world would need a new one. This would need to address not only cuts in greenhouse gases, but also issues of how the world would adapt to the levels of the inevitable climate change. \</doc>

This is what the beachfront could look like if the global temperature rises by 4\'b0C New sea-level rise research paints grim picture Scary picture of 4\'b0C rise in Bay THE impact of sea-level rise on Nelson Mandela Bay could be catastrophic, with swollen waters of Algoa Bay swamping roads, highways, railway lines, port infrastructure and large parts of Deal Party and North End if the global temperature rises by 4\'b0C. A graphic new report based on the latest climate change research shows how the sea could thrust into the Swartkops River, pushing the polluted estuary into the residential areas of Kwazakhele and Soweto-on-Sea and inundating the Perseverance industrial township. Expanded by heat, stalled mega- currents and melting glaciers, and prefigured by storm surges, it could crash over Kings Beach and across the prime land where the tank farm, ore terminal and new beachfront lifestyle development area are situated. Further along Beach Road, it could swell over Pollok Beach and the car park where the Something Good restaurant stands. That is just part of the prognosis for Nelson Mandela Bay captured in precise online visuals developed by US-based organisation Climate Central. These visuals are based on research by the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA (PNAS), whose studies published ahead of the 2015 Paris Climate Conference reveal that "unabated carbon emissions leading to 4\'b0C warming could lock in 6.9m to 10.8m of long-term global sea-level rise". "Such a rise would threaten to submerge land currently home to 470-760 million people on six continents over the coming centuries," the studies state. Working with PNAS's global figures, Climate Central factored in a suite of local factors, including gradient and terrain, warming off- shore winds, currents and degree of continuing land subsidence after the rebound following glacial subsidence 10000 years ago. The result has allowed it to produce interactive coastal maps to show what the effects would be for different emission levels, temperature rise and consequent sea-level rise wherever you are in the world. The publication of these new visuals comes on the eve of the Cop21 climate change summit, set to start on Monday and run to December 11. In a preview address this week, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-Moon said more than 166 countries, which collectively accounted for more than 90% of emissions, had now submitted national climate plans with targets. With the global temperature rise since the onset of the industrial revolution in 1880 about 0.85\'b0C, the figure touted by Ki-Moon is up from the 2\'b0C the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientists have already warned could wreak havoc, with increased drought, fire and floods, storm damage, changing disease vectors, species extinction and sea rise. Still, it is lower than the 4\'b0C many climate scientists are now pointing to as unavoidable. Most recently, research supporting this figure focuses on the until- now-unexplained factor of cloud cover, showing how rising temperatures will reduce the clouds, meaning less sunlight is reflected back into space, resulting in still hotter conditions. Weekend Post took a slow drive this week to get a feel of how the surreal new blue shading on the Climate Central Surging Seas map of Nelson Mandela Bay translates on the ground. Low-lying John Tallant Road with Algorax on the left and the Fishwater Flats treatment plant on the right could be hardest hit, it seems, with the ocean ballooning right over Grahamstown and Trunk roads, the railway line and the flatland between, and into Kwazakhele, through streets like Mcaphukiso, Mahambehlala, Kuzwayo, Madlingozi, Sodladla, Ngwendu and Ghandi. These streets are lined with homes and businesses, which would be obliterated. The blue also washes over important conduits like Daku and Dibanisa and up at Coega over the Ngqura port. The map shows that, as human structures appear again, the ocean starts invading the land. A large part of Settlers Freeway and Burman Road, the main thoroughfare through Deal Party, are covered, and much of the Port Elizabeth harbour is under water. What was key about the PNAS research findings was that "carbon pollution casts a long shadow", as Climate Central's Dr Ben Strauss explained. "It is expected to persist in the atmosphere long enough to prolong temperature increases for ... thousands of years." It was not so easy to gauge when this level of sea rise would occur. It might be any time between 200 and 2000 years from now, "although the faster end of the spectrum is more likely". But we were locked into it happening, he said. Asked for his comment on the new maps, Nelson Mandela Bay Chamber of Business chief executive Kevin Hustler said that "with the correct planning, we believe sufficient measures could be developed to alleviate extensive damage and loss to the economy". There was no reason to panic but the Bay, business and ordinary citizens needed to work together on this challenge, he said. "We need to establish clear scenarios and implement plans based on best practice developed around the world on how to jointly deal with this potential threat to the economy," Hustler said. Bay spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said the metro's Coastal Management Plan (CMP), updated this year, ranked the risk of storm surges on the back of sea-level rise as particularly important. To counter this, "the CMP recommends removal and relocation of some infrastructure ... and limiting development in certain zones to protect nourishment of beaches through sand migration". As part of the drive to bring down greenhouse gases, the metro has developed an inventory of the worst polluters. On the other end of the scale, more than 100000 households had been engaged through the metro's Go Green programme to help them reduce their carbon footprints through a wide range of measures, Mniki said. eThekwini Municipality sea-level rise specialist Dr Andrew Mather, who has advised the Bay on setback lines, was critical of the lack of time frames in the Climate Central visuals. Setback lines for sea-level rise of up to 1m had been established for the bay and the key was that development must happen behind these lines, he said. "Ordinary citizens should make sure they are aware of the risk lines on their coastline and raise these issues when developments are proposed in these zones." Harris said storm surge on the back of a rising sea level probably posed the biggest threat to the metro. In March 2007 8.5m waves struck the KwaZulu-Natal coast on the back of a temporary 1m sea rise caused by a cut-off low- pressure storm and equinox spring tide - resulting in R8.5-billion damage. Studies of that event showed natural coastlines absorbed storm impact best - but this was the biggest problem in Port Elizabeth, where historic development and invasive exotic vegetation had blocked the sand migration corridor which used to supply sand to the beaches in the bay, Harris said. "This has compromised our natural resilience to sea-level rise inside the bay. This resilience has to now be artificially constructed and this is already being done with a mixture of cement sea walls and sandbag imitation dunes," she said. "But if we decide we want to defend the beachfront amenities under a 4\'b0C scenario, that would probably mean sacrificing our beaches and having the waves breaking against some kind of a wall ... The alternative would be realignment." Human rights and climate change activist, NMMU development studies researcher Professor Janet Cherry, said the South African government had to sharply increase its commitment to carbon emission cuts. "If Cop21 does not come up with radical measures, we are doomed to 4\'b0C" - which would be a disaster, Cherry said.

South Africa's Minister of Environmental Affairs, Ms Edna Molewa, has arrived in New York to attend the High Level Event of Climate Change happening tomorrow, 29 June 2015, at the United Nations Headquarters. Today, 28 June 2015, the Minister attended a meeting of Ministers responsible for climate change from BASIC countries (Brazil, South Africa, India and China). The meeting discussed issues relating to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations. BASIC Group of countries is made up of the relevant Ministers dealing with climate change issues in their respective countries from South Africa, India, China and Brazil. 2015 is the critical and concluding year of the climate change negotiations initiated by the Durban COP in 2011 towards the adoption of a new protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention at the Paris COP at the end of the year. COP 21 will be hosted in Paris, France. The Paris agreement will be implemented from 2020. Lima COP 20 / CMP 10 was a penultimate year for the negotiations of a new legal agreement. The Conference adopted the 'Lima call for climate action, which managed to address three (differentiation, assessment of the contributions and scope of the contributions) of the five political issues facing the climate negotiations for a new legal agreement. South Africa as a responsible global citizen has played an instrumental role in the achievements made in Lima, such as rallying other BASIC countries (Brazil, India and China) to support the Africa position. This marked a successful achievement by South Africa to use the BASIC countries to support the Africa common position and thus further strengthening South-South cooperation. The Minister will also have bilateral meetings with her counterparts from different countries with a view to galvanize political ambition towards a positive outcome at the Climate Change Conference in Paris in December this year.

NEOKA Naidoo is a policy and research communicator at Cape Town environmental NPO, Project 90 by 2030. What does your job entail? I began as a policy and research intern at Project 90, but now work as policy and research communicator. My job entails a great deal of co-ordination with other civil society groups and communities, and engaging them on matters of environmental policy making. I keep a keen eye on the climate change policy and legislation being developed in Parliament, and make sure we make submissions as civil society. Effective and efficient collaboration are key aspects of my job. As part of my focus on advocacy and policy, I worked with the Project 90 team and other civil society actors ahead of the 2015 COP21 Climate Change Conference in Paris. I aim to make the technicalities within climate policy developments in South Africa more accessible by civil society actors. What is your background? When I was about 10 years old, I wanted to become a vegetarian. I always felt a sense of responsibility towards the environment and have always enjoyed spending time in nature. In high school I joined the Geography Club where we went on many hikes. It was one of my high school teachers that really triggered my interest in the environmental sciences as a possible career. I have a BSc in environmental sciences from the University of KwaZulu-Natal, and am finishing my post graduate diploma in sustainable development and renewable energy at the Sustainability Institute (University of Stellenbosch). Describe a typical day: I very rarely experience that. A lot of my time is dedicated to building my understanding of the civil society space in South Africa. I endeavour to keep up to date with all policy and research-related events in the environmental field, for example the papers delivered earlier this year at the hearings by the energy regulator (Nersa) into Eskom's tariff hike application. I attend many conferences too (such as the COP Conference in Paris last year and the African Renewable Energy Initiative Meeting in Berlin in February), and I have also have the chance to deliver position papers on behalf of South African civil society several times. What are the biggest challenges that face you at work? "Transparent Climate Action" is our key theme, as the Policy & Research team at Project 90, for this year. This refers to the challenge of changing the way that especially the different levels in government look at climate change. Climate change is affecting people as we speak; it is an important enough subject that must be communicated in an easy to understand manner. For example, people need to |realise the link between water conservation and the generation of electricity. What are your major rewards? I am part of a fantastic team, not just at Project 90 but also in the industry in which I work. I am inspired also by the people I meet such as the president of COP20, the Peruvian environment minister Manuel Pulgar-Vida. Listening to a minister who speaks of the importance of longevity and sustainability, and how we need to make this work for our children, gives me hope. What are the minimum educational requirements for the job? A mix of academic teaching and work experience is recommended. Not all academic teaching helps prepare you for a job like this where you interact with different groups of people every day, and need to think on your feet. My internships at Greenpeace and the Gordon Institute of Business Science gave me an understanding of a work environment and helped me build my network of references. It also helps to have a passion for the work you do. What is the basic starting salary? The starting salary varies and is project-dependent. \</doc>

A few years ago, alternative energy sources were a rich man's whimsy, but we are now living in the world of low-cost renewable energy... Speaking on the first day of African Utility Week, he said: There is nothing alternative about it anymore and anyone calling it that is 10 years out of date. He was referring to some renewable projects that are producing power at a cost as low as three US cents. Investment in renewables Liebreich explained that historically when oil prices plummeted, renewable investment usually stalled, but in the most recent drop in oil price, this didn t happen. Now, China accounts for about one-third of the clean energy investment globally, while there has been a R6bn average investment in renewables across the Africa mostly in solar. Half of this investment in one country South Africa. In terms of the Cop21 plans signed in Paris last year, Liebreich said, we need almost miraculous achievements to achieve these goals. We already have one, with solar power the price has come down by seven times in 15 years and wind, by four times in the same period. Three cents won t be the lowest we ll go, he said. The Miracle of Musk Liebreich then turned to what he called the Miracle of Musk and the transition to electric vehicles. The launch of Tesla 3 was the game changer, and there were 276,000 orders placed for the car in three days. Although Musk catalysed the disruption, there are other electric vehicles on the market. This will have implications on electricity demand, he said. It will also have a profound effect on the oil and gas market, and countries planning to base their economies on these commodities face a serious problem if they don t adapt. He concluded with a positive message. Africa is fully able to attract investment. I know the continent is facing tough times with downgrades, but this will also pass. He did, however, caution that there was a lot of work to be done around utilities and creditworthiness. Thinking outside the box Speaking on the same platform, Jim Rogers, former CEO and chairman of the board of Duke Energy, USA, said it is time to think outside the box by utilising new technologies . When it comes to safe, affordable electricity, there is no perfect mix. When you think in terms of business models one size doesn t fit all and each has to be tailored for the uniqueness of each country. Grids have changed from analogue to digital. I call this Grid 2.0. So we have to understand the grid within internet of things and think of it as a battery. In addition to technology, there has been a process of democratisation with customers wanting more control over their energy supply, he explained. Liebreich also said there has been an erosion of the distribution monopoly, because of solar on the roof. In addition, entrepreneurs should not be left behind, and countries should look at eliminating tariffs from imports of components, as well as skills transfer in the clean energy sector to create jobs. It s important to facilitate new ideas, as access to electricity translates into education, healthcare and a better life. There are really no excuses, the technology is there, the investment is there, we just need the will, Rogers ended. African Utility Week takes places at the CTICC in Cape Town from 17-19 May, 2016. \</doc>

The BRICS Ministers of Foreign Affairs held their regular meeting on September 29, 2015, in New York on the margins of this annual session of the United Nations General Assembly which marks the 70th Anniversary of the founding of the United Nations and the end of the Second World War. The Ministers paid tribute to all those who fought against fascism and militarism and for freedom of nations. The Ministers reiterated their intention to contribute to safeguarding a fair and equitable international order based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter as stated in the Ufa Summit declaration. They recalled 2005 World Summit Outcome Document. They reaffirmed the need for a comprehensive reform of the United Nations including its Security Council with a view to making it more representative and efficient. The Ministers discussed the current state of global economy and finances. They recognise the significant contribution of BRICS countries to the global economy and express full confidence in their economic prospects. They also highlighted the importance of decisive and effective actions to accelerate global growth. They reiterated the urgency of unblocking the IMF reform as a measure to reform global economic governance consistent with the interests and needs of the developing countries. The Ministers stressed the importance of closer economic, financial and trade cooperation, particularly through policy coordination, timely implementation of the Strategy for BRICS Economic Partnership, and the full functioning of the New Development Bank and its African Regional Centre. The Ministers expressed their full support for a successful outcome at the COP21 later this year. They called for a comprehensive, balanced and equitable agreement with legal force for the post-2020 period that is in conformity with the principles and provisions of UNFCCC to be attained in an open, transparent and inclusive negotiating process. The Ministers expressed their concern over continued conflicts in several regions which undermine stability and security and provide fertile grounds for terrorist activities and cause migration waves. They noted that terrorist activities of extremist organisations which control large parts of territory of the Republic of Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic pose a direct threat not only to all the countries of the Middle East, but to the whole international community. The Ministers reiterated their strong condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and expressed their conviction that a comprehensive approach was necessary to ensure an effective fight against terrorism. The Ministers urged concerted efforts to counter terrorism on a firm international legal basis, under the UN auspices. The Ministers stressed the need to continue support to the process of political settlement of the conflict in Syria on the basis of the Geneva communique of June 30, 2012. The Ministers welcomed the efforts to resolve conflicts in Africa led by Africa. They believe that the African Stand-by Force and the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises that are being operationalised in the framework of the African Peace and Security Architecture have a significant potential in the maintenance of peace and stability on the African continent. The Ministers reiterated their deep concern about the situation in Ukraine. They emphasized that there is no military solution to the conflict and that the only way to reconciliation is through inclusive political dialogue. The Ministers called on all parties to comply with all provisions of the Minsk Agreements adopted in February 2015. They urged the parties to observe the current ceasefire and make it sustainable. The Parties discussed the possibilities for the mutual support of their initiatives at the 70th session of the UN General Assembly. The Ministers commended Russia for hosting the VII BRICS Summit in Ufa and expressed their satisfaction with the progress achieved in the implementation of the Ufa Action Plan. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of India informed the partners of the preparations for the VIII BRICS Summit. \</doc>

AS THE Cop21 UN climate conference, aimed at brokering a global deal to reduce carbon emissions, starts in Paris today, South Africa's Centre for |Environmental Rights (CER) has noted "encouraging" improvements in accessing information so citizens can exercise |their constitutional right to a healthy |environment. While government departments this year released data in just over half, or 51.9 percent, of the centre's requests under the Promotion of Access to Information Act (Paia), this was significantly up from the 30.4 percent release rate in 2010. Private sector bodies appear better capacitated to ensure Paia compliance: this year, two out of three Paia requests the centre submitted led to the release of information, up from 20 percent in 2010. During the year, the Department of Water and Sanitation emerged at the top, with 71.4 percent of information requests granted - and delivered. The Department of Environmental Affairs maintained its track-record of granting, and releasing, information in half of the requests. The worst remained the Department of Mineral Resources, which refused 62.5 percent of Paia requests during the year, and only delivered records in 12.5 percent of the approved requests. In its "Signs of Hope?" report, the CER said the mineral resources track record was "disappointing" and "unacceptable", considering the high levels of environmental degradation caused by mining. The track record among municipalities varied "considerably": some like Cape Town and Ekurhuleni were well-resourced to handle Paia requests, but others were "completely at a loss". Still, municipalities released information in seven out of the nine Paia requests made since last year. However, court proceedings are still under way over a Paia request for the atmospheric emission licences and compliance reports of two Durban South refineries, brought against the eThekwini municipality in April by the South Durban Community Environmental Alliance and the Vaal Environmental Justice Alliance. The metropolitan municipality refused to disclose the information, citing commercial and trade secrets, which if disclosed would cause commercial harm and prejudice. The CER said it was a concern that government departments considered a wide range of information confidential or commercially sensitive, often without asking whether the release of information actually would harm the third party. "In many instances, government departments simply accept the claim by third parties that information is commercially confidential without conducting an independent review of whether this claim is accurate," the CER said. "Moreover, we see departments take the view that they are obliged to refuse the (Paia) request if the third party objects to the release of records. This is an incorrect interpretation and application of Paia, which requires the holder of the record to make an independent assessment." Another concern was departmental record-keeping: a number of Paia requests had been refused on grounds the documents did not exist or could not be found. However, in one such case where a government department, not named in the report, claimed documents did not exist, the centre obtained the record from another sources. "This evidences both poor record-keeping and even dereliction of duty, and raises the extremely concerning possibility that information officers are affirming that information does not exist either dishonestly, or without conducting the proper checks." Since 2010, the Centre for Environmental Rights has made 290 Paia requests: 237 to government departments and municipalities, 14 to parastatals and 39 to private bodies. In 2012, only 24.4 percent of government departments, 16.7 percent of parastatals and 26.7 percent of private bodies released information requested under Paia. Last year, government departmental compliance increased to 55.3 percent, parastatals dropped to 25 percent and private bodies released information in 80 percent of Paia requests. This year, the percentages were: government departments (51.9 percent) and private bodies 66.7 percent. \</doc>

Africa's subtropical regions are warming at 1.5 times the global average. For South Africa, sitting on the Tropic of Capricorn, this has meant temperature increases in the last few decades of nearly a degree Celcius. "Annual temperatures have been rising at an alarming rate across the continent over the five decades from 1961 to 2010." The warning is contained in new research, released by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in Pretoria this week. This equated to a 3.2\'c2\'b0C average increase per century - without factoring in the continually increasing rate of carbon emissions globally. The research - "Projections of rapidly rising surface temperatures over Africa under low mitigation" - was published through a collaboration with the Council and other groups such as the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in California. It looked at what happens to climate over the continent if little is done to lower carbon emissions globally. World governments are meeting at the COP21 climate change conference in Paris in November in an attempt to come to an agreement that would ensure countries lower their emissions. The core target of the negotiations is to create an agreement that keeps average global temperature increases below 2\'c2\'b0C. The UN's climate change research body has said this would allow the ecosystems that humans rely on to still function. Any greater increase will create "severe, pervasive and irreversible" change. African countries have consistently argued that the maximum allowable increase should be pegged at 1.5\'c2\'b0C because anything more would have such serious consequences for the continent. Dramatic increases The CSIR research released this week backs this point: "Dramatic increases in the number of heat-wave days and high fire-danger days, and reduced soil-moisture availability, are consistently projected." The continent's weakness not only came from the greater temperature increases experienced in the continent, but also from its low ability to adapt to a changing climate. The research noted that subsistence farmers and communities were already struggling to adapt as rainfall patterns and water availability changed. This weakness would be further exacerbated by periodic climate phenomenon, such as this year's El Ni\'c3\'b1o. The researchers said that this year's El Ni\'c3\'b1o - which warms the Eastern Pacific and leads to floods and drought worldwide - had already increased sea temperatures in that part of the world by 2\'c2\'b0C. This would only increase, and would probably break records for ocean temperatures in that part of the world. As a result, the team predicted that this year's summer would be the hottest South Africa had ever experienced. In other research this month, the CSIR said El Ni\'c3\'b1o would decrease rainfall by up to 150mm on average. This would further exacerbate the drought in five provinces, and add to crop shortages - a third of the maize crop was lost in the last summer growing season. South Africa's proposal to mitigate climate change The warnings come as South Africa's environment department and environment portfolio committee consult with members of the public on the country's plan to lower carbon emissions and adapt to a changing climate. The proposed plan has been widely criticised for being too vague and allowing South Africa enough room to both increase and decrease its carbon emissions. The only commitment to date by government was at the 2009 climate conference in Copenhagen, where the country said it would lower its carbon emissions by 42% by 2025. \</doc>

In line with their commitment to lower carbon emissions, the City of Cape Town will procure electric buses for the MyCiTi service... No longer a choice but a prerequisite As we extend the footprint of the MyCiTi service across the city, we also have a responsibility to lower our carbon emissions and the impact of pollution on the urban environment. Cities across the world will soon reach a point where alternative fuel for public transport is no longer a choice but a prerequisite, and as such the City of Cape Town has decided to expand our current fleet of diesel buses with electric ones. A tender for the procurement of a fleet of 12-metre electric buses is due to be advertised by the first week of February 2016. The City is also considering electric double-decker buses for longer distance trips as they have more seating. The tender specifies that the electric buses should be able to travel at least 250 km in traffic before the batteries need recharging. Apart from the buses, the successful bidder must also provide the City with the charging stations for the buses and the necessary training for the bus drivers and mechanical engineers. A first Researchers have made great advances in the development of electric buses over the past decade, some of which were presented at the African Union of Public Transport Workshop that was hosted by Transport for Cape Town in October last year. If all goes according to plan, Transport for Cape Town will be the first municipality in the country to benefit from the latest alternative fuel technology and we will be the first city in Africa to use electric buses for public transport. This is another step towards affirming our commitment to the Compact of Mayors and strengthening our pledge to reduce local greenhouse gas emissions and enhance resilience to climate change. The advantages of a green fleet The operational cost of electric buses is significantly lower - not only in terms of fuel, but also in relation to maintenance as there are fewer parts to service. Electric buses are easier to drive, the motors generate less heat than traditional diesel engines, there is much less noise, and it is a smoother drive for passengers and bus drivers alike. Progressive action This initiative directly supports the City's commitment to the Paris Pledge for Action at COP21 and as member of the C40 Cities to take progressive action and lead the way in reducing energy consumption and emissions. The City's Energy 2040 Strategy sets carbon targets and projects like this will help to ensure that we reach them. Transport for Cape Town has researched and is exploring the most appropriate mechanism for the procurement of solar technology to offset the energy required for the electric bus fleet, thereby further reducing emissions. This is in addition to the carbon credits that the City will earn for operating a green fleet. As we reduce our carbon footprint, Transport for Cape Town will earn carbon credits which the City will be able to sell to developed countries who are signatories to the Kyoto Protocol. This will generate much-needed revenue for the City and result in public transport benefits for residents, making this investment even more worth our while.

Can powerful words, can rhetoric, really make a difference to difficult political problems, where opposing positions have become entrenched? I think history tells us that the answer is, sometimes; and so I will be listening to every word of the two major speeches which Pope Francis will be making in the US. The pope is going to address a joint session of the US Congress in Washington today - the first pontiff ever to do so - and the General Assembly of the UN in New York tomorrow. Both these orations are likely to contain material that may upset some of his American hosts, not least those on the Republican right. We already know what the principal concerns of this Argentinian Jesuit with a social conscience, formerly Father Jorge Bergoglio, are: the way capitalism is leaving the poor behind, and the way the global environment is being trashed. This was made clear in the remarkable papal encyclical published in June, Laudato Si, in which His Holiness's ferocious critique of consumerist values, in particular, raised eyebrows; it almost amounted to an attack on capitalism itself. Yet even more remarkable - if that were possible - was his radical reordering in Laudato Si of the Catholic Church's long-standing position on the environment. For centuries, Christianity - as opposed to Buddhism, say - had seen the natural world merely as resources to be exploited, backed by scriptural authority, including the famous Biblical verse of Genesis 1:28: "Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over ... every thing that moveth upon the earth." Crisis The "ethic of dominion" that resulted, brutal and insensitive towards the earth and its life, made the church incapable of speaking with authority when the environmental crisis first arose. But in his encyclical, Pope Francis explicitly rejected it, and stated baldly that Genesis 1:28 no longer represented the church's position. It was an astonishing about-face. In future, the church was to champion the stewardship of the increasingly vulnerable, increasingly polluted planet which is our only home - or, as he would see it, God's creation. The question arises because, in one or both of his speeches, the pontiff will certainly address the principal environmental problem facing the world: Can the international community reach an agreement on halting global warming at the forthcoming UN climate change conference in Paris in December? This is because, although the overarching aim is fairly simple - to achieve cuts in global CO2 emissions which will halt the forthcoming rise in world temperatures to no more than 2\'c2\'b0C above the pre-industrial level, which is regarded as the danger threshold - the actual written agreement (which will probably be called the "Paris protocol") contains dozens of detailed clauses, on subjects from forestry to finance, all of which have to be agreed upon by 194 different nations, and all of those have different agendas and are grandstanding to different audiences back home. It is enormously, mind-bogglingly difficult. But it isn't impossible. What is needed is some sort of immense impetus to all the countries of the world, so that governments may relax intransigent positions and tell their negotiators to reach agreement in Paris at all costs - otherwise the chance of a deal at COP21 will vanish. Could Pope Francis, in his self-appointed new role as global environment champion, provide such an impetus in what he says in Washington and in New York? Let's fervently hope so, for it's hard to see where else it may come from. - The Independent \</doc>

Paris: It sometimes seems that the countries of the United Nations can unite on nothing, but nearly 200 countries have come together and agreed a deal. Today the human race has joined in a common cause, but it's what happens after this conference that really matters. The Paris Agreement is only one step on long a road, and there are parts of it that frustrate and disappoint me, but it is progress. This deal alone won't dig us out the hole we're in, but it makes the sides less steep. The deal sets out the objective of limiting temperature rises to 1.50 Celsius, but the emissions targets on the table take us closer to 30 Celsius. That's a critical problem, but it's one with a solution. Renewable energy is already doing heavy-lifting across the globe, but now its moment must come. It's the only technology mentioned in the Paris Agreement. There's a yawning gap in this deal, but it can be bridged by clean technology. We're in a race between the roll-out of renewables and rising temperatures, and the Paris Agreement could give renewables a vital boost. The wheel of climate action turns slowly, but in Paris it has turned. This is not a moment for triumphalism given the lives that have been lost already as a result of climate impacts, and the lives that are on the precipice as temperatures rise. This is a time for urgent action. The climate clock is ticking and the window of opportunity is closing fast. Now governments need to revise their short-term targets to be in line with their new goals, and revise their energy policies to speed up renewable energy uptake. They must stop funding fossil fuels and end deforestation by 2020. The Paris Agreement is a Treaty under international law, so it is legally binding. But the national targets (the so-called INDCs) aren't legally binding and nor are the financial commitments. This is primarily to enable the US to be part of this global agreement. The so called "Long Term Goal" is written in seemingly incomprehensible language ("to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century"), but combined with the 1.50C limit , it implies a goal of achieving net zero in all emissions by around 2060-2080. This effectively means we need to phase out fossil fuels by 2050. Indigenous Peoples rights are in the pre-amble and in the Adaptation section of the Agreement. But they're not given the protection they deserve, particularly given that forest protection will be key to achieving 1.50 degrees. The Paris Agreement acknowledges that countries should respect and promote human rights in addressing climate change. The conference saw good initiatives around renewables during the negotiations - though outside the official talks. India's Solar Initiative, the launch of the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative, mayors and leaders of more than 1 000 cities giving their support to a 100 percent renewable energy future, to name a few. In the text itself, renewables are recognised in the context of promoting universal access to sustainable energy in developing countries, in particular in Africa, through the enhanced deployment of renewable energy.

RESIDENTS of Greyton are turning rubbish into bricks, and a local high school is planning on cutting its electricity bill from R45 000 to nothing as they move to using solar power. Over the coming weeks, about 100 Greyton homes will be sporting mini-wind turbines with blades made from plastic bottles. They will be attached to broom handles and can be mounted anywhere on the house. The turbines have USB ports so residents will be able to charge their cellphones and LED lights, and possibly even laptops. It is one of the initiatives of Greyton Transition Town, a non-profit organisation which has teamed up with a company called Miniwind to test in the community. Greyton is the only transition town in Africa, but part of a global movement of about 3 000. Its aim is to create a sustainable, equitable, integrated community that is self-sufficient and focuses on reducing the cost of living and looking |at ways of reducing energy costs. Nicola Vernon, chairperson of Greyton Transition Town, lives in a farmhouse in Greyton built out of straw bales and clay. It is completely off the grid. She said that initially, when she chose to build with clay and straw, there was a perception in the community that it was a step backwards. But she said when people realised it was material that was widely available, and that it provided good insulation, they wanted to follow suit. Many people are now extending their RDP houses using eco-bricks made from plastic bottles and stuffed with anything from chip packets and cling-wrap to sweet wrappers and the plastic around cigarette boxes. These turn waste into a highly insulating building material, which tackles waste at the same time. Hendrik Davids, one of a team of eight who built Vernon's farmhouse, immediately saw the benefits. He has been extending his home in Heuwelkroon using eco-bricks he makes himself. There are three houses on the farm, all run on solar, and it is used as a base for educational programmes run with local schoolchildren. Vernon also runs the Greyton farm animal sanctuary, so there is an array of rescued pigs, geese and sheep mingling with cats and dogs at the farm. Marshall Rinquest, the director of Greyton Transition Town, heads up environmental education and works with children from the surrounding schools. Part of the Greyton dumpsite has been turned into a green park for the community and has an outdoor classroom built from eco-bricks. The initiative has planted trees and makes compost which is sold back to the community. The long-term plan is to have more of the town using solar power. The initiative is working with the municipality and the Industrial Development Corporation to come up with a plan to get the Emil Weder High School in Genadendal, which currently pays R45 000 a month in power bills, on to solar power. This would not only reduce their bill, but provide an opportunity to sell surplus power. Greyton Transition Town has transformed an old school hostel into a 60-bed eco-lodge which is run as a business to support its work. It has a grey-water reticulation system which is linked to a permaculture garden. The initiative has been invited to make a presentation at Cop21 , the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris. \</doc>

In April of 1815, 200 years ago, the Tambora eruption in Indonesia lowered global temperatures by 0.4 to 0.7\'c2\'baC. The northern hemisphere had no summer in 1816, and the end of the world was expected. There were famines in Ireland, Wales and Switzerland. Ice remained on the rivers of the American East Coast in August. It was the last subsistence crisis in the West before the agricultural revolution and the cost of grain rose by over 700 percent. In excess of 250 000 people are thought to have died. At the Villa Diodati on Lake Geneva, Mary Wollstonecraft, her lover Percy Shelly, Lord Byron and Dr Polidori endured the daily "darkness at noon" by telling outlandish stories. Byron's contribution, later developed by Dr Polidori, concerned the bloody nocturnal eating habits of vampire bats. Mary Shelly, raised at the centre of the new scientific elite, described the tragedy of a scientist who, creating a monstrous life form, eventually died trying to kill his misunderstood creation. The scientist's name was Victor Frankenstein. COP 21 , the global climate change conference in Paris, is essentially an admission that "science" and its industrialisation have indeed created a monster. It remains to be seen if the world's affluent will get to keep the luxurious lifestyles of their Faustian pact, or be pulled from their villas by the ravenous mob. Our current fears and insecurities are not unlike those experienced by the Diodatan four. But the world didn't end on July 18, 1816. Instead, there gradually emerged a golden era of scientific and industrial advancement. Perhaps the likes of Elon Musk are not sorcerers' apprentices, but reincarnations of George Stephenson. Perhaps humanity will improve sufficiently at managing its monsters so as to eventually build a New Jerusalem. But it will be a brutal process. There will be a Malthusian adjustment. Illusions will be shattered and, as Goethe argued, only bloody minded persistence and ceaseless striving hold the possibility of seeing humanity through. James Cunningham Camps Bay \</doc>

The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has welcomed the announcement that China and Africa are to join hands in the fight against the illegal trade of fauna and flora products... This announcement are contained in the final Declaration and Action Plan flowing from the 6th Forum for China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) that concluded in Johannesburg recently. During the summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping told African leaders that China would put $60bn into development projects and cancel debts under a three-year plan. There is concern, however, that some of the most pressing environmental issues facing the African continent have not been integrated into the plan which also outlines a major push for infrastructural development, from more intensive agriculture through to rapid industrialisation on the continent. "We salute President Xi's insight that China-Africa cooperation is by no means at the expense of the African ecological environment and long-term interests. We would like to see full implementation of President Xi's commitment into China-Africa cooperation, especially in sectors such as industry, sustainable finance, renewable energy and infrastructure," Dr Li Lin, WWF's China for a Global Shift Initiative leader, said. Financial institutions "We would also like to see financial institutions playing a critical role in leveraging resource and energy efficient investments and ensuring energy access. And we would like to see China-African cooperation exploring a new development path where we can all realise our development goals whilst living within the ecological limits of our planet." Said Fredrick Kumah, WWF regional director for Africa: "The fact that there is a sub-section devoted to environmental concerns in the Action Plan is a welcome indication that environmental awareness is beginning to find its way onto the China-Africa agenda. However, there are some vital issues at play. Given the unparalleled infrastructural growth slated for the continent through the FOCAC engagement, we had hoped to see a more integrated approach to sustainable development and a greater commitment to the sustainable development goals, rather than a footnote. "Africa, with its unique biodiversity, is at a crossroads. We can choose a path that takes us further down the road of environmental degradation or we can invoke the sustainable land-use planning and financial safeguards that will not only protect this continent's treasures but also benefit its people in the long term. Food, energy and water are the three key driver pressures for Africa. The sustainable development and use of these big three will be critical to people and nature. Chinese investments must ensure sustainability in this regard," Kumah said. Protection of biodiversity In the Action Plan, the two sides have agreed that China will help to build capacity to protect the continent's abundant biodiversity, including the fight the illegal wildlife trade, in particular with regard to ivory and rhino horn. The plan commits China and Africa to better manage border facilities; search, seize and destroy poached resources together; as well as to share in intelligence gathering to undermine the responsible syndicates, acknowledging their linkages to international organised crime. There are promises to set up a China-Africa Environmental Cooperation Centre and both sides have agreed to work together to improve management of water resources and to rehabilitate disused mines. Importantly, in relation to promises made at the climate conference COP21 in Paris, the plan also incorporates undertakings to deepen cooperation on climate change and the transfer of knowledge around new, game-changing technologies to help to alleviate sub-Saharan Africa's energy poverty. \</doc>

Chinese president Xi Jinping addressed the opening day of the Paris climate talks as leader of a nation more confident and assertive than it has been at any point since Mao declared it had "stood up" after a century of rebellion and invasion... The changing status is reflected in the hopes for COP21 . If China was the villain of Copenhagen six years ago, Xi is attempting to portray the country in a different light these days. In Paris he says he wants greater compromise with the West with pledges to cut China's greenhouse gas emissions, apparently recognising criticism over the country's green record. However, China will not face such criticism alone. After decades of Maoist isolation, robust diplomacy means a significant number of developing nations are likely to support any motions that China proposes. China has close ties with a number of African nations, for instance. After he leaves Paris, Xi will head to South Africa, for a summit with African leaders. At the same time, this "Chinese bloc" is not solely confined to Africa. Russia has sought to build closer ties with China in a bid to wean itself off the European market after being hit with sanctions after conflict in Ukraine. This can be seen in the number of trade deals between China and Russia as well as the growing political and military cooperation between the two states. However, China has also pursued closer relations with a number of former Soviet states in what was traditionally viewed as Russia's sphere of influence. Indeed, these states, most notably Kazakhstan, have viewed China as a possible balance to Russian ambitions in the region, as shown by Sinopec's recent agreement to invest in Kazakh oil and gas. What unites the 'Chinese bloc'? In return for control of these resources, China provides development assistance and technical know how, most notably seen in the boom in infrastructure projects throughout Africa. On the other hand, China provides Russia with an alternative market for its oil and gas as well as a source of trade deals favourable to China. Many of China's allies are also are governed by long-standing regimes such as Mugabe's in Zimbabwe, the ANC in South Africa or Putin's United Russia party without an obvious successor to their veteran leadership. Should these regimes be replaced, China's relations with its allies could rapidly change. A certain hostility to the West is possibly the most controversial linkage between China's allies, which in turn has led hawks to believe that the Chinese faction is anti-Western. After all, this bloc emerged at the same time as talk of the market-friendly "Washington Consensus" in international finance being replaced by a "Beijing Consensus" based on the Chinese economic model, along with the development of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, an Asian counterbalance to the EU, US and NATO. These international alliances put president Xi in a potentially formidable position in the Paris talks, and a degree of Chinese support will be necessary for any proposed motion to succeed. However, at the same time, Xi perhaps has more power to make any changes and accommodate Western motions than his predecessor Hu had at Copenhagen. This is China breaking with the status quo and playing a more integral global role. In Mao's words, China has not just stood up, it stands tall. \</doc>

One home ... we must save it now COP21 , a two-week UN climate change summit. More than 190 nations will attempt to agree to a new international deal to tackle climate change by cutting greenhouse gas emissions.Some 140 world leaders - including Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and David Cameron - are scheduled to deliver speeches on the opening day of the event. In partnership with the UN, photographers Mathias Braschler and Monika Fischer, a team based in New York and Zurich, spent months working on a climate-change awareness project. They took portraits of eminent climate activists who each made a personal statement. Here are a few of their views "CLIMATE change is critical to me because I'm a parent; I feel a sense of responsibility to the future. I'm not going to be around to see its worst effects, which are going to be hitting in the 2030s, '40s and '50s, but my kids will. Everybody is always talking about droughts and sea-level rise, but when human civilisation - with more crowding and greater resource depletion - is under that much stress, it translates into wars and huge displaced populations. The Syrian refugee crisis is just a first taste of what it's going to be like. I don't want my kids growing up in that kind of world."- James Cameron, film director "FIGHTING climate change isn't just an obligation that we owe to the future generations of the world.It's also an opportunity to improve public health - and drive economic growth - in the here and now. After all, the same steps that reduce carbon pollution also clean the air we breathe, saving lives and reducing disease. Cities with clean air also gain an economic advantage, because where people want to live and work, businesses want to invest. By speeding the transition to cleaner energy, we can improve the lives of billions of people, while also reducing the risks we face from a changing climate."- Michael Bloomberg,UN secretary-general's special envoy for cities and climate change, three-term mayor of New York City "CLIMATE change is real. To alter this reality, we need all hands on deck. Cleaner, more sustainable energy is possible and can transform our lives, our economies and our planet. We must make living in harmony with the earth a priority. This is our home . . . the only one we have!" - Gisele B\'fcndchen, model, UNEP goodwill ambassador "I THINK the leaders of this world will have to realise that playing politics and making money will mean nothing if they don't take decisions and invest in drastic change on how we use energy and transform from a fuel-based to sustainable economy. Talk is cheap, action is expensive and we are coming to a dead end. The more time we take, the greater damage we impose on the population of the world." - Angelique Kidjo,musician "TAKING bold climate action now has the potential to unleash the full power of business and lift millions of people out of poverty at the same time. We're the first generation to recognise this and the last generation that will have this opportunity."- Richard Branson,Virgin Group founder "I PRAY that our leaders stop pointing fingers and playing the blame game and seek a real solution for the good of the planet and all who inhabit it. It is the least represented among us who will be the most affected first. We have a moral responsibility to protect them." - Don Cheadle, actor, UNEP goodwill ambassador - Vivienne Westwood,fashion designer "WE need to change the idea of what success means. We need to inform human beings that a consumer-driven society gives us all very false ideas of what success means." - Dia Mirza, Bollywood actress and producer \</doc>

CITY of Joburg mayor Parks Tau has met with Pope Francis at the Vatican to discuss matters such as climate change and modern slavery. Tau attended a two-day meeting this week of mayors from across the world, designed to call local government authorities of global cities to action by joining the religious leaders in their request |to the UN to consider modern slavery and human trafficking a crime against humanity. The call also looks to put moral pressure on the UN to make sure that the new sustainable development goals will be approved by the UN in September and the Paris COP-21 Summit in December. During his presentation at the meeting convened by the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, Tau quoted a report of the UN Habitat, which predicts that by 2050, 75 percent of humanity will be living in cities - indicating that urbanisation was the future as more people moved into cities. He said: "The highest growth rates of population are recorded in cities, especially in the south. Joburg is already urbanising at a rate of about 4 percent - with our population having grown from 3.7 million to 4.4 million in almost 10 years. The African continent - having suffered from years of colonisation - has not seen relative peace and stability in some countries. This has led to forced migration of people from rural |to urban areas, and from unstable countries to those with relative stability." Tau said migration was typically seen as a failure of adaptation, and not a form of it being as a result of the high levels of vulnerability of migrants, recipient countries and cities. Tau told the gathering that South Africa had witnessed social unrest against migrants which portrayed the country in a bad light. "The government's response has been to promote social cohesion through anti-xenophobia campaigns. With the increase in the influx of migrants and concern for human trafficking, the government has furthermore introduced modernised immigration regulations. "At a city level, we are implementing a number of programmes that promote social cohesion in a bid to address potential exploitation of migrants and mitigate the impact of climate change," Tau said. In November, the city will host the seventh edition of Africities to deliberate on the future of African cities. The mayors are invited to these events. \</doc>

New tax prods business into new green era DUANE NEWMAN and JOSLIN LYDALL COP21 was a breakthrough in combating climate change; others worry that the lofty commitments will not now translate into real action. However, we are in no doubt that SA has taken a significant step forward, with the South African delegation firmly agreeing to tougher environmental measures, which now need to be put into action. New measures and stricter and more comprehensive monitoring will be required. Even if some of the detail is not yet clear, what is clear is that this will need focus and attention by our companies. It will be necessary to take a holistic view of carbon and energy issues at a company level. It is important to look at all the policy instruments that will be used to control and assess the carbon footprint of a business. The major challenge will be the new carbon tax, whose complexity should not be underestimated. It fits in a tax regime that already has a number of environmental elements, such as levies on plastic bags and electricity, an electric filament lamp tax, and the vehicle emissions tax. The carbon tax will undoubtedly become the most burdensome environment tax for many firms, particularly manufacturers. Companies will need to understand their carbon tax liability when the new instrument is implemented, and should be even more concerned about its effect in the following five to 10 years, during which it will be scaled up steadily. The global trend for new projects has been to put an internal price on carbon into all business case assessments, and SA must follow. Generally, our experience is that energy and environmental issues are looked after by a sustainability manager, while financial issues are the responsibility of the financial director. In future, the responsibility must shift to the finance department. It should now be apparent that the consequences of not waking up to the green agenda, and of not acting on it, will be that investment decisions may be incorrect, and a company may be selecting the wrong technology, or technology that is too carbon-intensive. You must move your thinking from the dark ages to the new green age. We expect there to be mandatory reporting implemented this year on a company's energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, and ultimately, on its full carbon footprint. In addition, companies that have an energy usage above a certain threshold will need to develop and submit an energy management plan to the Department of Energy. This means any company with a large energy footprint on one or more sites needs to understand its current energy footprint, and the consequences of planned changes in the next five years. This needs significant thought and interaction with the company's strategic planning processes. As part of the carbon budgeting process, companies should have submitted details to the Department of Environmental Affairs on their current carbon footprint - and expected carbon budget over the next five years. The challenge we have encountered to date is that many companies are just starting on this journey, which may mean the accuracy of the data they have collected is suspect. As a lack of precision and accuracy could potentially have a financial consequence, a lot more care has to be taken to ensure all required data are collected, and that this is done with rigour. A lot of work still needs to be done by many companies, and they must not underestimate the task. The Paris agreement has ushered in a new era, and companies that fail to move with the times will soon be paying a very high price. & 8226;Newman is a founding partner, and Lydall a carbon and energy specialist, at Cova Advisory and Associates, which advises firms on green issues and government incentives. \</doc>

The New Year is well underway and with it are ongoing challenges, particularly for those of us based on farms or in rural areas. The winds of change are in the air... There are three major insurance considerations for those of us based in outlying areas, namely protection against the elements, unforeseen negative events and crime. Weather wise The most obvious worry at the moment is drought - the worst the country is said to be facing in the last 111 years. Our water shortages are a scary reality. In the Western Cape, for example, restrictions have been implemented with the aim to save 20% of water. The province is applying to join ranks with the five other provinces already declared as 'drought disaster zones', namely the North West, Limpopo, Free State, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga. Arid conditions can make fires all the more likely, as are unfortunately regularly seen in the Cape, for example. Recent fires have caused terrible damage, making it evident that no matter where you are based in South Africa, you need to address insurance cover against fire loss. Farmers are also facing harvesting losses as natural disasters affect crops. Luckily, these can be insured. Changing weather patterns are a concern globally and COP21 , the climate change conference held in Paris late last year, saw a new sense of urgency among governments to achieve a legally binding and universal climate agreement, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2\'b0C. The agreement is set to be implemented in 2020. With unpredictable weather, keep in mind as well that areas where hail is least expected or where flooding seems impossible are the very places to insure against hail and flooding. Historic risk cover endemic to any given area is not guaranteed to be sufficient these days and you must make sure you are equipped for any possibility. A recent incident saw a farmer's 12 vehicles badly damaged by a freak hail storm. Sadly he was not insured against hailstorms, so his claims were repudiated. It is also important to insure farming equipment such as harvesters and tractors against the same risks. Structurally speaking Comprehensive cover extends beyond weather-related events; unexpected accidents can happen. We all remember when 14 canola silos collapsed in Swellendam late last year. In this instance, 11,500 tonnes of canola seed were spilled and, just like the domino effect of the incident itself, the costs to find alternative storage (among other factors) continue to contribute to unexpected losses. Insurance really is the secret weapon against life happening while you are making other plans. While investigations are ongoing to determine what caused this silo accident, the reality is that structural damage needs to be factored in to your insurance policies. Medium-to-large produce producing farmers need to be covered against such losses, which can be very high if large equipment is damaged. Remember as well that buildings and equipment must be insured at the appropriate replacement value. Staying safe In addition to making sure structures are adequately insured, security risks should also be a consideration. No matter where you are in the country, be it more secluded in a rural area or living in suburbia or in the city, sufficient security is of course advised, even though at your discretion. Your chosen security fittings, however, are very important in an insurance policy. If, for example, an alarm or security gate are specified to exist on the property, they must have been in use at the time of an incident for a crime claim to be settled. It is important to remember that the reality must match your insurance policy. It's a good time of year generally to review your current cover all round. Making sure you are prepared for the unexpected will bring you peace of mind for the year ahead. \</doc>

PwC's New Energy Futures report states that oil and gas firms need to expand their focus beyond short-term issues - such as tumbling oil prices and over-supply - if they are to successfully navigate the growing range of disruptive forces that will shape the industry. In the wake of December s climate change agreement in Paris, the momentum to replace fossil fuels with cleaner energy sources is gathering pace, and other factors, from low oil prices to geopolitical events, continue to shake the industry. But despite these pressures, the report is clear about the vital - albeit changing - role the industry has to play in the energy transition and the opportunities for those that are able to adapt to the changing times. "While, for understandable reasons, the current depressed oil price dominates the headlines, it s also important to look beyond that to consider what forces are shaping the future of the industry. US shale supply has contributed substantially to the current position - what other disruptors does the sector face?" Chris Bredenhann, PwC Africa Advisory Oil & Gas Industry leader, says. Global demand for affordable, reliable energy will continue to grow for the foreseeable future, but there is a new longer-term backdrop, as the world transitions to a low carbon system. Momentum to replace fossil fuels with cleaner energy sources is building, and oil and gas companies need to consider their futures in this context. Proposed framework The report proposes a framework that could help companies successfully navigate an increasingly complex and volatile global market over the next five to fifteen years. The framework evaluates four potential futures, where the level of disruption and the pace of change fluctuate: 1. The oil and gas sector evolves along current lines with limited government intervention. Ongoing price volatility across pricing and demand presents funding challenges, encouraging greater collaboration between operators and service providers to drive efficiency and reduce cost. Gas increasingly becomes an essential transition fuel. 2. Demand from energy consumers (retail & commercial) for cleaner energy drives the transition towards a low carbon world resulting in significant private investment in low carbon technologies. The link between economic growth and energy intensity breaks. 3. As governments follow through on COP21 with regulation, incentives and direct investment, it drives increased energy efficiency, expansion of renewable energy demand and accelerated development of disruptive technologies. This puts further pressure on fossil fuel providers who need to find new ways of working. 4. Supply constraints are triggered through direct government action, such as implementing carbon legislation or withholding licences (e.g. shale, arctic), or geopolitical disruption, which can also contribute to increased volatility on a periodic and regional basis. Impact of perspectives The report explores the impact of these four future perspectives on the oil and gas value chain. It states that while various elements may play out in distinct ways across different regions, it will be increasingly vital that companies are able to demonstrate: - A clear strategy and alignment with portfolio, decision-making processes and capabilities; - An ability to be agile and resilient in uncertain times; - An innovative response to disruptive change using existing assets as well as technology, knowledge and capabilities; - A readiness to form alliances and collaborate across the supply chain, with a growing focus on efficiency gains and reduced emissions rather than cost and risk sharing; and - Safeguarding the social licence to operate by sustaining the trust and support of investors and wider stakeholders through increased transparency. Future economic development depends on solving Africa s energy challenges. The role that oil and gas will play in these solutions will be informed by a wide range of drivers, as well as clarity and the relative priority of governments in the competition between oil and gas and renewable energy solutions, adds Bredenhann. For all the uncertainty that may cloud the industry s future, one thing is certain - the oil and gas industry has continually demonstrated resilience and innovation to adapt to a dramatically changing world. \</doc>

I see how unstable our future might be in my lifetime CLIMATE science has been knocking around since the 1850s. Scientists knew back then that there was a connection between man-made emissions and temperature peaks. In the past two decades, though, the science has become part of our DNA. Climate change has altered our vocabulary, slipped into popular culture and muscled in on almost every agenda. For global leaders the big push has come in the form of the UN Conference of the Parties processes but they are already 21 years old and still the talking continues. COP's timeline shows many turning points and milestones, but also missteps, failings, and the sounding of alarm bells signalling that time is running out for humanity to decide how the climate change story will pan out. Coleen Vogel, of Wits University's Global Change and Sustainability Research Institute, has worked in climate change for four decades and served on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. She has lived through the high hopes of what came even before the COP processes: the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992. Rio set in motion the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change that gave rise to COP and the much-vaunted Kyoto Protocol. Kyoto was put on the table for signing during the third round of COP in 1997. Vogel has seen talk-shops turn to stutters and the promise of Kyoto fail because the biggest polluter at that time, the US, failed to ratify the protocol. "The big disappointment over the past 21 years has been COP Copenhagen in 2009, when we failed to get firm commitments to emission reductions," said Vogel. "We also went through a time of climate-change scepticism that did a lot of damage to the science." But she believes that not all is lost. Even as the image of a solitary polar bear on a melting ice floe with nowhere to swim to has become a stark image of modern climate-change disaster, she believes that the right action now can arrest the slide to doom. She points to city-led initiatives for urban greening, improved public transport, and the placement of biodiversity and sustainability at the heart of city planning. Education also sparks solution-driven thinking, she says. "Even though parts were over-hyped, it raised awareness like nothing before it. Science writer and award-winning author Leonie Joubert said: "I've been writing about this subject for over a decade. I'd always thought the worst fallout of climate change would happen only after I were dead and gone. But this drought brought home to me what happens when natural climate events, such as El Ni\'f1o, start to become amplified by rising temperatures associated with carbon pollution. "Combine that with political failure, like the mismanagement of our water reserves, and I see how unstable our future might become within my lifetime." COP will be a success if there are "hard and fast emission cuts and real penalties for transgressors". Joubert's work connects the dots between climate change and world events. "There's a direct link between severe drought, political instability and the massive humanitarian crisis associated with the unfolding drama in Syria. That is what climate instability means for regions and real people." Real people should be at the heart of the top-level talks of COP21 , said South African environmentalist and activist Bobby Peek. "Countries such as China, India and South Africa are hiding behind their poor and claiming they need more Medupis and Kusiles [coal-fired power stations] but they are actually not getting energy to the poor. The North has outsourced its carbon emissions to us and our spineless politicians have accepted this at the expense of the poor. The poor have become poorer and there is an increase in global poverty and inequality." \</doc>

Bill Gates's mission is simple: find an "energy miracle" to help save Africa from the dangers of climate change. But is he the right person for the job?The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has released its annual letter, penned by the world's two most famous philanthropists. In his portion of the letter, Gates writes to high school pupils, appealing for them to save Africa from an energy Armageddon. The goal is to inspire an invention to bring down carbon emissions and light up unelectrified parts of the continent safely.Speaking to the Mail & Guardian on the phone from the United States, Gates said that while rich countries such as Europe, the US, Japan and China go full throttle with their power systems, poor people in African countries are most affected."In terms of where people will be hurt by climate change, it's only fair that we talk about Africa, because that happens to be an unusual problem. The rich world needs to change their energy systems and if they don't do it fairly dramatically, then the people who will be hurt the most are actually the poor farmers - a lot of them live in Africa; some of them live in Asia," Gates said.'What would your superpower be?' When asked about how African nations can help beat electricity depression and find energy alternatives for themselves instead of depending on foreign aid, Gates responded that the continent has many challenges to overcome."Most energy systems are the result of scientific work that's designed on a global basis and they're not specific to one continent," Gates said. "Africa does have a lot of wind and a lot of sun but to use those, it has to be intermittent, because you have to have really good grid and combine them with other [energy] sources."He added that sub-Saharan Africa is in better shape than the other parts of the continent when it comes to providing electricity. The most surprising statistic he found during the course of his research, he revealed, is that the amount of electricity consumed per person in sub-Saharan Africa, excluding South Africa, has decreased.The letter is addressed to youngsters, Gates said, because he believes they will be at the forefront of scientific innovation to help Africa's poor.The couple wrote this year's letter after a school pupil in Kentucky asked what their superpower would be if they each had one. Melinda Gates wished for more time, and her section of the letter is about the amount of time women spend on unpaid work, particularly in the home, where cooking and washing dishes can swallow the hours in a day.A rallying cry for urgency The young people the couple spoke to in Kentucky live in Appalachia - a region of the US where poverty is high and many families work in coal mines. But Gates chose to focus on issues in Africa. He maintains that younger generations have more capacity to find a solution to climate change challenges within the next 15 years."It doesn't matter where the solutions come from. We just need students everywhere to be inspired that they might be part of this, and we need their voices," Gates said.In the run-up to the Cop21 climate change conference in Paris last year, Gates announced the formation of a "breakthrough energy coalition" that included some of the richest people and nations around the world. South African billionaire Patrice Motsepe is included in the group of individuals, but countries on the African continent have yet to be represented.The Gates Foundation generally focuses on issues of health and food security. Gates admits the energy crisis is a new challenge, but believes that by creating a rallying cry for urgency, it can help find a solution.This continent will be worst affected by climate change, warns the philanthropist, hence the race to find sustainable energy solutions. \</doc>

PARIS: Search where you will in the most exclusive cheese shops in France and you will no longer find a bleu de Termignon, a vacherin d'Abondance or a galette des Monts-d'Or. Last week, Prince Charles, while visiting the COP21 global climate conference in Paris, declared his love for Pont-L'Ev\Â£aque and other French cheese made in the traditional manner with lait cru or raw, unpasteurised milk. He warned that their survival was threatened by the "bacteriological correctness" of European and national food safety regulation. Is he right? Oui et non. But mostly oui. Only about 10 percent of the cheese now consumed in France is "genuine" - in other words, made with untreated milk. Consumption of lait cru cheeses has been falling by 4 percent a year. Even many of the French cheeses labelled, like fine wines, as "origin controlled" are mass-produced with pasteurised or heat-treated milk. They have the old names, but a fraction of the taste and character, say critics. Real cheese producers say the real menace comes from the greed of France's large and powerful dairy companies. "Many thanks to Prince Charles," said V\Â£9ronique Richez-Lerouge, president of the Association Fromages de Terroirs. "But I find it shameful that French politicians and personalities should say nothing while the heir to the British (throne) speaks out so powerfully." Herv\Â£9 Mons, an award-winning producer and worldwide marketer of authentic French cheeses, said: "We are under pressure to apply the same standards to artisanal as to factory-made cheese. There is no justification on health or other grounds. The dairy industry lobbies for standards which would rob cheese of all true character and quality - in other words impose the kind of cheese that they can make cheaply." Richez-Lerouge says the erosion of authentic French cheese is part of a "wider, national hypocrisy". Successive French governments, she says, have extolled the virtues of small-scale farming and quality food while "shovelling 80 percent of European subsidies into the pockets of big farmers and the agro-industry". President Charles de Gaulle complained that it was impossible to govern a country with "265 different kinds of cheese". In fact, depending how you count them, there are (or were) at least 700, and maybe as many as 1 000 types of French cheese. Ten years ago, I visited C\Â£9lina Gagneux, the last manufacturer of vacherin d'Abondance, a rich, creamy cheese so soft it had to be eaten with a spoon. She had just retired, ending a 200-year unbroken tradition of cheese-making in the mountains on the French side of Lake Geneva. She said: "When I was a girl, there were 30 people or more who made vacherin in this valley. Now they've all died or stopped. They make the Abondance cheese, a firmer cheese, because that's what the big buyers want. How can you blame them?" Richez-Lerouge, the real- cheese campaigner, says there is also a more subtle threat to the survival of France's cheese tradition. The industry giants are moving into the "origin controlled" market and imposing rule changes to allow pasteurised cheeses to be sold with the appellation contr\'b4l\Â£9e label. In Normandy, a handful of traditional camembert producers resisted, Asterix like, and fought off the agro-giants. The close cousins of camembert, Livarot and Pont-L'Ev\Â£aque, have succumbed. You can now buy a pasteurised Pont-L'Ev\Â£aque which carries the "authentic" origin-controlled label - a contradiction in terms to the purists. If you want to buy a "real" French cheese, it must state on the label that it was made with lait cru. Mons, the cheese trader from Roanne in central France, says the threat is not the disappearance of great names such as cantal or camembert. "The real danger - and the reality in many cases - is their conversion into something bland and characterless, which betrays our traditions." - The Independent on Sunday \</doc>

Man's insatiable appetite for money under the guise of economic advancement seems to be the cause of the Earth's current weather patterns. China's capital, Beijing, is now under "red alert" status because of the heavy smog. Schools and businesses have been shut down and cars bearing odd/even number plates only drive on alternate days. Chennai and Bangalore have experienced the worst floods in more than a hundred years. Scores of people have lost their homes, lives and possessions. Here at home, we are experiencing the worst drought in well over two decades, brought on by the largest El Ni\'c3\'b1o effect since 1997-1998. In Paris, the Conference of the Parties ( COP 21 ) are in the final week of meetings to seek solutions to man-made global warming problems. Kumi Naidoo, the chief executive of Greenpeace International, is currently back on our shores. I had the good fortune to listen to his recent address on matters concerning the environment. Naidoo was vehemently opposed (justifiably so) to the use of fossil fuels (coal, gas and oil) to meet our energy needs. He was also particularly vocal about nuclear-powered energy stations. Dr Kelvin Kemm's article "Welcome SA's nuclear programme with pride" (Sunday Tribune, November 22) highlights the pros of a nuclear station, but has omitted salient factors such as: Have we forgotten the disaster of Chernobyl? The harmful effects of the radiation (thyroid cancer etc) are still lingering. Is it possible to have contingency plans in place to guard against natural disasters like in the case of the Fukushima Nuclear Plant in Japan. The rising threat of terrorism cannot not be downplayed. Naidoo has warned that 9/11 will seem like a picnic in comparison with a plane crashing into a nuclear station. The waste from a nuclear station is radioactive for thousands of years - it is too risky. South Africa has just been downgraded to one grade before junk status. Our country cannot afford to build a nuclear station. Renewable energy may not be as economical as fossil fuels, but if the planet is plundered to near extinction, the cost will be impossible to quantify. "Will the Earth ever perish?" This was a question posed to the small but enthralled audience during Naidoo's talk. His response? "Humanity may perish because of his folly, but planet Earth will never perish. It will regenerate itself - in time." Let's stop our folly. Gona Govender La Mercy \</doc>

Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa is currently in Paris leading the South African delegation during the High Level Segment of the 21st Conference of Parties ( COP 21 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The conference, which started on Sunday and will run until1 December, is expected to come up with a universal, legally binding agreement that will enable the international community to combat climate change effectively and boost the transition towards resilient, low-carbon societies and economies. The Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has a number of simple messages that say that greenhouse gas emissions (GhG) rose more rapidly from 2000 to 2010 than in the previous three decades, growing by roughly 1.0 Gigatonne per year, the Department of Environmental Affairs said. The United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) Emissions Gap Report states that global emissions in 2030 will most likely be 14 Gigatonnes above the level that would be consistent with a less than 2\'c2\'baC temperature increase. The UNEP Adaptation Gap Report concludes that by 2050, Africa's adaptation costs could rise to US$50 billion per year if global warming were to remain below 2\'c2\'baC, and up to US$100 billion per year for a temperature increase of 4\'c2\'baC, the department said. As part of the Africa Group, South Africa will negotiate for a Paris agreement under the convention that is ambitious, durable, fair and effective. The department said the agreement must balance environmental and development imperatives and ensure that global emission reduction efforts are adequate to keep global temperatures well below 2\'c2\'baC. The deal must have adaptation at its core and there must be an ambitious outcome on finance, technology and capacity building to support the adaptation and mitigation efforts of developing countries. A key position of the Africa Group is that adaptation is a global responsibility, the department said. South Africa has been instrumental in the negotiations leading to the establishment of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, particularly in developing countries. South Africa will continue to do that because we understand and acknowledge that there are limits to adaptation, hence our support for loss and damage to be addressed in the Paris agreement. Addressing this issue must be done in a manner that gives assurance that the Warsaw International Mechanism will continue and be strengthened beyond 2017, the department said. \</doc>

November marked a major milestone for a simple heat-retention bag that, to date, has achieved remarkable things... How is this possible and what is this revolutionary product? The Wonderbag (brainchild of South African entrepreneur Sarah Collins) was based on the oldest technology in the world - heat-retention cooking. Fuelled by the desire to empower women in vulnerable positions and ensure long-term economic freedom, Collins was struck by the idea to create a non-electric bag that retained heat for up to 12 hours. Once taken off the fire this bag continues to cook food without the need for any additional energy. During initial product development Collins soon realised the additional power and benefits of this simple but revolutionary Wonderbag to affect change solving real problems for consumers across the global spectrum. "The facts are alarming. More than 3 billion people in the world still cook on open fires, which results in 4 million deaths annually and 50% of these deaths are children under the age of five due to indoor air pollution. Deforestation is at an all-time high and in certain African countries the problem is so bad that they are experiencing a fuel crisis resulting in villages not having access to wood or charcoal to cook basic day to day meals for their families. Rape statistics in Africa are alarming, with South Africa reporting 3600 rapes per day, whilst in Nigeria 32% of women have been raped in their lifetime. Even worse is that 82% of reported rapes occur when women are collecting firewood for cooking - this has to be stopped! "For consumers in developed markets, the onus on saving time and money while feeding healthy and nutritious meals to their families - and healing our planet, are all of major concern. The ability of the Wonderbag to address all these problems with a very simple solution is what has led us to reach this very humbling milestone of 1 million bags having been sold across the globe," stated Collins. Celebrity endorsements The benefits that the Wonderbag offers consumers has been publicly supported and endorsed by celebrities, major global entities and world leaders which includes the likes of Jada Pinkett-Smith, Alicia Silverstone, Bill Gates, Chelsea Clinton, Unilever CEO Paul Polmon, Ban Ki-Moon, Dutch Prime Minster Mark Rutte, Nathan Myhrvold and Godfather of Modernist Cuisine - Mohammad Yunus - amongst many others. According to Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever, the Wonderbag is the epitome of small actions that make big differences to many lives that also works to improve them. "The Wonderbag offers a practical and effective solution to tackling climate change, improving health and enhancing nutrition. What better way to help achieve the SDGs. With COP21 we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to tackle climate change and drive development. Sarah Collins and her Wonderbag have once more shown that simple solutions are already here to rise to this challenge. Congratulations to Sarah Collins and the Wonderbag team for achieving the 1 million milestone," Polman said. When reflecting back on the more recent initiatives that have helped influence the selling of the millionth Wonderbag, Collins stated that their Wonderpreneur programme and launching of the bags into the countries of Ghana and Nigeria have been instrumental in pushing them over the threshold. "We've trained a multitude of women to become Wonderpreneurs and sell bags in their communities - looking to promote economic inclusion of these 'last mile entrepreneurs'," Collins added. The programme's success led to Collins being identified by tech giant Dell as their 'face of African entrepreneurs' for their recent #EntrepreneursUNite campaign where a global petition was signed to support Goal 8 of the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Goal 8 aims to empower entrepreneurs around the world, helping them foster innovation, job creation and sustainable economic growth. According to Collins, Wonderbag will be celebrating its one million milestone with a Wonderfeast in Soweto - where its first Wonderbag was sold. "The Wonderfeast will entail true Africa music from a star-studded line-up including PJ Powers, with soulful laughter and tasty traditional African fare cooked in Wonderbags for the 5,000 attending guests. Across the world our Buy And Give initiative, which supports the Wonderbag Foundation, means that for every Wonderbag bought by a customer - a contribution is given to the foundation to subsidise the purchase of more Wonderbags to be given to families in Africa who would normally not be able to afford one. We're encouraging everyone to join this revolution by buying a Wonderbag today," concluded Collins. \</doc>

THE climate change talks ( COP21 ) wind up just outside Paris tomorrow.

Under Austrian law, unless a rightful owner lays claim to them they belong to the |unnamed boy, according to Sky News. The Danube rises in the Black Forest, in Germany, and flows through Austria. Maybe the elves in the Black Forest did it. What a great Christmas it could turn out for that small boy. HE'S just been appointed to the company's board of directors. |He's sitting in his office when he notices that his fellow directors are being called, one by one, to the chairman's office. What's going |on? He's the only one not to have been called. Then his phone rings. It's his turn. The rest of the board are sitting round a table. He's invited to join them. The chairman looks him in the eye and asks in a stern voice: "Have you ever had sex with Mrs Foyt, my secretary?" "Oh, no, sir, positively not!" "Are you absolutely sure?" "Honestly, I've never been close enough to even touch her." "You'd swear to that?" Last word Not even computers will replace committees, because committees buy computers. - Edward Shepherd Mead \</doc>

Minister of Environmental Affairs Edna Molewa has underscored the important role of weather forecasting in government planning, as South Africa and the world continues to feel the effects of climate change. The application of vast data resources to the analysis of weather conditions cuts across government departments - ranging from energy, to infrastructure, to transportation, to agriculture, to disaster management and planning. This is particularly pertinent as changing rainfall patterns impact agriculture, food and water security. On 23 March South Africa marks World Meteorological Day under the theme: Creating a weather-smart nation - Innovating, Adapting and Facing the Future together. World Meteorological Day commemorates the entry into force of the convention that created the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1950. South Africa is a member of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and has served on the Executive Council since 1994. The South African Weather Service (SAWS) plays a leading role in matters relating to the WMO. It has positioned itself as a preeminent meteorological institution, playing a prominent role in important international engagements such as the WMO's Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) and in implementing South Africa's National Framework for Climate Services (NFCS) to feed into the global framework. One of the responsibilities of the WMO is to monitor global greenhouse gas (GhG) emissions in support of initiatives to reduce global warming. According to data released by the WMO, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere reached new record levels in 2015. Nations can expect hotter temperatures, more intense drought, and more intense rainfall and flooding episodes - directly threatening lives, livelihoods and property. According to the climate records of SAWS, in 2015, South Africa experienced the driest year on record since 1904. This can be attributed to variability in weather patterns due to climate change and the El Nino phenomenon - which is expected to subside by June 2016. The resultant drought has been associated with an unprecedented frequency of heatwaves. South Africa recorded 48.4 \'b0C in Vredendal in October (the highest recorded temperature in the world for October, according to the WMO) while 31\'b0C maximum temperature records were shattered across South Africa in early January 2016, during yet another strong heatwave. Climate research done by WMO also reveals that each of the past several decades has been significantly warmer than the previous ones. Globally, the period 2011-2015 has been the hottest on record, with the year 2015 the hottest since modern observations began in the late 1800s. Furthermore, January and February 2016 have been recorded as the hottest months to date. South Africa is a signatory to the Paris Agreement concluded at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP21 ) in December 2015. The Paris Agreement is a legally binding agreement that commits all countries to cut carbon emissions. The Department of Environmental Affairs and the South African Weather Service (SAWS) will continue to support the production of climate information and services to support Climate Resilience, Adaptation and Mitigation. The SAWS continues to play a key role in advancing South Africa's transition to a low-carbon, inclusive, resource efficient and climate resilient economy. As Climate Change and Variability is a cross-cutting phenomenon, the SAWS mandate is impacted by both the National Development Programme (NDP) and South Africa's National Climate Change Response Policy. In addition to the national implementation of the GFCS, there are specific weather and climate-related opportunities that support the implementation of the NDP directly. As host of one of only three Global Atmospheric Watch stations, in Cape Point; SAWS, working with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) conducts research and observations on the effects of greenhouse gases (GHG's) and other atmospheric trace gases. SAWS also hosts the South African Air Quality Information System (SAAQIS) and works towards the expansion and enhancement of the National Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Network (NAAQMN). It is our vision to have an empowered nation that can respond adequately to the impacts of climate change by becoming weather-smart. In this context SMART means a Safe, More informed, Alert, Resilient nation. For media queries: Albi Modise Cell: 083 490 2871 Hannelee Doublell Cell: 072 222 6305 \</doc>

AN AMERICAN stock market investor and blogger, Tom DeGrace, once wrote that two of the fundamentals that pulled one of the world's largest economies out of the Great Depression were innovation and prudent government spending. Today the US continues to be the economic leader, a model to follow and an inspiration for many from the lessons it learnt from the 1930s economic meltdown. With the global economic turmoil today, governments and cities around the world are having to find new ways to solve complex challenges. The reality of the economic uncertainty has hit home, with the ratings agencies setting their eyes on our country. Innovation and prudent spending have becoming a necessity, especially for cities, which are home to more than half of the world's population. The UN estimates that, at least, more than 54\'e2\â¬ \Â£fpercent of the world's population lives in urban areas, a proportion that is expected to increase significantly. Fortunately, the City of Joburg's long-term plan and vision would ensure that the metro's financial position is resilient enough to withstand the stormy economic environment. Through its Growth and Development Strategy 2040, the city has ensured it can continue to build from the fundamentals that inspired the Americans to survive their worst economic crisis. The strategy not only provides a vision of the future but, importantly, it defines clear outcomes against which to measure progress. Part of this strategy has been to acknowledge that the future of cities is increasingly becoming unpredictable and uncertain. As a result, there has to be a paradigm shift in the manner in which the cities need to approach developments. Over and above this, the development framework is being put in place in an environment in which, among other things, climate change is driving temperature increases across the globe, technological innovation is driving fast, unexpected and unpredictable changes in society and the economy, and there is an unprecedented increase in migration. Joburg's journey as a leading cutting-edge innovation hub was realised when it listed its Green Bond in 2014, demonstrating the city's commitment to supporting green initiatives that would ensure sustainability for the foreseeable future. This historic innovation was the country's first instrument of this nature in local government. The market welcomed this innovation, to the extent that the 10-year Green Bond was oversubscribed to the tune of 150\'e2\â¬ \Â£fpercent at a competitive funding cost to the city. This signified confidence in the city by the business community. In December, the city won the prestigious C40 Cities Award for its leadership in tackling climate change through its successful Green Bond initiative. The city was one of 10 cities to win this recognition at the third annual C40 Cities Awards held in Paris, France, during the COP21 climate negotiations. The winning cities, which also included Boston, Rotterdam and Nanjing, were each said to have demonstrated exceptional innovation and ambition to build low-carbon and climate-resilient urban communities. In the wake of this global recognition, Joburg's reputation as an attractive destination for investment was boosted by a decision by Fitch Ratings to upgrade and affirm the city's national long-term rating. The ratings reflect Joburg's important status as the largest city in the country, with its economy historically outperforming the national economy; its good management, with a fair degree of sophistication and positively tested access to capital markets; and its strong financial profile with sustainable debt and improved liquidity. The ratings also took into account the pressured operating environment featuring high unemployment and strong demographic growth. Amid the slowdown in the global and national economies, the city continues to achieve respectable net surpluses year after year; indicating that its financial development plan - which includes tighter expenditure management - is bearing fruit. Over the past four years, the city has continued to report net surpluses of more than R3.4\'e2\â¬ \Â£fbillion a year, with an average of R3.9bn a financial year. Joburg stands out as a great example of stability, despite the uncertainty in the local and global markets, rising interest rates and rapid fluctuations in currencies. Our endeavours in constantly trying to find new and innovative ways of doing things, our resilience in uncertain times, our sound financial controls and prudent spending give us the confidence that the city can weather the storm. Geoffrey Makhubo is the member of the mayoral committee for finance in the City of Joburg. \</doc>

THE MUCH-anticipated ANC eThekwini regional elective conference got off to a stormy start at the Moses Mabhida stadium yesterday after a dramatic failed court attempt by a rival ANC faction to interdict it from going ahead. Tensions were palpable as supporters of eThekwini mayor James Nxumalo, who did not attend the conference (as he is in Paris attending COP21 ) approached the Durban High Court to stop the talks, citing a string of irregularities. The election contest would have seen Nxumalo squaring up against councillor Zandile Gumede for the position of regional chair. But events took a nasty turn yesterday when disgruntled party members aligned to Nxumalo lodged an urgent court interdict. The court dismissed the interdict application. In retaliation, the disgruntled members boycotted the conference and convened their own meeting at Bolton Hall in Magwaza Maphalala (Gale) Street, where they decided to march to the conference venue with the aim of disrupting the proceedings. But their move was thwarted by the police, who dispersed them using stun grenades. What was poised to be a closely contested elective conference was reduced to what was described as a "one-horse race" as Nxumalo supporters resorted to vote with their feet. The small marquee erected at the stadium was dominated by Gumede's supporters as a result. Irate Nxumalo supporters have called for the nullification of the provincial conference which took place last month and which saw Sihle Zikalala elected provincial chairman. They claimed that the conference - where Senzo Mchunu was ousted as chairman - was riddled with irregularities. They also alleged that the nomination process in some branches was manipulated to favour Gumede. They also claimed that yesterday's conference should not have gone ahead because of long-standing political issues which have not been resolved. In a frantic effort to intervene, ANC top leaders, including President Jacob Zuma, convened a series of meetings this week to attempt to solve disputes in the province. The conference ran parallel to a meeting chaired by party secretary-general Gwede Mantashe at the Coastlands Hotel. Deputy provincial chairman Willies Mchunu and his deputy Mluleki Ndobe left the conference before it even started to attend to what was apparently a "heated" meeting between disgruntled members and Mantashe. After addressing the delegates, a clearly upbeat Zikalala left the conference to attend to "other matters". ANC councillor Sithejwa Nyawose said they approached the court because they had exhausted all internal processes with no success. He said they would pursue the matter despite being suppressed by senior party leaders. Whoever wins is poised to control the city's budget of close to R40 billion. Gumede is a known ally of Zikalala and her victory would be a major boost for Zuma's ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who will receive another important backer in her bid to be elected ANC president in the party's national elective conference due in 2017. The region is the party's biggest and is influential in the ANC. However, its influence is surely going to weaken with the latest crippling divisions. In effect, the whole region is now divided between factions supporting the Gumede/Zikalala and Nxumalo/ Mchunu camps. Starting almost five hours after the scheduled time, the conference was a dull showing yesterday. Delegates arrived at the stadium visibly in low spirits. There was less singing than is usual at ANC conferences and more talking as delegates expressed their concerns about the deepening factions that have led to some members opting to employ court proceedings to solve the ongoing internal squabbles. The conference was attended by Joe Phaahla (deputy minister of health) and MP Pule Mabe. It had failed to elect new leadership in the past four attempts. In May, the conference sat at the Greyville Racecourse premises but it was adjourned after a group of delegates supporting Gumede disrupted it. Mantashe declined to comment about matters relating to the eThekwini conference, saying it was handled by the provincial leadership. However, he admitted that the party's National Working Committee had convened a series of meetings to hear concerns of members. Zikalala conceded that the party was divided. He said there was a need to unite the party in KZN, adding that no individual was bigger than the party. "Lack of unity will influence the manner in which decisions are made. We need to go back to where we made mistakes and correct them," he said. \</doc>

Heh, heh, heh! Nobody can accuse Number One of failing to keep us on the edge of our seats. Financial analyst Dr James Greener points out in his latest grumpy newsletter that Nhlanhla Nene has twice in his career abruptly disappeared from view. "The first was the occasion when as a mere deputy minister of finance, his studio chair collapsed during a TV interview. The other was last week. "There are many appalling developments that will follow from the president's decision to replace a finance minister who has been trying to tell him the facts. But the saddest and most alarming is that Number One appears to believe that a cabinet reshuffle will conjure up the money that Nene insisted was not available. "The sheer crass stupidity of this is desperately bad news for the country and its few remaining friends. Having a president who |is financially clueless and innumerate is no longer amusing and now he is surrounding himself with acolytes who are equally ignorant and uninformed." My old financial editor colleague Richard Cluver says in his weekly online column that when he |opened his newspaper last Thursday, he thought it must be April Fool's Day. Richard's column is illustrated with all kinds of alarmingly |jagged little graphs, all heading south. "By this action Zuma has all |but guaranteed that our national credit rating will be downgraded to junk status, which implies that foreign pension funds that have invested heavily in our Blue Chip shares and our sovereign bonds |will be forced to sell. This will torpedo our share market and massively impact upon the economy." Heh, heh, heh! Never a dull moment. Number One knows how to put a squib under these smart-ass financial analysts. Climate fund A KEY part of the COP21 climate change agreement in Paris at the weekend is the setting up of a $100 billion (R1.5 trillion) fund to assist developing countries and those already suffering the effects of climate change. Who will administer this massive fund? Step forward, Des van Rooyen, this is your moment - the Nkandla Climate Change Fund. Heh, heh, heh! Danish Girl BRITISH actor Eddie Redmayne stars in The Danish Girl, a film about a man who changed sex - |one of the first ever, in the 1920s. They say it's in line for an |Oscar. On TV the other evening, Redmayne was saying how he'd found the role educational and inspiring. He'd had no idea before about the hostility and rudeness, and sometimes even violence shown to "trans-people". He kept using this term, which perplexed me somewhat. Sure, we were often hostile |and rude to people from the Transvaal - maybe some people even did get violent. The Transvalers kind of deserved it, the way they carried on. But doesn't Redmayne know the place changed its name years ago? But as things went on, the penny dropped. Silly me! I really need to get out more. Taxi OVERHEARD in the Street Shelter for the Over-Forties: "I had a few beers with some pals the other night. I finished off with a margarita. Then I took a taxi |home. There was a police roadblock, but they waved me through because it was a taxi. |I got home safe. "It's remarkable - I've never driven a taxi before and I don't know where I got this one." Tiny otter ONE of the more appealing images on our TV screens in recent days has been without doubt Buddy - | so named by his rescuers - a tiny otter cub who separated from his mom during recent heavy rains and was found crying on somebody's doorstep in Kirkcudbright, Scotland. Buddy is now being bottle-fed and hand-fed a diet of fish by the Scottish SPCA, according to Sky News. Young otters are apparently at risk in the flooding that |afflicts Scotland and the north of England at present. They get easily separated from their mothers and are not strong swimmers. Right now the Scottish SPCA |is caring for 15 baby otters |rescued in much the same way Buddy was. Fifteen? Do we have here a regeneration of Scottish rugby?

Christiana Figueres, UN Executive Secretary on the Framework Convention on Climate Change, said this week that the combined pledges by countries to lower carbon emissions would see the world warm by 3\'c2\'b0C.Speaking to journalists, she said only 62 nations had submitted their plans on how to deal with climate change and lower their emissions. These Intended Nationally Determined Contributions are a requirement of the ongoing international climate negotiations. The next meeting is in Paris in November, where an agreement for every country to lower emissions is expected. Figueres said the 62 nations represented 70% of current global emissions, so a fairly accurate guess of the cumulative effect of all submissions could be made. With the world already 0.8\'c2\'b0C warmer on average than when the Industrial Revolution started, she said that a good "guesstimate" still meant the intended contributions would not do enough.Even if each measure was carried out, she said the world was on target to be 3\'c2\'b0C warmer by the end of this century. The UN's climate change body - the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - has warned that this will create catastrophic and "irreversible" impacts. This change is already being keenly felt in Africa. Its members states have continually argued that temperature increases have to be capped at 1.5\'c2\'b0C if the continent is to survive its changing climate. Changes along the equator are more profound than in other parts of the world, with the interior of South Africa set to get warmer by 6\'c2\'b0C this century. South Africa is in the process of finalising its own intended contribution. The draft of this gives the country a wide margin for lowering emissions, and has come under heavy, and sustained, criticism from civil society. The environment department has been holding public meetings in every province to get feedback, which it says will help create the final submission. These submissions will then be collated ahead of COP 21 in Paris and used as targets for countries in the coming decades. The largest groups to submit their plans have been the European Union - which will cut emissions by 40% by 2030 - China - which will reach its maximum carbon emissions by 2030 and then start decreasing - and the United States - which will lower emissions by a third in the next decade. Figueres said all of this presents a substantial step forward. "What the contributions will do is mark a very substantial departure from business as usual." \</doc>

Buildings are moving from bricks and mortar into what previous generations considered science fiction... Intelligent lighting LED lighting was a game-changer for greener buildings. Today, LED lighting costs have reduced so much it has become mainstream. So the question worth asking is what's next for lighting? The answer is mind-blowing. Lighting in the future won't be just a device that gives light, but a technology that integrates into a system providing sophisticated data. The light itself will only be a by-product. The future of lighting will include devices that sense, record and take action. Lighting will measure the temperature of a room to control air conditioning. It will serve as a smoke detector in emergencies. It will also sense motion and even be able to tell the direction in which a person is walking. This could, for example, help to analyse the flow of shoppers in a mall. It will be able to detect barcodes on products, then pass this product information back to its manufacturer to show where the products are used or consumed. Rooftop solar Rooftop solar has arrived in a big way. As the prices of solar PV are coming down, panel manufacturing efficiencies are increasing. Solar power in the property industry is becoming increasingly relevant. In the '90s, Telkom had the monopoly over telecommunication in South Africa. Then a disruptive technology came along to make telecommunication more mobile and changed the whole industry forever. In the energy sector we have an energy provider that provides electricity in a centralised manner. However, solar is making the electricity industry mobile. Will private energy companies challenge Eskom? I think so. Transparent Solar Glass (BIPV)Glass technology is a science on its own, but couple it with electricity generation from the sun and you have an amazing solution. Glass technology is progressing at a startling rate. Transparent glass that can generate electricity is already with us. In the next few years, we will see demand increasing for building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) technology. This growing demand will drive down the cost of materials that can turn a building's facade into a solar power generator. Solar energy generating glass, and similar innovations, will begin appearing more and more in new building construction. CO2 soaking waterproofingReducing greenhouse gases is on everyone's mind, especially with COP21 recently concluded in Paris. This sets the stage for a rise in products that absorb CO2 greenhouse gases. This technology is already used in waterproofing products, for example.Battery storageBattery storage today is where LED technology was three to four years back. The cost of battery storage is likely to fall so much that it will become more feasible to run your own electricity generation plant at home than tapping into the main supply grid.Waste-to-energy technologyThe cost for vacant land is becoming more and more expensive. So is the cost for dumping waste on landfills. Coupled with the rising cost of electricity, this is resulting in innovations to produce electricity from various types of waste. EV charging stationsElectric vehicles are here to stay. While not yet mainstream, in the next few years several motor manufacturing companies will produce plug-in hybrid vehicles on their standard models. They will have an electrical engine supplemented by a range extender using petrol. Properties offering charging stations for these vehicles will have a competitive advantage. Water generation Water is a big concern for most of us, even though the price of water is still relatively cheap in South Africa. Technology that generates and purifies water from a humid environment is already in use. We will see this technology in large-scale applications and buildings soon, especially near coastal regions. Green building certification While not strictly a single technology, it is increasingly difficult for businesses to justify occupying or buying a building that isn't green-certified or benchmarked. This is already the case in several countries around the world where landlords struggle to sell a building because it doesn't have sufficient certification standards. {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell \</doc>

THE blasting into space this week of Brit Tim Peake - along with an American and a Russian - and their docking with the International Space Station has sent a frisson of excitement through the British media. There's talk of a Brit landing one of these days on the moon, on Mars. But why? The Yanks went to the moon many years ago and they haven't been back. Why not? There ain't nuttin' there. Nasa have sent an explorer craft to Mars, which is sending back photographs of the planet's barren, flinty, seemingly totally waterless and inhospitable surface (which is to presume, for the sake of argument, that this is not a gigantic hoax, the data being sent from the Griquas rugby field, near Kimberley). Apart from adventure and the planting of a flag, why would a Brit - or anyone else - want to go to Mars? The blast-off in Kazakhstan was indeed awesome. The courage and the disciplined training of the men inside the Soyuz spacecraft are to be marvelled at. The British-American-Russian comradeship is heart-warming and encouraging. But watching the thing on TV, it's inescapable that if humankind is to reach the distant galaxies - and perhaps find a habitable alternative to Earth, if it exists - it won't be done with today's technology. That giant rocket which propelled Soyuz into space was a development - at a multiple of perhaps a million times - on the technology brought to us by the Wright Brothers. It might one day reach the inhospitable planets of our own solar system. But the distant galaxies? Surely not. We'll need absolutely new technology, a new paradigm. As they used to say in the Great Depression: Buddy, can you paradigm? No Mars Bars BREAKING news: "Nasa reports that garlic bread has been f|ound on Mars." High port WHEN first I spotted the picture with yesterday's column of the high-stepping police cadet in India, I thought it was a Maritzburg Collegians rugby player - or perhaps a Carbineer - performing the traditional Jiyo Lele Mama, which is done with much gusto up in the capital. But local historian and writer Peter Quantrill tells me the cadet was in fact marching at what they call the "high port". It's a tradition in India. Peter knows about these things because he was once an officer in the Gurkha Regiment. He says Hitler also admired |the Indian high port marching |and tried to introduce it in Germany. "Alas, it failed miserably as the highest their legs would go resulted in the Nazis adopting the 'goose step'." Too silly OVERHEARD in the Street Shelter for the Over-Forties: "Women are silly. They sleep with men who - if they were women - they wouldn't even bother having |lunch with." A chance DUDU Myeni, here's your chance |to steal a march on Airbus and the malcontents who are making such |a fuss over things. Three jumbo jets are up for grabs at Kuala Lumpur airport, Malaysia. They've been standing there abandoned for more than a year now. The Malaysian authorities aren't even sure who owns them. Here's a chance for SAA to get a cheapie, and balance the books somewhat. Anagrams Fact of the day: Donald Trump is an anagram for Damp Old Runt. Others: Land Mop Turd, Damp Lord Nut, and Mad Lord Punt. Interesting. Climate change DAVE Thompson of Umhlali (who is a geologist) suggests that we worry too much about climate change. The problem is too many people on the planet. "Climate statistics presented are generally misleading, skewed, and even downright lies. The scientific community is never in total agreement," he says. "By 2025, or whenever global cooling/warming kicks in again, attention will be drawn to the several ice ages and warmer periods of the last 100 million years and we'll laugh at COP21 while the bunny huggers (and some of us) will be freezing in the dark."

IT is one thing to accept that the world is getting warmer and the climate changing; it is another to quantify how global warming will play out in the region in which you live. Now Nasa has released a new dataset which is set to change that. It shows how |temperature and rainfall patterns may change up to the year 2100 on a regional basis |as growing concentrations of greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere. Nasa said in a release that its climate projections give a detailed view of future temperatures and precipitation around the world at a 25km resolution, with minimum and maximum temperatures. Nasa chief scientist Ellen Stofan said: "Nasa is in the business of taking what we've learnt about our planet from space and creating new products that help us all safeguard our future. "With this new global dataset, people around the world have a valuable new tool to use in planning how to cope with a warming planet." The high-resolution data is available to the public and can be viewed on a daily timescale for individual cities and towns. Nasa said this would help scientists, planners and decision-makers better understand the local effects of climate change, such as severe droughts, floods, heat waves and losses in agriculture. The dataset shows projected changes in climate in response to two different scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions: one is a "business as usual" scenario, based on the current trend of greenhouse gas the world is emitting, and another on a significant increased level of emissions. It integrates actual measurements from around the world with data from climate simulations. The dataset is part of a Nasa Earth Exchange (NEX) programme and is available to the public through the OpenNEX project. Meanwhile, UN climate change negotiations in Bonn, where governments are trying to hone down a draft text for a new global climate deal for the COP 21 meeting in Paris in December, are moving slowly. Reuters reports that negotiators are under growing pressure to speed up their efforts to slim down the draft text for a new global climate deal so |that ministers can start working on it. Ten days of discussions on the 90-page draft document are due to conclude today, amid expectations they will produce a shorter working version that retains all the options now on the table. Jonathan Grant, director for climate change and carbon markets with consultancy PwC, said the climate negotiations felt "a world away" from the Group of Seven summit in Bavaria, where G7 leaders agreed on Monday to abandon fossil fuels by the end of the century and backed a 2050 goal to cut emissions. \</doc>

We, the undersigned Buddhist leaders, come together prior to the 21st Session of the Conference of Parties ( COP21 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris, in order to add our voices to the growing calls for world leaders to co-operate with compassion and wisdom and reach an ambitious and effective climate agreement. We are at a crucial crossroads where our survival and that of other species is at stake as a result of our actions. There is still time to slow the pace of climate change and limit its impact, but to do so, the Paris summit will need to put us on a path to phase out fossil fuels. We must ensure the protection of the most vulnerable, through visionary and comprehensive mitigation and adaptation measures. Our concern is founded on the Buddha's realisation of dependent co-arising, which interconnects all things in the universe. Understanding this interconnected causality and the consequences of our actions are critical steps in reducing our environmental impact. Cultivating the insight of interbeing and compassion, we will be able to act out of love, not fear, to protect our planet. Buddhist leaders have been speaking about this for decades. However, everyday life can easily lead us to forget that our lives are inextricably interwoven with the natural world through every breath we take, the water we drink, and the food we eat. Through our lack of insight, we are destroying the very life support systems that we and all other living beings depend on for survival. We believe it imperative that the global Buddhist community recognise both our dependence on one another as well as on the natural world. Together, humanity must act on the root causes of this environmental crisis, which is driven by our use of fossil fuels, unsustainable consumption patterns, lack of awareness, and lack of concern about the consequences of our actions. We strongly support "The Time to Act is Now: A Buddhist Declaration on Climate Change", which is endorsed by a diverse and global representation of Buddhist leaders and Buddhist sanghas. We also welcome and support the climate change statements of other religious traditions. These include Pope Francis's encyclical earlier this year, Laudato Si': On Care for Our Common Home, the Islamic Declaration on Climate Change, as well as the upcoming Hindu Declaration on Climate Change. We are united by our concern to phase out fossil fuels, to reduce our consumption patterns, and the ethical imperative to act against both the causes and the impacts of climate change, especially on the world's poorest. To this end, we urge world leaders to generate the political will to close the emissions gap left by country climate pledges. We also ask for a common commitment to scale up climate finance, so as to help developing countries prepare for climate impacts and to help us all transition to a safe, low carbon future. The good news is that there is a unique opportunity at the Paris climate negotiations to create a turning point. Phasing out fossil fuels and moving towards 100 percent renewable and clean energy will not only spur a global, low-carbon transformation, it will also help us to embark on a much-needed path of spiritual renewal. In addition to our spiritual progression, in line with UN recommendations, some of the most effective actions individuals can take are to protect our forests, move toward a plant-based diet, reduce consumption, recycle, switch to renewables, fly less, and take public transport. We can all make a difference. We call on world leaders to recognise and address our universal responsibility to protect the web of life for the benefit of all, now and for the future. For these reasons, we call on all parties in Paris: l To be guided by the moral dimensions of climate change as indicated in Article 3 of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). l To agree to phase out fossil fuels and move towards 100 percent renewables and clean energy. l To create the political will to close the emissions gap left by country climate pledges so as to ensure that the global temperature increase remains below 1.5\'c2\'baC, relative to pre-industrial levels. To make a common commitment to increase finance above the US$100 billion agreed in Copenhagen in 2009, including through the Green Climate Fund (GCF), to help vulnerable developing countries prepare for climate impacts and transition towards a low-carbon economy. The time to act is now. l His Holiness the Dalai Lama Tenzing Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama, |etal. \</doc>

Six of the world's largest energy companies have written a letter to Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), asking for help in setting up a scheme that would put a price on carbon. The letter asked Figueres to help them hold "direct dialogue with the UN and willing governments" about a possible carbon trading scheme. The six companies are Total, Statoil, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Eni and the BG Group. In a letter to the Financial Times explaining the move, the companies said, "We owe it to future generations to seek realistic, workable solutions to the challenge of providing more energy while tackling climate change." The Framework Convention on Climate Change is the body involved with global climate change negotiations. Countries meet each year at the Congress of the Parties (COP) to discuss ways of lowering carbon emissions and tackling climate change. The next meeting will be held in Paris in November, where an agreement is set to be signed, which will make all countries in the world do something to tackle climate change. Firm commitments The agreement could also include a date by which the use of fossil fuels will stop. French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, who will chair the Paris COP, said last month, "We need to be very firm in our commitments, because there is no alternative. There is no alternative planet." The ambition at the heart of a COP agreement should therefore be to create a carbon-neutral world economy in the second-half of this century, he said. The energy companies asked in their letter that this agreement include the extension of carbon trading schemes across the world. These put a price on carbon - making companies buy credits for each tonne of emissions they create. These credits and the funds are then given to offset projects, which actively lower emissions elsewhere. A few countries are currently running their own schemes - although Australia scrapped its trading scheme this year. The largest such scheme is run by the European Union, which puts a tax on around half of all the emissions in the region. But the scheme has struggled, thanks to the collapse of the price of carbon being sold through the scheme. The low price has meant the cost of carbon credits is not high enough to force a change in companies' emissions. Carbon tax in SA South Africa is also planning on introducing a tax, through the Treasury. This would price a tonne of carbon at R120, with most companies getting a 60% discount while they adjusted their factories to emit less carbon. Treasury has said it expects to raise between R8-billion and R30-billion a year from the tax. Environmental groups have asked for this to be ring-fenced, so that the money can be used for environmental programmes. But the tax has been delayed several times. It is also being opposed by various economic clusters. Last week the Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of South Africa issued a press statement saying, "The introduction of carbon tax would impose additional costs to business, harm the economy and impact negatively on jobs at a time when South Africa badly needs more jobs to be created." The letter from the six large emitters is part of a growing momentum ahead of COP21 in Paris, with governments now pushing for the private sector to be involved in fighting climate change. But none of the companies have significant investments in coal, and rather mainly work with natural gas. In the letter the companies punted this as a technology that would allow for a move away from dirtier fossil fuels. "We believe the pragmatic step of implementing a widespread and effective pricing of carbon emissions is critical to realising the full and positive impact natural gas can have." Various studies have questioned the view that natural gas is cleaner than other forms of energy derived from fossil fuels. While - when extracted properly - it produces 50% fewer carbon emissions when burnt than traditional fossil fuels, there are often methane leaks during operations. Several studies in the United States have shown that these leaks can exceed the environmental saving when gas is compared to other fossil fuels. Methane is 20 times more effective at warming the atmosphere per tonne than carbon. \</doc>

After months of wrangling, the eThekwini regional elective conference chose ANC councillor Zandile Gumede as the chairwoman of the region at the Moses Mabhida Stadium last night. Current mayor James Nxumalo was defeated in absentia. He was at the COP 21 environmental conference in Paris. Bontle Mpankanyane of the agency that handled the elections said Nxumalo had been nominated but had not accepted. The conference resolved to vote after numerous failed attempts to contact him. None of the Nxumalo supporters attended the conference. Gumede failed to suppress her excitement and said she was "relieved" that the conference had finally sat and elected her. Asked how she would deal with the tensions, she said: "On top of being a politician I'm also a parent. My job is to unite the ANC is this region and ensure that we soldier on with our mandate of serving people at grass-roots level." Disgruntled party members aligned to Nxumalo had earlier lodged an urgent court interdict to stop the conference from going ahead, citing a string of irregularities. However, the interdict was dismissed in the Durban High Court, with costs. In retaliation, the members snubbed the conference and convened their own meeting in Bolton Hall in Magwaza Maphalala (Gale) Street, where they planned to disrupt the conference. Police dispersed them with stun grenades. What was poised to be a heated elective conference was reduced to a "one horse race" . Irate Nxumalo supporters also called for the nullification of the provincial conference which sat last month. They also alleged the delegate nomination process in some eThekwini branches had been manipulated in favour of Gumede. On Thursday, ANC branches in Umlazi announced a boycott because it had been organised by an "illegitimate" provincial leadership. In an effort to mend the fragmented province, the top leadership, including President Jacob Zuma, convened a series of meetings this week to hear the disputes of branches. The conference ran parallel with a meeting chaired by secretary-general, Gwede Mantashe at the Coastlands Hotel. Deputy chairman Willies Mchunu and deputy secretary Mluleki Ndobe left the conference before it started, to deal with what was a "heated" meeting between disgruntled members and Mantashe. ANC councillor Sithenjwa Nyawose, who is one of the people who lodged the interdict, said they had approached the court because they had exhausted all internal processes without success. He said they would pursue the matter despite being suppressed by senior party leaders. Gumede is a known ally of Zikalala, and victories for both will favour the election of Zuma's ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, as president at the party's 2017 conference. \</doc>

October, November, December, January, February, March and now April - each month in the past year has been hotter than the last. The past seven months have been the hottest in recorded history. That's only two centuries' worth of data. But in those two centuries abnormal months have been haphazardly spread across time. This has changed. Data from Nasa shows that average land and sea temperatures for April were 1.11\'c2\'b0C hotter than they should be. That increase is part of a dramatic shift in recent years. Imperial Germany was battering its way into France the last time a month broke its cold record. Until this millennium dawned temperature records have been set at an increasing rate. When 2005 set the record for the hottest-ever year, it had been eight years since 1998 claimed that honour. But it was surpassed five years later by 2010. Four years later it was 2014. The next year it was 2015. And Nasa projections show that 2016 will continue the trend. The last three months have been hotter by the biggest margin ever. Jeffrey Sachs, director of Columbia University's Earth Institute, has said this new trend shows the Earth's climate system is having "a complete blowout". Normally, the world warms and cools over long time periods. This means the temperature difference between months is measured in a hundredth of a degree. April was 0.24\'c2\'b0C hotter than April 2010 - the previous record holder, which was 0.12\'c2\'b0C hotter than its 2007 cousin. February and March have similarly abrupt increases. In December, the North Pole was an average 0\'c2\'b0C, 30\'c2\'b0C hotter than it normally is. Most scientists - such as those at the United Kingdom's Meteorological Office - agree that a strong El Ni\'c3\'b1o has driven much of the recent record-setting. This phenomenon quickly warms the Pacific Ocean. That leads to drought in the southern hemisphere and floods in the other half of the world. But it is not the strongest El Ni\'c3\'b1o on record. That achievement falls to its 1998 predecessor. In November, the World Meteorological Organisation said that the five years until then were the warmest such period in recorded history. This was mainly down to the ever-increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, it said. Last year, the Mauna Lao Observatory in Hawaii tracked concentrations passing 400 parts per million. This is the first time this has happened in human history. That means more things in the atmosphere to trap and reflect heat. Unable to head back into space, heat is now stuck inside the Earth's atmosphere. Most of that heat goes into the oceans, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and that unlocks all sorts of problems. The Pretoria-based Council for Scientific and Industrial Research says a 2\'c2\'b0C increase in average global temperatures means up to a 6\'c2\'b0C increase in temperatures in South Africa, this century. That shifts rainfall - the country's biggest constraint to farming and development. Most of the country will get drier and take on the characteristics of the Karoo. Aloes and sheep will be the sole crop. Where rainfall does increase - in parts of KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Limpopo - it will come in shorter and heavier spells. That will cause regular flooding and destroy crops. To stave-off this future, South Africa - and nearly 200 other world governments - signed the Paris Agreement at COP21 late last year. This put countries on the same page: to ensure average temperature increases do not exceed 2\'c2\'b0C this century. Researchers at various organisations, such as the influential Grantham Research Unit on Climate Change, say it is too late to reach that target. That takes the world into unchartered territory: too many things start changing for computer models to fully predict the fallout. The canary to that scenario is already screaming, with islands in the Pacific being swallowed by swirling waves. Africa, a minimal emitter of carbon, will be hard-hit. South Africa might be slightly better off thanks to more wealth, meaning people can survive climate shocks such as food price hikes, but the climate is already shifting. The country is already more than 1\'c2\'b0C hotter than a century ago. That has already shifted rainfall and made planting crops a less-than-predictable art form, according to the environment department. The drought has stretched into its second year in most provinces. Less raindrops have splashed on to the ground than at any point in the last century. Relief should come in the form of La Ni\'c3\'b1a - El Ni\'c3\'b1o's sometimes benevolent sister. This cools the Pacific Ocean and brings rainfall to the southern hemisphere. Traces of this change are already being picked up by meteorologists. But its drought-abating rain has, historically, created the worst floods in Southern Africa. It will also not stop 2016 from going down as the hottest year in recorded history. \</doc>

BD Insights. Chartered Secretaries Southern Africa. CSSA/JSE Integrated Reporting Awards. 'Use reporting as a catalyst for behavioural change' COMPANIES and investors face a new reality in which value is increasingly seen beyond short-term financial performance and in the context of broader influences - not only long-term success, but also the environment and community within which we each operate, according to Donna Oosthuyse, director capital markets at the JSE. Delivering the keynote address at the CSSA/JSE Integrated Reporting Awards she asked the audience to consider the context in which the awards ceremony was taking place. & The recent marches for better access to education, greater economic freedom and inclusivity, perceptions around a crisis in political leadership, the continuing global economic downturn and its implications, and the upcoming challenge to reach a global agreement at COP21 to reverse climate change all make the sustainability imperative real and tangible,& said Oosthuyse. & Transparency is a key consideration to respond to these challenges. In the drive to realise value, achieving relevant material disclosure has become the Holy Grail for corporates the world over.& Oosthuyse said that, as an exchange, the JSE understands that sustainability is significant as it may impact financial stability and investor protection. She said what we do and how we do it leads to output and stability, while disclosure and transparency are the building blocks of good governance. & The advent of the notion of integrated reporting is thus a timely one, not only in that it requires and fosters an integrated approach to thinking about the business, but the potential impact that properly concise and relevant reporting could have on facilitating responsible investment and active ownership cannot be underestimated. & Beyond this ideal, integrated reporting creates an opportunity to speak to multiple stakeholders in a clear, simple language with one voice. SA is a unique audience in that it is made up of a range of stakeholders as providers of different types of capital and those from many tiers of broader society. & As a transformative country it's critical to get all interested and affected parties on board in a manner that clearly articulates the tenets of good governance and transparency. & Integrated reporting as a way to position the company's overall strategy, risk and opportunity profile relative to its broad range of stakeholders then becomes an ideal launch pad for real and impactful engagement.& Oosthuyse illustrated the JSE's way of thinking regarding integrated reporting being the basis for real and impactful engagement with these points: 1. First, there is a difference between reporting and transparency. Companies can report by & dumping& mounds of information and believe that they are being transparent, but end up making the reporting opaque through longer financial statements and lots of explanatory notes. If companies really want to use reporting and transparency as a catalyst for behavioural change, it would help if they aimed not just for reporting but for proper transparency: clear and simple. Clarity and simplicity mean people remember and focus on the information that is imparted. 2. What transparency means to different stakeholders and hence whether it will catalyse their understanding of value will depend on who those stakeholders are, since they all look at the world through their own lenses. & 8226;Employees want to know why they work for the best company in terms of strategy but also to understand how this impacts their pockets and lifestyles. & 8226;Communities are most interested in what you are doing practically about the things that affect them such as infrastructure, job creation, education and local procurement. & 8226;Government and regulators are interested in responses to policy - both existing and new. 3. The role of outside incentives is always important but may need to be relooked at. Financial market regulators look at disclosure as a great panacea - if the information is out there, at least those who need it can get it, but excessive disclosure is not necessarily transparent. Oosthuyse said in the rush to get volumes of information out there, perhaps the ecosystem is missing an opportunity to get the relevant information used in a manner that builds a shared understanding between multiple stakeholders of the value the company produces. & All of this leads me to conclude that companies should seize the initiative to be proactive about developing a common understanding of value and value creation.& She stressed that while the work being done by South African companies in implementing integrated reporting is truly progressive, which is evidenced by the awards, integrated reporting remains an evolutionary journey. SA is a unique audience in that it is made up of a range of stakeholders as providers of different types of capital and those from many tiers of broader society Donna Oosthuyse ... sustainability is significant. \</doc>

The Minister of Environmental Affairs, Mrs Edna Molewa officially opened the 2015 Lights on Lightning Conference, today, 12 November in Pretoria. The Lights on Lightning Conference is hosted by the South African Weather Service in association with the Lightning Interest Group for Health Technology and Science. The South African Weather Service is an entity of the National Department of Environmental Affairs. The conference serves as a platform for lightning researchers to share their relevant research within the broader African lightning community. The teams aim to break new ground in the centuries-old study of this complex, all-powerful, and at times mysterious scientific phenomenon. In the 21st century, groundbreaking research is being conducted by the likes of the South African Weather Service and the Lightning Interest Group for Health, Technology and Science. Rather than mystery, science is used to explain and harness the power of lightning. That said, it is known that centuries-old indigenous knowledge continues to play a formative role in helping our understanding of the science of lighting. The Kara Heritage Institute, under the leadership of Dr. Mathole Motshekga, forms part of today's proceedings. Injuries and fatalities from lightning in South Africa are among the highest in the world, with 100 people killed by lightning strikes every year. Loss of consciousness, amnesia, paralysis and severe burns are among the injuries reported by those lucky enough to survive. Around the world, lightning strikes result in death and injuries to livestock and other animals, forest and brush fires, and the destruction of agricultural land. In a country such as ours with unique biodiversity, our wildlife, particularly giraffes are vulnerable to lightning strikes. While seeking shelter under trees, the entire animal herds can be killed by a single strike. In many parts of the world, including South Africa, financial losses incurred as a result of lightning strikes can run into millions of rands, as homeowners and business owners claim damages from insurance companies. The insurance division of one of South Africa's and Africa's largest banks reported in 2012 that there has been as high as 402 percent increase year on year in weather-related damage claims, including from lightning. Minister Molewa said, Despite the high number of fatalities and injuries from lightning strikes, we know too that South Africa's lightning research scientists are leaders in this field and will continue to collate data and produce cutting-edge research to further enable our understanding of lighting science, in particular in the medical study of lightning injuries and casualties - keraunomedicine. In the 2014 paper on lightning medicine by Dr. Blumenthal, most lightning strikes tend to occur in rural areas where our people are most vulnerable, poor and sometimes helpless. Therefore, the collation of such data that you do, plays an invaluable role not just in aiding our understanding of lightning and the proper treatment of victims of strikes, but also in aiding our efforts as government to better inform and educate our people on the hazards of lightning. As a multi-disciplinary group that provides a platform for researchers to share their knowledge on lightning physics and related scientists within an African context, I am pleased to note that Lights also aims to provide practical lightning safety tips and broad lightning safety education through open public engagements, said Minister Molewa. This process is consistent with the provisions of the National Climate Change Response Policy which advocates for adaptation measures aimed at enhancing climate resilient society and emergency response capacity. This will require the enhancement of early warning systems as part of proactive disaster risk management. Further is the need to continue to enhance the generation and dissemination of climate information especially for climate sensitive sectors and the vulnerable segment of our society. This conference is taking place with less than three weeks to go before the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP21 ) opens in France. The UN Climate Change Conference as it is also more popularly known is a conclusion of the global mandate which was agreed to at CoP17 in Durban four years ago. Minister Molewa explained, That mandate is to develop a protocol, another legal instrument or agreed outcome with legal force, under the Convention, by no later than 2015, to come into effect and be implemented from 2020. This agreement it is hoped will achieve our goal of keeping global temperature rises below 2 degrees Celsius. Minister Molewa also expressed her pleasure that this conference will be producing a scientific paper that presents the South African position on lightning research and how this impacts on and/or affects climate change.

US, Japan, and China race to launch the first emissions-monitoring satellites after climate talks at COP21 in Le Bourget, near Paris, France. Scientists from the US, Japan, and China are racing to perfect satellite technology that could one day measure greenhouse gas emissions from space, potentially transforming the winner into the world's first climate cop. Monitoring a single country's net emissions from above could not only become an important tool to establish whether it had met its promises to slow global warming, a point of contention at climate talks in Paris, but also help emitters to pinpoint the sources of greenhouse gases more quickly and cheaply. "The real success of a deal here fundamentally revolves around whether we can see emissions and their removals," said John-O Niles, director of the US-based Carbon Institute, which studies methods of carbon dioxide (CO2) measurement. "We know satellite technology is evolving so that there is an increasing ability to actually tell whether countries are telling the truth." Most estimates of greenhouse gas emissions are now based on calculations of energy use and other proxy data, rather than on-the-ground measurements, leaving a huge margin of error when nations submit their figures to the United Nations. While space-based measurement is unlikely to be mentioned in any deal agreed by the nearly 200 countries negotiating in Paris, the European Union is leading a push for a universal system of measuring, reporting and verifying emissions data. China puzzle European and Japanese satellites have been monitoring overall carbon concentrations in the atmosphere since 2002, but calculating emissions at a national or local level is far harder. For example, the margin of error for China, presumed to be the world's top carbon polluter, is greater than the entire carbon footprint of Europe, according to experts. Earlier this year, new data showed that China had consumed substantially more coal in 2014 than earlier reported, causing big revisions to carbon calculations. An earlier report showed its carbon output between 2000 and 2013 was about 3 billion tonnes less than previously estimated. China announced plans ahead of the Paris talks to launch its first emissions-monitoring satellites next year. But it says trade restrictions are hampering cooperation. "Nasa and Japan are sharing the best sensors, but not China," said Yi Liu, a lead scientist in China's effort. "This is a problem. We need to work together to make this work." Red and orange blobs The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), launched its first satellite to measure atmospheric CO2 in July last year. The challenge now is to convert the images - which pick up carbon concentrations in the form of yellow, orange, and red blobs - \~into emissions data, said Steven Pawson, chief of the Global Modelling and Assimilation Office at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Centre. "What we can measure right now is the total column of CO2 in the atmosphere," he said. "The current technology is not strong enough to give absolute values, but if there were a gross misrepresentation (of one country's emissions), it would be quite possible to see." Nasa scientist Lesley Ott said that the satellite, named OCO-2, also showed there was potential to zoom into urban areas to record carbon pollution. A new device with that capability, OCO-3, has been developed for use on the International Space Station, but has been delayed by budget constraints, she said. Scientists are also struggling to measure changes in forests that absorb CO2, a key part of the calculation for net emissions, from space. Trees bind carbon while they are growing, but stop once they are mature. Masanobu Shimada, a researcher at the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency JAXA, is working on distinguishing between the two on a global scale. "We can get an idea about biomass from the shading of its images," he said. But for now, the imagery is too fuzzy for certainty. Down to earth Back on earth, climate activists hope a Paris deal will include helping poor countries to measure their own net carbon emissions on the ground, a process that can be difficult and costly. Michael Gillenwater, of the not-for-profit Greenhouse Gas Management Institute, said that kind of monitoring was better suited than satellites to pinpointing the source of emissions. "We need to know where emissions are coming from - which factory, what process," he said. But calculating net emissions at a single poultry farm in China, for example, requires a 54-page, UN-certified rulebook that factors in everything from the amount of methane removed from the chicken manure to local temperatures and animal weight to come up with a figure. At some point, that kind of detailed analysis may also be possible from space. A Canadian satellite company called GHGSat has launched a small-scale effort to do exactly that. Its nanosatellite, nicknamed CLAIRE, will launch in April aiming to provide a way for energy producers to measure their carbon footprint. \</doc>

THE headlines heralded the "beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era". The celebrations among many negotiators at the climax of the global COP21 climate negotiations were unbridled. The closing speeches from developed and developing countries alike hailed a global climate deal not perfect but nonetheless historic. On the night of December 12 in Paris, more than 190 countries adopted the first ever binding and truly global climate agreement. The Paris Outcome represents progress and yet, while it is more than some expected the deal delivers considerably less than is needed to protect people living in poverty across the world who face the worst impacts of the climate crisis. Before the talks a group of South African civil society organisations agreed on a series of critical climate "red lines" for a fair ambitious and binding global climate deal. Red lines included securing guarantees that at least half of the $100-billion (R1.5-trillion) a year from 2020 pledged by developed countries would go to mitigation and the other half to adaption projects desperately needed by developing countries hard hit by climate impacts. Or the inclusion of a temperature goal of 1.5\'b0C and ensuring that a robust and regular review mechanism is put in place to hold countries accountable to progress against their pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The inclusion of an ambitious target of holding to a 1.5\'b0C average future temperature increase was a success of the negotiations. In the next step it is critical to identify the means of implementation to achieve such a temperature target. The trouble is that the current voluntary pledges of greenhouse gas emissions cuts by countries add up to at least 2.7\'b0C of warming. Countries will need to step up their voluntary emissions mitigating efforts as soon as possible. It is also positive that the agreement speaks about the global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions must be reached as soon as possible and that the "balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases" needs to be achieved in the second half of this century. This is a clear signal to speed up the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. However in some ways the Paris Outcome is less ambitious than many had hoped. For example it does not include agreement on a review mechanism that could help aggressively increase country emissions targets in the period before 2020 to give us a chance of holding to even a 2\'b0C temperature target. On finance the deal recognises more funding is needed for communities to adapt to climate change over the next five years but does not include any concrete steps to help make this happen. Post 2020 there is only a commitment to set a new collective finance target for 2025 from a floor of $100-billion per year at some point after 2020 and critically no recognition of the need for a separate target for adaptation finance. The agreement also failed to reach consensus on the principle of differentiation at the heart of which is the issue of people and their rights. The rights of indigenous communities women and children were relegated from the legally binding section of the agreement to the preamble. In the Paris Outcome a gap exists between ambitious-sounding temperature and finance targets and the practical mechanisms needed for implementation - a gap between the rhetoric and the urgent actions needed to address the climate crisis. In South Africa this means following up on the international agreement by intensifying the call for the country to transition to a low-carbon economy; to reform fossil fuel subsidies build more accessible renewable energy and to enact these ambitions in climate legislation. Now again it is up to the growing climate movement of youth faith leaders frontline elders organised labour and scientists to hold our government and polluters accountable and to lead a just transition of our economy away from fossil fuels.

The Global South, made up of developing countries, met in New Delhi recently to discuss their expectations of the coming UN Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) set to take place in Paris at the end of the month and into December. The two weeks of deliberations are expected to yield definitive and legally binding agreements regarding climate change and the actions needed to clamp down on greenhouse gas emissions. But, say experts at the Centre for Science and Environment in India, even if the world stopped all carbon emissions tomorrow, historical emissions would continue to change the climate. They said between 1850 and 2011, the US alone had emitted a staggering 411 billion tons of carbon dioxide. These emissions, as a result of industry, consumption and agriculture, went hand in hand with development. That country, together with the 28-member EU, Russia and Canada, has emitted 50% of the world's total carbon dioxide. Africa has emitted just 50 billion tons of the world's emissions, which is roughly 2.7% of the world's total emissions. "From now until 2030, if the continent carries on with a business-as-usual approach, it will release 50 billion tons of carbon dioxide." And emissions are expected to grow. Developing nations, lagging behind in terms of development, will slowly begin producing more emissions as they invest more in development. This, said the director-general of the centre, Sunita Narain, was necessary to uplift people living in poverty - predominantly in Africa and Asia - and meet their basic needs. "There are still people without access to electricity. Research showed in 1992, 1.5 billion people did not have it. In 2012 the situation had not improved much: 1.3 billion still |do not have electricity." She said that developed countries had resisted the idea that historically the blame lay at their door and wanted all nations to curb emissions. "But at what cost? These negotiations are often regarded as 'soft negotiations', but they are far from that. This is a fight for development, for economic growth. The developed nations have had their time. This is ours." The agreements between nations relate to how much each will be allowed to emit to keep the temperature increase below 2\'c2\'baC by 2100 - identified as a "safe target", despite potentially disastrous impacts on food production and extreme weather events, particularly in developing countries. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a recent report that to stay below the target, the world collectively needed to emit just 2 900 billion tons of carbon dioxide. But from the dawn of the industrial revolution until 2011, 1 900 billion tons has already been used, leaving a 1 000-billion-ton window. This amount will have to be shared between developing and developed nations. In a discussion on the subject of carbon budget, the deputy director-general of the Centre for Science and Environment in India, Chandra Bhushan, said only 250 billion tons of carbon budget would be left after 2030. "Much of Africa and India will not have met their development needs by 2030," he said. "The developed world, with 10% of the world population, will eat 26% of the carbon cake." Narain added: "They (the US and EU) emitted in the past. We will emit in the present and future," referring to the emissions that India and Africa would make to meet the developed needs of their people." Countries have now been urged to submit Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, outlining how much they are prepared to cut back, related to their own national priorities and circumstances. This system was voluntary and, said Narain, might not be enough to reduce emissions effectively, steering the globe away from its target. The system is linked to the Kyoto Protocol, and the fact that it comes to a conclusion in 2020. The Protocol - adopted in December 1997 and brought into force in February 2005 - is an international agreement linked to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which commits it countries to internationally binding emission reduction targets. Some countries entered a second commitment period from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2020. Narain said it was important for developing countries to negotiate strongly in Paris. "It is critical that countries from South Asia and Africa send their best people and negotiate hard on climate change. "The world is already looking at the prospect of not containing climate change within 2\'c2\'baC. Recently, the emission plans of 119 countries were put out by the UN Framework for Climate Change. "These emission reduction plans will not contain temperature rise below 2\'c2\'baC," said Bhushan. Narain said Africa and Asia needed to work together to "push back" against the developed world. "We face the same problems. Reduced production of staple foods and deaths as a result of extreme weather events." \</doc>

In the run-up to the much-anticipated COP21 international climate summit in Paris, business leaders worldwide have shown substantial support for action on greenhouse gases (GHG)... The White House launched the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, with 81 companies representing US$5 trillion in market value committing to take more aggressive action. Ten large oil and gas companies, mostly from Europe and representing 20% of global production, announced an Oil and Gas Climate Initiative that "will collectively strengthen our actions and investments to contribute to reducing the GHG intensity of the global energy mix." Nonprofit The Climate Group launched the RE100 Initiative, under which 45 large companies declared their intention to move toward 100% renewable energy over the next several decades. This beehive of corporate activity represents a transformation in corporate attitudes and practices over the last couple of decades. At a recent talk at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, Rachel Kyte, World Bank group vice president and special envoy for climate change, said: <blockquote>The private sector is at an inflection point; it's very different than (the 2009 UN climate summit in) Copenhagen. There is an embrace of the science that there was not six years ago. There has also been an extraordinary evolution in the economics; we recognize that the cost of inaction will be brutal.</blockquote> Can this "corporate pivot," in Kyte's words, save the planet from climate change? What business brings Business certainly brings vast financial, technological, organizational and human resources to bear, and it constitutes a powerful political force that can exercise considerable sway over public opinion and policymakers. Business increasingly recognizes that, left unchecked, climate change presents a series of long-term risks, from flooding and drought to political instability and more drastic regulation. There are also significant business opportunities, particularly in clean energy and energy efficiency. The business of carbon measurement, reporting and management is itself booming. While the shift in the stance of business is certainly welcome, unfortunately it is not moving us nearly far or fast enough toward decarbonizing our economy, which requires cutting GHG emissions at least 80% by 2050 to stabilize the planet's climate system. A key reason is that corporate climate-related initiatives are largely treated as part of their voluntary Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities - all the new business initiatives mentioned above are voluntary. Although most large companies have now embraced CSR and more than 11,000 report their activities, these CSR-style measures usually don't have much impact on the technologies, products and growth plans that constitute the heart of most businesses' operations. This disconnect helps explain the apparent paradox of intense corporate activity but slow movement toward actually reducing global emissions, which have continued to rise globally at 2%-3% a year until stalling in 2014. It is still unclear if this slowdown represents a turning point or is just a short-term effect of China's slowing growth combined with cheap natural gas displacing coal in power generation. Sustainability comes to coffee My colleagues and I explored this paradox in a recent paper that examined the interaction of business, states and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) as they developed CSR frameworks around sustainable coffee labels, such as Fair Trade. We described how the concept of sustainability had successfully moved from the margins to the mainstream, and had been embraced by leading coffee roasters and retailers. This success, however, came at a price. We argued: <blockquote>Activists' early visions of a more sustainable, equitable and accountable global coffee order have been diluted and absorbed by mainstream business. The idea of sustainability has been reduced to a set of standards and certifications for managing reputation, quality and supply chain risk.</blockquote> We found that businesses and NGOs developed frameworks for CSR by negotiating codes of conduct, reporting standards, label certifications and auditing requirements. The push for sustainability led to a shift in how coffee is valued - economically, in the marketplace, and culturally, in the minds of the public. It introduced what we call a new "value regime" for coffee that captured growing consumer concerns for environmental and social conditions. Retailers like Starbucks successfully translated sustainable coffee into profitable new market segments with premium prices for branded high-end products. Roasters, and some growers, also profited from this economic model. <figure class="fig-caption" class="align-center zoomable"><figcaption><span class="caption">With certifications such as Fair Trade, many people now know more about the source of their coffee, but sustainable coffee hasn't fundamentally changed the basic dynamics of the industry.</span><span class="attribution">riot/flickr, CC BY-NC-ND</span></figcaption></figure> Though business initially resisted activists' demands for sustainability, they have gradually become more collaborative in their approaches, negotiating pricing mechanisms and environmental standards, and sometimes launching their own sustainability labels. NGOs have also been willing to compromise to secure the mainstream uptake of sustainability by, for example, offering not only social and environmental certifications but also quality and supply chain management services. Simultaneously, business has been willing to integrate CSR as a tool for measurement, management and disclosure that helps companies manage risks and differentiate their products and enhance their brands with consumers. As a result, CSR has achieved some real, positive changes in business practices of the coffee industry. But CSR has not changed the fundamental inequalities in the sector. Affluent western consumers now purchase larger quantities of higher priced coffee, which is still served by low-wage retail employees and mostly grown by impoverished workers in developing countries. There are some important parallels here for current efforts to address climate change in business. As in the coffee industry, sustainability has evolved to become a corporate tool for measuring carbon footprints and reporting various initiatives, from carpooling and recycling to renewable energy commitments. These CSR measures do have a real impact, because measurement and reporting brings managerial attention to the potential for investing in the low-hanging fruit of emissions reductions, such as energy efficiency, with strong returns on investment. Many larger companies are hiring chief sustainability officers with broader mandates and bigger budgets than more traditional, compliance-focused environmental, health and safety managers. Limits to CSR These voluntary CSR-style measures, however, only take us so far. CSR is inherently limited by the difficulty in transitioning to a low-carbon value regime, an economic model that would need to generate value for businesses and also align with consumers' values. Consumers might be willing to pay a substantial premium for fair trade coffee lattes but are more resistant to paying significantly more for greener electricity or high-efficiency hybrid vehicles, let alone reducing their consumption or giving up their personal comforts. As a result, business finds it difficult to justify investing beyond the low-hanging fruit. <figure class="fig-caption" class="align-center zoomable"><figcaption><span class="caption">Walmart has installed solar panels at many of its stores, including this one in California. But even with a large initiative around sustainability, the company projects that its emissions will be flat, not go down, as revenue grows.</span><span class="attribution">walmartcorporate/flickr, CC BY</span></figcaption></figure> Walmart is a good case study of the opportunities and limits of a CSR approach to climate change. With great fanfare, it is cutting emissions by millions of tons and saving many millions of dollars by reducing packaging and improving the efficiency of its distribution system and buildings. But it has made a commitment only to hold its absolute emissions flat this decade, due to anticipated growth in revenues, which entails more economic activity and associated emissions. Unilever has made a much more ambitious "pledge to cut the company's environmental impact in half by 2020." Though it has made substantial strides, it acknowledges that the target will be impossible to meet. Consumers account for 70% of the company's impact, and "their habits aren't changing." So businesses might be very busy with myriad initiatives, but if actual results fall short, are they really sustainable? As John Ehrenfeld and Andrew Hoffman point out in their book Flourishing, sustainability has real meaning only if it achieves stability of the planet's climate and ecosystems. The corporatization of sustainability has led to more sophisticated ways to measure and report sustainability in business, which includes ESG (environment, social and governance) metrics on publicly traded companies. But this, too, has limitations. As Matt Moscardi, who leads ESG research in the finance industry at investor research firm MSCI, put it at forum at the University of Massachusetts, Boston in December 2014, "ESG factors and their integration in investing is largely driven by (economic) materiality, and not just by the virtue of moral obligation." In other words, aggressive, expensive measures to dramatically reduce GHG emissions will not be integrated into these investor-oriented metrics if they do not correlate with financial performance. In energy, fast but not enough Beyond CSR, the rapid growth of the clean energy sector, particularly solar and wind, is encouraging when it comes to reducing emissions and is attracting the attention of major investors. Goldman Sachs recently announced that it will triple its capital allocation to clean energy finance to $150 billion over the next 10 years. Yet overall, new investment in clean energy has stagnated since 2011 at around $300 billion a year globally, after rising rapidly during the prior decade. And it's far below the $1 trillion per year that some groups estimate is needed to avoid raising global average temperatures two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels and the worst effects of climate change. There are several troubling factors that are impeding the growth of clean energy. Subsidies for renewable energy have been reduced by governments concerned about budget deficits, and cheap natural gas has made it harder for renewables to compete. Political pressures are likely to keep carbon prices far below the level needed to have a real impact. The delegates in Paris for COP21 are confronting a planetary emergency. Recent evidence regarding melting polar ice caps, methane emissions from permafrost and deforestation and forest fires suggests that we might be approaching a point of no return. If we are to stay within the two degrees Celsius warming target, we need massive structural changes in our energy and transportation systems, as well as in our urban structures and agricultural and land use practices. Mobilizing the financial and technological resources of business is crucial, but voluntary CSR-style measures don't go far enough. We can transform our economy and infrastructure, but it requires large-scale, coordinated economic, financial and policy measures at global, national and local levels. This is the challenge for Paris, and for decades to come. \</doc>

CLIMATE FINANCEUnited States secretary of state John Kerry announced on December 9 that the US will double its climate aid to poor countries to $860-million a year. Although there is little doubt of the benefit of more (and much-needed) climate aid, the effect of the aid is fundamentally contingent on how it is allocated.Following the conclusion of the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP21 ) and renewed commitments to climate finance, a crucial question is whether this "climate money" is properly spent by bilateral donors.Climate funds are typically earmarked for climate adaptation and mitigation. The former relates to overcoming the adverse effects of climate change where measures would, for example, include the construction of dykes and adapting water resources, and financing the movement of people who are adversely affected by rising sea levels.Mitigation, on the other hand, refers to the reduction of the rate and magnitude of climate change by reducing greenhouse gases. The central question is, are these funds assigned to the appropriate countries and to the right projects? When looking at adaptation, the answer to this question is simply, no. Our current comparative country study, which looked at seven of the largest climate finance donors, five of which were European, with a regional focus on sub-Saharan Africa, shows funding for climate change adaptation is not provided to the most climate-vulnerable countries, which are not necessarily the poorest countries. Climate vulnerability is determined by the exposure and sensitivity of a country to global warming and the resources present in the country to adapt to the negative effects.Read: Determinants of the Flow of Bilateral Adaptation-Related Climate Change Financing to sub-Saharan African CountriesYet bilateral donors are not driven by climate vulnerability, but by the existing relationships they have with their partners in development co-operation. In other words, countries that receive more climate aid are already receiving official development assistance and, as our research shows, democratic countries also generally receive more climate funding than nondemocratic countries.Importantly, climate vulnerability plays no role in spending climate funds, which implies that the countries that will be most adversely affected by global warming do not get enough money. To illustrate this, South Africa - with some sparsely populated countries and some small island states disregarded - received the highest amount for climate adaptation (per capita) between 2010 and 2013, but it is the least vulnerable country in sub-Saharan Africa.Related to mitigation, the answer is also negative. This is illustrated by the use of mitigation funds by countries such as Japan to finance coal plants in India, Indonesia and Bangladesh when coal is the largest source of climate pollution. Admittedly, Japan has focused heavily on technology that reduces the emissions of carbon dioxide in coal-fired plants. But the energy generated from coal plants is still significantly more polluting than energy derived from the sun, wind or natural gas. Indonesia and Japan, furthermore, have strong commercial ties. Indonesia is the second-largest supplier of coal to Japan. Japan's financing therefore ensures that a number of national companies remain internationally competitive. In short, the commercial interest prevails.The risk then, with climate finance, is we fall into the old traps of traditional development aid and this, according to academic literature, usually goes to ex-colonies, to countries where a (potential) commercial interest prevails for the donor, or to countries of geostrategic importance. This often happens at the expense of the neediest countries. Looking at the trends in climate finance, it appears as though bilateral donors are impervious to this criticism. Instead of learning from past mistakes, donors tend to be stubborn and consequently destined to make the same mistakes.The World Bank warns in its new report, Shockwaves, that global warming is likely to affect the poor in countries considerably more than the rich, further exacerbating existing inequalities.Moreover, the International Organisation for Migration has illustrated that migration will increase as a result of climate change. The incorrect assignment of climate aid may therefore have far-reaching consequences and lead to rising poverty in climate-vulnerable developing countries and an increase in climate-refugees to richer countries.In short, urgency is certainly appropriate when it comes to fighting climate change, but the provision of financing is only half the battle. The other half relates to relevant, effective disbursement of financing. It is essential bilateral donors learn from their mistakes in traditional development aid allocation, and that the US, in light of Kerry's announcement, learns from the successes and failures of European bilaterals, which have thus far tended to commit more to climate finance. We must correctly allocate the available funds to projects that signify the most efficient climate-friendly interventions in the most climate-vulnerable countries.Jamie Robertsen is an associate at Genesis-Analytics.

His Excellency President Jacob Zuma will lead a South African delegation to the 70th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA70) under the theme: The United Nations at 70 - the road ahead for peace, security and human rights. The General Assembly is the main deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the UN. Comprising all 193 Members of the UN, it provides a unique forum for multilateral discussion of the full spectrum of international issues covered by the Charter of the United Nations (UN). The General Debate will take place from 28 September to 3 October 2015 and will be preceded by the Sustainable Development Summit for the adoption of the Post-2015 Development Agenda outcome document titled: Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The General Debate takes place in the context of a number of landmark anniversaries, which include the: (i) 70th anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations; (ii) 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War; (iii) 70th anniversary of the use of the atomic bombs; (iv) 20th anniversary of the Beijing Platform for Action; (v) 15th anniversary of resolution 1325 on women, peace and security; and (vi) target date for the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The new development agenda builds on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and will serve as the guiding global development framework for the next fifteen years. South Africa participated actively throughout the drafting process, primarily in our capacity as Chair of the Group of 77 and China. At the heart of Agenda 2030 is the set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 associated targets. The goals cover all three dimensions of sustainable development ranging from: ending poverty, ensuring healthy lives; ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education, achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls, conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development and addressing climate change. The SDGs contained in Agenda 2030 are aligned to South Africa's National Development Plan (NDP), as well as to the African Union's Agenda 2063, and also seek to address the triple challenges of poverty, unemployment and inequality. South Africa will use her participation in the 70th Session to continue the work to achieve reform of the UN, specifically the Security Council, as well as to ensure that the selection and appointment process of the UN Secretary-General is brought in line with democratic practice. In addition to the Sustainable Development Summit and the General Debate, South Africa will participate in the following High-Level United Nations Events on the margins of UNGA70: Summit of the African Union Peace and Security Council (AUPSC) chaired by the President Museveni of Uganda as President of the AUPSC for September (26 September 2015), Global Leaders' Meeting on Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment - A Common Commitment, chaired by President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China (27 September 2015), Meeting of Selected Heads of State and Government on COP21 co-hosted by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, President Hollande of France, and President Tasso of Peru (27 September 2015), Informal Working Lunch of Heads of State and Government on Climate Change (29 September 2015), Ninth Regional Oversight Mechanism Meeting of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework ( 29 September 2015), and Leaders' Summit on countering ISIL and Violent Extremism hosted by President Obama of the United States (29 September 2015). South Africa will also be commemorating and celebrating the support of the United Nations for our struggle for liberation and the participation of many eminent South Africans in United Nations platforms during the struggle including liberation hero and icon ANC President Oliver Reginald Tambo and eminent musician Miriam Makeba. South Africa will also be commemorating and celebrating the support of the United Nations for the struggle for liberation. Key in this regard is the effective international campaign for the isolation of the apartheid state that was led by liberation hero and icon, ANC President Oliver Reginald Tambo. Mr Tambo and eminent South Africans such as musician Miriam Makeba addressed the United Nations on different occasions on the evils of apartheid, campaigning for isolation to bring the state to its knees. The declaration of apartheid as a crime against humanity was one of the most important milestones in the struggle for freedom. A most recent critical recognition of South Africa by the UN was the declaration of the 18th of July as International Mandela Day. President Zuma will be accompanied by the Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Ms Maite Nkoana-Mashabane; Minister of Women in the Presidency, Ms Susan Shabangu; Minister in the Presidency for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, Mr Jeff Radebe; Minister of Defence and Military Veterans, Ms Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula; Minister of Environmental Affairs, Ms Edna Molewa; Minister of Social Development, Ms Bathabile Dlamini; Minister of Communications, Ms Faith Muthambi; Minister of State Security, Mr David Mahlobo; Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services, Dr Siyabonga Cwele and the Deputy Minister of Public Service and Administration, Ms Ayanda Dlodlo.

Your Excellency, President Xi Jinping and your distinguished delegation, The South African delegation, It is a pleasure for me to host President Xi Jinping on his second State Visit to South Africa. It is also an historic visit taking place on the eve of the first FOCAC Summit in Africa. Our meeting today provided us with the opportunity to discuss progress we have made with the implementation of our "Five-to-Ten Year Strategic Programme of Cooperation'. Many areas of cooperation have been identified and a great deal of progress has been made in the areas identified for 2015. The 2015 areas of cooperation are the following: Alignment of industries to accelerate South Africa's industrialisation process; Enhancement of cooperation in Special Economic Zones Enhancement of marine cooperation; Infrastructure development; Human resource cooperation; and Financial cooperation. In our discussions today, President Xi and I both expressed our satisfaction about the progress we have made in the implementation of identified projects. You have just witnessed the signing of 26 agreements that are worth 94 billion rand. The volume of agreements indicates the amount of work that has been done in the past few months. We agreed that more could and should be done to increase our trade and investment figures. South Africa has just hosted an Inward Buying Mission from China, which comprised large Chinese State owned enterprises in the areas of Agriculture and Agro-processing, Minerals, Plastics and Chemicals, Capital Goods, Automotive and related sectors. We wish to invite more inward buying missions to South Africa. I believe that this will contribute to addressing the structure of our bilateral trade, as well as the industrialisation of our economy. We were both satisfied about the level and extent of the cooperation that exists between our two countries with regard to the establishment of Special Economic Zones and science parks in South Africa. In this regard, I refer particularly to Chinese investments in the Metallurgical Cluster by the Hoi Mor Consortium within the Musina Special Economic Zone in Limpopo. We requested China's continued support for the development of South African special economic zones and industrial parks, especially in infrastructure development and the establishment of incubation centres and specialised training institutes. In the area of energy, I informed President Xi that there is a niche for cooperation with China mainly in wind, solar and hydro power through the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers Programme programme. Amongst others, these include the development of small harbours and the positioning and utilisation of South African ports as Transhipment Hubs for Chinese Ocean Carriers in their global trade and within the BRICS trade. In addition, we also proposed further engagement with China on the recapitalisation of our marine manufacturing capacity and investments in vessel construction businesses. We also seek to expand tourism and business interaction. We therefore welcome the introduction of direct flights between Johannesburg and Beijing by Air China. South Africa has opened two new visa processing centres in Chengdu and Guangzho which will further promote travel between the two countries. We have each expressed our views regarding the UN climate change conference COP21 which is currently taking place in Paris. The impacts of climate change affect everyone. We must anticipate that these impacts will worsen over time, unless global greenhouse gas emissions are drastically reduced, with developed countries taking the lead. We urge all parties in Paris to put the interests of the world first and not allow national interests to make it difficult to reach an agreement. We remain optimistic that a legally binding agreement will be reached as we have no other choice. We have to act now before it is too late. We also confirmed to China, our support for their Presidency of the G20 and to cooperate with them to further advance those issues we deem crucial to developing countries. Naturally, we also touched upon the main developments in BRICS, since the Ufa Summit in July this year. We also discussed the need to promote global peace and security and condemned the recent acts of terror in France, Nigeria and other countries. Global action against terrorism is necessary within the ambit of the United Nations. In this regard, the reform and expansion of the UN Security Council is also critical for it to include other regions of the globe especially Africa with its one billion people. Ladies and gentlemen, We look forward to a fruitful State visit and a highly successful Forum on Africa-China Cooperation this week. I would now wish to invite President Xi Jinping, to address the media. I thank you. \</doc>

MCB Group has invested, via MCB Equity Fund, in Partnering Technologies, a French high-tech printing and robotics business run by Ramesh Caussy, the Mauritian inventor of Diya One... Diya One is the first neuro-inspired robot that can analyse and purify indoor air. It was a major attraction at the "Solutions COP 21 " exhibition. Diya One was showcased at the booths of the Institut National de la Protection Industrielle and that of French multinational ENGIE. Ramesh Caussy also presented his project during the "breakthrough night" dedicated to innovation. The R2-D2 of climate change Dubbed "the R2-D2 of climate change" by the international media due to its resemblance to the mythical Star Wars robot, Diya One is equipped with artificial intelligence. It moves around silently on its own, eliminating particulate and chemical pollution. After analysing the composition of indoor air using integrated sensors, Diya One robot then purifies it with extreme precision. The robot also delivers other functions, such as reducing energy consumption and managing maintenance requests from occupants. Diya One can work in museums, public buildings, schools and offices. Its abilities have been officially validated by the Centre Scientifique et Technique du B\'e2timent in France and it is currently being supported by the European Union's SPARC programme dedicated to research and innovation and whose aim is to make Europe the global leader in robotics by 2020. A bright future MCB Equity Fund was launched in 2005 with a committed capital of $100 million. Managed by MCB Capital Partners, a subsidiary of MCB Capital Markets, the fund provides expansion and buy-out capital to businesses with high growth potential. Its involvement in Partnering Technologies is sensible as the future of robotics is bright. The multibillion-dollar global market for robotics, long dominated by industrial and logistics uses, has begun to see a shift towards new consumer and office applications. According to a Business Insider Report published in May 2015, there will be a $1.5 billion market for consumer and business robots by 2019. Improving the environment Diya One is the first interactive robotic solution that purifies indoor air that is very often degraded by microbial or microbiological pollutants. According to the World Health Organisation, bad air quality is one of the main sources of respiratory diseases that can cause death. In Europe and the United States, norms are being introduced to ensure clean air is being breathed in public places, including schools and offices. As a pioneer of autonomous air purification, Diya One should be a success. Mutual benefits Pierre Guy No\'ebl, chief executive, MCB Group: "We have taken the opportunity to invest in a young and innovative business working in a promising market and that has shown, through Diya One, its ability to improve our lives. It's also an exciting opportunity for us to support a local talent who is showcasing the Mauritian know-how on a global stage". Ramesh Caussy, chief executive, Partnering Technologies: "I couldn't imagine international development without involving Mauritius, and ensure it benefits from my humble contribution. We have now made the first step with the entry of the MCB Group, a key player in Mauritius, in the capital of Partnering Technologies." \</doc>

Climate refugees are already a reality. In Syria, a climate-exacerbated drought led to the migration of thousands of farmers into cities. This largely drove that country's revolution and mass migration. In the Pacific, the island state of Kiribati is buying land in Fiji to move people there when the seas swallow their country. In Alaska, coastal residents are moving inland as rising waves are battering their homes. This is just the beginning. New research from the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Germany and the Cyprus Institute in Nicosia shows that vast swaths of the Middle East and North Africa will become uninhabitable by 2050. The region is home to about 500-million people. Average daily temperatures regularly exceed 40\'b0C. This is hotter than it was half a century ago. Since 1970, the number of hot days \- 5\'b0C hotter than average \- has doubled. Persistent warming will accelerate the process. Jos Lelieveld, Max Planck's director, says: "In the future, climate in large parts of the Middle East and North Africa could change in such a manner that the very existence of its inhabitants is in jeopardy." In just 34 years, by 2050, the researchers calculate that hot days will reach 46\'b0C. These will happen five times more regularly than they do now. Heat waves \- three or more days of temperatures 5\'b0C hotter than average \- will happen 10 times more often than they do now. Whereas global warming will affect most places by raising their winter temperatures, in the Middle East and North Africa it will be worst in summer. This will mean no respite at night. The Max Planck team says that, in summer, night-time temperatures will not drop below 30\'b0C. The length of hot spells will also be extended. Between 1986 and 2005, it was hotter than average for an average of 16 days in a row. The team estimates that, by mid-century, that will stretch to 80 days a year. By 2100, it will be unusually hot for 118 days a year. If carbon emissions are not lowered, this could stretch to 200 days of unusual heat a year. Lelieveld says: "Prolonged heat waves and desert storms can render some regions uninhabitable, which will surely contribute to the pressure to migrate." In previous research, the team found that dust pollution in the atmosphere over Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Syria had increased by 70% since 2000. This was mainly the result of the increasing number \- and severity \- of droughts in the region. The intensity of all these scenarios will come down to decisions made by politicians. The Max Planck team used two climate scenarios in their work, both generated by the United Nations's climate change body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The first, the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5, assumes that carbon emissions will start to decrease by 2040. This is what countries signed up to achieve in agreeing to the COP21 Paris Agreement late last year. In this scenario, average temperatures across the whole region will increase by 4\'b0C this century. The second, RCP 8.5, envisages that countries will do nothing. This business-as-usual scenario will lead to average global temperatures increasing by 4\'b0C this century, but double that in the Middle East and North Africa. The Max Planck research is part of an increasing amount of data ringing alarm bells about the region. Last year, researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Loyola Marymount University said Gulf temperature increases would make the region uninhabitable. They focused on wet bulb temperatures \- the combined measure of temperature and humidity. Often referred to as mugginess, it's measured by wrapping a bulb thermometer in a moistened cloth. The highest temperature on this scale that a fit human can survive is 35\'b0C. That is equivalent to about 45\'b0C on a normal thermometer on a humid day. At this point, the body is unable to get rid of heat through sweat. People start to boil and dehydrate. The team said: "Beyond this, any exposure for more than six hours would probably be intolerable for even the fittest humans, resulting in hypothermia." For Gulf residents, this seems a likely future problem. Large parts are extremely hot and low-lying, which means constant humidity. Other areas will be slightly less affected, but still uninhabitable for anyone who is not fit. Mecca, where the Hajj takes place, would have a wet bulb temperature of 33\'b0C, according to the team. This would make the Hajj dangerous for people with health conditions, or those not at the peak of their physical ability. If carbon emissions are not lowered, the scientists warned that large parts of the Gulf and surrounding states would resemble the Afar desert of northern Ethiopia. The area averages 34\'b0C all year round. Summer temperatures are often higher than 50\'b0C. This is the future if carbon emissions are not dramatically lowered. \</doc>

The African Climate Reality Project says it's time for South Africa to look up and not down for its energy solutions... In an apparent state of conflict over its energy policies, South Africa flounders as a victim of load shedding in the grip of Eskom's continued reliance upon coal and now also must seriously review its 'intended nationally determined contribution' (INDC) and declare a commitment to reducing carbon pollution ahead of the climate change conference in Paris this December ( COP21 ). Role of consumer pressure Just as a huge defeat for 'big oil' was scored when Shell, in bowing to mounting opposition, pulled out of its controversial drilling operation in the Alaskan Arctic this past week, the indicators are that consumer pressure could really help bring about a universal review of how we derive our energy. Shell was 'surprised' and apparently caught off-guard by the force and scale of the opposition it met - and, meanwhile, the case for wind and solar energy is becoming ever more plausible and compelling. In the first six months of 2015, renewable energy contributed R4n worth of benefit in savings for SA (Source: CSIR). Six years ago, the price of wind-generated electricity cost a third of coal power (62c compared with 168c per kilowatt hour for coal). To build a wind farm, it costs half that required to develop a new coal power station and it only takes 18 months to establish a wind farm - Eskom's Medupi Power Station has been ten years in production and is still not operational. Job creation According to Greenpeace Africa, renewable energy will create around 80,000 jobs annually while coal will lose 10,000 jobs. To date, the solar industry alone has created 20,000 and is set to contribute an estimated R2.9bn to socio-economic development in rural regions over the next 20 years. Everyone knows that Eskom cannot cope with the country's energy demands and that its load shedding programme is having a crippling effect on the economy and causing widespread stress and discomfort to all South Africans. The African Climate Reality Project (ACRP), which works closely with the Energy Centre of the CSIR, says that wind and sun are far more valuable as inexhaustible resources than the minerals we've been digging up out of the ground for energy. South Africa has enough wind potential alone to generate more than South Africa's current energy needs, according to a study conducted by the CSIR's Energy Centre. And wind has already protected us from shedding; wind energy helped to avoid more than 200 hours of load shedding in the first six months of 2015 alone, an equivalent value of R1.5bn. Added to this is the fact that wind energy saved Eskom around R300m in expenditure on diesel and coal during the same period. High potential for solar Most regions in South Africa receive more than 2,500KW hours of sun energy per square metre per year, making the country's potential for solar energy one of the highest in the world. But SA is only tenth on the chart of countries that are effectively harnessing the sun's energy. Germany's at the top of the list with 1.5 million solar plants (small to large rooftop and utility scale) that yield an installed capacity of 40GW; whereas SA produces 1GW of installed utility scale solar capacity. Solar is also an ideal solution for delivering power to the 15% of South Africans without access to electricity. By providing homes, townships and entrepreneurs with small, portable solar panels and solar kits, South Africa could be empowering people with affordable electricity right now. Electricity insecurity Eskom currently generates 95% of South Africa's electricity. Its plants house technology that will continue to age, and in turn increase the risk, frequency and severity of load shedding. Load shedding is a symptom of larger environmental and economic issues. In South Africa, electricity insecurity is our daily reality, and it's paralysing our economy. One former Eskom advisor has predicted that load shedding will occur until 2023. Patching up old plants is just a temporary fix, tantamount to slapping a plaster over a gaping wound. Meanwhile, South Africa's power sector is responsible for nearly half the country's carbon emissions because of its reliance on coal. Phasing out unsustainable coal plants and replacing them with wind, solar and other clean energy technology has to be the best way for South Africa to step into the light of a low-carbon energy future, one that provides clean, affordable energy for all South Africans and protects the environment and climate for future generations. South Africa needs and deserves an energy revolution. \</doc>

Dubai is rapidly transforming into becoming one of the smartest digital cities in the world, according to Cisco's president of Smart+Connected Communities Anil Menon, pictured here with Inbar Lasser-Raab, VP for products & solutions marketing. Africa is not innovating as fast as the rest of the world when it comes to the Internet of things (IOT), according to Inbar Lasser-Raab, VP for products & solutions marketing for Cisco. She was speaking at a press briefing at Cisco's third annual Internet of Things World Forum (IoTWF), currently taking place in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. "We are seeing less in Africa [in terms of IOT] than in other parts of the world, but there could be huge potential in areas like mining and agriculture there is less innovation coming from there, but there are some applications from other parts of the world that are starting to work for Africa," she says. Cisco unveiled its smart city evolutions in five global cities, but none are in Africa. Dubai is being hyped as one of the most technologically advanced cities in the world, and Cisco is this year showcasing more than 20 digital city and connected industry solution deployments in the city. This is more than twice as many solutions as were featured at the 2014 IoTWF event in Chicago in the US. "As host to the 2015 IoTWF, Dubai is rapidly transforming into becoming one of the smartest digital cities in the world, connecting the unconnected through the power of intelligent networks," according to Anil Menon, president of Smart+Connected Communities at Cisco. Other than Dubai, cities that have already begun using a single digital data platform for managing their urban services include Kansas City in the US, Adelaide in Australia, Hamburg in Germany and Bangalore in India. The deployments featured in Dubai include IOT services such as connected parking, connected lighting and waste management, alongside other vertical industries. In Dubai's command and control centre, nearly all the solutions are integrated into a digital platform. The digital platform can aggregate data from various sensors, solutions, and partner applications; conduct advanced data analytics; and support a wide spectrum of urban services. "Beyond Dubai, utilising the digital platform in conjunction with the portfolio of Smart+Connected Communities solutions are helping cities to achieve their digital transformation goals. For instance, a number of cities have made strides in reaching their COP21 climate goals by reducing traffic, encouraging greater use of public transit and streamlining the delivery of services to citizens," says Cisco. In Africa, Cisco says it's about finding local partners who understand African businesses to make IOT a reality. Cisco does, however, see SA as a strong potential market for IOT, as well as Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria and Botswana. "As we move into this new digital era, organisations across both the private and public sectors are already beginning to rethink how they will approach the shift in infrastructures, processes and outcomes on a grand scale. It is likely to disrupt every area of society and redefine sustainability," says Cisco. Smart cities speak out The Dubai Design District (d3) says it is proud to be showcasing some of the real-time smart initiatives that are being deployed in the district. "Our aim is to select and implement those smart solutions that will bring significant benefits to business partners, visitors and management and, importantly, to Dubai as a smart city," says Mohammad Saeed Al Shehhi, COO for d3. "Through these unique and technologically enhanced initiatives, d3's creative tenants will benefit by saving on utility consumption, they will receive an enriched customer experience, improved safety standards, and they will be able to tap into effective, real-time data analytics that help drive their business forward." Rama NS, CEO of Bangalore's Electronic City Industries Association (ELCIA), says data from the city's digital platform for lighting and parking has helped them understand the energy consumed by public street lighting as well as the usage of on-street parking at the ELCIA campus. "We are now beginning to socialise this data with other sensor devices/applications development companies in ELCIA so that they can manufacture, test and deploy new types of sensors and applications in the Living Lab that has been set up in partnership with Cisco." "Our Smart City pilots will help us demonstrate the value of a sensor-connected infrastructure to deliver new and improved citizen experiences. We want to empower and engage our residents, to deliver new city experiences, to share and optimise our city data to support new business development and entrepreneurs, and to attract new investment into the city," according to Jane Booth, GM for city and organisational development for the Adelaide City Council. The Hamburg Port Authority's CIO, Sebastian Saxe, also believes a holistic model will help businesses in his city without interfering with citizens' experiences. "To create a model where we are able to do this without negatively impacting the citizens and the city itself is our goal."

South Africa currently emits over half a billion tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere every year. The emissions make it the 12th highest emitter per person in the world. These trap heat and warm the planet. That warming is set to unwind the ecosystems required for life on Earth.In an attempt to mitigate that, world governments are putting together their plans to lower carbon emissions and deal with climate change. These Intended Nationally Determined Contributions will be submitted before the COP 21 climate change meeting in Paris next month. These will then be put together in order to create a roadmap for lowered emissions. The 2\'c2\'b0C threshold At the heart of this process is a recognition by the UN body guiding the COP negotiations - the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - that average global temperatures should not increase by more than 2\'c2\'b0C.According to its research, any increase above this will be "severe, pervasive and irreversible".The UN's latest comprehensive release on climate change, "Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability", said climate change was already being acutely felt in Africa. "African ecosystems are already being impacted by climate change, and the future impacts are expected to be substantial."Even with substantial action taken to reduce carbon emissions, the report said the continent's interior would be up to 6\'c2\'b0C by the end of this century. Local data shows that South Africa's interior is nearly a degree hotter than a century ago. As a result, the African country bloc negotiating ahead of Paris has said the goal has to be to keep average global temperature increases below 1.5\'c2\'b0C this century. South Africa is part of this bloc. But influential climate research group Climate Action Tracker said this week that South Africa's plans to lower emissions were "inadequate". Not cutting it The country's intended contribution gives a benchmark target of keeping emissions between 398 and 614-million tonnes of carbon dioxide. The group said this would mean South Africa's emissions would be between 20% and 82% higher than 1990, even if it did all the work that it promised to do. This year has become symbolic in pledges, with numerous countries promising to lower their overall emissions by certain percentages below their 1990 levels.In its contribution, the European Union put forward a binding goal for its members states to collectively reduce emissions by 40% below their 1990 level, by 2030. Last week India said it would cut its carbon emissions per unit of GDP by a third by 2030. But South Africa's pledge was not consistent with the global goal of limiting global warming below 2\'c2\'b0C, according to the carbon tracking group. "If most other countries were to follow South Africa's approach, global warming would exceed 3-4\'c2\'b0C."At the 2009 Copenhagen climate conference, South Africa said it would reduce its emissions by 42% below business-as-usual levels by 2025. The majority of this would come from decommissioning old coal-fired power stations and building renewable and nuclear energy plants. Without implementing its intended contribution - and only through plans currently on the books - the group said South Africa would increase its emissions by 141% on 1990 levels by 2025. \</doc>

National Treasury has published the draft Carbon Tax Bill for public comment. This follows the announcement made by Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene in the 2015 budget. Cabinet approved the publication of the bill and noted that the carbon tax forms an integral part of the system for implementing government policy on climate change as outlined in the 2011 National Climate Change Response Policy (NCCRP) and the National Development Plan (NDP). South Africa has committed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions below business as usual by 34% by 2020 and 42% by 2025. The country has also committed to adaptation measures, as outlined in the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) recently submitted to the United Nations for the upcoming Conference of the Parties ( COP ) 21 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris. The carbon tax seeks to price carbon by obliging the polluter to internalise the external costs of emitting carbon and contribute towards addressing the harm caused by such pollution. The Draft Carbon Tax Bill marks the next step in the consultation process conducted over the past five years, starting with the 2010 discussion paper on carbon tax, the 2013 Carbon Tax Policy Paper and the 2014 Carbon Offsets Paper, said Treasury in a statement on Monday. The draft takes into account comments received in writing, from meetings and workshops and from a wide range of stakeholders including business, NGOs, academia, civil society and labour. The publication of the Draft Carbon Tax Bill provides an opportunity for further comments on the design and technical details of the carbon tax policy and administration. It should be noted that the final tax rate, exemptions and the actual date of implementation will be determined by the Minister of Finance through the annual Budget process. The carbon tax will be implemented together with complementary measures like a reduction in the electricity levy and other measures to recycle revenue. Stakeholders are invited to provide comments on the environmental and socio-economic impact of the carbon tax (taking into account revenue recycling measures), as well as the design and legal wording of the Bill. National Treasury said a revised bill incorporating comments received will thereafter be submitted to Cabinet for approval for tabling in Parliament. Treasury said the impact of carbon tax on the economy can only be assessed when taking into account both the direct impact of the tax, as well as the way the resulting revenue is spent. Hence, to assess the impact of the tax, the revenue recycling measures must be taken into account. The carbon tax will assist in reducing GHG emissions and ensure that South Africa is ready and better prepared to deal with future climate risks and challenges and also be in a position to take advantage of new investment opportunities. It further said that the tax aims to change the behaviour of firms, incentivising them to shift towards cleaner technology when replacing/renewing machinery, technology or processes. The draft bill is available on the National Treasury website: HYPERLINK http://www.treasury.gov.za www.treasury.gov.za Written comments should be submitted to Dr Memory Machingambi at HYPERLINK mailto:Memory.Machingambi@treasury.gov.za Memory.Machingambi@treasury.gov.za \</doc>

SOUTH Africa has experienced what has been a very dry year. The recent heatwave in Gauteng and drought in KwaZulu-Natal and the Free State, both now declared disaster zones, have seemingly taken environmental concerns a notch up the ladder in our country's newsrooms. Depending on where one is sitting or the lens through which these concerns are viewed, we may be grateful that access to water and food are issues that are now part of the national conversation, or we may be concerned that it's only when the problem reaches such proportions that we start|talking. The question is: why have these not been previously given the amount of attention that they are receiving now? To put this into context, the water shortage issue has been going on for years in some communities, mainly due to service delivery, infrastructure issues and irregular rain patterns. A relevant example, which is just one of the cases, is that of the community of Letlhabile in Madibeng (North West) which only started having running water this year after 10 years of continuous struggle. One can only imagine how this community felt when they saw the water situation only now starting to be a part of the national conversation on a bigger scale. As a climate change campaign, one of the main challenges 350 Africa faces is the perception of the impacts of climate change as something for the future. In addition to this, is the perpetuation of climate change denialism. It is important to note, however, that the drought we are currently experiencing in the country may not be a random nor a separate trend from the global experience, certainly in Africa. The situation has implications beyond just the amount of water available in rivers, reservoirs and dams. Al Jazeera reported that South Africa has failed to produce enough maize to export to neighbouring Botswana and Swaziland. This is in addition to reports in July that the drought in Botswana would lead to a severe food shortage. Not only does this reflect the water-food nexus but also the regional nature of the crisis. We also see this through the planned and |current discussions between South Africa, |Zimbabwe and Zambia about the diversion of |the Zambezi River for access to water and electricity production. Again, the impacts are mainly felt by the poor, whose struggles - even though they are the majority - seldom takes centre stage. The South African heatwave did not compare with that which Egypt experienced which caused the deaths of more than 90 people in August. We are not comparing extreme weather conditions in different parts of the continent and the world but really focusing on bringing the magnitude of the problem to the fore and the centre of debate. 350 Africa has firmly stated that the fight against climate change and access to resources, like food and water, is about human rights and social justice, and how the impacts of climate change are hitting the poor the hardest and will continue to do so. The 21st session of the Conference of Parties ( COP21 ) is currently under way. The parties are talking about climate change under the banner of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Even after 20 sessions, civil society organisations remain pessimistic about the prospect of a binding agreement, and with good cause. In the meantime, poor people continue to suffer the impacts of climate change. It is worth bearing in mind that whatever result comes out of the meetings in Paris, the facts on the ground persist: floods in Mozambique and Malawi displacing hundreds of people; and food shortages linked to water in Ethiopia, Botswana, Kenya and, now, South Africa, among many |other countries. Linked to the struggle of farmers, different communities in KwaZulu-Natal have already had to manage for hours on end without water. As it is, 2.7 million households are facing water shortages. Anyone who understands what many call "bread and butter" issues as they affect the poor majority would appreciate what such a sharp increase in the price of staples like mealie meal and bread means. Climate change will exacerbate these in ways that are unthinkable. No society can be stable if the vast majority of the country is hungry and without water. Even when South Africa had the highest GDP in Africa, we also had the highest inequality. Looked at from this lens, two things stand out: we should take heed of the challenges that poor people are facing, not only because these are human challenges but also because our society will never be stable when the majority of citizens are hungry. The urgency of a response to curb carbon emissions, the pollution of water systems and air quality and climate change is thus not just about the carbon concentration in the atmosphere but about fostering a stable existence. Even for the wealthy in unequal societies like ours. l Khomotso Ntuli is a member of 350 Africa, a grassroots movement which focuses on solving the climate crisis. \</doc>

Releasing his long-awaited encyclical on "care for our common home", Pope Francis said on Thursday that the world needs to transform its economics, politics and the way people live in order to tackle climate change and environmental degradation. Francis likened the earth to a sister, "With whom we share life." It sustained life and gave humanity the basis for its growth. But in return humans have abused the relationship, he said. "We have come to see ourselves as her lords and masters, entitled to plunder her at will."Quoting at length from the Bible, the Argentinian said humans had forgotten that "that we ourselves are dust of the earth". The economic system that existed today accelerated the separation of humanity from nature -- with the subsequent destruction of natural systems being a direct result. "Our very bodies are made up of her elements, we breathe her air and we receive life and refreshment from her waters."This abuse of the planet was partially down to Christians misinterpreting the religion's key readings. He said believers "must forcefully reject the notion that our being created in God's image and given dominion over the earth justifies absolute domination over other creatures".His strongest criticism was for the "throwaway culture of today" and for the rich, who ran corporations that exploited natural resources for profit.The encyclical Laudato Si runs to nearly 200 pages and covers everything from climate change to biodiversity loss and the dangers of over consumption. It is the first one entirely dedicated by a pope to environmental issues. In each section it critiques the current economic reality, while offering solutions. It was leaked ealier this week to the Italian press.It will be sent to churches and bishops throughout the 1.2-billion member Catholic community. Francis included a handwritten note asking priests to pray with their congregations for action on climate change and environmental degradation.Lesser of two evilsHis most powerful request was for fossil fuels "to be progressively replaced without delay". But while the technology to develop renewable energy was still growing and adapting, he said it was acceptable for developers to choose "the lesser of two evils" -- natural gas.He also warned that those profiting from damaging the environment could not be trusted to look after it. "Is it realistic to hope that those who are obsessed with maximising profits will stop to reflect on the environmental damage which they will leave behind for future generations?"The encyclical is being seen by climate change activists as a critical move ahead of the November climate change talks in Paris at COP21 . A global agreement to lower carbon emissions is supposed to be signed at the meeting, although it is expected to be weak and not ambitious enough to keep global temperature increases below 2\'c2\'b0C. Francis was however stinging in his questioning of the international political responses to climate change. "There are too many special interests, and economic interests easily end up trumping the common good and manipulating information so that their own plans will not be affected."Christiana Figueres, the UN's climate chief, said the encyclical underscored the moral imperative for urgent action on climate change. "This clarion call should guide the world towards a strong and durable universal climate agreement in Paris at the end of this year. Coupled with the economic imperative, the moral imperative leaves no doubt that we must act on climate change now."'I don't get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinal or my pope'Cutting to the heart of the most contentious issue in the ongoing climate change negotiations, Francis placed the blame for much of the current warming on rich nations. This deadlock has stood through two decades of negotiations, with the developing world demanding that historical polluters pay for climate adaptation and damage. That money has not been forthcoming. "The warming caused by huge consumption on the part of some rich countries has repercussions on the poorest areas of the world, especially Africa, where a rise in temperature, together with drought, has proved devastating for farming."His comments are being keenly received in nations that exploit their coal reserves, and also have strong Catholic populations. Francis is due to visit the United States in September and address Congress -- where Republican presidential nominees such as Jeb Bush have to balance their religion with their pro-coal views. Speaking about the encyclical on Wednesday, Bush said, "I hope I'm not going to get castigated for saying this by my priest back home, but I don't get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinal or my pope."Nicholas Stern, an economist and author of the influential Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, said; "Moral leadership on climate change from the Pope is particularly important because of the failure of many heads of state and government around the world to show political leadership."If action is not taken to tackle climate change, the Pope warned of dire consequences; "If present trends continue, this century may well witness extraordinary climate change and an unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequences for all of us." \</doc>

Failing to concentrate at work? Turning to your cellphone to add up a simple sum? Unable to think beyond the next cup of stimulant-laden coffee? If you're nodding your head, then maybe you're another victim of deadly carbon dioxide. The colourless and odourless gas is an unusual villain. For much of human history, it has been a friend. Elevated levels 10?000 years ago sparked the agricultural revolution and modern-day civilisation. Humans evolved to process concentrations of around 200 parts per million. But a few centuries ago the world economy exploded, thanks to the digging up and burning of fossil fuels. This spewed carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Average ambient levels now hover at around 400 parts per million. That concentration of particles traps heat and warms the planet - leading to most carbon-related research looking at its effect on global warming. But new research from Harvard University shows that this dramatic rise in CO2 is eating away at our cognitive ability, especially in closed environments, such as offices. Here levels can reach 3 000 parts per million - lowering cognitive ability by at least 21%. This relatively new research focus came to its first definitive finding in 2012, courtesy of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the United States. The study - Is Carbon Dioxide an Indoor Pollutant? Direct Effects of Low-to-Moderate Carbon Dioxide Concentrations on Human Decision-making Performance - found CO2 levels in cities were on average 100 parts per million higher than the global average. In specific areas, such as schools, these levels could rocket up to 3 000 parts per million. In published double-blind tests, the laboratory found increased CO2 concentrations led to "statistically significant and meaningful reductions in decision-making performance". The findings were backed up by research by Harvard University's healthy building and environmental health and human habitation units, published last month in the peer-reviewed Environmental Health Perspectives journal. Focusing on CO2 levels in workspaces and homes, the team put numbers to the reduction in cognitive functioning: for every 400 parts per million extra CO2, a person's cognitive scores drop by 21%. These scores include basic cognitive functioning, crisis response, information usage and the ability to think long-term and plan. No similar research appears to have been carried out in South Africa but an increasing amount is being done overseas. Nasa takes the findings as fact, based on its own observations at the International Space Station. Early in its operation, the space administration found astronauts were adversely affected when CO2 levels in the station increased. Nasa then limited CO2 levels and started researching the effects of increased CO2 concentrations, which are continually rising. The World Meteorological Association says 2015 will be the first year where global CO2 levels are consistently over the 400 parts per million mark. This was symbolically reached at one research station in the Pacific earlier this year. Now that level is the norm. To avert the climate change effect of these emissions - more heat trapped, leading to a warming planet - negotiators will meet at COP21 in Paris later this month to hammer out an agreement to lower emissions. Now the negotiators will have a public health argument to support their efforts, if they can concentrate in the cramped negotiating offices. See Presenteeism is the new office plagueLead dims people's potential Much like excess carbon dioxide concentrations, lead poisoning comes from an invisible source and steals people's futures. For much of the 1900s, that source was the extra lead added to petrol to give cars more power. South Africa's fuels have had among the highest levels of lead in the world. In the early 1990s many countries started banning lead in petrol and myriad other places. In seven of these countries research shows that this resulted in a dramatic dip in violent crime 23 years after lead was phased out. Tracing this anomaly led researchers to lead. One report from the United States found that exposure to lead results in a loss in IQ points - which then set people back and pushed them into crime to make ends meet. The violence of the crime was exacerbated by that exposure. Summarising the work, the US investigative publication Mother Jones found that: "Massive lead exposure among children in the post-war era led to larger numbers of violent crimes in the 1960s and beyond." The startling effect of lead had long been hidden because it did not affect many middle-class children, who had good schools and a support system to help them overcome it. In poor children, other factors such as a poor diet and education were blamed for problems. But recent research shows that lead poisoning has been instrumental in hampering the prospects of children already on the edge. This situation is particularly acute in South Africa. The apartheid regime moved people into areas where there was little chance for a healthy environment - downwind of mines and industrial areas. This ensured that environmental factors, such as carbon emissions and lead exposure, add to other stresses and rob people of their potential. Speaking to the Mail & Guardian last year, Angela Mathee, director of the Medical Research Council's environmental health research unit, said lead poisoning and other environmental pollutants had the effect of dampening the potential of entire communities. "At a community level, the bell curve of IQ gets shifted to the left," she said. "At the lower end, there is an increased requirement for remedial education." But this was rarely available; instead, the number of "bright sparks, leaders, scientists and entrepreneurs" was greatly reduced in these areas. - Sipho Kings \</doc>

At the invitation of Her Excellency, Ms Asa Romson, Deputy Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Sweden, His Excellency the Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, visited Sweden on the occasion of the 9th session of the Bi-national Commission (BNC) between South Africa and Sweden from 19 - 20 October 2015 in Stockholm. The two Principals were accompanied by delegations of Ministers, Deputy Ministers and Senior Officials. On the margins of the BNC, the Co-Chairs also held bilateral discussions on issues of mutual interest at the bilateral and multilateral levels. At a bilateral level, discussions focused on trade and investment, skills development and training as well as job creation among others. At a multilateral level, discussions included co-operation in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, reform of Global Governance institutions, UN and AU peace-building efforts and social cohesion. The meeting reaffirmed the historic ties of friendship and solidarity between South Africa and Sweden, which date back to the struggle for peace, democracy and justice in South Africa. The unequivocal support that the Swedish people gave to the people of South Africa laid a firm foundation for future co-operation between the two countries The BNC reviewed and welcomed progress made since the 8th session of the BNC which took place in 2013 in Pretoria. The BNC also agreed to establish a new Committee on Environment, Water and Energy to cover new areas of co-operation of particular significance for sustainable development. At the conclusion of the two days of consultations, the Co-Chairs received and welcomed progress reports from the four Committees of the BNC, namely: Political Affairs, Economic Affairs, Science and Technology Affairs, and Environment, Water and Energy Affairs. The Political Affairs Committee discussed the bilateral relationship as well as selected Foreign Policy concerns of mutual interest. The Committee discussed a number of regional and global issues of mutual interest, including DRC, Burundi, the Horn of Africa, Liberia, Ukraine, Syria and Palestine. The importance of upholding the principles of international law, based on the centrality of the UN Charter and including the principle of territorial integrity was underlined in the discussions. It agreed on the desirability to improve cooperation between the UN and the AU particularly within the peace keeping and peace building fields as reflected in UN Review reports. Sweden and South Africa will work jointly to strengthen inclusive and sustainable peace building by promoting, amongst others, cooperation between women mediation networks as well as training of female mediators The BNC took note of the success of the Swedish-sponsored full scholarship programme and welcomed the announcement of the extension of the programme until 2021. The programme provides opportunity for study at a post graduate level for South African students at Swedish tertiary institutions in a wide range of fields. Further efforts will be made to deepen and develop economic relations, not least in the area of trade and investments. Strategic areas include, among others, energy, ICT, mining and transport infrastructure. Focus will be given to ensuring a conducive and predictable investment climate. It was also agreed to strengthen collaboration in broadband policy framework development and rollout priority areas, including in ICT capacity building, SMME incubation and inclusion thereof in the value chains, as well as data security and e-learning strategies. The Committee on Science and Technology noted the significant progress on scientific relations between the two countries with appreciation. It highlighted an agreement between the South African National Research Foundation and the Swedish Foundation for International Cooperation in Research and Higher Education which has already resulted in a research call with 103 applications received. An adjudication process of these research applications is currently underway. Sweden and South Africa are committed to contribute towards a positive conclusion of COP21 in Paris in December 2015 and intend to intensify cooperation on sustainable development. The Committee on Environment, Water and Energy also agreed to continue collaboration on a broad range of issues including chemicals and waste, water resource management, and on the information platforms Water and Climate Change Information for Africa (WACCA) and Drought Early Warning Detection (DEWD). The Committee also expressed willingness to develop cooperation on energy. At the closing ceremony of the BNC, a Memorandum of Understanding on Water Resources Management, and a Letter of Intent on Environmental Protection and Climate Change were signed, and the joint intent to finalise a Memorandum of Understanding in the field of Energy was expressed. These instruments will enable a broadened cooperation on areas contributing to sustainable development, including in the Blue Economy, and underscore the importance of job creation as a priority for both South Africa and Sweden. In addition, a Business Forum of South African and Swedish business leaders met during the BNC, to explore the possibilities of future collaboration with particular focus on ICT, mining and energy. The two sides agreed to further pursue trade and investment relations, within the overall thrust of plans to grow a more inclusive economy. A seminar on the importance of local partnerships was also held during the BNC. There are currently thirteen active partnerships between South African and Swedish local authorities, further deepening people-to-people contact between the two countries. A seminar on the New Climate Economy facilitated discussion on the economic potential of climate change and energy policies. At the conclusion of the BNC, His Excellency Deputy President Ramaphosa expressed his sincere appreciation and gratitude to the Swedish government for the excellent arrangements and hospitality extended to him and the South African delegation. In conclusion, the Co-Chairs agreed that the 10th Session of the South Africa - Sweden BNC would convene in South Africa during the second half of 2017, on a date to be mutually determined through diplomatic channels. \</doc>

CHINA continues to burn more coal than the rest of the world combined. India plans to double its annual coal production by 2020. It is estimated that more than 2 000 new coal-fired power stations are under construction worldwide. Facts like these make the cheers greeting the Paris climate treaty seem like so much hot air. Indeed, some climate alarmists already say the treaty is not worth its paper. They wanted it to be legally binding with harsh penalties attached - moral suasion will not cut it. Cynical observers note the Paris treaty's only achievement is the creation of yet another UN body that will fly more of its bureaucrats around the world to check on which countries have been naughty and slap their wrists. Diplomatic treacle awaits these latter-day puritans. A thankless task awaits them. But the stress will no doubt be soothed by their whopping UN salaries. The truth is that the Paris negotiations reached consensus only because none of it is legally binding. The result is that the treaty has more than enough wriggle room. However, as China is the world's second-biggest economy, it is above all what China does about its emissions that will be critical. So far, there is little evidence that it shares the climate change lobby's obsession with carbon dioxide (CO2). National interests Western public opinion, and its free press, will not sway China's leaders either. Street theatre involving clever masks and witty placards are not going to do it either. For China, the national interests always come first. Pleas to reduce CO2 emissions are unlikely to have much impact on a Chinese government that must prioritise economic growth. So what is China's stance on saving the world from the predicted climate Armageddon, and its "Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)" to the fight against it? The NDC is how the UN managed to get China to COP21 because it allows each country to set its own emission targets. The result is that it all comes down to interpretation. The history of the past two decades of UN climate conferences is thin on evidence of real progress. Only the Kyoto "Agreement" was binding, but the US refused to ratify it, making its worthless. The fact that China never signed it in the first place made the agreement worth even less. However, 38 developed countries signed up. As always, and clearly in the hope of more financial aid. Some suspected it was in the expectation of increased financial aid rather than concern for the climate. China never signed. The Paris treaty last year was different. Everyone took the pledge. It was progress of a sort but time will tell if developing countries (and China regards itself as leader of the group) will turn their pledges into action. They have now made it clear that any action they take will depend on delivery of substantial amounts of new Western cash. Coal consumption Available figures suggest China's coal consumption and the emissions that go with it will rise for at least the next decade if China is to grow. Even a necessary ban on coal and wood stoves in the cities will not make a dent in CO2 emissions. China does not see CO2 as the bogeyman. It is more concerned with smog, and a groundswell of complaints from millions of its citizens forced to breathe it every day. Smog is visible; it stinks, and is a serious health risk. It makes perfect sense to solve the smog problem before worrying about CO2, especially as every year 500 000 Chinese die from smog inhalation. The argument of anti-CO2 enthusiasts that China's smog problem will improve if it cuts invisible CO2 emissions does not have the popular appeal of returning clear skies to Chinese cities - as Europe and America have done. This is also the view of Patricia Adams, an academic with impeccable environmental credentials. She is the executive director of Probe International, a Canadian non-governmental organisation that has been involved in the Chinese environmental movement, and founder of the World Rainforest Movement and the International Rivers Network. In her recent study, "Why Beijing will resist demands for abatement", published by the Global Warming Policy Foundation, she points out that cutting CO2 emissions relies on prohibitively expensive technology that does not work very well. In contrast, reducing nitrous oxide and sulphur dioxide, which are key components of smog, is cheaper, more efficient and uses proven technology. In other words, China could either retrofit scrubbers to coal-fired power station chimneys to emit less nitrous oxide and sulphur dioxide, or forfeit economic growth by trying to eliminate a colourless gas we all breathe out continuously throughout the day. China's leadership knows that what it says to the climate change (um...community) about cutting CO2 emissions does not commit it to anything. Economics always trumps an unproven theory. The simple fact is that cutting CO2 emissions and economic growth are incompatible. The Chinese know it, whatever they said and signed in Paris. And what China does, other developing country will copy. The repost of the latter to any UN CO2 auditors may well turn out to be, "Show us the money first". Maybe, possibly, sooner rather than later, one hopes, developing countries will realise that if the climate is changing, the cause it is more likely to be the Sun rather than man's puny efforts, and their hopes of getting huge amounts of money to avoid what cannot be avoided, will be dashed.

BD Insights. Sandton: The New Business Hub IN BRIEF Developer has big plans for Benmore ON THE UP Valued at about R1.2bn, Acsiopolis is Acsion Properties' largest residential project to date. Located in Benmore, Sandton, it is a 20-storey mixed-use development scheduled for completion in April 2018. The plan includes about 36,000m2 of executive apartments, 5,000m2 will be used for retail and 1,000 m2 will be set aside for office space. There will be six levels of parking. Empty Shop is open for donations MAKE A DIFFERENCE For the second consecutive year, Sandton City is hosting the charity store, The Empty Shop, until Monday. Part of a global corporate social investment initiative, The Empty Shop invites donations of clothing, toys and books in good condition. The proceeds will go to Sandton City's 2015 beneficiary, the Tomorrow Trust. Four tons of clothing were collected for Hospice Wits in 2014, which translated to about R640,000. Clothing collected by The Empty Shop in 2014 was sold on from the Hospice Wits charity shop. Madiba shirts materialise BEST DRESSED A new Presidential Store opens in Nelson Mandela Square today, bringing & Madiba shirts& to Sandton for the first time. The Presidential brand was founded in 1994 when designer Desr\'e9 Buirski gave former President Nelson Mandela a batik & Fish Shirt& as a gift two days before his inauguration as president of SA. She went on to make more than 150 shirts for Mandela. Pointsmen to help ease traffic DIRECTION Outsurance-sponsored pointsmen are to help ease morning and afternoon congestion on Sandton's Grayston Drive. This came about after employees at Rand Merchant Bank and Merchant Place approached Traffic Freeflow, which manages the Outsurance pointsmen project, to help improve traffic flow in the area earlier this year. After analysing traffic patterns, Traffic Freeflow identified Grayston from the M1 (pilot phase), Rivonia to/from Morningside, William Nichol/Sandton to/from Bryanston and Rivonia to/from Illovo as routes requiring urgent managing. Outsurance will fund a pilot phase and full implementation of all four phases plan are dependent on the results of this and the realisation of additional sponsorship from Sandton's corporate community. Swedish shopping frenzy EXPANSION Swedish retailer H& M opened its second South African outlet when it welcomed customers to the 2,700m2 store in Sandton City last Saturday. Fans began queuing for the opening 24 hours prior. Those in the queue, which eventually included more than 1,200 people, received wristbands and goodie bags. The first H& M store opened at Cape Town's V& A Waterfront earlier this year. The opening marks the first of several Gauteng-based H& M stores with outlets in the Mall of the South, Clearwater and the new Mall of Africa due to open within the first part of next year. Say cheers to Winelands in Jozi TASTY Five of Stellenbosch's finest chefs will team up with prominent wine makers from the area to provide Johannesburg with some fine food and wine in Hyde Park on November 25. Sanlam Private Wealth and the Stellenbosch Wine Routes are behind Stellenbosch at Summer Place. The event will also provide a rare viewing of art pieces from the extensive Sanlam art collection. Talking the talk about mobility DECLARATION The EcoMobility World Dialogues, which took place at the IDC Conference Centre in Sandton in October, was addressed by 47 speakers from more than 20 countries and was attended by about 500 local government leaders, experts and practitioners. The event resulted in the creation of the Johannesburg Declaration of EcoMobility in Cities which, after being endorsed by cities and other international organisations, will be taken forward to the upcoming climate talks at UN-Climate Summit ( COP 21 ) in Paris in December. The declaration can be accessed on the website www.ecomobility.org. \</doc>

THERE have been several significant developments in relation to sustainable development and development co-operation at a multilateral level this year. On July 5, the Third International Conference on Financing for Development agreed on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. And on September 25, UN member states at summit level adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The 2030 Agenda establishes a set of global priorities to help eradicate extreme poverty and shift all countries toward inclusive, sustainable development. Later this month the 21st Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 21 ) will convene in Paris. All these events are interrelated. They seek sustainable solutions to the development challenges that confront all nations. Persistent high levels of chronic poverty, unemployment, marginalisation and inequality confront, and must be addressed by, all nations. The 2030 Agenda sets global priorities to help eradicate extreme poverty and move all countries toward inclusive and sustainable development. The Sustainable Development Goals entail 17 goals and 169 targets. These emphasise eradicating poverty in all its forms; an end to hunger; achieving food security and promoting sustainable agriculture. They also focus on providing inclusive and equitable quality education and to promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. They emphasise the need for continued, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, characterised by full and productive employment and decent work for all; and the reduction of inequality within and among countries. Realising these goals will require co-ordination and multiple stakeholder collaboration. Nations and governments will have to find new, innovative and unconventional ways of doing things. Some initiatives that could be explored in support will be the promotion of Open Government as an aspect of South-South co-operation as well as a programme for support in Triangular Co-operation. An important development on the sidelines in September was the ministerial level meeting of Open Government Partnership steering committee members. This meeting resulted in the adoption of the Declaration on Open Government for the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The declaration on Sustainable Development Goals, endorsed by 40 Open Government countries, affirms the pivotal role that open government as an enabler of development plays in promoting accountable government that delivers services to its citizens. Therefore, countries from the South participating in the Open Government Partnership should prioritise learning from each other and also share technical expertise. An example of this will be in utilising open data portals for citizen engagement and policy decisions in environmental management. The Group of 77 is the largest group of member states within the UN. It is a vehicle for countries of the South to promote their collective economic interests and enhance their joint negotiating capacity on all major international economic issues within the UN, and promote south-south co-operation for development. However, this should be underlined by respect for national sovereignty, national ownership and|independence, equality, non-conditionality, non-interference in domestic matters and mutual benefit. Current efforts such as the Brics Bank, Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, the South-South Climate Co-operation Fund, the China-Africa Development Fund, as well as other global South initiatives (such as the New Partnership for Africa's Development (Nepad) and the AU's Agenda 2063) are drives South Africa is already a part of. South Africa will intensify and extend its co-operation with Global South countries by ensuring that the private sector and civil society play their role. There is a need to secure commitments from the private sector to take advantage of new opportunities brought about by new markets and technologies. Such a public-private partnership to accelerate the implementation of the goals must focus on creating decent work and respect for labour rights, achieving sustainable economic activity, addressing poverty, gender and economic inequality and combating corruption. l Dlodlo is deputy public service and administration minister. \</doc>

The human body has adapted to survive in extremely hot and harsh environments as a result of its ability to sweat more than that of any other species. It can also adapt to changes in this heat, as long as it remains dry. But research published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Climate Change this week looked at what happens when extreme temperature is combined with humidity. "Future temperature in southwest Asia projected to exceed a threshold for human adaptability" looked at the changes climate change will bring to the region's average wet bulb temperature. This is the combined measure of temperature and humidity - often casually referred to as mugginess - that is measured by wrapping a bulb thermometer in a moistened cloth. The researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Loyola Marymount University said that when temperatures stay below a wet bulb measure of 35\'c2\'b0C, a fit human body can survive the mix of humidity and temperature. But above that even the fittest people struggle to survive. By this system of measurement, the team equated a 35\'c2\'b0C wet bulb reading to the effect a dry temperature of more than 73\'c2\'b0C would have on the human body. At that temperature the human body cannot get rid of excess heat by sweating and starts to accumulate heat. "Beyond this, any exposure for more than six hours would probably be intolerable for even the fittest humans, resulting in hyperthermia." This finding was coupled with long-term climate modelling to find which parts of southwest Asia would be worst affected. The area has a perfect mix of extremely high temperatures and low-lying areas, which allows for heat and humidity. The worst affected countries are the Gulf states and parts of Iran, which produce the majority of the world's fossil fuel oil - a key driver of global warming. If business as usual continues and serious steps are not taken to curb carbon emissions, the researchers found that by 2070 the usual maximum temperature in Gulf cities would be 45\'c2\'b0C. This would regularly drive the wet bulb temperature above 35\'c2\'b0C, the researchers said. Slightly less affected areas include the areas of Saudi Arabia where the Hajj happens - Mecca and Jeddah. Here the wet bulb temperature would rise to 33\'c2\'b0C, which would nevertheless make the Hajj dangerous for people with health conditions and those not at the peak of their physical ability. "One of the rituals of Hajj - the day of Arafah - involves worshipping at the site outside Mecca from sunrise to sunset. In these kinds of conditions, it would be very hard to have outside rituals." Without mitigation to lower carbon emission globally, the scientists said large parts of the Gulf would resemble the desert of northern Afar. Sitting across the Red Sea in Ethiopia, the area has the highest average temperature ever recorded and summer temperatures are often higher than 50\'c2\'b0C. The worst affected groups will be those who cannot handle the heat and humidity. The researchers said that in Yemen, where the wet bulb temperature would regularly reach 33\'c2\'b0C, "climate change would possibly lead to premature death of the weakest - namely children and the elderly". A global climate change meeting at the end of November in Paris - the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as COP 21 - will attempt to stop this from happening. World governments will discuss a text that aims to ensure carbon emissions are lowered globally. \</doc>

CONFERENCES on sustainability risk being dismissed as mere talking shops. Nevertheless, several such events this year present at least four crucial opportunities to move the world towards|sustainable use of natural resources. But that requires political will and personal activism, backed by science. In the context of South Africa, that could scarcely be more important: it is a country that has unique flora and fauna that can provide a competitive economic advantage globally if|managed judiciously. But those species and systems are also pressured by climate change which can cause extreme weather. It alters habitats, imperils species and is linked directly to our food-, water- and energy-security. Those threats hit South Africa's poor first and hardest, those with the fewest choices or resources. South Africa doesn't operate in isolation in these matters. In the 23 years since the signing of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions has been mostly ineffective. Consequently, 2014 may have been the warmest year in recorded history, with concomitant destruction from extreme weather and |consequences such as droughts, floods, fires and heatwaves. We know that unsustainable activity can have impacts - often unexpected - far away. The rise of wealth and a consumer culture in one part of the world puts pressure on species in other parts, such as South Africa's rhino, as well as humble but ecologically important species such as abalone and pangolin. So we don't need to look far to see that we need urgently to reinvent our relationship with the natural systems that sustain us, locally and globally. From acid-mine drainage crisis in South Africa, to deadly pollution in China's cities and the |acidification of our oceans, we have a clear|mandate to act. We have compelling opportunities to do so. Earlier this month, world leaders met in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to chart reforms of the global financial system. The third UN conference on Financing for Development (Ffd) aims to make solid decisions on the future and how to finance it. It's an important opportunity to ensure that development takes cognisance of sustainability. In September they will meet again, in New York, to approve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to guide national and global policies to 2030. And in December leaders will assemble in Paris to adopt a global agreement to head off the growing dangers of human-induced climate change. But closer to home, in September, Durban will host the XIV World Forestry Congress (WFC), a crucial opportunity to ensure sustainable management of the lungs of the earth. Forests are essential to life on our planet, to mitigating and adapting to climate change, ensuring an adequate supply of fresh water, enhancing biodiversity and providing sustainable incomes and livelihoods, including food security. But they face unprecedented and unrelenting pressures. The WFC aims to help position forestry as an integral part of sustainable development at all|levels - regional, national, and global. It will also seek to identify and review major issues facing forests and forestry and propose technical, scientific and policy interventions to promote forest sustainability. Progress has been made in bringing seven percent of the world's forests under stewardship through credible certification, but clearly much work remains. The WFC is an opportunity for an open |forum in which the world's forestry community and partners from related sectors can debate |their knowledge, views and latest findings and establish and consolidate partnerships and |networks. It can create an inclusive dialogue for all key stakeholders, particularly youth, students,|professionals, women and local communities. Successful and fruitful forums like this will add important impetus to, for example, the UN|Climate Change Conference, COP21 , in Paris in December. Each event has its role and its role-players, and each must be seen in the context of global|concerns over ecological destruction. UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon recently announced his Road to Dignity report and called for "a universal and transformative agenda that places people and planet at the centre, is underpinned by human rights, and is supported by a global partnership". Sustainable use of natural resources provides business, government, civil society and ordinary citizens with the opportunity to ensure "some, for all, forever" rather than "all, for some, for now". That opportunity must be catalysed by conscious consumer demand, conscientious|business, and a committed and enabling|legislative environment. So we must drive home the message that sustainability isn't simply some middle-class indulgence. Successful environmental and conservation efforts must, by definition, be|community and people-centred. The conference in Durban in September represents an excellent opportunity for focusing the attention of media and their audiences. It is also a chance to address audiences beyond the|environmental sector. But for that to be achieved - before, during and beyond the conference - communications must be sustained and strategic to be effective and drive behavioural change. Humankind's ingenuity and appetites have contributed to environmental destruction and the loss of habitats and species. That same resourcefulness and energy can now drive the quest for sustainability. An example of where that's being done is the multinational Project Apollo, which aims to secure investment of 0.02 percent of GDP for development of cheap, clean electricity. The project derives its name from the Apollo Space Programme, which engaged America's brightest minds to achieve the seemingly|impossible: a man on the moon. Our viability as a species pivots on preserving the natural systems that sustain us, and on|finding the will and the way to do so. l Kim Carstensen is the global director general of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). \</doc>

The Earth's climate is changing and South Africa is vulnerable. Even as the leaders of the planet gather at the 21st United Nations Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) climate talks in Paris this week, it is ever clearer that some pain is inevitable.But there are steps we can take right now to protect ourselves against higher temperatures, rising sea levels and water scarcity. Here are eight that can mitigate the risks and harm - if we care to do so.1. EnergySouth Africa's dependence on coal is not sustainable - from the perspective of human health, carbon emissions and the fact that it is a fossil fuel. Steps need to be taken to move away from it or, at the very least, to introduce cleaner coal burning technologies.This is something a host of climate change specialists agree on. The price of fossil fuels will only increase, according to the International Energy Agency. Reserves will be harder to find and more expensive to bring to the surface. Conversely, renewable energy costs have dropped dramatically in the past five years. The agency adds that two thirds of all existing fossil fuels must stay in the ground for dangerous climate change to be avoided.Professor Jasper Knight, of the University of the Witwatersrand, says the South African government is "in a unique position to start initiating some of the changes needed to survive in the 21st century". With billions of dollars now flowing into renewable energy research, thanks to recent pledges by government and business leaders at COP21 , renewables will be able to provide baseload capacity to national grids.South Africa can take advantage of this, with its high levels of solar radiation and consistent wind along its coastlines, as well as scientific and technical expertise in several renewable energy technologies. It also has a laudable procurement system for renewables, with R200-billion in foreign investment coming in the past five years. But that growth still faces regulatory uncertainty and Eskom's stranglehold over transmission lines. The monopoly needs to be diluted, but earlier this year the department of energy withdrew its support for the Independent Services and Market Operator Bill, which would see Eskom restructured to allow for more competition in the supply of electricity.These hurdles are blocking the immediate action that can be taken to diversify South Africa's energy supply, but political interference shrouds the entire issue. Nuclear technology, for example, is no longer a technical or economic issue, but a political one. Instead of taking the small steps that could move South Africa further along the renewable energy path, the issue has been stalled by political polemic and lobbying.2. WaterSouth Africa is already a water-scarce country, something that climate change will exacerbate. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research predicts that much of the country will become drier, and the rain that does fall will be in short, sharp bursts, which will damage crops and erode soil. The World Economic Forum already ranks water insecurity as the greatest threat to economies and peace. But rather than treating water as a resource, South Africans view it as an expected service, says water engineer Jacques Laubscher."We cannot change the external fact that we don't have water, so we need to conserve and manage the water we have." The country's water has not been conserved or well managed: a third of municipal water is lost because of leaks and poor billing and, although only 8% of South Africa's surface area produces about half of its water supply, much of this land is under prospecting rights.On the bright side, the current drought has seen a renewed focus on infrastructure maintenance and on the integrity of ecosystems. Driven by scarcity and cuts in metros, the government has pushed for bigger fines for wasting water, and for the price of water to be increased so that it reflects its true value. But this should just be the start, and water should be placed at the heart of economic decisions. Dhesigen Naidoo, the head of the Water Research Commission, says economic planning, and even the National Development Plan, ignores the reality that there is not enough water for proposed developments."We need to be realistic about our water scarcity and build an economy that is less water-intensive." Wasting less water and protecting existing water resources from mining would be the easiest way to create more resilience in a system in which water demand will increasingly outstrip supply.3. AgricultureStaple food production in Southern Africa will drop by at least a third during this century as a result of climate change, according to the World Bank. As temperatures rise above 3\'c2\'b0C, livestock and plants will struggle to survive and reproduce. This drought is a warning of that future, with hundreds of thousands of heads of livestock dying and entire provinces being declared drought disaster areas. South Africa needs to diversify its produce, says Bob Scholes, of Wits University's Global Change and Sustainability Research Institute."You need to plant a range of crops, then you're going to win some and lose on others. If you have it all in one basket, you're less resilient." This has already started, with large-scale producers growing different varieties. The farming conglomerate ZZ2, for example, has been growing tomato variants that need less water to grow, and can survive extremes in temperature. On the smaller scale, the government and civil society have been driving programmes to support subsistence farmers, because they are expected to be hit hardest by the changing climate. These initiatives range from training in agricultural techniques to crop varietals that are more resilient to climate extremes.University of Cape Town's Mike Lucas says: "Farmers need to be sensitive to future rainfall patterns and adopt appropriate crops for expected rainfall."The country should shift from beef, sheep and goat farming in arid areas - much of the country's interior - in favour of game farming, he says. "Game use less water and are less destructive to their natural habitats." 4. PerceptionClimate change's two biggest problems have been its communication - the science has not been well translated for the public and its negative association with activist extremes. Public perception surveys have consistently shown that climate change does not feature in the top 10 concerns of citizens.South Africa is no exception, with more immediate concerns such as food, housing and unemployment consistently trumping climate change. But many of these issues are inextricably linked to climate change, such as increased food prices, water shortages and destruction caused by extreme weather, and inaction on climate change will ultimately affect votes. By linking climate change to the way it will affect people's lives and livelihoods will alter the perception and importance of climate change.5. EnforcementSouth Africa has one of the world's best environmental and climate change regimes - in terms of legislation. Rights that many other people fight for, such as the right to a clean environment, already exist here. But the legislation is consistently trumped by short-term development. Eskom has been allowed to build two of the world's largest coal-fired power stations, Medupi and Kusile, in areas where pollution already exceeds environmental thresholds. The parastatal is also exempt from complying with air quality legislation designed to curb the emission of greenhouse gases and other gases damaging to human health. Melissa Fourie, executive director of the Centre for Environmental Rights, says industrial developments are rubber-stamped to the detriment of the environment. "Companies know there is very little enforcement of the law, so they go ahead and pollute more, or destroy wetlands and protected areas." These areas are often integral to ecosystem functioning and, by extension, water supply, and animal and plant diversity.Enforcement is not a priority, and a chronic shortage of skilled personnel and funding means the excellent legislation is ignored. "We could make a huge difference to our overall greenhouse gas emissions if we just applied the law rigorously," she says. 6. ScienceScientific understanding and technical advances are pivotal to achieving climate change goals. In a large part it is because of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that we are aware of the extent to which the Earth's climate is changing and our culpability for it. The IPCC, the United Nations body responsible for assessing "the scientific technical and socioeconomic information relevant for the understanding of the risk of human-induced climate change", is credited with giving urgency to the climate change issue and putting it on the international policy-making table.But we need more science to look at local effects, because, although climate change is a global phenomenon, it is felt locally. A villager tries to extinguish one of the thousands of fires caused by slash-and-burn farming in Indonesia. (Bay Ismoyo, AFP)Guy Midgley, a Stellen\'c2\Â£dbosch University climate scientist on the panel, says: "What you realise is that we're trying to make policy with imperfect science. There is still quite a lot of uncertainty about how the world works. We don't have an operating manual for the planet, and we need one."This is echoed by Wits University's Coleen Vogel. "Efforts need to be continued in understanding the future complex climate system so that we can better try and project changes and current and future actions that may need to be taken." But this goes beyond researchers, says Scholes. "Probably the most important thing of all [to make South Africa 'climate-change-proof'] is to create a learning society." He uses the example of industry sharing water-saving tips with other sectors, and agricultural players sharing new crop successes."A learning society has, amongst other things, increased research and development, but this should not just be the domain of researchers. Everyone out there is trying things out, and we should be pooling our knowledge and sharing it."7. Financial systemUnlike many other developing countries, South Africa does not have to wait on international benevolence to take steps to help itself become more resilient to climate change. The country's banks are actively backing renewable energy projects, both locally and on the continent. Encouraged by this, foreign investors have pumped R200-million into renewables in South Africa. International programmes, such as the Green Climate Fund, which aims to raise $100-billion a year by 2020, will bolster developing countries' ability to adapt to climate change. These are likely to attract more private sector investment as the risk diminishes.The global funding model lies at the heart of COP negotiations, with many of the 150 leaders in Paris saying one of the biggest outcomes of negotiations has to be a strong signal to the financial sector. If countries show that the world's economy is going to move away from fossil fuels, they reason that the business sector will take that as a signal and start shifting its investments. South Africa's one problem in this regard is policy uncertainty. This has plagued the renewable energy programme and many other sustainable development programmes. 8. Future citiesMore than half the world's population live in cities, and there is an increasing focus on making them the catalysts for smart development.South Africa's cities have ambitious plans to emit fewer greenhouse gases and to adapt to the changing climate.A key to lowering emissions is public transport, which cities such as Johannesburg have placed at the heart of future development. This will make the air healthier and could reduce national emissions by up to 10%. Smart buildings are also being introduced, with each update to South Africa's building codes calling for homes and offices to become increasingly more self-sufficient. In many countries, homes are already net contributors to the national water and electricity grid, taking away the need for damaging power stations to be built. Cities are also a key testing area for one of the biggest impacts of climate change \'c2\Â£d- rising sea levels. Many of South Africa's metros lie along the coastline and are at risk from the projected 3mm annual sea rise this century. For many cities in the world it is too late for any lowering of emissions to stop flooding, so they are putting measures in place to deal with storm surges.Wits University's Claudious Chikozho says: "Climate-proof areas that are vulnerable to flooding are putting in place climate-resilient infrastructure such as houses designed to withstand floods, even moving whole communities from low-lying, flood-prone areas to higher ground if needs be." \</doc>

Nigeria seems in no haste to unveil its climate pledge with just four months to go before the U.N. Climate Conference scheduled for December in Paris. However, unlike Gabon, Morocco, Ethiopia and Kenya - the only African nations yet to submit their commitments - Nigeria has just commissioned a committee of experts to draw up targets and responses for its "intended nationally determined contributions" (INDCs). INDCS are the post-2020 climate actions that countries say they will take under a new international agreement to be reached at the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) in Paris, and to be submitted to the United Nations by September. "The whole exercise [of preparing INDCs] will consider some priority sectors, look at the baseline and look at our needs for development and see what we can put on the table that we are going to strive to mitigate in terms of greenhouse gases" - Samuel Adejuwon, Nigeria's Federal Ministry of Environment Ahead of that date, Nigeria says its goals are clear: balancing post-2020 greenhouse gas (GHG) emission cut projections with its development peculiarities, according to Samuel Adejuwon, deputy director of the Federal Ministry of Environment's Department of Climate Change in Abuja. Nigeria is Africa's fourth largest emitter of CO2, and there is no doubt climate change is already a problem it faces. From the north, encroachment of the Sahara is helping to fuel a bloody insurgency by the jihadist group Boko Haram, as well as resource conflict between farmers and pastoralists in its central region, while the rise in ocean levels and flooding are affecting the south. In a report issued in October 2014, the Mapelcroft global analytics company said that Nigeria, along with Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India and the Philippines, were the countries facing the greatest risk of climate change-fuelled conflict today. Nigeria's hopes for slashing its emission levels as part of its INDCs face several tests. One is that for an economy almost solely dependent on oil - which accounts for a major portion of its 500 billion dollar gross domestic product (GDP), Africa's highest - the commitment it takes to Paris will reflect how jettisoning fossil fuel cannot be an urgent priority and why doing so will require significant time and resources. "The whole exercise will consider some priority sectors, look at the baseline and look at our needs for development and see what we can put on the table that we are going to strive to mitigate in terms of greenhouse gases," says Adejuwon. Another test is Nigeria's energy shortage. The country produces about 4,000 megawatts for 170 million people, leaving much of the population reliant on wood, charcoal and waste to fulfil household energy needs such as cooking, heating and lighting. In 2014, Nigerians used at least 12 million litres of diesel and petrol every day to drive back-up generators, according to former power Minister Chinedu Nebo. The country's daily petrol consumption (cars included) stands at about 40 million litres, according to the state oil company, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. Cutting the level of pollution that this consumption causes will require big investments in renewable and cleaner energy, says Professor Olukayode Oladipo, a climate change expert and one of three consultants drawing up the INDCs for the government. Last year, former finance minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said the country needed 14 billion dollars each year in energy investments and related infrastructure. Oladipo argues that the key to the issue lies in striking a balance between a future of lower greenhouse emissions and immediate developmental realities. "Every country is now exploring how to use less energy ... in an efficient manner, how to rely on renewable energy sources." In Nigeria, we are looking at "how to be able to drive our economy through reduced energy consumption without actually reducing the rate at which our economy is growing." Last year, minister of power Chinedu Nebo said that while solar panels were welcome for use in shoring up generation in distant communities, the government will deploy coal in addition to the hydro power currently in use. "There is no doubt that the potential is there. Clean coal technology can give us good electricity and minimum pollution at the same time," he said. Insecurity Oladipo also stresses that besides fuel, Nigeria's climate plans will focus on agriculture, partly to diversify from oil and also as a response to growing resource conflict. "We are not saying it is the only determinant of crisis," he says of climate change stoking conflict over resources, "but at least it is adding to the degree and the frequency of the occurrence of these conflicts. In the latest attack in May this year, herdsmen from the Fulani tribe slaughtered at least 96 people in the central state of Benue, Nigeria's Punch newspaper reported. The government agrees that climate change is one of the causes of the frequent bloodletting, alongside factors like urbanisation, but not much has been done to address the problem. Oladipo says he believes that Nigeria's new leader, Muhammadu Buhari, will do more to address fundamental climate change issues, point out that in his inaugural address on May 29, Buhari pledged to be a more "forceful and constructive player in the global fight against climate change." However, Nnimmo Bassey of the Health of Mother Earth Foundation argues that proposals put forward by Nigeria and Africa can barely be achieved if the developed nations - the biggest polluters - fail to act more to meet their commitments and cut down on their emissions. "Nigeria should insist that industrialised nations cut emissions at source and not place the burden on vulnerable nations," says Bassey. Urging action from those nations, including the United States, will form a key element of Nigerian and African INDCs, adds Oladipo. Edited by Phil Harris \</doc>

Ever larger and more frequent weather disasters around the world are fuelling pessimism that we can curb man-made climate change before its too late. But Laurence Tubiana is more optimistic than apocalyptic. She believes mankind is finally getting the message about the damage it is inflicting on the planet. And is at |last starting to do something serious about it. COP 21 - which is to be held in Paris in December. Tubiana - who is also professor and director of the Sustainable Development Centre at Sciences Po Paris and professor of international affairs at Columbia University - visited South Africa recently to talk to local climate change officials. COP 21 - the 21st yearly session of the Conference of the Parties to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) - is going to be a jamboree with about 40 000 people attending, including UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon and Pope Francis - who has just delivered an encyclical on climate change. This is where the all-embracing global agreement to counter global warming which was dimly envisaged in Durban at COP 17 in 2011 is supposed to be spelt out and adopted. Which she thinks it will be. "The window of opportunity is now much narrower. It's still feasible, but it implies that in particular global (greenhouse gas) emissions will have to peak earlier than at the moment is anticipated. "The emissions of the developed countries have peaked already so they are decreasing. "So everything depends on China," because it is emitting so much, she says. "For the moment, China has given the signal that it will peak at or around 2030. That would mean we cannot do the 2\'c2\'baC. "Of course, everyone believes that China could peak much earlier." But Beijing doesn't want to say it now. And may not say it even in Paris. That's because Beijing's overriding political priority is maintaining a high economic growth rate. If it announced that carbon emissions would peak in, say 2025, rather than 2030, that would imply a lower growth rate than the 7 or 8 percent currently projected - and expected by its people. Tubiana said Beijing was caught in a dilemma between this high growth imperative and its "serious concern about climate change" - greater than South Africa's, for instance. It was seeing the effects in floods, desertification and air pollution so toxic that people sometimes struggled to breathe. "It happens that the sea level rise happens faster in China than in some other regions. So they are concerned because all their development is coastal, basically, even if they try to develop more than the West." Tubiana said the big COP 15 climate change conference in Copenhagen in 2009 had failed because the big emerging nations like China, India and Brazil were not yet ready |to tackle climate change. |Since then there had been a "striking" change in their attitudes. Beijing, especially, began to tackle climate change seriously, investing heavily in renewable energy such as solar and wind, and now even preparing to launch its own carbon market next year. India had recently announced that by 2025 it would be producing 175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy, 100GW from solar and 75GW from wind. Others had done likewise. From almost no policies on global warming before Copenhagen in major emerging economies, most now had them. The developed nations had also moved rapidly since then. Denmark had invested heavily in wind and was now a world leader, exporting windmills all over the world. Germany has made renewables a part of its industrial strategy, partly by putting a very high price of about e100 |a ton on carbon emissions. "California is doing stunning things in renewables; it has made that one of the pillars of its economic strategy. It's inserting renewable energy into the grid without storage at a rate we in France thought impossible." Japan was also doing a lot. All these investments in renewables since Copenhagen had brought prices right down. The cost of solar panels had decreased in Spain by almost 90 percent since Copenhagen. In rough average terms, electricity from solar energy now costs about e80 a megawatt hour, about the same as "new nuclear", meaning electricity from nuclear reactors with advanced safety features, she said. However, in sunny southern France and in Chile, for example, solar energy-powered electricity prices have dropped to about e55 or e60 a megawatt hour, approaching the global average price of electricity from coal-fired plants, which is about e50 a megawatt hour. Wind was a little cheaper than solar on average, though in northern Europe it was much less. In California, renewable energy prices were already on |a par with fossil fuel energy prices. These changes in the real energy economy had contributed largely to greenhouse gas emissions stabilising last year for the first time. "The problem is to upscale it. Because this is only incremental. That is the challenge for Paris. Not dreaming that Paris will solve the issue. Paris has to set the framework where we can to it effectively. "We cannot do that by government alone. We will have to have the financiers, the companies and the mayors. We have to create a coalition, a movement, or it will not work." The Paris agreement would not be binding, because that was politically impossible, especially because emerging and developing nations were now emitting most of the carbon. "So we can't divide things and say you can emit this and you can emit that. We can't find a formula so the system is based on voluntary pledges." The agreement should further encourage research and development in renewables by giving a signal to investors and private companies that governments were finally serious about climate change and would implement the necessary policies. "Then much of the effort directed to fossil energy now would be redirected towards these new sectors. In reality, the battle behind the climate agreement is economic sectors betting on the new wave of technology against the old ones." Paris would have to map |a "transformative pathway" towards the target of staying under the plus 2\'c2\'baC limit, not doing it all immediately but agreeing on a system of constant improvement, never backsliding. It would include increasing collaboration among countries to help each other, for instance through joint efforts to master vital outstanding technologies such as electricity storage - which would make a quantum leap by converting intermittent renewable energy from windmills and solar plants into baseload electricity. A global carbon market would not be established soon because that would require setting global limits on carbon emission. But national or regional carbon markets - like those in Europe and in China - would continue to be set up, she forecast. And she also predicted that after Paris there would be a revival in the energy and investment devoted to carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), which had flagged because of the low carbon price. That was already happening in fossil fuel-rich countries such as the Gulf states, where Saudi Arabia for one was already investing serious money in it. And if the plus 2\'c2\'baC limit is eventually exceeded, there might still be ways of clawing the planet back below that. "If people begin to think seriously, you have very many avenues of technology," said Tubiana. "Climate change is not for your grandchildren. It's happening now." \</doc>

NEWS ANALYSISAfrica is not a country, even if the organisers of this week's historic Forum on Africa and Chinese Co-operation (Focac) act as though it is.Close to 40 African heads of state are travelling to Johannesburg to meet with China's President Xi Jinping for the first summit of its kind on African soil this weekend.Xi paid an official visit to South Africa in the run-up to the summit, to place the focus on issues such as the trade imbalance between the country and its biggest trading partner. South Africa has also hosted an unprecedented number of debates and \'c2\Â£dconferences on relations with China in the past few days. The 15th anniversary of Focac was originally meant to be a ministerial-level meeting but was "upgraded" to a summit of African leaders - a feather in the cap for South Africa following the controversy around the presence of Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir at the June summit of the African Union in Johannesburg.Al-Bashir is not attending the summit, nor are the newly elected president of Burkina Faso, the president of S\'c3\Â£3o Tom\'e9 and Pr\'c3\Â£dncipe and the king of Swaziland because of the relations between the three countries and what China considers the "rebel province" of Taiwan.Morocco, the only African country that is not a member of the AU, will also be represented at the summit. The idea that Africa speaks with one voice when meeting China is reinforced by the fact that the AU has official status as a member of Focac and that AU Commission chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma's flagship project Agenda 2063 has been included in the theme of the summit.Yet relations with the Asian giant are not all on the same level. In South Africa, the Chinese presence in the country dates back to the 19th century and China's recent huge investments in corporates such as Standard Bank are less visible in South Africa's more diversified economy, but China's presence is much more obvious in less-developed African countries. Getting a clear picture of the state of relations between individual African countries and China is complicated by a lack of accurate data. Even China-Africa experts admit that figures of the number of Chinese in Africa range from one million to two million. "China-Africa relations do not exist in a vacuum," says Yu-Shan Wu, a researcher at the South African Institute for International Affairs. Wu emphasised at a media briefing last week that the nuances and complexities of the relations should not be overlooked. "Perceptions are important," she said, speaking about the contentious issue of the illegal trade in wildlife between countries such as Tanzania and China. Chinese engineers at a construction site in Sudan's capital, Khartoum. (Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah, Reuters)Tension between African citizens and Chinese informal traders, for instance, has also sometimes soured relations between China and countries such as Ghana and Nigeria.These have been offset by the economic benefits of trade and Chinese investment in projects such as infrastructure, hospitals and sports stadiums. Following the promises made by Xi at the COP21 climate summit in Paris this week, emphasis is now also being placed on much-needed renewable energy projects. China is investing in major solar energy projects in Zimbabwe, where Xi paid a visit to President Robert Mugabe on Tuesday.Xi is expected to make an announcement of more Chinese loans to Africa this weekend, as has been the case at previous Focac meetings, but experts warn that the dwindling demand for raw materials should temper this expectation."Focac comes at a critical juncture with the slump in commodities. There is a rethink of relations in Africa and also in China," said Romain Dittgen of the South African Institute for International Affairs. China is the seventh biggest investor in Africa, but these investments dropped more than 40% in the first half of 2015, compared with last year. The big announcements made at summits such as these should also be scrutinised as very little detail is given about which countries are benefiting. Some of the megaprojects announced in countries such as Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo as far back as 2006 have, for example, not been realised to date. On the political front, opposition parties in many African countries question the tendency for China's links with the continent to be driven by government-to-government relations, with little or no regard for democratisation or human rights.Zimbabwean opposition leaders told the local NewsDay website this week that they are sceptical of the announcements of major Chinese investments."All we will have are speeches and hot air about this being a historic visit," People's Democratic Party spokesperson Jacob Mafume said about Xi's visit.Guinea's former dictator Lansana Conte is quoted in the book La Chinafrique as saying the Chinese were a welcome alternative to "the whites that still act like colonials". The premise of the book is that, in time, China will supplant the close networks between French politics and business and Francophone Africa, often dubbed Francafrique.Recently China invested in a major hydroelectric plant in Guinea, one of West Africa's potentially rich but struggling economies.One issue African leaders agree on is that industrialisation is key to the future development of their countries, especially with the drop in commodity prices and the expectation that changes in China's economy will lead to its more low-end jobs being exported elsewhere.For now, Ethiopia is one of the few African countries where manufacturing by Chinese companies has taken off, but China is still shifting the bulk of these jobs to countries such as Vietnam that are geographically closer to it. \</doc>

Independent Media Taking a stroll in the forest as the sun sets is a relaxing pastime. Forests are essential to life on earth, and their importance will be discussed at the World Forestry Congress in Durban in September. Picture: Sophia Stander Conferences on sustainability risk are being dismissed as mere talking shops. Nevertheless, several such events this year present at least four crucial opportunities to move the world towards sustainable use of natural resources. But that requires political will and personal activism, backed by science. In the context of South Africa, that could scarcely be more important: it is a country that has unique flora and fauna that can provide a competitive economic advantage globally if managed judiciously. But those species and systems are also pressured by climate change which can cause extreme weather. It alters habitats, imperils species and is linked directly to our food-, water- and energy-security. Those threats hit South Africa's poor first and hardest, those with the fewest choices or resources. South Africa doesn't operate in isolation in these matters. In the 23 years since the signing of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions has been mostly ineffective. Consequently, last year may have been the warmest year in recorded history, with concomitant destruction from extreme weather and consequences such as droughts, floods, fires and heatwaves. We know that unsustainable activity can have impacts \- often unexpected \- far away. The rise of wealth and a consumer culture in one part of the world puts pressure on species in other parts, such as South Africa's rhino, as well as humble but ecologically important species such as abalone and pangolin. So, we don't need to look far to see that we need urgently to reinvent our relationship with the natural systems that sustain us, locally and globally. From acid-mine drainage crisis in South Africa, to deadly pollution in China's cities and the acidification of our oceans, we have a clearmandate to act. We have compelling opportunities to do so. Earlier this month, world leaders met in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to chart reforms of the global financial system. The third UN conference on Financing for Development (Ffd) aims to make solid decisions on the future and how to finance it. It's an important opportunity to ensure that development takes cognisance of sustainability. In September they will meet again, in New York, to approve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to guide national and global policies to 2030. And in December leaders will assemble in Paris to adopt a global agreement to head off the growing dangers of human-induced climate change. But closer to home, in September, Durban will host the XIV World Forestry Congress (WFC), a crucial opportunity to ensure sustainable management of the lungs of the earth. Forests are essential to life on our planet, to mitigating and adapting to climate change, ensuring an adequate supply of fresh water, enhancing biodiversity and providing sustainable incomes and livelihoods, including food security. But they face unprecedented and unrelenting pressures. The WFC aims to help position forestry as an integral part of sustainable development at alllevels \- regional, national, and global. It will also seek to identify and review major issues facing forests and forestry and propose technical, scientific and policy interventions to promote forest sustainability. Progress has been made in bringing seven percent of the world's forests under stewardship through credible certification, but clearly much work remains. The WFC is an opportunity for an open forum in which the world's forestry community and partners from related sectors can debate their knowledge, views and latest findings and establish and consolidate partnerships and networks. It can create an inclusive dialogue for all key stakeholders, particularly youth, students, professionals, women and local communities. Successful and fruitful forums like this will add important impetus to, for example, the UN Climate Change Conference, COP21 , in Paris in December. Each event has its role and its role-players, and each must be seen in the context of global concerns over ecological destruction. UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, recently announced his Road to Dignity report and called for "a universal and transformative agenda that places people and planet at the centre, is underpinned by human rights, and is supported by a global partnership". Sustainable use of natural resources provides business, government, civil society and ordinary citizens with the opportunity to ensure "some, for all, forever" rather than "all, for some, for now". That opportunity must be catalysed by conscious consumer demand, conscientious business, and a committed and enablinglegislative environment. So we must drive home the message that sustainability isn't simply some middle-class indulgence. Successful environmental and conservation efforts must, by definition, be community and people-centred. The conference in Durban in September represents an excellent opportunity for focusing the attention of media and their audiences. It is also a chance to address audiences beyond the environmental sector. But for that to be achieved \- before, during and beyond the conference \- communications must be sustained and strategic to be effective and drive behavioural change. Humankind's ingenuity and appetites have contributed to environmental destruction and the loss of habitats and species. That same resourcefulness and energy can now drive the quest for sustainability. An example of where that's being done is the multinational Project Apollo, which aims to secure investment of 0.02% of GDP for development of cheap, clean electricity. The project derives its name from the Apollo Space Programme, which engaged America's brightest minds to achieve the seemingly impossible: a man on the moon. Our viability as a species pivots on preserving the natural systems that sustain us, and on finding the will and the way to do so.

Energy in Africa is a rarer commodity than in the developed world... Electricity consumption per capita in sub-Saharan Africa is, on average, less than that needed to power a 50-watt light bulb continuously. The 48 sub-Saharan countries have a combined installed generation base of only 68gW, according to the African Development Bank Group. This is roughly equal to the generation capacity of Spain, a country that has a population of less than 5% of that of sub-Saharan Africa. Improving economic opportunities In 2011, the international community initiated a drive towards achieving universal access to modern energy services by 2030 under the UN s Sustainable Energy for All Initiative (SE4All). Substantially increasing energy access rates has the potential to make a significant contribution to lifting people out of poverty, creating more dignified living conditions and expanding economic opportunities. How then should we go about meeting the energy needs of the continent? The two additional goals of the SE4All for our leaders are to achieve the radical transformations in energy access whilst actively driving down global carbon emissions via the promotion of low carbon technologies and energy efficiency. Accelerating the uptake of renewable energy It is important that the north and south work together to support all African countries to achieve the ambitious goals encapsulated within the SE4All. Encouragingly, recent international agreements (such as those announced at COP 21 in Paris) have committed the world s richer countries to investing significant resources in supporting the rapid acceleration of the uptake of renewable energy across the countries of the global south, to help mitigate climate change and promote sustainable local development. The role of capacity building and applied research in accelerating this uptake cannot be underestimated: development, optimisation and dissemination of new technologies, innovative mechanisms for financing renewable energy projects, and evidence for formulating efficient policies for renewable energy just to name a few. Providing a scientific platform Three action areas Last month, the inaugural Africa-EU research symposium was held in Tlemcen, Algeria. The event was attended by 135 international experts, representing universities, research institutions, public sector, industry associations, and international organisations from 30 countries in Africa and Europe. The symposium highlighted three action areas for the international scientific and development communities. - First, while the role of academia in advancing renewable energy market and policies cannot be underestimated, it is unfortunate that most research projects end with the publication of a scientific paper. Researchers need to build closer partnerships with the private sector in order to translate science into practical and bankable solutions that will have a positive impact on markets and livelihoods while also contributing to the financial sustainability of research institutions. Private sector players, on the other hand, should also be involved in all stages of a research project, ensuring that research meets actual market needs. - Then, access to energy is not just a question of physical access to energy sources; it is also about people s ability to pay for them. Many communities across Africa live within metres of national grid systems and yet have no access to the electricity passing so close to their homes. It is therefore important to take a people-centred approach in every research project on renewable energy in Africa. This includes the need to focus on cost-effective, household level off-grid solutions and the acknowledgment of the role of women in energy use, entrepreneurship, policy making and research. - Lastly, although funds are available, financing renewable energy research in Africa remains a challenge. Lack of awareness, difficult application procedures and limited capacities often hinder access to available funding sources such as Horizon 2020, the biggest EU research and innovation funding programme. Joint research proposals with international partner institutions can substantially increase chances for successful applications and increase the quality of research output. {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell \</doc>

Anti-nuclear energy activists are up in arms, and have taken to vigils outside South Africa's parliament in Cape Town to protest against President Jacob Zuma's push for nuclear development. The protest has been building since September 2014 when Zuma struck a deal with Russia's Rossatom to build up to eight nuclear power stations in South Africa. The stations would cost the country around 1 trillion South African rands (84 billion dollars). As the protests mount, the Southern African Faith Communities' Environment Institute (SAFCEI), an interdenominational faith-based environment initiative led by Bishop Geoff Davies, has said the government's nuclear policy is not only foolish but immoral. "SAFCEI does not believe that nuclear energy is an answer to climate change but is a distraction likely to bankrupt the country [South Africa] and lead to further energy impoverishment" - Liziwe McDaid, energy advisor for the Southern African Faith Communities' Environment Institute SAFCEI is demanding that the government take a fresh look at its drive for nuclear energy, and the call has found resonance among clean energy civil society organisations (CSOs) in South Africa. Although CSOs and government agree in the need to tackle climate change urgently, they differ on core issues as South Africa prepares for the U.N. Climate Conference ( COP21 ) in Paris in December. "We believe that adaptation needs to be given greater emphasis," says Liziwe McDaid, SAFCEI's energy advisor. "Building the capacity of affected and vulnerable communities to respond to climate change must be a priority," she adds. For mitigation, argues McDaid, a much greater rollout of renewable energy is the key to shifting the carbon-intensive energy sector towards a sustainable low carbon future. As a participant in the country's National Climate Change dialogues, she says that SAFCEI shares the aspiration for responsible climate change and "we are in agreement with government on many of the priorities as outlined in the White Paper." South Africa's White Paper seeks to prioritise climate change responses that have huge adaptation benefits, imply significant economic growth and job creation, and are responsive to public health and risk management. Meanwhile, David Hallowes researcher and editor of Slow Poison for groundWork, another climate change pressure group, feels there is no consensus between the government and the CSOs ahead of the crucial Paris meeting. The same plants and developments that are driving climate change are poisoning and killing people, animals and plants that are in the path of pollution, "so the people's struggles for an environment not harmful to their health and wellbeing are also climate struggles." According to Hallowes, "there are different views on what can be achieved with renewable energy. We (groundWork) do not think it can power infinite economic growth and hence we do not believe it can sustain a capitalist economy. In the short term, we think we should be looking for a reduction in energy consumption. The question is who gets it for what." Referring to South Africa's Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement (REIPPP) programme, which some say proves the benefits of privatisation, he also pointed to differences over nationalisation or privatisation. "We think we should have a programme that creates democratic ownership and control of renewable energy at different levels from community or settlement, to municipality to national. We call it energy sovereignty. The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa calls it social ownership. It's the same thing." The groundWork researcher said that CSOs want to see an end to new coal developments, such as new mines or power stations. "I think everyone agrees but don't necessarily mean the same thing. For some, it's just a matter of jobs. We think it means the transformation of the economy towards equality and freedom that is democratic control rather than plutocratic control." Muna Lakhani, founder and national coordinator of the Institute for Zero Waste in Africa (IZWA), is equally concerned that government is not doing enough to fight climate change. "Our government sees too much of 'business as usual' and is very lax in implementing even the minimal legislation, such as air quality permits, carbon taxes and the like," he says. According to Lakhani, CSOs are mostly united on key issues, such as the call for no more fossil fuel, a bigger push for renewables, and promoting local resilience especially of poorer communities and the generally disadvantaged. Government role Leluma Matooane, director of Earth Systems Science at Department of Science and Technology (DST) says the Department of Environmental Affairs has the responsibility to implement the country's National Climate Change Response Policy but that the DST has taken a leadership and coordinating role in climate change research and in ensuring that the country's responses to climate change are informed by robust science. Under DST's 10-Year Innovation Plan, argues Matooane, more focus is being placed on improving the scientific understanding of the drivers, impacts and risks of climate change, as well as on technological innovations the country may need to allow vulnerable sectors of the economy and society at large to adapt. While views may differ on how to deal with climate change, notes the DST official, government has allowed the setting up of a multi-stakeholder grouping in which government has been joined by the private sector and civil society to discuss solutions. Discussions in this grouping, he adds, influence and shape the country's position in international debates and there is a deliberate attempt to have South Africa's representatives deliver the similar position and messages at different platforms. \</doc>

21 October was a Wednesday like any other for commuters in Johannesburg, the only difference being the influx of SA celebs, high-profile City of Joburg officials and CEOs commuting with them... The reason? The WWF EcoMobility Challenge, a WWF South Africa initiative held in association with the City of Johannesburg, aimed at demonstrating the solutions available to tackle climate change, while at the same time highlighting the benefits in shifting to public from private transport. Held during the month-long global EcoMobility World Festival, the Challenge saw teams of racers navigating a series of destination checkpoints across Johannesburg using only public transport, minibus taxi, or electric or non-motorised transport. Kicking off at the WWF building in Braamfontein, Lisa Seftel, Executive Director of Transport for the City of Joburg, opened the race and gave the teams their first clue. The raceThe teams worked hard puzzling out clues which led them to Hector Pieterson Square, to Orlando Stadium, to Maponya Mall and on to the Sanlam building in Sandton. Armed only with maps, public transport timetables and other tools to guide them, and their commitment to the cause, all strategised with the end goal in mind - to be the team with the lowest 'carbon footprint' to cross the endpoint before the cut-off time. Racers' adventures included tackling the Rea Vaya interchanges, fighting off other commuters for spots on eTukTuk, learning the signs to "uptown" and "downtown" when hailing minibus taxis, walking for kilometres in the current heat wave, and riding bicycles, something many racers, including Miss South Africa Liesl Laurie, admitted to not having done in several years. "The experience was phenomenal. I had not ridden a bike in 10 years and today made me realise what I have been missing."Maps Maponyane, one of SA's most loved celebrities, also went EcoMobile in support of the cause and highlighted the benefits in shifting to public transport, which include less congestion, lower infrastructure costs, health benefits, and local economic development, "there are no parking issues, it saves costs, and it's easy to travel in large numbers," he said. Regardless of the modes of transport used, all racers were in agreement that the challenge provided them the chance to meet lots of similar-minded people and engage in a fun-filled day of laughter, while at the same time visiting parts of Joburg they would not otherwise have seen, or at least had not visited in many years. "It was a great way to see and explore the city from different perspectives," said Maponyane. "At the same time, realising the several modes of transport one could use in order to lessen their carbon footprint, and their impact on our city, through our daily emissions."The winning teamWith all said and done (and walked and ran and cycled), it was a team comprising Graeme Stephens (CEO of Sun International), Liesl Laurie (Miss South Africa), Bongani Xakaza (South African National Energy Development Institute or SANEDI) and Innocent Nkosi (University of Johannesburg) who came out tops. From beginning to end, the team that won were carbon-conscious about the modes of transport they used and walked or cycled whenever the distance allowed. At one Rea Vaya interchange, they chose not to catch the bus for the second part of that stage and rather walked. On the trip from Park Station to Sandton, they caught a minibus taxi, which had a lower footprint than the Gautrain - which most teams opted for - and then walked to the closing ceremony instead of taking an eTukTuk. According to Graeme Stephens, they "couldn't have been more eco-friendly." The prize Valli Moosa, Chair of the WWF South Africa board handed the team that won their prize, but it was not all fun and games. MMC of Transport, Councillor Christine Walters, who also took part in the Challenge, then addressed the awards ceremony on the City's Strategic Integrated Transport Plan and how this addresses climate change. "A group of people from different cultures, different age group, different academic and work backgrounds committed to one purpose - today, we practically displayed that we can lessen our carbon emission footprint by choosing instead to travel via Rea Vaya, Gautrain, minibus taxi, cycling, walking and electric car", said Walters. Louise Naud\'e9, WWF South Africa's lead on low-carbon transport and climate change, expressed the harsh reality: "There is a serious need for national governments at COP21 to increase their commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - the gases driving climate change. The pledges they have put on the table fall far short of the reductions we need if we are to keep average global warming below 2\'b0C. What's scary is that at 2\'b0C globally, Africa will be up to between 3\'b0C and 4\'b0C. Climate change could reverse all the developmental gains we have made." CEO of WWF-SA, Morn\'e9 du Plessis, who participated in the Challenge to get first-hand experience of the types of transport options in Johannesburg, while hearing what regular commuters think about their commute, really enjoyed the challenge and connecting with the people of Jozi. "I was surprised to see the willingness of the people of Johannesburg to engage with strangers who wanted to ask them questions about transport. As individuals, we can reduce our own carbon footprint in many ways. But the single biggest contribution we can make is to 'change the way you move' as the City's theme says. Our race today showed the way," he said. Showing support for public transport and low carbon emissions "The race would not have been possible without the generous support of transport service providers Gautrain, Rea Vaya, Metrorail, Metrobus, minibus taxis, bicycles from Lebo's Soweto Backpackers, eTukTuk and the Nissan Leaf; apps Findalift for ride-sharing and Findmyway which puts public transport in your palm; hosts along the way at Hector Pieterson Memorial, Orlando Stadium, Maponya Mall, Park Station, EcoMobility Festival Exhibition and Sanlam who spoilt us with goodies, food and the closing venue; and other sponsors in kind or time Ernest & Young, Hollard, Sun International and Vivreau Water. Most of all, we celebrate the racers who donated their enthusiasm and time, and spread the message far and wide. The City of Joburg backed us all the way and we hope this is the start of a beautiful friendship. All those who took part can take pride in the fact that insights gained through the challenge will add to existing City programmes and feed into WWF's low-carbon transport programme. Together we can make a difference," concludes Naud\'e9. {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell \</doc>

Statement by International Relations and Cooperation Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane on the occasion of the media briefing on the outcomes of the 26th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the African Union Good morning ladies and gentlemen, In this briefing today, we will focus on the outcomes of the recent 26th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union, which met for its beginning-of-the-year Summit at the Africa Union headquarters in Addis Ababa on 30 - 31 January 2016 under the theme: "2016, African Year of Human Rights, with a particular focus on Women's Rights. Deliberations at the summit were on the following main issues: 1. UN Security Council Reform; 2. The state of peace and security on the continent, with particular focus on the situations in Burundi, South Sudan, Libya and the DRC; 3. The Summit also issued three political declarations namely on Palestine, Cuba, and an appeal to the United States to lift its sanctions on Sudan. On the theme of the Summit, the 9th AU Gender Pre-Summit Meeting was held from 18 - 20 January 2016 with the objective of ensuring that women's voices are captured in the main Summit as this is the second consecutive year that the AU theme for the year focuses on women. Issues discussed during the deliberations included: harnessing the demographic dividend (Africa's population is predominantly youthful), women in the blue economy, women in peace and security, the impact of climate change on women and the financial inclusion of women. A Special Summit of the Committee of Participating Heads of State and Government of the African Peer Review Mechanism (APR Forum) was held on 29 January 2016 and was preceded by a Meeting of the Committee of the APRM Focal Points on 28 January 2016. Some of the decisions of the Special Summit include: 1. The appointment of Prof. Edward Maloka, a South African, as the new CEO of the APRM Secretariat; 2. The extension, under the provisions of the Operating Procedures of the APRM, of the term of office for three members of the APR Panel of Eminent Persons whose four-year tenure had expired i.e. Dr Mustapha Mekideche (Chairperson) and panel members Ambassador Fatuma Ndangiza Nyirakobwa (Rwanda) and Ambassador Ashraf Rashed (Egypt). The report of the APR Forum will be presented to the Assembly during the July 2016 Summit, which is planned to be hosted in Kigali, Rwanda. The Assembly of Heads of State and Government adopted its Bureau, which is to be led by the President of Chad (Chairperson) with the First Vice Chairperson as the President of Benin, Second Vice Chairperson as the President of Rwanda, Third Vice Chairperson as the President of Libya and Rapporteur as the President of Zimbabwe. The Assembly also adopted a decision on the report of the Commission on Governance, Constitutionalism and Elections in Africa. The following can be highlighted from the decision: The Assembly called on Member States to accelerate the signing, ratification, domestication and implementation of the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance (ACDEG) and the African Charter on the Values and Principles of Decentralization, Local Governance and Local Development; to prioritize the continued operationalization of the AU High Council of Local Authorities (AU-HCLA); to ensure professionalization and de-politicisation of the security establishment; to maintain zero-tolerance on military coups and other methods of unconstitutional changes of government; to ensure that constitutional amendments are done in accordance with the provisions of the ACDEG and the active participation of their citizens; to establish permanent, impartial and independent Constitutional Review Commissions whose mandate should be to oversee all constitutional amendments; amongst other matters. On the domestication of Agenda 2063 and The 1st Ten-Year Implementation Plan, those Member States which have not yet done so were encouraged to start the domestication process. The AU Commission, Regional Economic Communities and all AU Organs and continental institutions were also requested to align their Strategic and Master Plans to the 1st Ten Year Implementation Plan and ensure maximum coordination in its implementation, in the spirit of complementarity and subsidiarity. Member States were also encouraged to urgently develop a continental initiative on Critical Technical Skills, and to prioritise investments in the development of skills, especially in the areas of science and technology, essential for implementing Agenda 2063, including vocational skills and trade technicians, and the design and management of large-scale projects. The AU reiterated its previous calls for the urgent reform of the UN Security Council, which was the central message highlighted by the outgoing Chairperson of the AU, H.E. Robert G. Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, as well as by the new Chairperson of the AU, H.E. Idriss Deby Itno of the Republic of Chad, during the opening of the Summit. The Assembly Decision on the UN Security Council Reform recalled all its previous decisions on the matter and welcomed the UN General Assembly Decision 69/560 adopted by consensus to immediately continue with the intergovernmental negotiations' informal plenary during the 70th session, building on the gains made as well as the informal meetings held during the 69th session. The Assembly reaffirmed that the Common African Position, as contained in the Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration, shall continue to serve as the only viable option that reflects Africa's legitimate right and aspiration to rectify, inter alia, the historical injustice endured by the Continent and called on all African Union Member States to continue to speak with one voice on all aspects of the question of equitable representation on the membership of the UN Security Council and related matters". The AU welcomed the adoption of the new UN development agenda, titled: 'Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development', which is the result of consultations and inputs from member states of the UN and various bodies, including the AU. Lastly, on the Paris Agreement (which is the outcome of the COP21 climate change summit adopted on 12 December 2015), the AU highlighted the African priorities for the Paris agreement which were: enhancing the implementation of the UNFCCC; provide parity between mitigation and adaptation and address all elements in a balanced manner; ensure adequate support for developing countries and reaffirm countries obligation to provide finance, technology transfer and capacity building for developing countries; and provide priority and flexibility for Africa. As already indicated, the 27th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the AU will be held mid-year in Kigali, Rwanda. I thank you! \</doc>

NELSON Mandela said global climate change was one catastrophe humanity had the power to stop - and the South African public now has a chance to say how this should be done, environmental portfolio committee chairman Jackson Mthembu says. "As we go to Paris for COP21 , we would like to have a broad mandate from all our people. Madiba said this is one catastrophe that is in our hands to stop," Mthembu said last week. For that reason the committee would hold public hearings on September 22 and 23 to get the views of people on the Department of Environmental Affairs' discussion document on South Africa's negotiating position for COP21 . World leaders will meet in Paris in December to negotiate a new agreement to cut carbon emissions sufficiently to keep the average global temperature increase to 2\'c2\'b0C. The discussion document broadly outlines the country's position on the kind of agreement it would like to see in Paris. - Mercury Correspondent \</doc>

As maximum temperatures soared to 39\'c2\'b0C in South Africa's capital city, Pretoria, during the second week of November, residents were asking: why is it so unbearably hot this year? And why have there been successive heat waves?It was the second or third heat wave to hit the country's Gauteng province in the early summer. But it was not isolated to one province. Other parts of South Africa are also experiencing anomalous weather.There was a heat wave in coastal Cape Town, unusual spring thunderstorms and strange cloud formations in the Western Cape province along with the well-publicised drought in the summer rainfall region all across the country.The question is why? There are three probable culprits: regular climate dynamics, a phenomenon known as El Ni\'c3\'b1o, and global warming. Which of these is the dominant cause is a matter of scientific climate research, but there are some conclusions we can draw.Regular climate dynamics and global warmingInter-annual and decadal climate variability and extreme weather events are natural phenomena. This means that South Africa from time to time experiences years that are unusually wet and cool compared to the long-term average.At other times the country experiences relatively very dry and warm periods. This type of variability is part of the Earth's natural climate dynamics and is partially caused by oscillations and complex configurations of global and regional climate systems working in concert to produce our weather.Climate change is different from inter-annual climate variability. Climate change is a result of global warming which is caused by human activities that have resulted in the emission of various pollutants, principally carbon dioxide. This has altered Earth system dynamics in a way that affects the climate system, ultimately causing trends and changes to climate and weather systems.Climate models project that, given the current rate of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, and some unique features of South Africa's climate system, like our location in the subtropics and the important role that high pressure systems play in controlling the system, temperatures in southern Africa are likely to increase by at least 1.5 times the global average rate of temperature increase.The warmer weather South Africa is experiencing now is not solely attributable to climate change, but is likely to be a touch of what we may experience more often in the future. This is based on the evidence from climate scientists running powerful models to compute the climate projections of the future.El Ni\'c3\'b1oOf more immediate concern is the 2015 El Ni\'c3\'b1o. This is a phenomenon that occurs every two to seven years and appears when large parts of the eastern and central Pacific Ocean are experiencing above normal sea-surface temperatures. One of the strongest El Ni\'c3\'b1o events ever observed has settled over the Pacific.In South Africa, El Ni\'c3\'b1o is usually associated with below normal rainfall and above normal temperatures during the mid-summer period of December to February. The presence of the strong El Ni\'c3\'b1o event in combination with global warming means that it is no coincidence that 2015 is on track to be the warmest year ever recorded by humans in the 150-year record of reliable observations. A combination of El Nino, global warming and the country's climate dynamics has affected South Africa's weather patterns. (Shutterstock)Nine of the 10 warmest years on record have been observed during the last ten years. The current spell of heatwaves and record-high temperatures are a combination of global temperature extremes due to El Ni\'c3\'b1o in combination with the effects of systematic greenhouse gas warming.The exact mechanisms and linkages across the global climate system are the subject of ongoing research. For example, will El Ni\'c3\'b1o occur more frequently, more intensely and for longer duration with its impacts on global weather in the future?South Africa was in an existing state of drought even before the 2015 El Ni\'c3\'b1o started to have its impact. This was due to the previous two rainfall seasons being associated with below-normal rainfall over much of the country. There was a weak El Ni\'c3\'b1o in 2014. The situation is therefore more serious this summer with El Nino likely to cause a third season with below normal rainfall and above normal temperatures.The effects on human healthHigh temperatures, especially over long stretches of hot days, have a negative impact on human health, animals, agriculture and the natural environment.Adverse human health symptoms and effects - such as fatigue, fainting, headaches, heat cramps and heatstroke - may become more common with higher temperatures. The impact on infectious diseases, such as diarrhoea, is also predicted to increase with increased temperature.People with pre-existing diseases, such as HIV-AIDS and TB, children and the elderly, are especially vulnerable. People with suppressed immune systems, or developing immune systems in the case of children, may find it difficult to cope with warm temperatures.What is to be doneThere are two basic options - adapt and mitigate. Adaptation involves engineering ways to cope with our extreme weather and changes to climate. An example would be building more suitable housing or planting drought resistant crops. The other is to try to mitigate the impacts of climate change by reducing its manifestation.The 2015 Conference of the Parties, COP21 , to be held in Paris, France in November and December 2015 under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, will be a crucial meeting towards significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions during the 21st century.The correct strategy is the subject of complex debates especially for developing countries. But as a global community there can be no doubt that this is a critical issue. It will become a looming international crisis and world economies and populations will feel the pinch.This week, the World Health Organisation called all health professionals to action in the fight against climate change. The health community is being urged to advocate for a healthier and more sustainable future. Other sectors of society and communities have important roles to play in realising this goal and finding creative ways to mitigate and adapt.Caradee Yael Wright, Specialist Scientist (Public Health), South African Medical Research Council; Francois Engelbrecht, Research Group Leader, Climate Studies and Modelling and Environmental Health, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and Neville Sweijd, Acting Director and Operations Manager at ACCESS, Applied Centre for Climate and Earth Systems ScienceThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

Acclaimed singer and activist Ang\'c3\Â£9lique Kidjo is unstoppable. Last year the 55-year-old Grammy award- winner brought out a new album, Eve, and published a memoir, Spirit Rising. This week Kidjo, who is a goodwill ambassador for Unicef, attended the climate conference in Paris, where she spoke to journalist Philippa Garson. Why are you at Paris COP21 ? I'm here to speak about the children, especially disadvantaged children, who are the first victims of climate change. We adults don't think enough about the legacy we are going to leave behind for them. The drought - particularly in Africa - is not only affecting farmers: food scarcity is putting kids in danger. Parents often have to leave their children behind to find food, and they become victims of violence. Climate change is impacting on food, education, shelter - the ingredients that children need to grow into healthy adults. It's not just leaders of the world who can address climate change - every single person has to do something. Will Paris deliver for Africa? We Africans have to come up with our own solutions. It's about time we stopped counting on other people. If rich countries had thought about our well-being, our security, our education, we wouldn't be where we are today. We are still in debt to these countries - I don't know what created that debt - and we are the richest continent on the planet. If we had enough money to invest in renewable energy we wouldn't be waiting for help from the countries that pollute the most. Companies must invest with our governments, sit down with our leaders and come up with ideas that work for the welfare of everyone. Do you think there is a will on part of African leaders to tackle this problem? They don't have a choice. To stay in power you need Earth. You also need to stop corruption. Some leaders are realising this and making changes for the better. But we African people must be more transparent and ask for what we need. We have to be more vocal and active. We must ask ourselves what we are doing to keep our leaders accountable. What is your message to young girls on the continent? The problem is the powerlessness of mothers to protect their children - especially if they can't feed them. They turn their head to the side, knowing their girls are prostituting themselves for food. It breaks my heart to see this. My message to the girls is that this is no solution: they must stay in school. Even if you have only one meal a day you have to make the best of it. It's not easy, I know, but the future is in your hands. What you do with it is your choice. There are organisations like mine (Unicef) that can help. How can climate change activism be made "cool" for young people? As adults we forget that when you are young you play with death; you think you're eternal, that nothing will happen to you. The more dangerous the game, the more exciting it is. Until something happens and then you think - uh-oh - I almost died there. Then you start thinking about it differently. We cannot take away from the youth that restlessness but that doesn't mean we can't talk to them about climate change. They know what it is; they just don't have the words for it. Once climate change is part of their reality it will be something they can fight for, something greater than their community - because, really, everyone is impacted by it. Tell us about how you became an activist as well as a musician? Growing up in Benin, the first time I heard of slavery was through music. I was nine years old when Jimi Hendrix brought it to my attention. Through music I learnt that Africans had been taken away from Africa to create other people's wealth. I was 15 when I heard Winnie Mandela talking about Nelson Mandela in jail. My mom and dad had always told us not to judge people by their skin colour - that there's one human family we all belong to. I couldn't put it together at that age that somewhere on the continent a minority was putting a majority of people through horror. I was so angry with my parents. So I wrote a song called Azan Nan Kpe, which means "a day will come". My first draft was full of hate. My father said: "No, music has nothing to do with hate. I understand that you are hurt and angry and that you wrote this out of fear. But as an artist you can build bridges among people and among cultures. You can help people realise we are not that different from one another." So I went back and rewrote the song. How did Miriam Makeba inspire you? When I was a child, my mom and her friends had an organisation fighting for women's rights. They were singing Makeba's Malaika. They would drag me along with them because they couldn't sing. My mother still tells me I must keep singing that song to her until the day she dies. My brothers started a musical band when I was 7, 8 and I would sing with them. The band covered songs from the British, French and American pop and rock 'n' roll scene. But whenever a new album came out it was always by a male. Then came Aretha Franklin and I thought, "Wow, a black lady". And then Miriam arrived with Pata Pata. I thought, 'that's what I want to do'. How do you think South Africa is doing today? Why have you chosen New York as your home? My music pretty much brought me to New York. American music awakened my knowledge of this dark part of the continent's story. I knew that I wanted to explore the slave journey through music. I went to the US in 1997 and worked with (many artists from different cultural and music backgrounds). Then I went to Brazil, to the Caribbean, to Cuba. Doing those three albums (Oremi, Black Ivory Soul and Oyaya) took me 10 years. And I stayed. \</doc>

Your Excellency, Ms Asa Romson, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Sweden Your Excellency, Mr Anders Hagelberg, Ambassador of the Kingdom of Sweden to Republic of South Africa Your Excellency, Ms Faith Radebe, South Africa's Ambassador to the Kingdom of Sweden Honourable Ministers and Deputy Ministers present Distinguished guests Deputy Prime Minister, we are pleased to honour your invitation and wish to thank you for the warm welcome extended to me and the members of my delegation by the government and people of Sweden. The Government and people of South Africa consider Sweden to be a great friend of our country. This visit is testimony to the special ties that were formed in our common struggle for democracy in South Africa. The generosity of the Swedish people, who gave whole-hearted support in making available humanitarian aid and other means of support lies close to the hearts of South Africans. Sweden supported us without any conditions or motives apart from helping us usher democracy, deliver social justice, and uplift our people from years of deep suffering and exclusion. For that, we salute Sweden and remain grateful to its people. Your Excellency, I am pleased to Co-Chair this crucial 9th session of the Bi-National Commission (BNC) between our countries, and I have every intention to build on the sterling work of my predecessors. This BNC attests to the strong ties that our countries have built over several years on shared interests and mutual values. The South Africa-Sweden Bi-National Commission creates an opportunity for both sides to examine the scope of our relations over a wide range of issues. The political, economic, social and development issues will again be reviewed holistically, so that our relations can be deepened and strengthened for the mutual benefit of both countries. Your Excellency, Our national priorities are central to the attainment of our country's goal of uplifting all the people of South Africa. For South Africa, this Bi-National Commission forms part of our determined efforts in our young, cherished, vibrant democracy to take charge of our own destiny. In our quest to effectively deal with the challenges of poverty, inequality and unemployment, the need to grow and develop our economy, create jobs and develop skills that are supportive to the needs of the economy is critical. Our co-operation with a country like Sweden presents enormous opportunities in addressing these priorities whilst at the same time promoting trade and investment between the two countries. The issue of skills development and job creation, especially amongst South African youths, is a growing concern for the South African Government. As we are all aware, youth unemployment is a global phenomenon and requires innovative solutions. Sweden is also facing its own youth unemployment challenge which it is working hard to address. In our relationship, we can share ideas and develop strategies to address this common challenge. In this regard, I would like to express gratitude for the tangible benefits deriving from our bilateral cooperation and its positive impact on South Africa's key national priorities, especially in the field of education, the creation of employment, skills development and vocational training. I would like to acknowledge the broad based bilateral relationship between our respective countries and also the South Africa-EU Strategic Partnership which enables South Africa and Sweden to further deepen and broaden our relations. Your Excellency, Our deliberations this year take place at no ordinary time. Since the last meeting of the BNC two (2) years ago, events in the international arena have greatly changed both in positive and negative ways. We have witnessed the unfolding conflicts in several regions, especially in the Middle East and North Africa, with often tragic consequences for the many people seeking safe passage to Europe. This year also marks the historic 70th anniversary since the founding of the United Nations. South Africa is pleased that the General Assembly has adopted Agenda 2030 which sets out the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and targets. We are also on the eve of yet another important international meeting, the Climate Change negotiations ( COP21 ) which will take place in Paris later this year. These developments all provide a sound basis for the international community to work collectively to address the many challenges facing the world. It is important that we have an inclusive, transparent and representative multilateral system to address the urgent global challenges of sustainable development today, recognising the universality and central role of the UN. Through Africa's Agenda 2063 and its first 10 Year Action Plan, the continent's leaders are committed to the vision of a revival of Africa, determined to eradicate the evils of poverty and underdevelopment. In most of these areas, Sweden has proven to be a true friend of the African continent. Your commitment to stability, progress and sustainable development, on the basis of an equal and constructive partnership, is highly valued. As South Africans, and Africans, we seek to integrate ourselves ever more fully within the rapidly globalising world economy. We are confident that we will succeed because we have dependable, strategic partners such as Sweden which will continue to be with us to achieve higher levels of growth and employment and increase the international competitiveness of our economy. Let me also at this stage acknowledge the role of Sweden in its attempts to support all efforts that try to bring and consolidate international peace and security through multilateral mechanisms. Both our countries are known for their commitment to the principle of multilateralism and working through institutions like the UN and in our respective regions, the AU and EU. Through our continued collaboration and our discussions here today, we will be able to enhance and foster the constructive and fruitful relationship that both our countries derive from the Bi-National Commission and its programmes. I look forward to the reports from the various Committees which will direct the path for our future cooperation especially in the fields of, environment, trade and investment, Information and Communications Technology (ICT), energy, science and technology, skills development and in the maritime sector. I am reminded that our Bi-National Commission is taking place during a month of birth in this city of one of the world's greatest inventors, Alfred Nobel. October is also the month of birth of Oliver Tambo, an exceptional leader of our people who worked intimately for many years with a hero of both our countries, Sweden's late Prime Minister- Olof Palme. I hope that our deliberations and efforts to create a better South Africa, a better Africa, and a better world will be guided and inspired by the inventiveness, imagination, and humanitarian values that we remember Alfred Nobel, Olof Palme, and Oliver Tambo for. I thank you. \</doc>

Alice Dhladhla wrinkles her nose slightly as she opens the biogas digester buried in the earth. As she explains the "miracle" under way inside it, she smiles, fascinated. From the scraps of decaying food that Khangezile Primary School, a no-fees school, has tossed inside, invisible bacteria are making methane gas, which is used to cook meals for the children and to help light and heat its classrooms. "It's amazing isn't it?" enthuses Dhladhla, who is part of a renewable energy and climate change resilience project at the KwaThema school that is funded by the EU and being run with Oxfam, GenderCC-Southern Africa and Earthlife Africa. The project provides women like Dhladhla with the skills to manage and use natural resources - such as solar panels, rainwater harvesting and organic vegetable gardens - to overcome the effects of climate change on their lives and help improve their communities. "If all of us do these little things like this, we'll make a difference," Dhladhla says. "So many people in KwaThema want to know how they can do what we are doing at the school to reduce their energy bills and to grow their own food. "I worry about what world we are leaving behind to our children... The government needs to do more." This week, civil society organisations, representing ordinary people like Dhladhla, crammed seats for two days of public hearings at Parliament on how South Africa would deal with climate change. The portfolio committee on environmental affairs called the hearing to garner public input on the government's draft Intended National Determined Contributions (INDCs), which are to be tabled in December at the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris. The country's proposed measures to adapt to and mitigate climate change has come under scrutiny from environmental groups, who criticise it as being too weak and who have called for stronger commitments. Nicole Loser, from the Centre for Environmental Rights, said at the public hearings that the draft INDCs would make it impossible to meet proposed targets to combat a warmer world. "Already our people face significant threats to their health because of industrial activity, particularly poor water and air quality as a result of mining, coal-fired power generation and collapsing water treatment infrastructure. "Much of the costs - health costs, and impaired economic development - is borne by the state and borne disproportionately by the poor and vulnerable in South Africa. The impacts of climate change will only make this worse." Bobby Peek, the director of groundWork, agreed, saying: "Costs to mitigate climate change need to be internalised by the government if thousands of lives are to be saved. "Climate change is upon us and while some quite serious damage is unavoidable, certain losses can be reduced in the short term. "These can be achieved by ensuring clean air regulations, safer working conditions and modern energy options for people at risk due to carbon-intensive forms of energy. All these measures will save lives, but it will take political will to move towards an equitable and clean energy system." Peek told the Saturday Star that while he welcomed the public hearings, "these meetings shouldn't happen on the eve of the country going to COP 21 ". The government has to submit its final INDCs by October 1. "The government has clearly articulated one thing internationally in climate policy and has done something contrary in its energy policy with regards to health. "The increase in coal (use) and coal-related infrastructure is a complete contradiction to what is needed at COP for the world and to South Africa's climate policy." Dr Tristen Taylor, from Earthlife Africa Johannesburg, said: "In effect, South Africa's supposed commitments will mean the country will continue with the same industrial policy. "It's this same approach to economic growth that is what needs to change drastically if any progress is to be made in meaningful climate policy." Loser agreed. "It's clear that South Africa is operating at cross-purposes, expressing international and domestic commitments to fight climate change while simultaneously adopting policies and making decisions that defeat these objectives." The environmental affairs committee noted that the submissions were characterised by "robust debate". The committee said later: "The majority of submissions recognised the best way to decrease greenhouse gas emissions in South Africa was by stopping dependence of the country's energy generation on coal resources." \</doc>

Several commentators have remarked that current conditions in the world and in business are characterised by VUCA: volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. From where I am sitting, it certainly feels that way. In business, we face relentless pressure and change from within our industry, from new technology, changing customer demographics and preferences, and increasing regulation, and from the broader operating environment. Over and above all of this, the world faces another challenge that is quite unique. Climate change is |distinctive temporally, because the consequences span generations. It is distinctive spatially, because impacts have no respect for borders. And it is distinctive in its irreversibility, because once certain thresholds are breached there is no going back. Possibly the most |difficult aspect of climate change is that it is caused not by evil intentions or deliberate selfishness, but mostly by our well-meaning efforts to provide affordable energy, food and higher living standards. What is needed is a collective resolve to deal with the reality of climate change that has no historical precedent. Understanding the causes, impacts and possible responses to climate change has already been an unparalleled scientific endeavour. Although the basic principles of climate science were firmly established a century ago, and underscored by a US National Academy of Science study in 1979, the last two-and-a-half decades have seen the topic subject to further scientific examination, scrutiny and peer review unlike almost anything else. No process is perfect, but the work overseen by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is surely the best effort the world could have mounted to understand the complexity of the challenge. And the message from the IPCC is emphatic: the world needs to take rapid and decisive action to avoid dangerous interference with the climate system. This means we need to drastically reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). Thus far, the rest of the world, as represented by our leaders and |policymakers, has been unable to translate the scientific recommendations into actions that are commensurate with the challenge. December this year, at COP 21 in Paris, presents another chance to agree upon a pathway to a low-carbon economy. We cannot be sure that the negotiators will succeed where 20 previous attempts fell short, but we really need them to because time is not on our side. For this reason, we must lend our support. Some form of globally binding agreement will imply sacrifices from all of us and changes in the way we pursue certain objectives. Longer-term gains nearly always require shorter-term pain. But, we really do not have any alternative. Responding to climate change is not just the "right thing to do". It is also the most economically rational thing to do. Fortunately, continued advances in renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy storage technology are also making it increasingly achievable and cost-effective. South Africa, like the rest of the world, can now see a credible pathway for the continued expansion of energy services while greatly curtailing GHG emissions. In our own climate change journey, we have found it useful to apply the lens of a carbon budget. Budgets are something that we are all very familiar with, and we firmly believe in the discipline that budgeting instills. We can all take a step in the right direction by supporting our negotiators and legislators to carry a South African commitment to Paris that will enhance the likelihood of a successful agreement. And we can all look ahead to the exciting and beneficial opportunities inherent in the transition to a low-carbon economy. We are certainly doing just that. Please remember - there simply is no Planet B. l Brown is chief executive of Nedbank \</doc>

The proposed accord was just hours from a final vote when the glitch was spotted. Someone had changed a single word in the draft text - from a "should" to a "shall" - and suddenly the entire climate deal appeared at risk of faltering. US Secretary of State John Kerry phoned his old friend, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, in exasperation over a tiny revision that implied huge new legal and financial obligations. "We can't do this," Kerry warned. Less than four hours later, the accord was approved with the bang of a gavel. A bit of diplomatic finesse had excised the troublesome word and helped clinch a historic agreement. The formal adoption of the accord late on Saturday was greeted with applause and cheers by thousands of weary delegates to the 21st Conference of Parties ( COP21 ) climate talks in Paris. But the happy conclusion was preceded by days and weeks of tough bargaining, along with occasional flashes of drama. Over the 13 days of the climate talks, and for months before it, negotiators faced the daunting task of forging consensus among government officials from nearly 200 countries - some of whom had been initially sceptical or even hostile to parts of the proposal. US and European officials prepared the ground for an agreement during months of heavy lobbying and deal-making in scattered capitals. But while the talks were calmer than past climate negotiations, closing the deal was at times a diplomatic high-wire act, the success of which was never assured until the final moments. "It took hard work, grit and guts," said Jennifer Morgan, the director of the climate programme at the World Resources Institute. Diplomats and observers who witnessed the proceedings from close range credited a handful of French, UN and US officials who worked tirelessly over two weeks to keep the negotiations on track during the most difficult phases. With French prestige on the line, Fabius and Laurence Tubiana, France's ambassador to the UN on climate change, kept a tight rein on the proceedings to prevent minor disputes from turning into revolts, which has happened famously in the past. French officials insisted on continuing with the plans to hold the conference in Paris despite the terrorist attacks in the city two weeks earlier that killed 130. Diplomats worked feverishly to ensure many of the key struggles were resolved before the conference began. Obama administration officials pushed hard for the unusual "bottom-up" design of the draft climate accord, in which each country would submit its own, individualised plan for reducing or limiting emissions from fossil-fuel burning. The pledges would be non-binding, but for the first time, all countries, rich and poor, would be asked to make a contribution. US officials initially hoped as many as 100 countries would submit pledges. By the second week of the talks, 186 capitals had done so. A breakthrough, diplomats said, was the US-Chinese agreement in November last year to jointly announce ambitious pledges to reduce their countries' emissions, setting an example for others as the world's two largest economies and biggest emitters. Kerry travelled to India to enlist Prime Minister Narendra Modi's support. "The US leaned hard on China and India to step up, while standing firm on its bottom lines," said Elliot Diringer, an ex-Clinton administration environmental official and now Center for Climate and Energy Solutions executive vice-president. Kerry, a seasoned hand at climate diplomacy, flew to Paris during the second week of negotiations and remained there for the final five days, using his personal stature and long-time relationships with dozens of ministers at the talks to help keep wavering delegations in line. "Kerry had plenty of other crises to deal with, but his presence at the talks was important," said Durwood Zaelke, an expert in international environmental law and an observer to the negotiations. "And still it was a real slog to get to where we got." The hard bargaining began midway through the second week. After an all-night session last Wednesday appeared to make progress, the French convened an "Indaba of Solution" on Thursday, but that failed to make significant gains. The US team, led by Kerry and chief climate negotiator Todd Stern, struggled to fend off demands from small island states and other poorer countries for guaranteed "loss and damage" compensation, essentially payment for negative impacts of climate change. But the Obama administration would not contemplate such an open-ended financial obligation that Congress would have to approve and US citizens would have to pay for. Kerry sought to assuage the island states' concerns by announcing a doubling of US grants to help poorer countries harden their infrastructure against the effects of rising sea levels. The US delegation also agreed to an aspirational goal of keeping future temperature increases below 1.5\'c2\'b0C. By Friday afternoon, India and China expressed support for the latest draft text, as did Saudi Arabia, a country that has played a spoiler role in previous talks. Delegations began to push back against suggestions for further changes to the accord for fear that the agreement would unravel. US officials were sensing a growing optimism for an accord. At one point, when Stern walked into the main plenary hall with the representative of the Marshall Islands, delegates seated nearby broke into spontaneous applause. At a previous climate negotiation in Bali eight years earlier, the lead US negotiator had been booed off the floor. Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser, said the difference was less about American popularity and more about a trust built over many months. "Unlike Kyoto or Copenhagen talks, the Paris agreement is built to last," Bledsoe said, "because it includes detailed emissions pledges by all major nations and clear rules to monitor those emissions." Yet, on Saturday afternoon, as US officials pored over what they believed was the final draft, they found the tiny revision that threatened to derail the negotiations in the talks' waning hours. Substitution of "shall" for "should" in a section that spelt out financial obligations was a potential deal-breaker. Had someone slipped in the language in an attempt to sabotage the deal? "We made it crystal-clear that every text up until this particular one had a different wording," Kerry said. His message to Fabius was: "Either it changes, or President (Barack) Obama and the US will not be able to support this agreement." More hours passed as the Kerry team tried to investigate how the wording had been changed and if they could fix the text without a risky reopening of the proposal for further debate. After the call to Fabius, US and French officials decided the word change had been accidental. As such, it could be handled as an ordinary typographical error and erased at the discretion of the conference leader. Just after 6pm on Saturday, the full assembly was convened to give a final okay to the deal. A list of technical corrections was read and approved without debate. Ninety minutes later, the Paris climate agreement, now whole, was declared adopted. But after the applause died down, Fabius took up the microphone to acknowledge yet another omission: he had neglected to sound the gavel to mark the pact's approval. Fabius picked up a small wooden mallet and gave the podium a resounding whack. The hall erupted in cheers. Now it was truly official. - Washington Post \</doc>

Speech by the Minister of Environmental Affairs, Minister Edna Molewa, at the University of Johannesburg Public Lecture on Climate Change Deputy Vice Chancellor: academic, Professor Angina Parekh, Deans of various Faculties, Lecturers, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, Good Evening, It is an honour for me to be addressing you this evening; at a time when the international community is negotiating a new legal climate change regime that is scheduled to be completed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, the 21st Conference of the Parties. The agreement hoped to be concluded at the conference will be the culmination of a four year negotiation process that was initiated in Durban in 2011 at the 17th Conference of the Parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This year in Paris, all Parties to the UN Climate Convention are expected to adopt a protocol, legal instrument or agreed outcome with legal force in order to conclude the Durban Mandate. The agreement will be applicable to all Parties, and will come into effect from 2020. On behalf of President Jacob Zuma and the South African government I would like to thank our hosts, the University of Johannesburg, for affording us this important public platform to outline our efforts in addressing one of the most critical issues of our time. I have been invited here this evening to brief South Africans on our positioning and preparedness for the UN Climate Change talks in Paris. More broadly, I have also been asked to outline the South African government's progress in transitioning the country along a low-carbon, inclusive, climate resilient growth path. This evening's lecture is part of our wider public participation process as government of mobilising business, civil society, government agencies and citizens for climate action. Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fifth Assessment Report of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that each of the past 3 decades has been successively warmer than the preceding decades since 1850; even warmer than during the Industrial Revolution! It also confirms that human influence on the climate system is absolutely clear, and that the more the climate system is disrupted, the more humanity risks severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts. This tells us that despite global action to limit greenhouse emissions, they haven't been enough. We will continue to experience the impacts of climate change and that they are intensifying. One need only observe the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events around South Africa to conclude climate change has long become a measurable reality. Some parts of the country are in the grip of severe drought, while others are having more rain, leading to flash floods. Although we are ultimately all impacted by the effects of a changing climate, such effects are not being felt evenly around the world. Along with other developing countries, South Africa and Africa is at greater risk because of low levels of development and that their climate change adaptation efforts aren't on the scale of developed countries. These impacts threaten to severely undermine the developmental gains made by our own young democracy in the past twenty-one years. Climate change affects nearly every cog in the many wheels that keep this country running: from healthcare, to agriculture and forestry, to biodiversity and ecosystems, to infrastructure and human settlements, to defense, to water and sanitation Allow me for a moment to paint a picture of what this means in real terms. Extreme weather results in drought: which in turn leads to diminished agricultural production capacity and loss of food security, especially for people living in rural areas. Irregular rainfall patterns can lead to an increase in human and animal disease, including cholera, malaria and diarrhoea; thereby putting immense strain on the public health system. Flash flooding causes damage to crucial infrastructure like roads and telecommunications, resulting in social and economic losses. Flooding of low-lying coastal areas as a result of sea-level rise results in the loss of life and human settlements, as well as destruction of mangroves and river deltas. Groundwater can become contaminated, rendering areas uninhabitable for communities reliant on borehole water for drinking and crop irrigation, including subsistence crops. South Africa and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Effectively managing the impacts of climate change requires a response that builds and sustains South Africa's social, economic and environmental resilience as well as our emergency response capacity. This response is guided by principles set out in our Constitution and Bill of Rights. The multilateral agreement that will be concluded at the Paris negotiations in December, must be ambitious, fair and effective, and must facilitate the transition to a low carbon and climate resilient future. It is a future that facilitates global co-operation to address a global challenge, in a manner that also recognises common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. This is a principle contained in the UNFCCC which was the very first international treaty to address the global challenge of a changing climate. South Africa is one of 196 State parties to the UNFCCC, which was adopted in 1992 and came into force in 1994. This framework Convention sets out obligations for all countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to the unavoidable adverse effects of climate change and report on national implementation. It also sets out obligations for developed countries to support the efforts of developing countries with finance, technology and capacity building. Importantly, the Convention notes that the largest share of historical and, until recently, current emissions - originate in developed countries. The Convention's first basic principle is that developed countries should not only take the lead in reducing greenhouse gas emissions - but that they should also take the lead in supporting climate change activities in developing countries to take action on and adapt to the impacts of climate change. In the Convention there is an implicit recognition of both the vulnerability of poorer countries to the effects of climate change, and the right of poorer nations to economic development. From our perspective, we have repeatedly emphasized that our climate change response must balance making a fair contribution to the global effort to stabilise greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations - with consideration of the economic and social developmental needs of our country. Allow me to offer some brief perspective on the guiding policy instruments as well as milestones achieved in the lead-up to the Paris climate talks. The road to Cop 21 By 1995, the evidence outlined in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change clearly indicated that much more needed to be done to reduce emissions. Therefore a further subsidiary treaty - the Kyoto Protocol, was negotiated and concluded in 1997, and is ratified by 192 Parties. Since at that time developed countries had the most responsibility for the cause of climate change as well as the most capability to address the crisis, the Kyoto Protocol placed legally binding commitments on developed countries to reduce their emissions in absolute terms and enabled them to meet some of their legal obligation through investment in low carbon sustainable development in developing countries. The first commitment period was from 2008 to 2012. However the measures contained in Kyoto proved to be insufficient largely because firstly the US with some 25% of global emissions did not join Kyoto. Secondly, due to the dramatic economic growth and consequent increases in greenhouse gas emissions from developing countries, especially from emerging economies like China, India, Brazil, South Korea and South Africa. This emboldened developed countries to challenge the legal obligations to cut emissions under Kyoto, charging that the current system was both unfair and ineffective. They further contended that not only did they contribute less than 30% of global emissions, but that they were at a relative economic disadvantage because the US and major emerging developing country economies -particularly the BASIC countries - only had voluntary non-legal commitments. Although not explicitly stated, it was clear the reasons underpinning developed countries' reluctance to take on legally binding Kyoto commitments lay in international economic competiveness concerns, rather than any environmental or social impact concerns. In fact due to these issues, by the beginning of the first commitment period in 2008, the Kyoto Protocol included less than 40% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. And since the US did not join Kyoto, many other developing countries refused to join the Protocol's second commitment period agreed to at COP17. As a result, the second commitment period that started in 2013 and ends in 2020 now only covers less than 15% of world greenhouse gas emissions. These shortcomings were clearly evident by the time the Kyoto Protocol came into force in 2005. At this Climate Change Conference it was agreed that solutions to these shortcomings would be explored in an international dialogue process, which was co-chaired by South Africa and Australia. This became a two- track negotiation in 2007 under the Bali Road Map. That two- year negotiating process concluded at COP 15 in Copenhagen in 2009, without a multilateral agreement. South Africa's position has been that efforts to protect the atmosphere should be shared fairly among countries in accordance with their "Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities, and social and economic conditions". This principle is perhaps the most important when considering South Africa's position for the Paris climate talks and what we hope to achieve. Copenhagen did however note a political accord reached by 30 Heads of State, which focused on this central and politically divisive principle. Among the outcomes of this delicate political balancing act were: Commitment to a global goal to limit temperature increase to below 2 degree Celsius and a review of the adequacy of this global goal in 2015 Absolute quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets for developed countries Relative Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMA's) for developing countries; with the extent of actions depending on the extent of support A transparency and accountability framework for both absolute targets and relative actions as well as the support provided for developing country action Equal priority for adaptation A technology development and transfer mechanism and the building of capacity to implement both adaptation and mitigation actions in developing countries. South Africa's Copenhagen pledge was to take nationally appropriate mitigation action to enable a 34% deviation below its "business as usual" emissions growth trajectory by 2020, and a 42% deviation below the "business as usual" emissions growth trajectory by 2025. This level of effort would enable South Africa's emissions to peak between 2020 and 2025, plateau for approximately a decade, and decline in absolute terms thereafter. We further clarified - as we have consistently done, that the extent to which this outcome can be achieved depends on the extent to which developed countries will meet their commitment to provide financial, capacity building and technology support to developing countries. The political agreement of the Copenhagen Accord was formalised in the Cancun Agreement in 2010 and extends to 2020. Post-Copenhagen, two competing paradigms for a future global regime emerged. On the one hand, the top-down model of a comprehensive/inclusive, multilateral rule based, legally binding regime with levels of ambition informed by science. On the other hand, a bottom up, pledge and review model of incremental domestically determined policies, measures and rules (that may or may not be domestically legal) with the levels of ambition being informed by national priorities and circumstances and which are internationalised through the UNFCCC reporting and review procedures. The 2011 Durban Climate Change Conference marked a turning point in the negotiations and called for bolder actions by all governments. Specifically Durban had to resolve a set of complex and inter-related issues, including: Implementing the Cancun Agreement up to 2020 Closing the ambition gap between the Copenhagen/Cancun commitments and pledges, and what science requires, and The future of the international climate change regime beyond 2020 Among the vexing outstanding issues was how to give effect to the principle of equity in the allocation of the burden and costs between developed and developing countries - all the while recognising that a continued degree of differentiation is central to developing countries who still face challenges. The Durban COP17 was a watershed in several respects. Firstly, the financial and technology mechanisms to support the implementation of the Cancun Agreement were outlined. Secondly, bolder actions by all governments were called for, in order to close the ambition gap between the Copenhagen/Cancun commitments and pledges, and what science requires. Thirdly, it was here in South Africa that governments clearly accepted the need to negotiate a fresh, universal, dynamic and evolving legal agreement to deal with the climate change crisis beyond 2020. Durban set a new long-term pathway for the development of a fair, ambitious and legally binding future multi-lateral and rules-based global climate change system that balances climate and development imperatives. This will address six key issues, namely climate change mitigation, adaptation, and the finance, technology and capacity building support required for developing country implementation, as well as arrangements for transparency of action and support. Subsequent advances have been made in COP 18 in Doha in 2012, COP 19 in Warsaw in 2013, and COP 20 in Lima in 2014.The Warsaw COP in particular made a call for all Parties to the UNFCCC to intensify their national efforts in dealing with climate change. The road to INDC's To this end, Parties agreed to prepare and submit Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs by October 2015 for a period beyond 2020, which would be captured in the Paris agreement. INDC's will be crucial to the success of the UN climate deal, both in 2015 and beyond. It is the first time all countries, rich or poor, have been obliged to come forward with commitments to manage their greenhouse gas emissions. They are also an opportunity for countries to design policies that can make economic growth and climate objectives mutually reinforcing. I am pleased to announce here this evening that South Africa is finalising its consultation processes and will be submitting its INDC before the 1 October deadline. Over the past three months, we have been consulting countrywide through a series of provincial conferences, engagements and stakeholder workshops with business, labour and civil society. I'm told that UJ was represented, by the Department of Anthropology and Development Studies, and that there was representation from a number of other academic institutions in the different provincial conferences. South Africa's INDC includes three distinct components on mitigation, adaptation and the means of implementation. It builds on our 2009 emission reduction pledge, and presents an emission reduction trajectory range for 2025 and 2030. It further sets a number of national adaptation goals, including the development of a National Adaptation Strategy and plan, the strengthening of institutional capacity for addressing adaptation at all levels, and developing a national early warning system. This contribution to the global effort to address climate change is based on our National Climate Change Response Policy. Our policy is guided by the overarching principle of sustainable development, which is the cornerstone of Vision 2030 contained in South Africa's National Development Plan (NDP). As I said earlier, South Africa's approach to addressing climate change balances our contribution as a responsible global citizen to the international effort to curb emissions, with the need to adress economic growth, job creation, and poverty alleviation. South Africa Climate Change Response South Africa has been stepping up efforts to reduce this country's vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. I will list but a few of the many initiatives and policy instruments we have in place: To ensure that our country's food, water, energy security and infrastructure are not negatively impacted by climate change we have developed Long Term Adaptation Scenarios, and climate change vulnerability assessments, to assess sectoral, cross-sectoral and geographic impacts and adaptation options. These processes have a specific focus on communities most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, particularly the indigent, rural dwellers, and women, South Africa has finalised the ratification process of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol that was agreed to in Durban Work has been done with business and industry and other stakeholders to analyse the emission reduction potential in key economic sectors, to establish a Desired Emission Reduction system, and to understand the potential social and economic opportunities and impacts of South Africa's transition to a lower carbon economy and society. Our Green and Blue Economy Strategies provide the strategic directive to attract investment in the green and blue sectors, create jobs, improve the country's competitiveness and overall promote equitable, inclusive, sustainable and environmentally-sound economic growth, Three years ago a Green Transport Strategy was still at the drawing board. Today our national green transport flagship include ground-breaking urban public transport initiatives, renewable energy fuel alternatives and the shift of freight from road to rail, Through the national Green Fund, we have adopted an innovative approach to catalysing investment in green programmes, South Africa sits on the boards of key international climate finance mechanisms, where we have championed the course of direct access as an innovative way of developing domestic national institutional capacity, We are in the process of ensuring international accreditation for national Implementing agencies for the Green Climate Fund SANBI is the accredited National Implementing Entity for the Adaptation Fund which so far has approved two South African projects. The first, in the uMgungundlovu District Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal aims to increase resilience of vulnerable communities through interventions such as early warning systems, climate smart agriculture and climate proofing settlements. The second will deliver direct adaptation benefits in the Namakwa and Mopani Districts in Northern Cape and Limpopo Provinces respectively. These projects will provide an opportunity for South Africa to learn how to develop and implement high impact climate change adaptation projects that make a real difference in people's lives, The Ministry of Public Works is leading a programme to unlock the so far largely untapped potential for energy savings in public buildings at national, provincial and local level, Three years ago, renewable energy projects were small and lacking investment. Today there is rapid uptake of large-scale renewable energy technologies through the Renewable Energy Independent Power Purchase Programme (REIPPP). So far under the REIPPP programme, 6 105 MW have already been allocated, of which 3 725 MW must be commissioned by November 2016. Already, 1 965 MWs is in full operation, This shift towards renewable and cleaner energy sources is outlined in the Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP. Importantly however, the IRP is a sustainable energy mix that includes coal, renewables, alternative energy, natural gas and nuclear power. By 2030 we aim to have decreased fossil energy demand significantly, creating alternative renewables through new technological innovation, good behavioural practices and a public commitment to more efficient, sustainable and equitable energy use. Ladies and Gentlemen, As you have just heard, South Africa is not resting on its laurels waiting for the outcome of the Paris negotiations. With the support of our local and international partners, we have evidenced the political will, means and commitment to address the impacts of climate change with real, tangible benefits for those most vulnerable. Our efforts will ultimately contribute to the attainment of our national priorities and those of the soon to be Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). What we hope to get from Paris Firstly, a recognition that climate change is a global problem, requiring a global solution, which can only be effectively addressed multilaterally, under the broad based legitimacy of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Secondly, a recognition that the multilateral solution is only relevant as long as it is responsive to the scientific evidence. And only if its rules-base provides for the consistent setting and implementation of commitments that in turn require verifiable tracking of progress towards what the science requires. The Paris outcome must therefore ensure that regular reviews of implementation against both commitments made and what the science requires - are undertaken. If we do not recognise the mutually dependent roles of science and rules for the success of the Paris agreement, we will miss this historic opportunity. Thirdly, a recognition that we live in an unequal world. An ambitious response in line with science is only possible if Paris agreement is fair and equitable for all. Developed countries maintain that the world has changed since 1992 and wish the Paris legal agreement to reflect current global realities, particularly with respect to developing countries who are now major economic competitors. As the current chair of the Group of 77 plus China, we emphasise that the principles of the Convention must apply, in particular the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR). South Africa as a responsible global citizen has played an instrumental role in these negotiations - fully aligning with the common African position. Together with our alliances in BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India, China) we continue to coordinate a strong developing country voice. In this regard we are rallying other BASIC countries to support the African position and further strengthen South South coordination and cooperation. Financing Post-2020 International finance and investment is a crucial element of the Paris agreement - to be provided to those countries that are not only vulnerable to climate change, but also least responsible and without the means to transition to low carbon economies. Considering that the Paris agreement is expecting more commitment from developing countries despite their ongoing developmental challenges, it is worrying that there are currently no indications of the scale support to be provided from developing countries for post-2020 action. This inequitable balance has the potential to undermine confidence in the Paris process. While we welcome recent commitments to the capitalization of the Green Climate Fund to fill the existing finance gap we urge donor countries to fully implement their pledges as well as to replenish other climate funds such as the Adaptation Fund, the Least Developed Country Fund, and the Special Climate Change Fund. On the matter of post-2020 scale of support, we believe that as a minimum, developed countries should communicate their support undertakings for the period 2020 to 2030, even if only at indicative levels at this stage. Fourthly, a recognition that less mitigation means more adaptation. In this context, adaptation is a global responsibility that must be treated with the same priority as mitigation. This is the basis of the Africa Group's proposal for the Paris agreement to outline a Global Adaptation Goal, which is reciprocally linked to the mitigation goal of 2 degrees Celsius. Conclusion Ladies and Gentlemen, President Jacob Zuma in his address at the opening of the Department of Environmental Affairs' new green building last October said: together we can build the biggest mitigation buffer against climate change\'c2\Â£6 We can save our country and the world for future generations. Our economy will become resilient to the possible effects of climate change only when we take bold steps. It is indeed bold steps that are required if we are to achieve an equitable regime that reinforces multilateralism - and offers hope to those most vulnerable. In her 2004 lecture on the occasion of receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize, the late Kenyan environmentalist and social justice activist Dr Wangari Maathai called for a global state of restlessness: Those of us who witness the degraded state of the environment and the suffering that comes with, she wrote: cannot afford to be complacent, We continue to be restless\'c2\Â£6 If we really carry the burden, we are driven to action. We cannot tire or give up. We owe it to the present and future generations of all species to rise up and walk!" At Paris we have within our grasp the means to build an ambitious, fair and binding agreement that strengthens the global approach to addressing one of the greatest challenges facing humanity and its survival. I thank you! \</doc>

We are at the beginning of 2016 caught in a fearful gridlock of strategic contradictions... On the one hand we are in one of the tighter economic contractions in recent history, characterised by some of the lowest growth rates in modern times with the general scent of austerity accompanying most national budget policies - around the world. Much of the global economic woes are laid at the doorstep of China s declining growth rate, the lower prediction, from The Conference Board of which is 3.7% in their Global Economic Outlook 2016 (the IMF forecast is 6.3%). Of course in the same report, the USA is described Â£ bright spot in a weak global economy' with a predicted growth rate of 2%. The general commentary points to an increased Sino-consumption pattern as a core remedy to the global economy. This of course is a vicious circle. China s consumption patterns depends intimately on its earnings from exports. Exports to exactly those countries that can no longer afford these Chinese exports as their own economy is in decline because of lower Sino consumption trends. The chicken is not getting enough nutrition to lay the egg to grow into the next chicken. On both sides of the import/export divide. Further, the added conundrum is also the primary contradiction. The World Economic Forum cites the failure of adaptation and mitigation measures to global climate change as the number one risk to the global economy in 2016. This supersedes last year s number one risk, namely, water crisis and comes on the back of a lukewarm result at COP 21 , in Paris in December 2015. Fundamental contradiction Core to any adaptation and mitigation strategy is a radical shift to lower consumption patterns from local to global levels. Herein lies the fundamental contradiction. If the touted solution of increased Chinese and concomitant global buying patterns as the fundamental remedy to the current economic crisis is realised, then this must mean two steps backward for sustainable development and the global climate change agenda. And yet these conversations occur rampantly in the media as if they have no relationship at all, and sometimes even by the same commentators. If ever we needed innovation and creativity, this is that time. This conundrum is mirrored in the water sector, and perhaps water can pave the way with an innovative strategy. South Africa s ability to meet the entirety of its national water and sanitation objectives, including the sustainable development goals, requires a significant quantum of new investment in both infrastructure and more rigorous operations and maintenance regimes. The traditional model of increased sales to realise sufficient funds for these interventions, ala the global economy, is clearly contrary to the overall objective of sustained and predictable water security. In fact, many of the solutions we have been punting in South Africa, from an ability to deal decisively with leaks and non-revenue water to large scale adoption of low flush and dry new sanitation to more efficient irrigation methods and practice to more efficient water use in industry and mining all point to lower sales volumes. But, this is on the back of an increased recognition of value. Three pillars The key to financial sustainability in the water sector in a sustainable development paradigm rest on three important pillars. The first is water being priced in relation to its value and in line with use efficiency. High efficiency use must be incentivised and low efficiency use must be penalised - at all levels, in all use sectors. The second is that operations and maintenance optimisation must be a legitimate component of the infrastructure budget. The third is an expansion of capability and opportunity to radically increase the size of the water resources team. It is time to open up the discussion on the sustainability of the model of the state as the sole water service provider. The Minister of Water and Sanitation, Nomvula Mokonyane, has been clear that this is not the same as privatisation and Finance Minister, Pravin Gordhan in the 2016 budget speech, has opened the doors to innovative models. We must use them. This is not only about increasing the funding pool for water investments, but can also genuinely increase the size of the South African water team in a manner that guarantees our water security into the future to stimulate and enable the growth we vie for. This water security must be achieved in a manner that ensures a realisation of the constitutional imperative of meeting the basic water and sanitation needs in a reliable and dignified manner for all who call South Africa home. \</doc>

Fellow South Africans, We are nearing the end of another momentous year in the history of our young democracy. This is a time when we can collectively reflect on the progress made during the year and commit ourselves further to address the challenges that face our country and its people. We do so with a view to consolidate the gains we have thus far made while sparing neither strength nor effort in confronting the challenges facing our country - poverty, unemployment and inequality. In a difficult global economic environment, we have been working to strengthen our economy through investment in infrastructure, providing support to key industrial sectors, and developing our agricultural value chain. Working together, we have stabilised the supply of electricity to our homes, schools, hospitals, factories and businesses. Working together with key role players in labour, business, communities and government, we have made significant progress towards the introduction of a national minimum wage as one of the key mechanisms to reduce income inequality. These deliberations have been part of a broader process among all social partners to improve the labour relations environment, which we expect to complete in the new year. President Jacob Zuma has led an important engagement with major stakeholders in addressing key issues arising from students protests around the cost of higher education. We are confident that working together with students organisations and management we will find long term solutions to all these challenges. Working together as South Africans, we will be able to realise the call that was made in the Freedom Charter for higher education and technical training to be open to all. It is a matter of concern that largely peaceful protest has on occasion been marred by the destruction of critical property of schools, libraries, clinics and damage to other community infrastructure. As a society, we need to remain resolute in our conviction that in a democratic society, protest must take place within the framework of the law. We must work together to protect these community structures for the benefit of future generations. As part of the African Union, we continue to work within the framework of Agenda 2063 to ensure the political and economic renewal of our continent based on good political and economic governance. Working together with sister countries in the SADC region we have continued to consolidate regional integration efforts which will add momentum towards building united, prosperous and better Africa. Inspired by the vision of providing African solutions to African problems we remain part of efforts by SADC, the African Union, regional economic communities and the UN to help bring peace and stability in those countries afflicted by conflict. These include the Kingdom of Lesotho, Burundi and South Sudan. As part of the family of nations and working together with like-minded countries, we have persisted in our efforts to bring about a fundamental transformation of the United Nations and other institutions of global governance. Our country participated at the highest level in the COP 21 Climate Change Conference in Paris, France. We have begun to feel the effects of climate change, which is impacting on water security, food security and economic development. We welcome every resolution taken by the international community to limit the effects of climate change on humanity as a whole and developing countries in particular. South Africa was honoured to recently host the first Forum for China-Africa Cooperation held on on our soil as well as the African Union Summit earlier this year. The hosting of events of these magnitudes, coupled with the world-class infrastructure at our disposal, is an expression of the confidence that the world has in our country and its people. We take this opportunity to thank you all for your contributions in making South Africa a better place for all who live in it. We extend our thoughts and prayers to those families who lost loved ones during the year. We share in your pain and sorrow. We salute our men and women in uniform who toil day and night to assure us of peace and security in our homes and communities. We thank our national sporting teams for continuing to proudly hoist our national flag in international sporting events. Your contribution to nation-building and social cohesion is deeply appreciated. As we embark on journeys to our various destinations let us ensure we observe the rules of the road. Arrive alive must be a way of life for all South Africans. I thank you. Issued by The Presidency \</doc>

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) - an international economic grouping of 34 countries - has traditionally been pro-fossil fuels, but has been speaking more favourably about renewable energy in the last year. Speaking at the London School of Economics this past weekend, Angel Gurr\'c3\Â£da - its organisation's secretary-general - said countries needed to stop building new coal-fired power stations. "Governments need to be seriously sceptical about whether new coal provides a good deal for their citizens." Instead of building new plants that would release more carbon into the atmosphere, he said countries needed to be serious about their climate commitments. If average global temperature increases were to be kept below 2\'c2\'b0C, he said, "Not all coal assets will be able to run for their full economic lifetime." This meant new stations plans should be scrapped, and old plants wound down before time, he said. Countries that did not do this would be faced with a much steeper cost in the future, as carbon reductions would have to be quicker and on a much larger scale. This meant money would be stuck in coal-fired plants and coal mines which could not be used, he said. But the decision to turn away from coal now should be a no-brainer, thanks to the external costs of coal-fired stations, and the competitive nature of renewables, he said. "Coal is not cheap, due to the damage done by significant land disturbance, water contamination, air pollution, damage to ecosystems, and dust and noise pollution." He cited the case of China, where the cost of the health impact of air pollution - just from energy use - was $1.4-trillion in 2010 (R17-trillion in current prices). His organisation says 60% of the total investment in power plants since 2000 has been in low-carbon technologies. But between 1990 and 2013, the amount of coal burnt for electricity generation doubled. Its percentage of the global energy had also remained the same since 1990. This was because the price of different fuels was still skewed in favour of fossil fuels, thanks to myriad subsidies. Coal in particular benefited from being the least heavily taxed of all fossil fuels, and being subject to little or no import tariffs, he said. In contrast renewables often receive import tariffs of between 10% and 20%. This meant coal was given an unfair competitive advantage, he said. The timing should be perfect for lowering the sorts of subsidies that had traditionally made fossil fuels cheaper, he said. Oil had halved, from $120 a barrel to $60 a barrel. Countries - such as India and Thailand - had used the lower price to reduce their fossil fuel subsidies. But he said few other countries have done this. "The benefits of falling oil prices have flowed to oil consumers, at the expense of the environment." Last month the International Monetary Fund released research saying environmental costs and taxes borne by society for fossil fuels were R63-trillion a year, or R2-million a second. These costs were mainly due to healthcare and environmental damage caused by burning fossil fuels, it said. The decision on whether or not to lower carbon emissions globally will be taken at the COP21 climate negotiations in Paris in November. After two decades of negotiating, and numerous failed attempts at an agreement, delegates will meet and discuss what is now a draft text on lowering emissions. At the heart of the draft is the ambition of ensuring that average temperature increases do not exceed 2\'c2\'b0C this century. This is the number science has said will lead to climate change that can be managed. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned last year that if this target is not kept, the effects of climate change will be " severe, pervasive and irreversible". Gurr\'c3\Â£da said the Paris meeting had to reach an agreement. "There is little time left. Governments cannot afford to treat this year's COP like just another round of endless trade negotiations. The carbon clock is ticking." China has already pledged to peak its carbon emissions in 2030. The United States has promised to lower emissions by 17% by 2025. Last month the G7 countries agreed to phase out fossil fuels this century. Coal stations to burn half of humanity's carbon budget In its research released last week - " Aligning policies for a low carbon economy" - the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warned that coal-fired power stations would emit more than 500-billion tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2050. That is half of the total amount - called a "carbon budget" - that the entire world can release before reaching 2\'c2\'b0C of warming becomes irreversible. The report was a collaboration between the OECD, International Energy Agency, the International Transport Forum, and the Nuclear Energy Agency. While warning of the future dangers of coal plants, it also said the current dominance of coal had to be changed. "Many of the regulatory features of today's economies have been built around the availability of fossil fuels, and without any regard for the greenhouse gas emissions stemming from human activities." Moving to a low carbon economy therefore required of countries to change their regulatory framework to make different types of energy compete equally, and with cognisance of their environmental impact, it said. South Africa pledged at the 2009 climate conference in Copenhagen to lower its carbon emissions. This peak, plateau and decline trajectory would see emissions drop by 42% by 2025. This was, however, dependent on funding and technical support from the developed world. Emissions have held steady, mainly thanks to the recession and a stagnant economy. But government is building Medupi and Kusile - two coal-fired power stations that will be in the five largest in the world. In his 2014 State of the Nation address, the president indicated that government would also build another coal-fired power station, called Coal 3. South Africa already emits around half of Africa's carbon emissions. Per person, the carbon footprint of each South Africa is in the top 20 highest in the world. Much of this is down to Eskom and Sasol, which emit three-quarters of the country's carbon. Eskom emits around 230-million tonnes of carbon a year, depending on how much of its fleet is operating. Research published by the Energy Research Institute at the University of Cape Town last year calculated that in 2011, the power utility's emissions contributed up to R41-billion in "global damage costs related to climate change". This is damage - exacerbated flooding and other climatic events - that is caused by the global warming Eskom's emissions drive. The research institute said Medupi and Kusile would jointly consume around 34-million tonnes of coal a year, and emit 60-million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere. This meant that the climate damage caused by their combined 9 600-megawatts would be R10-billion a year. But the deadline for firing-up the stations keeps being set back. Eskom started synchronising one boiler at Medupi earlier this year, and said the plant should be fully-operational by the end of this decade. There is no timeline for Kusile. \</doc>

Climate change is a global problem. But local actions are needed to reduce its impact. Specifically, southern African countries must consider what they can do to protect their interests in the face of growing threats to economies and welfare... So consider the idea of having a giant sunshade over southern Africa. During the recent heatwave, it would have been wonderful. It could have saved lives and there would have been less evaporation from dams, reducing the impact of the current drought. Crops and livestock would have fared better. Putting up a global sunshade is feasible, not fanciful. It has already been shown to be an option for California. But it is rarely talked about in polite scientific or policy conversation. This is because it would be geoengineering, a human intervention to alter the climate. Many people consider this to be a step too far. But this must change, not least because human action is already causing the climate to change. Why geoengineering is a difficult subject Discussion about geoengineering has been muted because scientists are uncomfortable about accepting second class solutions. They fear that any effort to moderate the impact of additional C02 in the atmosphere will reduce the pressure for action on the cause of the problem. But Africa must look hard at uncomfortable options or face being left behind by other countries with fewer scruples. Specifically, it is important to consider how regional geoengineering initiatives could help to protect southern Africa from some of the more damaging impacts of climate change. From the outcome of the COP21 meeting in Paris last year, two key points stand out: The resulting slow progress means that the southern African region could face prolonged hardship. The consensus is that life under climate change will be hotter, and therefore drier, since evaporation and aridity increases with temperature. Some countries stand to gain, some to lose Southern Africa needs to take action as a region. Not all regions are affected equally by climate change. Some countries - Canada and Russia specifically - actually stand to gain from a warmer globe. Millions of hectares of land that is currently frozen will become available for agriculture. This will occur just as food problems arise elsewhere. Other countries - think Saudi Arabia - would like to put off action as long as possible. This will enable them to use their oil revenues to fund the adaptation that they will need. Coal exporting countries like Australia and South Africa have similar interests. Yet another group of countries would like adaptation to move faster. This is not always because they are concerned about the impact of climate change. Many in Europe believe that there is money to be made from renewable energy. And they would like everyone to adopt it as fast as possible so that they can make more windmills, install more solar panels and sell more power management solutions. So regional interests have a strong influence on the approach to climate change. And I contend that South Africa, together with its neighbours, is not doing enough to consider specific regional interests and options. That opinion is based on more than a decade's engagement on climate issues at the United Nation's Commission on Sustainable Development, two COPs, the World Economic Forum and South Africa's National Planning Commission as well as my work on southern Africa's water resources. The thinking - or rather the lack of it - about geoengineering is one example of regional interests. Creating shade Some geoengineering interventions will only work on a global scale. Proposals to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere are one example. But other interventions work more locally. It has long been known that the presence of some chemicals in the atmosphere can shield the earth from the heating effects of the sun. This has been demonstrated on numerous occasions when, after erupting volcanoes spewed sulphurous gases and ash, the earth cooled noticeably for a couple of years. The most famous case is perhaps the eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia in 1815. This led to 1816 being known as the "year without a summer". The science to use this effect for geoengineering is now well documented. A leading mind on this is professor Paul Crutzen, who won the Nobel Prize for working out how to fix another global atmospheric problem - the ozone hole. If sulphur dioxide (SO2) is used, the amount required for a worldwide solar sunshade could be dosed into the atmosphere using existing passenger aircraft. The payload would be the equivalent of two economy class seats on every flight. Crutzen estimated the cost at between $25 and $50 per developed world citizen. It would be more efficient to dose at higher altitudes but the point is that this is already a feasible option. What needs to be considered is whether this technology could be used to provide local sunshades. These would not help places threatened by rising sea levels which needs warming to be stopped at a global level. But it might well help to reduce the impact of higher temperatures on local agriculture and water resources. Potential risks need to be considered. The amounts of SO2 needed are tiny compared to what is generated, more harmfully, by industry and natural sources. But it would be desirable to design and use more benign materials. Fortunately, the science of chemistry is increasingly able to design materials with very specific properties. Doing this to mitigate climate change needs to become a research priority. To make such interventions practical, the region needs local science, focused on meeting local needs. And Western scientists have been reluctant to help develop this capacity. I have found British scientists working on climate change very helpful on many other subjects, but not on this regional interventions. And South Africa's scientists are too often guided by global thinking rather than local challenges and opportunities. Finally, there is the question of implementation. Do we have the means to do the job? Since there would almost certainly be international opposition to regional geoengineering, we would need regional capacity for intervention. Could this be a new role for embattled SAA? It would be helpful to have a national airline to enable us to take a regional decision to protect regional interests. Such a move could buy time while the underlying problem is properly addressed. Critics who argue that this would simply encourage further delay miss the point. The delays are happening and the consequences need to be addressed. Beyond that, the mere threat of regional geoengineering action could accelerate action to address the underlying causes more effectively. At the least, the southern African region if not the continent as a whole must discuss regional options. And regional geoengineering will have to be on the agenda. Otherwise Africa will once again find itself at the back of the queue, carrying the burden and the costs while those responsible for our problems profit from our passivity. \</doc>

POPE Francis's environmental encyclical entitled Laudato Si ("Praise be to you"): "On Care For Our Common Home", which was released on June 18 is undoubtedly one of the most important interventions in the campaign for environmental justice in the 21st century. It is not surprising that the 184-page document, released in eight languages, took more than 18 months to draft. This second papal encyclical has already had a significant impact on shifting the global debate in favour of those who advocate that humanity should act with greater care for our common home. This is clearly in evidence at the discussions taking place at the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) which is convening in Paris until Friday. Moreover, Laudato Si has had a ripple effect within the inter-faith community. The imminent release of Laudato Si inspired the issuing of a statement in June by more than 330 rabbis in a letter on the climate crisis entitled: "A call to action to prevent further climate-fuelled disasters and work toward eco-social justice." Laudato Si no doubt has also inspired the Islamic Declaration on Global Climate Change released in Istanbul in August. Muslim scholars, such as Joseph Lumbard, who have engaged with Laudato Si, have concurred that the important themes in Pope Francis's encyclical on the environment resonate well with the teachings of Islam on the environment. Here I would like to highlight two of them that were also evident in the exegesis and commentary on Laudato Si, by Father Peter-John Person. First and foremost, one of the most significant aspects of Laudato Si is that it frames the issue of environmental conservation within a framework of justice. In Pearson's interpretation, Laudato Si is a document about justice with a focus on the environment, rather than the other way around. Pope Francis sees the issue of climate change through the eyes of the poor and this is the key hermeneutic or interpretive lens. In other words, the pontiff wants the economic, social and environmental world orders to be fairer to the poorest. Laudato Si criticises consumerist, profit-seeking economies, and emphasises acute sensitivity to debt, inequality, and poverty, and suggests differentiated responsibilities based on wealth and ability. Compassion and justice require voices to speak up for the most vulnerable and marginalised - those often left voiceless, those who have been pushed into poverty, those who have been denied access to food, water and other basic human rights, those who stand to suffer the most from climate change, while having contributed the least to the problem. The social, economic and environmental dimensions cannot be considered in isolation, but should be treated integrally as a complex joint crisis. These social justice concerns resonate fully with the teachings of Islam. "God has raised the cosmos, And set up (for all things) the balance. So do not transgress the balance. Weigh, therefore, (your deeds) with justice, And cause no loss in the balance!" From an Islamic perspective, the environmental crisis humanity is facing today can be viewed as a symptom of a deeper spiritual malaise. This spiritual malaise has come about through extravagant and consumerist lifestyles that have transgressed the balance between humans and nature. An imbalance or altering of the mizan (balance) has taken place at the individual, social and global levels and this is now being reflected in the environmental crisis. Such a perspective is also evident in the nomenclature and mission of The Claremont Main Road Masjid's environmental programme: Muslims for Eco-Justice. A second new theme that Laudato Si takes up is that of acknowledging the existential rights of those with whom we share this planet, namely animals and plants, etc, and more importantly, recognising their spiritual essence. In the sixth chapter of the encyclical, Francis writes that humanity can "discover God in all things". Hence, the pontiff asserts, "there is a mystical meaning to be found in a leaf, in a mountain trail, in a dewdrop, in a poor person's face". Interestingly, in order to drive home and substantiate this point, in footnote 159 of the encyclical, Francis credits a 9th century Muslim Sufi mystic Amir al-Khawas for the concept of nature's "mystical meaning". In his theology, al-Khawas was obviously inspired by the abundance of QurÂ£nic verses that depict the natural environment in this manner. Joseph Lumbard in his response to Laudato Si has provided the following examples of QurÂ£nic verses wherein God affirms the spiritual essence of our natural environment. The QurÂ£n proclaims, "whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth glorifies God" (59:1; 61:1; 62:1; 64:1). "The stars and the trees prostrate" (55:6), "the thunder hymns His praise" (13:13), and "unto God prostrates whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, and the beasts" (22:18). In these and many other verses, the whole of creation is presented as a divine symphony, for "there is no thing, save that it hymns His praise, though you do not understand their praise. Truly He is clement, forgiving" (17:44). According to an Argentinian priest, Father Augusto Zampini, "it is certainly unusual for a Pope to cite a Muslim Sufi in support of his theology of environmental transcendence, but those who have known Pope Francis since his days in the slums of Argentina know that this shows his personal touch on the encyclical". By quoting al-Khawas, Zampini argues Francis is "inviting all human beings to transcend, to go out of themselves and therefore to improve the relationship that we have with other people, with the Earth, with God". "Everything is connected. Concern for the environment this needs to be joined to a sincere love for our fellow human beings and an unwavering commitment to resolving the problems of society." In conclusion, it is my considered view that through Laudato Si, Francis has inaugurated a constructive platform for credible faith and secular leaders to enter into renewed dialogue on the critical question of climate change and discuss ways in which we can bring ourselves closer to living in harmony and reverence with nature. Moreover, by locating such a conversation within the broader framework of Francis's theology of compassion for the poor, which offers a powerful social critique of our global culture of consumerism, covetousness, and opulence - inter-religious dialogue should find even greater resonance among Muslims. It is my sincere hope that more Muslim scholars will take up the dialogical challenge presented in Laudato Si in a spirit of reverence and hospitality comparable to that with which the 12th century Muslim leader, Sultan al-Kamil, welcomed Saint Francis of Assisi, from whom the current pope takes his name. Muslims can and should engage substantively with Laudato Si in order to build broad solidarity with meaningful global commitments for the collective good, through responsible stewardship of the earth. l A Rashied Omar is imam of the Claremont Main Road Mosque. \</doc>

Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma Director General of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, DrJose Graziano da Silva Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Senzeni Zokwana Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Bheki Cele Minister of Water and Sanitation Nomvula Nkonyane UN Ambassador for Forestry and the Environment, HRH Crown Prince Laurent of Belgium Premier of KwaZulu-Natal, Senzo Mchunu Executive Mayor of eThekwini, James Nxumalo Honourable Ministers, Deputy Ministers, Heads of International Agencies and National Forestry and Environmental Organisations Esteemed Delegates Ladies and Gentlemen Sanibonani! A warm welcome to our shores for this, the first World Forestry Congress on African soil. We are sure your experience here will be invigorating and rewarding. We are confident this congress will help map the future of the forestry sector as a critical pillar of the sustainable development of our planet. Our generation is called on to make critical decisions that are likely to impact on our world for years to come. Forests are a crucial part of our identity. They are part of our shared heritage. They are central to our common future. They are a source of life and wellbeing. The world today is confronted by severe environmental challenges. Many communities across the globe are grappling with extreme weather conditions and related phenomena, such as drought and wild forest fires. We have recently experienced unprecedented drought conditions in parts of South Africa, including here in KwaZulu-Natal. South Africa is determined to be part of the global response to this global challenge. Just recently, young men and women from government's Working on Fire programme returned from Canada, where they were part of a team that fought wild land fires in the western part of that country. Such international cooperation helps strengthen our ability to confront many of these transnational challenges. The global response to climate change will take centre stage again in Paris in December around the COP21 I am sure your deliberations will amplify the importance of forests in mitigating the harmful effects of climate change. This World Forestry Congress is well placed to ensure that the role of forests as the planet's carbon sink is fully understood and acknowledged. The sustainable management of our forests is therefore critical as we confront global warming. You carry the important responsibility of making certain that the overall importance of forests is reflected in the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals currently being formulated by the United Nations. The projected global population growth has cast the critical issue of food security into sharper focus. The current global population stands at about 7.1 billion people and some projections suggest that this number will grow to around 9.3billion by 2050. The implication of this growth is that, collectively, we will have to produce 70% more food than we are currently producing. Our forests have historically been the source of more than just wood. Many of our communities still harvest a wide range of food products from the forest environment. The pressures of food security has in many instances resulted in deforestation as societies seek to increase their capacity to feed their people. The real challenge will be to explore ways in which we are able to ensure the multi-use of land while ensuring the sustainable growth of our forestry assets. Across the globe, and particularly in large parts of the African continent, communities are confronted by a shortage of potable water. This challenge is exacerbated in times of extreme weather conditions. The role of forests in the larger picture of water security must therefore also be acknowledged. On our continent, permanent flowing rivers tend to originate in forested or wooded areas. As custodians of policy and legislation, we are increasingly called upon to balance the demands of plantation forestry with water rights in water scarce environments. The pressures of development often threaten biodiversity. Policies relating to the forestry sector should therefore also be mindful of the indisputable role forests play in sustaining and protecting biodiversity. The importance of sustaining forests is often overlooked, even as we daily consume the paper, packaging and a vast range of wood products. I hope that this congress will highlight for our public the role of forestry in their daily lives. If we all better understand the enveloping importance of the forestry sector, we will develop cutting edge technologies and attract innovators who will support and develop it. Ladies and Gentlemen, Hosting the first World Forestry Congress on the African continent is an honour, which we as South Africa deeply appreciate. I am pleased to note that the African Forest Forum had the foresight and dedication to ensure that Africa was able to meet and prepare for this Congress over the last three days. The Africa Day event tomorrow will provide a useful focus on the issues confronting the forestry sector on our continent. I am informed that some 82% of household energy needs in Africa is supplied in the form of wood harvested from Africa's forests. As African economies grow, the demand for sawn timber and round wood is escalating dramatically. The value of the charcoal industry, mostly involving small-scale producers, has been estimated as being in excess of $25billion per annum. African forests continue to be the source of a wide range of non-wood products, such as fruit, spices, honey and medicine. As African leaders, we clearly cannot afford to neglect a policy environment that impacts on so many lives on this continent. We need a regulatory framework that promotes a sustainable forestry sector and that recognises its economic, hydrological and environmental value to our communities. In South Africa, we have a vibrant commercial forestry sector. It plays an important role in supplying our domestic wood and wood product needs, while earning valuable foreign currency through our wood chip and cellulose exports. The sector presents challenges and opportunities. Some 50 to 60% of our plantation land is currently under land claims as part of our land restitution process. Land restitution will result in significant changes in the ownership of the country's forestry lands. Already we have more than 24,000 small growers -many of them women - who are relatively new entrants into the forestry sector. We must ensure that they have adequate support in developing their businesses. The involvement of community forest organisations from other parts of the world in this congress is a welcome opportunity for our small growers to interact with, and learn from, their counterparts. I am very pleased to see the congress's plans to engage the youth, as they are central to the achievement of a sustainable future. South Africa's youth must use this opportunity to expand their horizons and find a role for themselves in the future development of the forestry sector at home and beyond. A group of students from the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University attending the International Forestry Student Association conference in the Philippines succeeded in bidding to host the 2017 International Forestry Student Association Symposium in our country. Delegates from about 55 countries are expected to attend. This will be another forestry first in South Africa. The Fourteenth World Forestry Congress has a weighty and worthwhile agenda. We wish you well in your deliberations and look forward to hearing your conclusions. We encourage you to share them with communities across the globe. In that way, we can work to ensure that the peoples of the world understand and appreciate the critical importance of forests in securing a sustainable and prosperous future for all. I thank you. \</doc>

EPA Chinese President Xi Jinping (C) EPA/ERIC FEFERBERG #Focac: Johannesburg - Soon after being elected the Communist Party of China\' s (CPC) general secretary, President Xi Jinping outlined the concept of the Chinese Dream, describing his wish to promote a Chinese renaissance and a new awakening. In his first speech at the National People\' s Congress, after being declared the President of the People\' s Republic of China (PRC), President Xi indicated that the objective of the Chinese Dream was to achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The core of the Chinese dream is national prosperity and rejuvenation along with a better standard of living for the Chinese people. Following 30 years of continuous economic growth, averaging almost 10 percent annually, citizen\' s incomes have seen a 30-fold increase, while China accounts for over 70 percent of global poverty alleviation since 1980. Driven by rapid industrialisation and modernisation, China has overcome the difficulties of the past and opened a new and compelling chapter in its history. The specific target for China\' s national dream is to double annual per capita income within 10 years and create a prosperous middle income country by 2050. The conclusion for the dream will be the complete elimination of poverty and a moderate standard of living for all citizens. To make the dream come true, China will have to maintain its current high growth rate and continue to address poverty in rural and low-income communities. At a national level, realisation of the Chinese dream would mean international respect for modern China as a key player in the international community. Moreover, China would be able to regain international status and forget past humiliations. At the same time, the China Dream is intended to expand convergence with the interests of other countries and to construct a community of common interests. China is strongly promoting the concept of a common human destiny and encouraging broader co-operation within the global community, especially with Africa. This implies the establishment of innovative global development partnerships to advance mutual economic and political interests. The FOCAC VI Summit will give expression to a new China-Africa partnership within the context of the Chinese Dream and the concept of a common human destiny. President Xi has suggested that China and Africa now have a community of shared destinies, based on similar historical experiences, common development tasks and shared long-term strategic, and geo-political interests. A common destiny grounded on a collective desire to overcome poverty now unites both China and Africa, while increased commercial interaction, based on equality and mutual respect, is seen as the mechanism for promoting economic growth and long-term prosperity. The China-Africa common destiny has become more evident over the last ten years, as increased trade with China has transformed Africa into the last great frontier for economic development. Riding the China wave of industrialisation and modernisation, Africa has witnessed significant growth and increased prosperity. In 2014, former Nigerian President, Olusegun Obasanjo, suggested that Africa, like China needed a dream to identify its priorities and to mobilise its efforts towards a common goal. The voices of the African people are now contained in the African Union\' s (AU) Agenda 2063, the manifestation of an \' African Dream,\' through which the goals and aspirations of the African people are clearly expressed and articulated. The objectives outlined in the AU document are in many ways similar to the aims of the Chinese Dream. Both China and Africa are striving for a better future, for a reduction of poverty and for the improved material well-being of their people in a highly competitive globalised world. China and Africa share the same dream of sustainable development, poverty relief and long-term prosperity. After 30 years of opening and economic reform, China is already more than halfway to achieving this dream, while Africa has made good progress, but has a long way to go. Increased China-Africa interaction will provide both sides with fresh opportunities and new options to advance a win-win outcome promoting common economic and social development. China\' s success in reducing poverty is a particular inspiration to Africa, thus a China-Africa consultative partnership to share experiences and ideas to combat poverty would be very helpful in advancing the common dream of economic growth and prosperity. Poverty relief remains Africa\' s key issue and requires new policies and creative economic solutions. China\' s success in this context offers Africa encouragement and a possible model for addressing this challenge. The AU\' s Agenda 2063 suggests a framework for a broader and more co-operative China-Africa relationship. China\' s commitment to Africa over the last thirty years has been extensive, constructive and has made a positive overall contribution to Africa\' s economic development. Broadening and deepening the co-operation process can strengthen relations and build a foundation for a long-term comprehensive development partnership. The successful implementation of Agenda 2063 will largely depend on Africa building and advancing a more positive and constructive business environment. Advancing business-friendly policies in Africa is also the key to enhancing the China-Africa relationship and lifting the African continent from poverty. China\' s post-Mao business-friendly policies, especially in the coastal special economic zones (SEZ\' s), were the initial catalysts which ignited new industrialisation and growth for the Chinese people. Following the China development model, means good planning, offering creating investment opportunities and leveraging advantages. Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) is the key to skills enhancement, technology transfers, job creation and long-term economic growth. Africa should fully support the China Dream and should shape its future in co-operation with China\' s Dream, through a process of policy synergy, committed co-operation and positive, goal-orientated interaction. The AU\' s Agenda 2063 offers China and Africa an exci ting new opportunity to identify and craft a collaborative agenda which could bring significant benefits to both sides, while reinforcing a long-term development partnership. Given the growing interest in Africa by China and other external actors, the continent has a unique chance to exploit new options and possibilities. Africa\' s leadership has an opportunity to broaden engagement with the world, take advantage of globalization and craft a road map out of poverty towards prosperity and social stability. The challenge at the Johannesburg Summit will be for the leaders of both sides to articulate a FOCAC declaration and action plan which advances both the Chinese Dream and the African Dream towards a common destiny of continued economic growth and prosperity.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted at a summit meeting of world leaders at the U.N. headquarters in New York on Sep. 25, reflect the five strategic domains the ACP Group is gearing to focus on, as it repositions itself as a more effective organisation in the global arena, says the 79-nation bloc's head Dr Patrick Gomes. These domains include: rule of law and good governance; global justice and human security; intra-ACP trade, industrialization and regional integration; building sustainable, resilient and creative economies; as well as financing for development, he said in an email interview with IPS, adding that South-South and Triangular Cooperation informs the Group's approach to all these domains. Following is the full text of the interview: IPS: The ACP Group is composed of 48 countries from Sub-Saharan Africa, 16 from the Caribbean and 15 from the Pacific. How far has it been possible for the ACP Group to evolve a joint strategy? Dr Gomes: From the outset, the Committee of African, Caribbean and Pacific Ambassadors in Brussels recognised the importance of the post-2015 development agenda as a platform for global action to address the enormous needs of developing countries. In 2014 the ACP Group set up an ad-hoc Ambassadorial Working Group to focus solely on crafting a joint position on the matter, highlighting key areas which are important to our Member States - climate change, financing for development, technology transfer, for example. At the heart of it all, is the desire to create conditions for our countries to succeed in development and industrialise in a sustainable manner, in order to raise the standards of living of our peoples. This work fed into the joint declaration with the European Union on the post-2015 agenda, which was adopted by the ACP-EU Joint Council of Ministers in June 2014. That was a true milestone and it highlighted very clearly our joint interests while providing a guide for our future cooperation. The ACP Group of States also more recently agreed on a position on the U.N.'s international conference on Financing for Development in July, and we are working on one for the Climate Change Conference COP21 in Paris in December. Through a number of different platforms, the ACP Group has been able to articulate a common position on issues of direct relevance in our countries' prospects for sustainable development. IPS: How far do the 17 SDGs address, in your view, the problems and aspirations of such a diverse group as the ACP? Dr Gomes: The ACP Group is indeed a diverse group. All are developing, but each has specific conditions - amongst the membership, there are 40 Least Developed Countries, 37 Small Island Developing States (some are both), and 15 landlocked developing states. This is also captured at the regional level, whereby the ACP is organised in six regions (East, West, Southern and Central Africa, as well as the Caribbean and Pacific). The concept of national ownership and country-driven policies becomes very important. Furthermore, the ACP Group has called for the establishment of a vulnerability index that takes into consideration the specific challenges that affect a country's ability to develop. This doesn't mean that member states cannot stand together on common issues, or support each other's causes in the name of solidarity. We also follow a principle of subsidiarity and complementarity. The SDGs reflect the five strategic domains the ACP Group is gearing to focus on, as it repositions itself as a more effective organisation in the global arena. These domains include rule of law and good governance; global justice and human security; intra-ACP trade, industrialization and regional integration; building sustainable, resilient and creative economies; as well as financing for development. South-South and Triangular Cooperation informs our approach to all these domains. IPS: The Addis Ababa Financing for Development Conference in July, the Sustainable Development Summit and the Paris Climate Change Conference end of November through December have the semblance of a triumvirate determining the fate of the world in the coming years. At its core lies financing. How do you expect the financing problem to be solved? Does the European Development Fund provide adequate framework? Does it suffice? Dr Gomes: We need to do development differently in the post-2015 era. It is clear that traditional Official Development Assistance (ODA) is, quantitatively, simply not enough to address the development demands of our countries. In fact, ODA now accounts for far less than Foreign Direct Investment, equity participation and remittances from diasporic communities investing in their countries of origin. In terms of long-term sustainable financing, we must look at mobilising domestic resources in our own developing countries. This means refining our tax laws, tackling tax evasion and curbing corruption in order to curtail the billions of dollars haemorrhaging through illicit financial flows. To add to that, private funding to finance investments, improved public debt management, boosting trade - all these avenues need to be addressed in a comprehensive manner. The ACP Group also takes particular interest in South-South and Triangular Cooperation to complement the traditional North-South models of development finance. Notwithstanding, ODA will remain an essential part of post-2015 development finance. Developed countries must still honour their previous pledges to allocate 0.7 percent of their Gross National Income (GNI) to development aid. So far, only a few European countries have achieved and surpassed this level of ODA - imagine if all the industrialised countries did so. Moreover, since developed nations recommitted to the 0.7 percent GNI goal for ODA in Addis Ababa in July, we have to look now at implementing this in the ACP-EU framework. The European Development Fund for ACP countries is significant, but obviously not enough to achieve the SDGs. However, what is unique about the EDF is that it is part of a legally binding agreement between two sets of sovereign states. In the framework of our partnership, the EU provides a predictable source of finance and the ACP Group co-manages the funds. At the same time, issues of flexibility in the EDF regulations and better planning in ACP countries, mean that actual absorption rates by ACP countries can still be improved. IPS: How far does the Sustainable Development Summit mark a watershed in global development cooperation? Do you expect it to turn out more of a success than its precursor, the MDG? Dr Gomes: The attainment of SDG's will be as successful as we make it. That is, these goals need have sufficient resources for work to be implemented and results delivered. Contrary to the momentum and hope generated by enormous pledges made by developed countries in international fora, the reality is that the state of financing for development is currently handicapped. In fact, amongst the challenges faced by the MDGs, were the inadequate implementation of commitments listed in Goal 8 (Global Partnership for Development), the global financial crisis of 2008, as well as issues of mutual accountability. However, I remain positive. There is a growing awareness across the globe about development issues. There is also an interest in reviewing current systems to better deliver on development goals, as seen in the reforms currently being pursued at the UN and ACP Group. There is no doubt that the resources and means to achieve the Post-2015 Development Agenda do exist - it is a matter of collective will to wield them in the right direction. (END) \</doc>

The BRICS Leaders met on the margins of the G20 Summit in Antalya on 15 November 2015. The Leaders strongly condemned the abhorrent terror attacks in Paris. They expressed their condolences to the families of the victims and extended their wishes for the speedy recovery of those injured. They reaffirmed their support for the people and government of France and the efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice. The Leaders recommitted to strengthen cooperation among BRICS countries and with other nations in the fight against terrorism. The Leaders commended Russia for the hosting of a successful Seventh BRICS Summit, contributing further to the enhanced intra-BRICS cooperation and appreciated the good pace of the implementation of the Ufa Action Plan. The Leaders welcomed the substantive progress made this year in advancing intra-BRICS cooperation. The New Development Bank (NDB) is starting its operating activities and is expected to launch its inaugural projects in the beginning of 2016. The NDB will enhance cooperation with existing and new financing institutions including Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Furthermore, the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) has been established and will contribute to the stability of the international financial system in view of the increased volatility of the world financial and economic situation. The Leaders instructed relevant agencies of BRICS countries to engage actively in the implementation of the Strategy for the BRICS Economic Partnership adopted at the Ufa Summit as well as in preparing a draft BRICS Roadmap for Trade, Economic and Investment Cooperation until 2020. The Leaders exchanged views on the main topics on the G20 Summit agenda and agreed to pursue issues of mutual interest to the BRICS countries. The Leaders agreed that the global economy was still at risk and its recovery was not yet sustainable, which underlines the importance of strengthening macroeconomic policy coordination and cooperation among G20 members to avoid negative spillovers and to achieve strong, sustainable and balanced growth. The Leaders agreed that based on the progress already made, all G20 members need to focus on the implementation of their respective national growth strategies. They stressed their determination to continue to work together with other G20 members to make continuous contributions to a more rapid, sustainable recovery of the global economy and towards the reduction of potential risks. The Leaders noted that geopolitical challenges, including the politicization of economic relations and the introduction of unilateral economic sanctions, continue to beset future prospects for economic growth. They urged the need to ensure that trade and economic blocs are consistent with WTO norms and principles and contribute to strengthening the multilateral trading system. They decided to strive to facilitate market inter-linkages and an inclusive, rules-based and open world economy. The Leaders agreed to continue the exchange and the coordination of positions among the BRICS countries on the G20 agenda to better accommodate interests of emerging market economies and developing countries. In this context, they welcomed the first meeting of the BRICS Working Group on Anti-Corruption on 1 November 2015, which would also contribute to the work of relevant multilateral fora including the G20 Anti-Corruption Working Group (ACWG). The Leaders expressed their deep disappointment at the lack of progress in modernizing international financial institutions, especially on the agreements on the reform of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). They urged the IMF - in cooperation with its membership - to step up efforts in collaboration with the G20 to find such solutions that would ultimately make it possible to increase the institution's quota resources and review the distribution of quotas and votes in favour of developing countries and emerging market economies. The adoption of the 2010 IMF reforms remains the highest priority for safeguarding the credibility, legitimacy and effectiveness of the IMF and the Leaders urge the United States to ratify these reforms as soon as possible. The Leaders welcomed the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at the United Nations Summit held in September 2015 as well as the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and acknowledged the coordination and cooperation efforts made by the BRICS countries. They expressed their commitment to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development including through strengthening cooperation among BRICS countries in this process and decided to work towards the improvement of the international development cooperation architecture. The Leaders look forward to a successful outcome at COP 21 in Paris in December, and affirm their determination to adopt in the Paris Conference a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the UNFCCC that is applicable to all Parties. The Paris agreement should be fair, balanced, durable and comprehensive, reflecting the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of different national circumstances. The Leaders declared their readiness to support China in its upcoming G20 Presidency with a view to enhancing the leading role of the forum in meeting global financial and economic challenges. They encourage G20 members to strengthen macroeconomic cooperation, catalyze innovation, boost trade and investment, lead by example on global development cooperation.

Honourable Prime Minister, Ladies and gentlemen of the media, Let me once again extend a warm welcome to my honoured guest, Excellency Prime Minister Rutte and his delegation. We are truly pleased with this visit because our two countries share a historical bond. The Dutch people stood with the oppressed people of South Africa during a most difficult period in our history. The Netherlands became a powerful centre of the Anti-Apartheid Movement during the struggle for liberation. Amsterdam for example became the hub of the anti-apartheid movement and many historic conferences and activities took place in that beautiful city. We also fondly recall the twenty thousand people in Amsterdam who welcomed our founding President Mr Nelson Mandela, four months after his release from prison, demonstrating their love for Madiba and their support for a free South Africa. It is in this context that the roving Signs of Solidarity exhibition was showcased at various locations in both South Africa and the Netherlands in the course of 2014 as part of South Africa's 20 years of Freedom and Democracy celebration. Since 1994, South Africa and the Netherlands have forged a solid partnership that transcends many fields including economic, education, agriculture, trade, science and technology, education, judicial, multilateral and culture to mention but a few. The visit by the Prime Minister will certainly take these relations and cooperation to a higher level. We are in agreement on the need at this time to elevate our relations. We are pleased that our ministers responsible for foreign affairs will sign the agreement establishing a Joint Commission at The Hague on Thursday, which will help to coordinate and guide the broad and substantive scope of our relationship. The Prime Minister is accompanied by a sizeable business delegation which augurs well for our economic relations. The Netherlands is of particular interest to South Africa as a trade and investment partner. Total trade between the two countries increased consistently from twenty seven billion rand in 2010 to forty eight billion rand in 2014. The Dutch have also invested in about 40 projects in South Africa with direct investment volume estimated at over fifteen billion rand over the period 2003 to 2015 in the following sectors: Financial Services, Aerospace, transport, business services, biotechnology and IT and Software. The Prime Minister and I discussed even more possible investment opportunities, such as in South Africa's ocean economy, energy and other key priorities. I have been informed of the House of the Future project taking place in Newtown which will enable South African and Dutch companies to partner in various sectors. The message we want to communicate to our Dutch partners is simple and clear: South Africa is open for business and investment. The Netherlands will next year be President of the EU. We would like to reaffirm our commitment to stronger relations between South Africa and the EU. We look forward to the South Africa-EU meeting to be held next year. Prime Minister, Ladies and gentlemen, We meet during a period when global security is in sharp focus following the senseless attacks in Paris. We returned this morning from the successful G20 Summit in Antalya, Turkey where the attacks drew condemnation from all world leaders. We remain firm in our condemnation of all forms of terrorism. Prime Minister the horrific attacks in Paris and also Turkey, Lebanon and the ongoing terror attacks in parts of Nigeria and sporadic attacks in Kenya remind us that the scourge of terrorism requires urgent attention, with an emphasis on dealing with the root causes. It is our strong belief that the interference by outside parties in some countries and the pursuit of the regime change doctrine has perpetuated a cycle of conflict and instability in many parts of North Africa and the Middle East. The preference for military action instead of political solutions becomes a breeding ground for violent extremism and terrorism. The United Nations must be at the centre of collective global action against terrorism, working with regional organisations. The international community must also redouble its efforts particularly in the quest for genuine peace in the Middle East. It will be difficult to find lasting peace without resolving longstanding issues in the Middle East such as the Palestinian question. We also wish to reiterate as well that terror attacks should not be used to label refugees as terrorists as that would have negative consequences. It is a difficult situation but solutions can and must be found. Mr Prime Minister, At the end of the month the world will converge on Paris for the United Nationswork Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that can comprehensively address climate change. We look forward to a successful conference in Paris. We are pleased as well that the G20 leaders agreed that COP 21 must succeed. Prime Minister, I am really happy that you have been able to undertake this first Official Visit to South Africa. I look forward to enhanced relations between our two countries, building on the rich history and our common beliefs in democracy, freedom, human rights, equality and other values that make the world a better place. I thank you. \</doc>

THE ban on away fans attending Ligue 1 matches will continue until December 14 following the attacks in Paris earlier this month, the Interior Ministry said yesterday. The initial ban was for Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 matches on November 19, because stretched security forces were unable to offer full protection. There is a lack of available police, with France in a state of emergency and the COP21 climate change summit taking place in Paris from today until December 11. - AFP \</doc>

If you could change one characteristic or habit of a politician in 2016, what would it be? Do wannabes count? Donald Trump's hairstyle has to go. In fact, all of Donald Trump has to go. Odious man. In what ways are you trying to reduce your use of water during this severe drought? World peace seems so elusive; so what would you propose doing to make it a reality? Stop the superpowers from dropping bombs. Stop Islamophobia. What are your sincere wishes and hopes for our nation in 2016? A government that listens to the people. If you could change one characteristic or habit of a politician in 2016, what would it be? I would change Zuma's habit of being a president to a habit of being a prisoner. #Zumamustfall_andfall_|andfall_andsplat! In what ways are you trying to reduce your use of water during this severe drought? I've decided not to bath or shower again. I'm also drinking my whisky neat and am trading my two border collies in for Camels. World peace seems so elusive; so what would you propose doing to make it a reality? We need more Miss Universes, Miss Worlds and Miss South Africas making more moving speeches about Syrian-led attacks by Jihadist Republicans in Somalia. Also, if they could mention global warming, I could get my collies back. What are your sincere wishes and hopes for our nation in 2016? I would love to see our growing middle class continue to rise up against bad governance as it has done over the past few weeks. I would like to see the Proteas return to form under Hashim (Amla) and a change in the laager mentality of the Boks. I would like to see the rand at 12 to $1 by year-end, a resolution of the power crisis that doesn't cost us R1 trillion and more nudity in general. If you could change one characteristic or habit of a politician in 2016, what would it be? Spend less on yourself and give more to those in need. In what ways are you trying to reduce your use of water during this severe drought? Well, for guys its a no-brainer. Go and pee in the bushes. World peace seems so elusive; so what would you propose doing to make it a reality? Love your neighbour as yourself, irrespective of colour, creed or religion. If everyone tried to adapt that in a small way every day, there would be no wars. What are your sincere wishes and hopes for our nation in 2016? Love, peace, understanding, caring for the poor, less for oneself and more hands-on governance to ensure a better life for all. The obscene, gratuitous, wanton display of nouveau-riche bling wealth. Is such opulent over-indulgence really necessary? I truly hate it and wish politicians would not be so self-serving and greedy and rather share their abundance with those whose who need it. In what ways are you trying to reduce your use of water during this severe drought? Shorter showers, no unnecessary running of water and reuse grey water where possible: I decant my bath water to water my garden. World peace seems so elusive; so what would you propose doing to make it a reality? There is so much that can be done - if everyone were to exercise empathy and compassion and consciously try to look beyond differences to find commonality, that would be a start. Stop using words which imply that a fellow human being is "other"; so don't refer to a person by their race, religion, gender and sexual orientation; and chant the mantra "first be kind" often. And mean it. What are your sincere wishes and hopes for our nation in 2016? Of course I join in the call for our leaders to lead with integrity, honesty, intelligence and care. I wish that my fellow South Africans would exercise tolerance, empathy and mindfulness. I'd like service delivery to be accelerated; for crime to diminish and for the drought to break. And of course for everyone to support more theatre, galleries, concerts and events. There are so many wonderful things to see and do in KZN - I wish more people would venture off their couches, away from their devices and engage with the myriad possibilities on offer. If you could change one characteristic or habit of a politician in 2016, what would it be? Unearned excess. All politicians, from the president down, should downgrade their expenses to better reflect the people they represent - they should use small cars with no blue lights, budget flights or coaches, and public schools, public transport, RDP housing and public hospitals. Then let's see how the services improve. In what way are you trying to reduce your use of water during this severe drought? I am reluctant to admit this but at home I only flush the toilet when it is absolutely necessary, a habit acquired during UK droughts. We used to have a slogan: "If it's yellow, let it mellow; if it's brown, flush it down." World peace seems so elusive; so what would you propose doing to make it a reality? Simple first step - ask everyone in the world to find someone near them whom they fear and have them sit down and share a meal with them. What are your sincere wishes and hopes for our nation in 2016? Honest elections in which politicians tell the truth, bad politicians are voted out of office and people express their anger and frustration by getting rid of politicians who have failed to deliver. That is real democracy! If you could change one characteristic or habit of a politician in 2016, what would it be? Not a politician, but the political media landscape. Instead of always searching for the bad, there are some extremely dedicated and committed politicians out there. Let South Africa hear about them and the sterling work they have done. In what ways are you trying to reduce your use of water during this severe drought? As the MEC of finance, we have dedicated a large proportion of our 2015 adjustment budget to directly alleviating the devastation of drought. I personally represented KwaZulu-Natal at the COP21 conference in Paris, putting the experiences of this province on the global map. World peace seems so elusive; so what would you propose doing to make it a reality? World peace is not elusive. Fundamentally, peace among men is a universally accepted, and aspired to, principle. Each and every citizen must speak out. As a collective, we can be heard. What are your sincere wishes and hopes for our nation in 2016? Stability, tolerance, understanding and patience. We are in troubled financial, economic and social times. Let us forgo instant gratification for an understanding of collective need and forbearance. If you could change one characteristic or habit of a politician in 2016, what would it be? It would probably be their consciences. I would ask them to grow one or get one for the sake of the millions of starving and homeless people that we are surrounded with every day while money is abused for self-preservation. This is something I feel strongly about. In what way are you trying to reduce your use of water during this severe drought? I take a very short shower and the sprinklers are used once a week as opposed to every day. World peace seems so elusive; so what would you propose doing to make it a reality? World peace starts within yourself; once you reach a state of mind that is itself peaceful and blissful internally, then the world will appear so outwardly. Can you imagine if we all felt this way? We would have true world peace. What are your sincere wishes and hopes for our nation in 2016? I pray that we have deserving people lead us into 2016. I pray that we make sure we do more as individuals for the less fortunate, as everyone can make a difference. The smallest actions can have a lasting impact and melt even the heart of God if done sincerely and with no expectations. \</doc>

With the COP21 climate summit concluding in Paris earlier this month and this year set to be the hottest on record, according to the UN, extreme weather events and unusual weather patterns have been stealing the headlines. A World Meteorological Organisation study warned that there was more extreme weather to come, with next year continuing the trend. The years 2011 to 2015 had been the warmest five-year period on record, with heatwaves influenced by climate change, the UN's weather, water and climate body said. \</doc>

COMMENTI've started taking notes. In some cases it's accidental - an interesting idea pops up during a zombie film (and there are enough of those to cross-reference ideas) - but of late I have started absorbing the internet. All of it (except the 90% made up of porn, which gives little in the way of \'c2\Â£dsurvival techniques).Being an environment reporter, most of my story research heads down the same inevitable path, to the same conclusion: we're all doomed. The world is going to burn up and in the process find an ingenious way to kill us all off. Various colleagues refer to me as a "ray of sunshine" (that's the polite, publication-worthy, version). Anyway. Death. Doom. You get the idea. The latest such foray into climate-change research reading ended up at this journal entry: "Carbon emissions affect thousands of years of climate change." Published in that tome of peer-reviewed-hope, Nature Climate Change, this took a slightly longer view than the one our politicians like us to focus on. At COP21 last year - where 195 governments signed off on the Paris Agreement - the focus was firmly on lowering greenhouse gas emissions this century. The aspirational goal is to ensure that global average temperatures do not increase by more than 1.5\'c2\'b0C this century. Nobody talks about what happens after 2100. Peter Clark, an Oregon State University paleoclimatologist and lead author of the article, wrote: "Much of the carbon we are putting in the air from burning fossil fuels will stay there for thousands of years - and some of it will be there for more than 100 000 years." This is because different greenhouse gases stay active in the atmosphere for different periods of time. Methane - the stuff cattle keep spewing out in vast quantities - traps 30 times more heat than carbon dioxide but only hangs around for a decade before decaying. Carbon dioxide - that most famous of greenhouse gases - is less effective at heating the world and is mostly absorbed into the ocean in a few centuries, but 20% of it then hangs around for tens of thousands of years. That means what we stick into the atmosphere now will be there for quite a long time. Clark's research made him turn to a plea for humanity to take this seriously: "People need to understand that the effects of climate change on the planet won't go away, at least not for thousands of generations."That statement has an upside - he thinks we will be around for thousands of generations. So how to get there? Well, my latest spate of internet trawling has led me to believe that the key to survival is by forming gangs. There's no other way to put it: if you stick to surviving alone and second-guessing the shelf lifespan of your pilfered pilchard tins, you'll have your head battered in by a gang of desperados who need something to spread on their dry crackers. When things go pear-shaped, be sure you know how the safety on a gun works - just in case. (Eric Thayer, Reuters)In the interests of being part of one of these gangs, I am willing to share some tips in return for having first choice on what our gang is called. We'll need some swag to make the postapocalyptic future seem as cool as it is in films, after all. First, a disclaimer. Hollywood is obsessed by some virus that will turn us all into flesh-eating zombies that munch their way through all but the hardiest of humans. That won't happen. If climate change has its way (which looks to be the case as we serenely continue on our fossil-fuel-guzzling path to oblivion) the fall will come about slowly, before an abrupt collapse. Mosquitos will move into more parts of the world, and come with deadlier diseases. Or the oceans will batter our coastal cities - where much of the world's population and commerce is based - and destroy the insurance industry and the world economy. Or some new diseases will crack through our defences and render our species infertile. But - more probably - all these things will slowly unfold until we can't feed enough people to justify oppressing the billion people who currently don't have food. Social systems will collapse and we'll go back to killing each other for the contents of an overturned truck, or the water coming out of a spring. The subsequent fallout will smash all the stuff we rely on to keep living in an oblivious bubble. Those with more of the big weapons will use them to batter those without, until only a few people are left wandering around. Human beings suck - history shows this. So. Survival. You need to pay attention to the news. Sure, it's depressing and reruns of your favourite Nineties sitcom are better ways to escape reality. But you need to be one of the first to catch #TheEndIsHere so you can get ready for the apocalypse. Give your friends/family/clan mates a shoutout and gather with all the canned food, seeds, water and weapons you can. Hopefully you'll have prepared by working out how the safety on a gun works and finding out what kind of knife best rips through the skin of an animal. Maybe you'll have been one of the brave few who watched every survival episode Bear Grylls put out (personally, I hope you're not, because then we'll have an even \'c2\Â£dplaying field). Once you've congregated, get the hell out of Dodge (I assume that you're in a city - that's where most of our readers are). When things fall apart, the centre - cities - become dark and dangerous places. Sure, there are more repositories of Twinkies (thanks Zombieland for that postapocalyptic tastebud sensation) and your dog Milo likes the other dogs in the park, but STAY AWAY FROM DENSE URBAN AREAS. Once you've found your bolthole - I would suggest somewhere nice in the foothills of the Drakensberg - work out how your society is going to work. Elect a leader (again, if you read this and are alive as a result, it might be polite to pick me) and agree on tasks. That way nobody is going to hit someone else over the head with a baseball bat because they want to have guard duty over the swimming pool/sunbathing spot. In this way you can complement each other and put your Google-search-result-generated-skills (I suggest printing out your basic survival blueprint before the world goes bang) to best effect in making food and keeping each other alive. Most importantly, learn from our mistakes and keep your water source clean. Water really is life, and you don't want to be looking for bottled water. At this point I should go back. I missed a critical point: when you select your gang of survivalists, try not have your cousin or sister included. If you are to survive the 100 000-odd years until the climate isn't catastrophically broken, you'll need to raise more worker-folk. Given the tension and stress of having witnessed the collapse of humanity, it might also be good to have someone who knows how to distil alcohol and make some sort of brew - just to break the ice before any sexy times can unfold.Now, that's as much as I am willing to disclose. The rest is on the internet. But you won't find it because that cat video is too funny not to watch. That means I'll know what happens next, and my gang will beat yours. I will build a grand agrarian society where we barter for bullets and laugh at those who judged us for anticipating the apocalypse. \</doc>

City dwellers are bearing the brunt of extreme temperatures. Thanks to a phenomenon that makes urban areas hotter than their surroundings, cities such as Pretoria are as much as 6\'b0C hotter than they could be. Layered on top of the hottest months ever recorded, this means cities are killing their inhabitants. The heat comes from decades of poor planning. Since the 1950s, the global focus of city infrastructure planning has been on cars, and on getting as many people as possible into tall buildings. In South Africa's six big cities, this means tarmac crisscrossing what used to be fields and bushveld, big cement slabs providing parking for the cars they bring in, and high-rise apartment and office blocks sucking in their occupants. This both creates and traps heat, which leads to an urban heat island. This effect is worse at night, with cities storing heat - like an oven. Consequently, during the summer of 2015-2016 temperature records have tumbled in these cities, with the midday heat going into the high 30s and low 40s. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says urban heat islands, which both raise temperatures and trap pollutants, will have to disappear this century if future generations are to live healthy lives in cities. This need is particularly acute as half the world's population now lives in urban environments. The organisation says gases - particularly carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter (dust) - create a petrochemical smog that smothers cities. In India and China, urban heat islands have trapped so many pollutants that children have been kept out of school and entire industries have had to be shut down. In colder climates, heatwaves have combined with the pre-existing heat stress in cities to kill tens of thousands of people. The WHO estimates that air pollution and heat stress kill about four million people a year. It says the combination of hot days and nights weakens the body to a level where it cannot recover. Local figures for those affected are hard to find because little national research has been done, but Johannesburg is consistently ranked as one of the most polluted cities in the world, thanks to its heat island trapping dust from mining and many other pollutants. The WHO puts Pretoria in second place, followed by Cape Town and Durban. The State of Green Infrastructure study into Gauteng's urban planning, conducted by the Gauteng City-Region Observatory, found that historical development patterns had left its major metros - Tshwane, Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg - with serious problems. "The region is facing worryingly high levels of dirty air, heat island effects, intense storms, polluted and even toxic water systems, shortages of land for food production, and a situation where people increasingly spend their lives in  artificially regulated building environments." The study does, however, acknowledge work being done in the region to undo this history of bad spatial development, with the cities envisaging a totally different version of themselves by mid-century. According to research by Carolyn Hardy of the department of mechanical engineering science at the University of Johannesburg, it is only recently that urban planners have tried to turn this sort of urban planning in another direction. The problem now is that budgets are small and any tweaking has to happen on top of existing infrastructure. The current El Ni\'f1o has exacerbated this problem, with record temperatures being set across South Africa. The phenomenon, which has seen the Pacific Ocean warmed by a record 3\'b0C, leads to extreme heat and drought in the southern hemisphere. Research by the City of Johannesburg for its 2040 strategy shows that, if not tackled, climate change will pile pressure on top of the existing urban heat island and see temperatures in summer push closer towards 50\'b0C, rather than the high 30s that are now common. Valerie Durant of the University of Pretoria says the solution is a comprehensive shift in the way cities are organised. The key step will be in greening cities, with an emphasis on public transport, meaning roads and parking lots can rather be used as urban forests and gardens. "We need to implement sustainable intensive urban agriculture." This could happen relatively easily, with roofs converted for gardening and encouraging vertical gardens to proliferate. Borrowing from cities elsewhere, motorways can be built under a layer of green infrastructure to create both more space for green space and reduce the heat effect of the tar. Johannesburg, Cape Town and eThekwini have included this sort of thinking in their long-term strategies. Each city has begun a fundamental shift away from having one person in a car, with a large investment in rapid bus systems and cycling lanes. Johannesburg's "corridors of freedom" will also try to use the shift in transport to change the spatial dynamic of the city, mixing low-cost and high-cost housing projects with business districts so people do not have to travel as much. Large green areas will also be wrapped around the city, with public parks and sports areas encouraging people to spend less time in air-conditioned offices and homes. This will add to the city's 10-million trees and will also create space for urban gardens so fresh produce does not have to come in from the countryside. These measures are part of a wider initiative at local government level to make cities climate proof, so they are ready for when things get worse. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research predicts that the interior of the country will warm by up to 6\'b0C this century, with the coast warming at half that rate. For cities that do not tackle their historically poor development, that will mean summers could become so severe that people will be unable to function in them. Fortunately for South Africans, the metros are aware of this danger and are already changing their landscape. Motor City takes a new direction Detroit in the United States used to be the pulsing heart of the automobile revolution. The city built massive highways to bring people in to its car factories, and skyscrapers to house the companies that employed them. Research by its municipal authority in the 1990s showed that this had created a heat island that pushed temperatures up by about 8\'b0C. The 2009 economic collapse changed this, as the city's car manufacturers closed shop overnight. Detroit is now a test case for rebuilding a city to be ecologically friendly. Abandoned suburbs have been turned into urban farms that produce food, which is then bartered for other services. A new society is being built, with its lessons being replicated on a smaller scale in other cities around the US. Urban planning courses at universities are using this as a case study, to show how resilient cities can be built on top of existing ones. Researchers at the University of Michigan have found that this change has had a profound influence on the city's heat island, with temperatures and pollution levels dropping significantly. Subsequent projects have started to examine the impact on people's health. - Sipho KingsHubs of pollution act The emission of greenhouse gases caused by humans means the world is getting hotter at a rate hitherto unseen in history. The United Nation's climate change body says this will lead to "irreversible change" this century if emissions are not lowered. The world is already, on average, nearly 1\'b0C hotter than it was before the industrial revolution kicked off. Southern Africa has warmed at double this rate. After a record-setting 2014 and 2015, the UK meteorological office is warning that 2016 is likely be the hottest year ever recorded. The key is to lower carbon emissions, and cities, with their increasing population and financial muscle, are a key part of this. The C40 cities initiative has pulled together the world's largest cities to act unilaterally to reduce carbon emissions. This group signalled its ambition by holding a conference on the periphery of the COP21 climate conference in Paris late last year. South African cities are key partners of this initiative, and Johannesburg recently hosted the C40 annual conference. South Africa as a whole has pledged to lower its greenhouse gas emissions by 42% by 2025. - Sipho Kings \</doc>

Climate experts say the need to agree on a global carbon price to cut pollution and aid clean technologies is a no-brainer, and yet the topic will have no place at the upcoming Paris climate talks... World leaders, captains of industry, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank had all expressed hope that the Paris meeting would welcome the idea. Paris will host beginning next week a gathering of nearly 140 world leaders to spearhead a climate pact tasked with keeping Earth liveable for humanity. But despite a myriad carbon pricing schemes having been experimented with across the world and plenty of big-name support behind the idea, the Paris gathering will not address putting a global price on pollution. The idea of a setting a price for the cost of carbon is to encourage polluters to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit by making them pay the bill and focus on the need to develop and invest in green technology. Frederic Dinguirard, from The Shift Project think-tank, wants to see "the creation of a 'signal-price' which triggers a decision to invest long-term, as these are the investments which are necessary to make the transition to a low carbon society". The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, an independent initiative on how the global economy can meet green challenges that is co-chaired by Mexican former president Felipe Calderon and economist Nicholas Stern, recommends that "governments introduce a strong, predictable and rising carbon price." The body says carbon pricing is "a particularly efficient way to advance climate and fiscal goals" as a means of "helping to guide consumption choices and investments towards low-carbon and away from carbon-intensive activities. It also sees the recent fall in oil prices as "an opportunity to advance carbon pricing and fossil fuel subsidy reform." Twenty managers' organisations from around the world, including Business Europe, recently wrote to UN climate chief Christiana Figueres stressing the importance of a carbon market being created as part of accords stemming from the Paris conference. "The development of a global carbon market will help stimulate investments in innovative technologies, installations and products to be made in locations where they deliver the greatest possible climate benefits at the lowest economic cost," wrote Business Europe, which urged "the setting of a global level playing field to ensure a fair comparison." But despite their efforts, the issue will not feature in Cop 21 talks, to the chagrin of Brice Lalonde, UN special advisor and a former French environment minister. "(This) illustrates perfectly the rather abstract side of the negotiations and the world inhabited by diplomats as compared to the world's economic reality," says Lalonde. Lalonde says it is "not totally to be ruled out" that carbon pricing could win a mention in an international Paris agreement. But he suggests it is somewhat unlikely given that "the petrol producing or coal producing nations don't want it as it will render their development more expensive." To date, some 40 nations and 23 cities have already introduced or scheduled the introduction of carbon pricing, covering around 12 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to World Bank figures. "So things are evolving - but not quickly enough to have a real impact on economic models," complains Pascal Canfin of the World Resources Institute in his guide to the issues facing Paris participants. Europe did bring in an emissions trading scheme a decade ago but with its surplus of allowances, coupled with low pricing, has not sparked the desired low-carbon investment decisions. Canfin says: "The price of carbon is an issue where international cooperation allows acceleration of national action. The results of Paris on this point will thus be a key element our in judging the success or otherwise of the climate summit." Lalonde meanwhile says the price level needs to be sufficiently high to "dissuade" firms from cleaving to the high-carbon path as well as pushing other green measures such as ending subsidies for fossil fuel. Dinguirard says an "arsenal" of measures is required to cut carbon emissions, comprising "all kinds of constraints, incentives" -- measures which would cement awareness of the global warming issue. A brief look at several methods of applying carbon pricing: Carbon tax A monetary levy added to a product's sale price on the basis of the volume of greenhouse gases emitted in its production and use. Several European countries and Mexico have introduced such a tax. The IMF recently said it favoured the option as the "best" solution despite reticence in the business world. Emissions norm A legally fixed standard determining the limit of greenhouse gas emissions allowed for the production of a good or a technology. Carbon market or exchange quota system This is a more flexible mechanism which fixes emissions reduction obligations and allows firms or countries to trade quotas, buying or selling depending on whether they have surpassed or remain inside set emissions limits. This is the system currently in use in the European Union, California and New Zealand. China, the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, says it will adopt this system in 2017.

Recent comments by some energy experts about nuclear energy being too costly, and that South Africa does not even need it, cannot go unchallenged. To understand the reasons for or against nuclear energy, perhaps we should first establish on what basis should a decision for or against such a move be made? Is it based on demand forecast, environmental concerns or just capital cost? Which seems to be the main focal point being proposed for abandoning the option of nuclear in South Africa? Had this been the case in 2010, when the first Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) for electricity supply in South Africa was developed, we would have had a least-cost and unconstrained power plan. However, this would have resulted in building only coal-fired power stations for base-load and gas/liquid fuel turbines and pumped storage for peaking capacity. Therefore neither renewables nor nuclear would have featured as options. As a consequence, the highly successful Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Programme (IPP) would have been a non-starter. Important to note that when plans for the IPP were announced, there was significant public debate on the necessity of the programme and "experts" rallied against it. Costs highlighted The key concern was the costs that were highlighted in Bid Window 1 that were on average R3 453 per megawatt-hour (MWh) for concentrated solar power, R3 374 per MWh for solar photovoltaic and R1 447 per MWh for wind. For the record, our current cost for the Koeberg nuclear power plant is R433 per MWh. It is noted, though, that the cost of new capacity for nuclear will be higher than R433 per MWh, because the depreciation cost will be higher for the new plant. This notwithstanding, and like our successful renewable programme, nuclear energy is the future. Electricity demand in South Africa has plateaued over the last 10 years. The demand predictions made in the IRP 2010 have not materialised and the economy has slowed. The cause of this is important as it impacts future growth predictions. The conundrum that planners are facing is whether the decline in growth is natural, structural or a direct consequence of the constrained supply. It is quite likely that the latter has played a significant role in curtailing demand and as the supply constraints ease, one will start seeing demand increasing above the recent trends. The increased demand, coupled with future decommissioning, will require South Africa to build new capacity. This then leads into the question of what do we build and when? For this we need to separate dispatchable (generation options where capacity can be increased or decreased on demand) and intermittent (generation options where capacity or availability cannot be controlled, such as wind and solar) supply options. To maintain control of the electrical network system, we require sufficient dispatchable power supplies distributed strategically across the network. The dispatchable options serve two purposes: namely as a back-up for intermittent supplies (renewables) to ensure demand is met, as well as providing frequency support without which the entire national supply system would be unstable. The larger the capacity of intermittent supply in the system, the more reactive the system needs to be. The options The options available for this purpose are coal, natural gas, liquid fuel, nuclear, geothermal, biomass and pumped storage. However, not all of these technologies are suitable for deployment in South Africa, based on the following considerations: l Geothermal is not available locally. l Natural gas is not sufficiently available to fill this role and there is uncertainty on long-term costs, though current prices are low. In addition, there will have to be limitations on maximum volumes to maintain security of supply in the event of interruptions. l Liquid fuels are too expensive to utilise as mid-merit or base-load options. l Biomass as a fuel source for large power generation is a potential fuel swop for coal in the future. Therefore, South Africa has only two real options for base-load and mid-merit operations to manage system requirements. These are coal and nuclear. The decision on which technology to deploy then requires an assessment of lifecycle cost, current and future predicted costs, and COP 21 commitments. Significant debate There has been significant debate on current and future costs of both these technologies. There is growing consensus that future cost comparisons will swing in favour of nuclear, given increasing coal-fired plant costs associated with continuously more stringent emission limits and the introduction of carbon taxes. Nuclear would also offer more certainty on future electricity pricing. Nuclear does have high initial construction costs. However, operationally, nuclear offers one of the cheapest sources of electricity that comes with zero greenhouse gas emissions. This is clearly more favourable than any fossil power generation. Nuclear power is the largest source of low-carbon electricity in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, with an 18 percent overall share of electricity production in 2013 and second at global levels with an 11 percent share. A total of 72 reactors were under construction at the beginning of 2014, the highest number in 25 years. According to the latest reports, China would account for the largest increase in nuclear capacity additions from 17 gigawatt (GW) in 2014 to 250GW in 2050. Other growing nuclear energy markets include India, the Middle East and the Russian Federation. For a number of countries like China, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates, this has meant reducing coal reliance and the impact for these countries has been immense. Finally, though there are a number of alternatives available, nuclear remains the best long-term option for the further development of South Africa's energy mix that will ensure security of electricity supply while adhering to our various national and international objectives.

Your Excellency, President of the Pan African Parliament, Honourable Roger Nkodo Dang, Honourable Ministers and Deputy Ministers, Your Excellencies, Ambassadors and High Commissioners, Members of the Diplomatic Corps, Honourable Members of the Pan African Parliament, Ladies and gentlemen, I am honoured to warmly welcome you to our country and would like to greet all of you on behalf of the South African Government and the people of South Africa. Let me take this opportunity to congratulate the President and the Vice Presidents of the Pan African Parliament (PAP) on their elections during the previous session. Mr President, I would like to assure you of our continued support to the PAP and we remain available for engagements on issues you may wish to raise with us at all times. This 1st Ordinary Session takes place on the backdrop of a successful 25th African Union (AU) Summit held in Johannesburg in June 2015. The Summit was held under the theme: Year of Women Empowerment and Development towards Africa's Agenda 2063. I am delighted that you decided to convene, on the margins of this Session, the 2015 Women Conference under the June AU Summit theme. This is a clear demonstration of your resolve and commitment to work towards the realisation of the 25th AU Summit declaration on the theme. As you may be aware, the AU has made many declarations over the years but has been found wanting when it comes to implementation. Your commitment and dedication in this regard is commended. We have recently participated in the United Nations' adoption of the Post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). African leadership heeded the call of the 25th AU Summit to participate in this process at the highest political level possible. This came at an opportune time when we celebrate 20 years of the Beijing Declaration and Plan of Action. This Declaration and Plan of Action remains a rallying roadmap towards the realisation of gender equality and women empowerment since its adoption by 189 UN Member States at the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995. We therefore believe that the continued implementation of our regional and continental mechanisms and protocols should be guided by the commitments of the Post-2015 SDGs, the Beijing Plan of Action, and aspirations espoused in Agenda 2063. Mr President and Honourable Members, We welcomed the adoption of the SDGs, being well aware of the task ahead to build on the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) while ensuring environmental sustainability. Climate Change is Goal 13 of the SGDs which calls for Taking Urgent Action to Combat Climate Change. We are encouraged by the general consensus and endorsement by the UN that such action should be taken within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It is heartening that you have dedicated time during the Session to debate climate change issues which are important to the continent and the global South under the theme Climate Change and African Position. It is in our collective interest to build momentum in preparation for COP 21 /CMP11 scheduled for December 2015 in Paris. Our livelihoods are to a greater extent dependent on the environment surroundings we live in. The importance of preserving the planet cannot be over-emphasised. In this context, we should recall that the Durban Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP17/CMP7) decisions and outcomes set us on the path towards a legally binding instrument. We will therefore participate in the Paris process with a clear determination to pursue the adoption of a fair and ambitious legally binding instrument. This is not the first time the PAP convenes forums to deliberate and strengthen African positions in issues of continental importance. It has done so previously while in cooperation with other AU organs, AU Member States individually and collectively, development partners, civil society organisations, business and academia. Ladies and gentlemen, In this regard, the aspirations of the African Agenda 2063 I briefly referred to above, requires strengthened coordination between the AU Commission Departments and Committees of other organs of the AU. I would like to urge the new Bureau to consolidate the mechanism and efforts undertaken by the previous leadership to ensure alignment between the PAP committees and the AU Commission departments. The PAP's oversight role is important in the pursuit of peace and security, promotion of democracy and good governance, as well as fostering economic growth and prosperity in Africa. You are an integral part towards the realisation of a vision of the AU forbearers. It is common knowledge that the Organ has a broader scope of work which transverse and compliments other AU organs' functions. This is evidenced by the variety of activities that you have undertaken throughout the eleven years of existence. These include Fact Finding Missions, Regional Parliamentary Meetings and Elections Observer Missions, among others. Mr President, I am well aware that the PAP mandate has been limiting your endeavours to deliver concrete and tangible results in certain areas. However, this august body must be commended for its achievement thus far. We are mindful of the fact that eleven years on, the PAP has not achieved its ultimate goal of becoming the continent's legislative body. This organ continues to function as a consultative and an advisory body. We should however be encouraged by the 2014 AU Mid-Year Summit's adoption of the reviewed PAP protocol. The reviewed protocol will enhance the PAP's mandate once it enters into force. South Africa undertakes to embark on a national process which will enable us to ratify this protocol and would like to encourage other AU Member States to do the same. This is the only way we can accelerate the entry into force of the protocol thereby demonstrating our commitment to transform the PAP. Ladies and gentlemen, The AU requires stronger organs in order to achieve its continental political and economic integration agenda. I thank you. \</doc>

Programme Director All the Ministers and the Deputy Ministers present All the MECs and Mayors All Heads of Delegation The leadership of REN21 and SANEDI Government representatives Captains of Industry Representatives of Non-government organisations Ladies and Gentlemen Good afternoon We, as South Africans, have been the proud hosts of the International Renewable Energy Conference for 2015. We have come to the end of our gathering and in particular the pondering of a very important topic on renewable energy by 82 countries that are represented at this SAIREC. Let me take this opportunity to highlight on the myriad challenges I referred to in the opening about the African continent, that range from high levels of poverty and inequality, a lack infrastructure, poor governance, relatively low levels of skills and productivity at a time where energy is a necessity to alleviate poverty and promote sustainable economic growth in the continent. Many of these factors contribute to a business environment in which it is often judged difficult and costly to operate. In sub-Saharan Africa, the epicentre of the global challenge is to overcome energy poverty. However I must say the challenges are surmountable and the benefits are immense. Energy contributes to a better quality of life. To those that have it, modern energy unlocks access to improved healthcare, improved education, improved economic opportunities and, even longer life. To those that don't, it is a major constraint on their social and economic development. Africa's energy sector is vital to its development. I am happy that in these three days we have looked at the whole renewable energy value chain, focusing on Africa Continental Interconnectivity, regulatory framework, Technology Innovation, Financing mechanism and the Road to COP 21 in an effort to unlock all the barriers and to tap and maximise the opportunities that come with harnessing the natural resources that the world and in particular Africa is endowed with. The effective development of Africa's energy resources could unlock huge gains across the economy. But key questions remain on how quickly can modern energy be brought to the huge population now deprived of it? How can the existing and emerging rich countries maximise the value of their resources? What actions in the energy sector can unleash stronger economic and social development in the African continent? Distinguished Guests, to meet the greenhouse gas reduction objectives and mitigate global warming, as governments we need to actively pursue low-carbon policies. On our respective journeys to lower carbon pathways, renewable energy has a major role to play in the energy mix. Programme Director, we are following up in the footsteps of Germany, China, USA, India and the United Arab Emirates. We are proud to be counted among those who have hosted the largest conference on renewable energy in the world. This has been a significant event - being the first of its kind on African soil and at a crucial time: a time where energy is a necessity to alleviate poverty and fast track sustainable development in a climate resilient manner. In South Africa, energy is a basic need. We are committed to providing a long term solution to energy security across the continent, a continent where energy supply is limited. The renewable energy sector provides an opportunity to stimulate new local industries, new opportunities and the empowerment of people through direct and shared ownership with communities, when the renewable energy sector is developed from a local perspective. South Africa is committed to greening its economy, shifting away from a heavy reliance on fossil fuels and heavy reliance on a resource extraction economy. Renewable energy offers a major opportunity to further develop our country into the lower carbon and climate resilient vision we have set out in our National Development Plan. It has the potential to stimulate job creation, skills development and a broader local economy as well as positively contributing to our national energy mix. As a country, we are working hard to change our development pathway to a more sustainable one, and renewable energy is significant in the country's transition to a lower carbon economy and society. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has estimated the contribution of our grid tied renewables' net benefit to the economy to be R800 million. In the first half of 2015 renewables were estimated to generate R4 billion in financial benefits. Other renewable energy sources that we also need to take advantage of are: Landfill gas: South Africa has become a leader in this sector and is currently looking into scaling up effort in this area. Anaerobic digestion to produce biogas, which is a young sector, with a lot of interest as it plays a role in reducing organic waste disposed to the landfill and reducing methane emissions from water treatment facilities. We will certainly step up our efforts in entrenching the renewable energy paradigm. And the vestiges thereof are in having announced the establishment of the 1500 MegaWatt Solar Park in the Northern Cape. Our work which is evidenced in the Renewable Energy Status Report is bears an emphatic account of the interventions made in respect of our policy trajectory, existing renewable energy landscape and the future we aspire for. In trekking into the future, we shall be unwavering in our support towards Namibia in its hosting of the Southern African Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency. We are happy that the SAIREC Declaration has been adopted and I challenge all of you here to ensure that this declaration should not become part of a talk show. Rather it should be embedded into your countries' commitments so that when we meet at the next IREC we can reflect on progress in the next two years instead of just adopting another declaration. I wish you a safe journey back to your destinations, and success in the deployment and scale of the renewable energy journey in your respective countries. In particular I thank the German government, the Austrian government, and all the sponsors for their support to South Africa in hosting SAIREC 2015. Special thanks to the Local Organising Committee for ensuring that this conference is the success that it is. I thank you. \</doc>

IT is blindingly obvious that if all countries agreed to take immediate action to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide, it would be massively expensive and turn the world economy upside down. The cost of everything will rise. Food, fuel, building costs, prices of just about everything. Taxes will rise too, of course, and the private sector will be faced with yet more regulations backed by the threat of draconian fines. Well, perhaps it is not that obvious. None of these consequences seem to bother the UN. It is enthusiastically backing the whole climate change boondoggle. It misses no opportunity to put itself forward as the saviour of the world from the alleged earth-changing sins of private enterprise. It still hopes for a (miraculous) agreement by all countries to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to prevent the earth hotting up with alleged disastrous consequences for humanity (and everything else that lives and breathes on the planet). This yet to be achieved consensus supposedly will be delivered in Paris, France, in December at the culmination of the 21st conference on climate change organised by the UN, or to give its full title, the "Conference of the Parties" ( CoP 21 ). Yes, well, no, fine, as we say, because with two months to go before the scheduled happy ending, there are signs that it might be difficult to get the trumpets to blow a fanfare. Put aside such pressing matters as the chaos in the Middle East, mass migration, bordering on invasion into Europe, the Ukraine shambles, the Taliban resurgence in Afghanistan, not to mention the state of the global economy. Ignore all that. Saving the world from burning to a crisp is supposedly the overwhelming concern of those attending the conference. The bureaucrats of the UN are counting on it. But are world leaders with the power and the cash required for the rescue equally passionate? Take the wonderfully named Like-Minded-Developing-Countries (which suggests there are some that are not). The UN prefers to call them LMDCs (acronyms are beloved of all bureaucrats). These make up half the world's population. Do they care as much about, or believe climate change is as great a threat, as people in the comfortable middle classes of the West or those walking the corridors of UN headquarters in Flushing Meadows, New York? There is some doubt they do. The like-minded developing countries had their own pre-Paris conference two weeks ago (September 15). They met to decide a negotiating strategy, which suggests something less than a wholehearted commitment and more like a tussle for advantage. The post conference statements seemed to be in the context of the recent UN admission that the Paris conference is not about protecting the environment, but about negotiating the distribution of the world's resources, and transforming the "global economic model". Unified stand urged India's environment minister, Prakash Javadekar, set the tone. He urged the LMDCs to take "a unified stand on critical issues", using words like mitigation, adaptation, loss, damage, finance, technology development and transfer, the principle of equity, and common but differentiated responsibilities. Rich nations should transfer money to the poor to mitigate the effects of climate change. India would resist any "obligatory review mechanism", he said. "If the developed world doesn't walk the talk on issue of finance, there will be a problem for the Paris outcome. I hope the developed world will consider it and rise to the occasion," he said. It sounded like a veiled threat. Meanwhile, the EU, according to Brussels bureaucrats, has reached an agreement that all its 28 states will jointly reduce Europe's emissions by 30 to 40 percent by 2020. Poland had to be beaten over the head to agree. It relies heavily on coal for its energy. Lastly, there is doubt about the keenness of powerful Western politicians to obey the climate change agenda set by the UN. The US has never gone along with it, whatever its presidents have said. Now doubts appear to be extending to the leadership of other industrialised countries. The top seven leaders are due to arrive on the first day of the Paris conference and then leave. So no glorious conclusion on the final day. This is when everyone is supposed to shout, "Hurrah, we have saved the world!" as world leaders sign a binding treaty to spend more than $100 billion (R1.39 trillion) on doing so in the next five years. Seeing as promises made to deliver this amount were first made in 2009 before the full implications of the global economic downturn were known, there seems a fat chance of it happening in 2015. Reality has crept in It is true that the UN has since reduced the amount of cash needed to $2bn, according to some reports. Perhaps the lower figure is because reality has crept in. Nevertheless, the amount of money the UN climate bureaucracy wants is certainly ambitious. The question is whether the developed world - the part with the money - is ready to do so on the basis of a theory that cannot be proved or disproved. There are plenty of other crises that demand their attention. Whatever noble motives - love of nature, wild animals, all animals, vegetarianism, and veganism - that drive the Green lobby, the prime motive behind the climate change scare has now morphed into one with a distinctly fascist tinge - a push for world government that grows more blatant by the day with unelected UN bureaucrats seeking unprecedented supranational power.

Funding development Forum aims to narrow gap between global economies HISTORY may remember 2015 as the year in which the international community began forging a new social contract for structuring global economic governance and the framework in which socially and environmentally sustainable development takes place. This new contract should slowly emerge from the three major conferences - on financing for development, sustainable development and climate change - that the United Nations (UN) is hosting over the next six months. Given the chaotic and unpredictable state of global economic and political affairs and the generally weak capacity of the UN, it is tempting to dismiss these conferences as expensive photo opportunities and gabfests. However, before doing so, it would be prudent to recall the lesson from the UN's previous effort to create a new social contract between governments, the international community and their citizens. In December 1948, the members of the UN, by a vote of 48-0 with eight abstentions, including SA, adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. At the time, no participating state expected the declaration to amount to much more than an idealistic statement of human aspirations that hard-nosed politicians could comfortably ignore. Almost 70 years later, following efforts by governments, lawyers, human rights activists and academics, in which the struggle against apartheid played a starring role, many consider the declaration to be part of customary international law. The combined outcome of this year's conferences could have a similar effect. Collectively, they may produce a set of standards, norms and goals to guide policies and actions - including those of governments, international organisations, corporations, philanthropies and civil society groups - for creating sustainable and inclusive societies. They may also establish the basis for holding these actors accountable for their actions. The first of these three conferences - the third Financing for Development (FfD) Conference - starts in Addis Ababa today and will build on the outcomes of the first two FfD conferences. The focus of the first conference was on the responsibilities of advanced and developing economies with regard to the use of international trade, aid, debt relief and institution building to promote sustainable development. Held in Monterrey, Mexico, in March 2002, this was the first UN-sponsored meeting between advanced economies and the developing and emerging market economies to tackle the frustrations the latter felt at the dominance of the Bretton Woods institutions and the advanced economies in debates about development and to talk about the best ways to manage financial flows for development. The second FfD conference was held in Doha, Qatar, in early 2008, just as the financial crisis was beginning to engulf the world. Its focus was on ensuring that adequate financing was mobilised for development. The conference was also part of the international effort to forge an agreement between advanced and emerging markets and developing economies about strategies for dealing with the financial crisis. This week's FfD conference will concentrate on both the quantity and quality of the financial flows for development. The draft of the Addis Ababa Accord that countries will conclude and sign at the conference, explicitly links the issue of financing for development to the post-2015 development agenda that the international community will adopt at a summit in New York in September and to the climate-change issue, which it will seek to resolve at COP-21 in Paris in December. It should be seen as part of the efforts to forge an agreement on how the international community should deal with our problems of political and social conflict, inequality and environmental degradation. Thus, it expresses support for such goals as delivering social protection, ending chronic undernourishment and hunger, promoting investment in sustainable infrastructure, and financing inclusive and sustainable industrialisation. The document recognises that the financing for this agenda must come from international and domestic public and private sources. It raises a number of important issues for Africa. For example, in the section on domestic resource mobilisation, in addition to stressing the need for countries to have effective tax systems and administration and the importance of transparent and participatory budget processes, it highlights the adverse consequences that illicit financial flows, which cost African states about $50bn a year, can have on efforts to implement sustainable development strategies. In the section on international public financing, it notes that developing countries cannot raise adequate financing for development from their own resources and calls on advanced economies to finally meet their long-standing commitment to provide 0.7% of gross national income as official development assistance. The document also acknowledges the significance of the new financial institutions, such as the Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China, SA) bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The draft accord does not ignore the private sector and supports the creation of regulatory frameworks for promoting both domestic and international investment, and inclusive and sound financial systems that can finance small-, micro-and medium-sized enterprises and facilitate remittance flows at reasonable costs. It also urges the private sector to pay appropriate attention to its social and environmental responsibilities. It is more than 70 years since the international community began forging the arrangements that now structure the management of the global political economy. However, these arrangements have failed to adapt to our fast-changing world, so they are no longer capable of effectively managing the economic, social, political and environmental problems we face. We therefore need a new agreement on global economic governance. This week's conference is an important step in the process of establishing this. We need to make sure South African and other African voices are heard. This week's conference will concentrate on both the quantity and quality of financial flows for development \</doc>

France would fund e2 billion (R30.47bn) of renewable energy projects in Africa until 2020, a 50 percent increase on the previous five years, French officials said. France's financing should cover about a fifth of the cost of a goal agreed on this year to install 10 gigawatts of power capacity in Africa by 2020, the officials said. The financing was announced as President Fran\'c3\Â£7ois Hollande hosted talks with African leaders at the COP21 climate talks in Paris. The meeting was focused on electrification, preventing desertification and rehabilitating Lake Chad. "If there is no financing, there is no action in these areas," Hollande said in opening comments at the meeting. The extra funding meant that France would be financing a total of e6bn of power projects across Africa in the coming five years, Hollande added. - Bloomberg \</doc>

United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-Moon The President of the United Nations General Assembly, Ambassador Mogens Lykketoft The Executive Secretary, Mr. Mourad Ahmia Excellency's Distinguished delegates After the immense misery and social disintegration as a result of the Second World War, the establishment of the United Nations provided nations the means to foster peace, build democracy and create a just society on a global scale. The creation of the organisation was also a pathway for the independence of many of the members of this Group. 70 years after its establishment, we should use this occasion to evaluate the UN's history and its many achievements and challenges and assess its effectiveness in addressing the specific interests and needs of developing countries. The future of developing countries lies in a strong and robust multilateral system, based on the principles of international law. We must secure the restructuring of international political and economic systems in order to rectify the inherent asymmetries of power. This would safeguard developing countries, which make up the majority of countries across the globe, having a voice in global governance. The Group of 77 and China has made notable contributions over the years to the effective functioning of the United Nations. As the largest grouping of States within the UN system, the Group of 77 and China, has played a fundamental role in crafting international economic policies and relations, narrowing the gap between developing and developed countries. The Group has also been a major actor in developing initiatives to advance development and international economic cooperation among developing countries. The Group can therefore legitimately claim a large part of the credit for advancing the interest of marginalised people of the world within the UN system. Today's meeting provides us with an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the continuing validity and relevance of the objectives and principles of our Group. In this regard, this meeting will adopt a declaration that will include strategies of action underpinning and supporting the processes in which we have been involved during the past year and in which we remain involved. Distinguished delegates, During the past nine months, we have witnessed the finalisation of the negotiations on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The outcome document that the Summit will adopt build on the Millennium Development Goals and covers all three dimensions of sustainable development. This global development agenda recognises and responds to the triple challenges of poverty, inequality and unemployment that most of us continue to face. It has been our Group's active engagement of the negotiation process that has ensured that the key interests of developing countries are reflected in the outcome document. The realisation of the new Agenda will only be achieved if the Global Partnership focuses on adequate means of implementation as identified under Goal 17 and under each individual goal. It is imperative that the follow-up and review process for the goals should also focus on whether the means of implementation have been achieved and whether developed countries have kept to their commitments. Of major importance in the outcome document is the inclusion of the Principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR) which recognises our different national realities, capacities and levels of development and respects our national policies and priorities. Another major achievement has been the reference to the right to development; and, removing the obstacles to the full realisation of the right of self-determination of people living under colonial and foreign occupation. Distinguished delegates; The 3rd International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD3) resulted in the adoption of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. While the Addis Agenda emphasises the importance of financing for development, it is disappointing that there is little in the way of new funds to fill the existing development financing gap. Developed countries merely repeat their 45-year-old commitment to allocate 0.7% of their Gross National Income (GNI) to Official Development Assistance (ODA). The problem is that only a handful of developed countries have ever met this target. Distinguished delegates, South Africa welcomes the work carried out by the Ad Hoc Committee on Debt Restructuring Processes. South Africa, within the Group of 77 and China, will continue considering improved approaches to restructuring sovereign debt, taking into account the newly adopted Basic Principles and work carried out by the international financial institutions, in accordance with their respective mandates. The 10th Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) will be held for the first time in Africa, in Nairobi, Kenya this December. South Africa urges the international community to work tirelessly to conclude the Doha Development Round of negotiations and give priority to issues that address the imbalances and inequities of the current global trading system by agreeing on legally binding outcomes that will allow developing countries to effectively engage in equitable global trade. Distinguished delegates, In December at the upcoming Paris Climate Conference, we hope to adopt a new legal agreement which we are currently negotiating under the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action. It is important that this multilateral process on climate change be respected and lead to the adoption of an ambitious and fair agreement in Paris. This agreement should serve our twin objectives of ensuring environmental integrity, whilst protecting the development space of developing countries. To be successful, the new legal agreement must be fair. Fairness would imply respect for the Convention's principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR and RC). There should be differentiation between the actions required of developed and developing countries based on different capacities and historical responsibility for climate change. Respect for CBDR and RC also means the provision of the financial and other support from developed countries that developing countries require to enable them to undertake their best efforts to address the climate challenge. The new legal agreement must accord adaptation the same priority as mitigation. Since adaptation is a global responsibility, we should call for the adoption of a global goal on adaptation. Means of Implementation and support for developing countries (public sector finance, technology transfer and capacity building) will be of central importance to the Paris outcome. Developed countries should commit to a goal of jointly mobilising US$ 100 billion per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. Funds provided to developing country Parties may come from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources. A significant share of new multilateral funding for adaptation should flow through the Green Climate Fund. It is essential that existing commitments covering the pre-2020 period are honoured and that the second commitment period to the Kyoto Protocol comes into force preferably before COP21 /CMP11. The new legal agreement covering the post-2020 period will have limited credibility if there is insufficient action in the pre-2020 period. Distinguished delegates, The 70th anniversary of the UN is also an opportune time for us to evaluate and discuss ways in which to strengthen South-South cooperation. South-South cooperation remains important for strengthening the economic independence of countries of the South and is not a substitute, but rather a complement to North-South cooperation. We should also look at ways in which we could strengthen the institutions of the Group of 77 and China. We must ensure that the Secretariat of the Group is adequately funded to ensure that it carries out the Group's objectives in an effective and efficient manner. Similar support should also be extended to institutions that promote and contribute to the unity and solidarity of the Group, including the South Centre, in order to be our power houses for service delivery, knowledge sharing, information, professionalism and excellence. Distinguished delegates, During this session, we will approve both the biennial budget for 2016-2017 and the scales of assessment. The Group should continue to stress that the level of resources approved by the General Assembly must match the increase in mandates and activities approved by Member States. It is essential that arbitrary cost-cutting not be used as an excuse to shift funding from developing country programmes to the detriment of the South. Distinguished delegates, In conclusion, and in view of our ongoing endeavours for a fair and just world, the Group of 77 and China should remain involved and relevant in all multilateral processes, specifically at this important juncture when the international community is considering our collective development aspirations beyond 2015. From our own experience, it is clearly evident that the G77 is most powerful when it is most united. Let us harness the diversity of our group to fortify our unity. I thank you. \</doc>

With El Nino affecting countries in southern Africa, threatening agricultural production due to a massive heat wave, the World Food Programme has urged the international community to support the upscaling of climate smart agricultural technology for resilience. During her recent visit to Zambia, one of the region's foremost producers and exporters of maize and other crops, WFP Executive Director, Ertharin Cousin said the situation was a crisis that should not be allowed to degenerate into a disaster. "We need to get organised and not let the situation, which is still at crisis level degenerate into a disaster. I believe there are opportunities that still exist through proven climate-smart techniques such as conservation agriculture," said Cousin enthusiastically. She said the time has come for the world to 'walk the talk' on climate change adaptation, as agreed at the COP 21 Climate Conference in Paris, last year. "What I have seen here in Zambia has proved what I was saying at the climate summit that 'the furthest behind are the most vulnerable'... therefore, making them resilient should be the ultimate goal for us all. And I am talking adaptation through climate smart technologies and crop diversity," she said. While the challenge ahead is huge, the WFP chief thinks the future should be defined by hope through what works to help smallholders be more resilient. Highlighting the case of Bishop Mweene, a conservation farmer in Pemba district, whose maize crop survived a 22-day dry spell, Cousin believes climate smart agriculture could be a difference between success and failure in a climate changing world. "If what we have seen at the lead farmer is anything to go by, then we have the solutions in our hands. All we need is to upscale these proven technologies to a wider community for them to reap the benefits as he is doing," Cousin told IPS. Farmer Mweene, 51, boasts of a modern house with iron sheets which he says has been made possible through increased productivity as a result of conservation agriculture --a climate smart agricultural technique that thrives on minimum tillage guaranteeing enough moisture for crops to survive severe dry spells. Through the Conservation Agriculture Scaling Up (CASU) Project by FAO and the Ministry of Agriculture with financial support from the European Union, and now part of index insurance based rural resilience by WFP, Mweene has seen a positive change in his standard of living. "Before this programme, my children were frequently sent back from school for nonpayment of school fees, but not anymore. Through increased productivity, I earn more money and I have even managed to build a brick house with iron sheets," said Mweene, a proud father of 23 children, most of whom have left for urban areas in search of economic opportunities. Southern Province Agricultural Coordinator, Maxwell Choombe says the introduction of insurance for smallholders could hold the key for young people's active participation in agriculture as a business. "Over the years, youths see agriculture as a risky business but with insurance now, young people could be attracted into agriculture,", said Choombe. And Stanley Ndhlovu of WFP's Zambia Rural Resilience Initiative (R4), agrees with this reasoning saying that the major challenge has been the higher risk associated with agriculture which is mainly anchored on rainfall, without which, failure is guaranteed. "R4 is anchored on disaster risk. Over the years, we have realised that the risk in Zambia's agriculture is growing especially with the weather changes and this is pushing youths away from the sector that has so much potential to lift them out of poverty," Ndhlovu told IPS. Ndhlovu explained that R4, which was launched last year, is about risk transfer developed, not only to mitigate against climate shocks but also help farmers adapt to the changing climate. "Risk transfer is basically insurance in our case. We know that traditional insurance exists but is out of reach of small scale farmers because it is too expensive and most insurance players consider it too risk to support the smallholder sector. Our (WFP's) intervention is therefore weather-based index insurance--insuring against rain and not the crop," explained Ndhlovu. According to Ndhlovu, the index insurance component has been developed in such a way that it uses, for now, satellite information to trigger a payout to farmers based on the rainfall received, focusing on critical periods in the rainfall calendar. Coupled with prudent risk or credit to support investment and risk reserves or savings, WFP has prioritized weather index through the establishment of an automated weather station in the community and manual rain-gauge stations in selected areas for the farmers' timely decision making. Darton Nanja, the Southern Province Meteorological Officer told IPS that while national weather information dissemination remains centralized, the automated weather station is "ground-proofing of the weather index insurance for the farmers in the R4 project area and the surrounding community to receive a pay-out or not." With five hundred farmers already insured at a total value of over 77,000 dollars, calls for up-scaling may not be misplaced. "For the past year, I have seen the positive effects of insurance for smallholder farmers. Apart from improved living standards, farmers now have confidence to get credit and I think this project is the best thing that could have happened to rural farmers," said Angela Mushasho, the Agricultural Camp Extension Officer in the pilot project area. While such projects are meant to build the medium and long term capacity of smallholders, the country's top leadership is looking at the immediate food requirements that are likely to emanate from the poor rainfall showing being experienced. "We are looking at possibilities of importing maize. But we are still in discussions with all concerned stakeholders, for example, replanting of early maturing varieties to salvage what we can before resorting to the last option of whether we might need to import maize," said Republican President, Edgar Lungu. Based on the rainfall pattern so far, the president's emergency plan may not be far from reality considering that the Southern African country did not receive enough rainfall in the last rainy season. The situation affected agricultural production, forcing government to provide relief food to at least 133, 000 households countrywide. In a year when drought and the global El Ni\'f1o weather event are having a severe impact particularly on smallholder farmers who account for most of the region's agricultural production, Zambia and the entire Southern African region is bracing for tough times ahead. \</doc>

Your Excellencies Heads of State and Government Ministers, Delegates and Invited guests, It is indeed our great honour and privilege to host the Forum for China-Africa Cooperation Summit in South Africa. We are pleased that the FOCAC summit is taking place in Africa for the first time. The decision clearly illustrates the underlying ethos of the FOCAC platform which is mutual trust, equality and partnership. Esteemed colleagues, Let me welcome the opening statements by my esteemed colleagues President Xi, President Mugabe and the Chairperson of the AU Commission Dr Dlamini Zuma. Let me especially acknowledge and welcome the new measures announced by President Xi this morning which definitely take this partnership between Africa and China to its highest level since the inception of the FOCAC. Your Excellencies, Tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the passing of our beloved President Nelson Mandela. His belief in peace, freedom, democracy, equality, justice and human rights for all must continue to inspire us to work tirelessly each day to build a better Africa and a more just world. Your Excellencies, The theme of this Summit, Africa-China Progressing Together: Win-Win Cooperation for Common Development is a clear indications of the intentions of this strategic partnership. Originally, we were comrades in arms in the quest for liberation and freedom, at the height of colonialism and apartheid. Given that history, it was only natural that Africa has developed a win-win partnership for development and progress with China over the years. The partnership encompasses cooperation in a number of developmental areas including agriculture, renewable energy, skills training, health, peace and security and infrastructure development. These elements align with and are integral to our vision for Africa as outlined by Agenda 2063. Already the partnership is yielding economic results. China has become Africa's largest trade partner, and Africa is now one of China's major import sources and fourth largest investment destination. This partnership can only yield further positive results for Africa's development. However, we meet during a difficult global economic crisis. This affects both our trade outlook as well as investment flows into our countries. This period therefore calls for innovation and resilience to make our economies survive the global meltdown. Also, there is still hope for Africa despite the global economic downturn. African economies and the Sub-Saharan region in particular have some of the fastest growing economies in the world. Importantly, China and African countries share the advantage of having largely youthful populations. We also have the numbers. Together we make up nearly a third of the global population. Africa has in the region of one point one billion people and China has one point three billion people. Africa also has unique agricultural conditions, innovative and entrepreneurial businesspeople, indigenous knowledge, a huge economic potential in our oceans, and significant quantities of mineral resources, to name a few. I have deliberately mentioned mineral resources last because, whilst these are a blessing, they have also made Africa vulnerable to exploitation. It is for this reason that we want to prioritise beneficiation and value-addition. In that way, what is buried in the belly of our soil will translates into benefit for the bellies of our citizens. We are also keen to explore cooperation with China to ensure the long term viability of African mining and extractive industries in a global market. This is important in light of the declining demand for commodities. Africa needs improved connectivity through road, rail and air and we need water infrastructure, energy and a lot more to improve economic activity and improve lives. Excellencies, The year 2015 has brought about the painful humanitarian disaster occasioned by unparalleled global migration. Scores of migrants from Africa and the Middle East have perished in the Mediterranean sea in their attempts to reach Europe. This desperation is caused by the urgent need to flee from wars and conflict and from poverty and hopelessness. Tragically, we are also witnessing increasing incidents of terrorism in parts of our Continent, France and elsewhere. The tragedies remind as leaders that we must work harder to build peace and also to promote inclusive growth and development. There can be no lasting military solution to this problem. It needs political, social and economic solutions to ensure sustainability. In the short term we need to protect our youth in particular from being brainwashed into joining extremist groupings that perpetuate violence and destruction. Importantly, we must give the African people who live in poverty hope that a better future is possible. Africa has already taken steps to find African solutions to end conflicts and instability. The continent has committed to Silencing the Guns in our continent by 2020, in alignment with our commitment to Agenda 2063. We have already taken a significant step forward towards bringing the African Standby Force and its Rapid Deployment Capability into operation. The Force will respond quickly in conflict situations to save lives and bring stability. I would like to acknowledge the tangible contribution of the People's Republic of China's with regard to peacekeeping in Africa. In addition to participating in up to sixteen United Nations Peacekeeping Missions in Africa, China currently has approximately 2000 peacekeeping personnel on the ground. We appreciate this commitment to peace, development and progress. It gives practical meaning to the belief of President Xi that China's military capability must be utilized to achieve peace. Excellencies, We must give our people hope that indeed the guns will be silenced, and that peace can be achieved in every part of the continent. Peace creates better conditions for the achievement of economic development and growth. Your Excellencies, Very important discussions are taking place in Paris, France, the Twenty First Conference of the Parties to the UNwork Convention on Climate Change. This includes the right to receive the support they require to make the transition to a low carbon economy and to adapt to climate climate including support for those that have suffered loss and damage. It is also a fundamental principle of the Convention that our actions must be based on the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities. We wish all parties successful negotiations in Paris. These are set to intensify next week. COP 21 must succeed and must produce a legally binding outcome that is applicable to all that will save this planet for future generations. Your Excellencies Esteemed guests, The strategic partnership and cooperation between Africa and the People's Republic of China is an important instrument towards the achievement of our development goals.

SPECIAL REPORT: WORLD FORESTRY. OVERVIEW An untapped resource SA's forestry sector could help the country mitigate the threat of climate change WHAT IT MEANS FOCUS ON PRESERVING THE FORESTRY SECTOR MOBILISING INDUSTRY AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS An often underappreciated sector, the vast array of products which come from the forestry industry often go unnoticed in our day-to-day lives, says Forestry SA (FSA) executive director Michael Peter. But if managed sustainably, the industry could help offset the threat of climate change in SA. The 14th World Forestry Congress is putting the spotlight on this essential sector. Taking place at the International Convention Centre in Durban from September 7 to 11, this will be the first time the congress takes place on African soil. It's a joint venture with the UN Food & Agriculture Organisation, the AU Commission, other forestry stakeholders and government departments. Government has been enthusiastic in its endorsement of the event. In the build-up to the gathering, department of agriculture, forestry & fisheries (DAFF) minister Senzeni Zokwana said: & The growing threat of climate change has dramatically thrown the importance of our forests into critical focus. & When we speak of the future, we cannot escape the need to pay attention to the issue of engaging our youth and women by empowering them to play a meaningful role in the development of the forestry sector, as they are the future.& According to the department, the forestry sector in SA is a major contributor to the national economy. Commercial plantations cover an area of about 1,2mha and the industry's gross contribution to GDP, excluding that of paper, is R28,1bn. With paper added, this amounts to R45bn/year . Peter adds that forestry accounts for 22,5% of jobs in the agricultural sector and up to 40% of agriculture's contribution to GDP. Roundwood sales alone generate R7,5bn/year. Globally, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's Forest Solutions Group estimates that & annual demand for wood alone is expected to triple by 2050 to more than 10bnm\'b3 - equivalent to 4mn Olympic size swimming pools full of wood each year& SA and Africa are no different. Congress secretary-general Trevor Abrahams says government recognises the importance of a range of sectors such as timber for roofing, mining and paper. & Government has invested more than R1,5bn in some of the innovation in forestry projects, particularly in ferrous production. Our timber industry is not simply about logs,& he says. Looking at the local industry, MTO Forestry & Cape Pine CEO Lawrence Polkinghorne says: & It's very much determined by geographical regions. Overall the industry is in a good space, specifically when you look at the opportunities on offer from the rest of the continent.& He continues: & The SA forestry resource is somewhat finite, the opportunity for expansion is limited and there is pressure on supply in certain regions, but there is a definite demand for wood on the continent and as a result we are optimistic about the future of the industry.& In recent years some frustrations within the sector have been ironed out. Polking-horne says: & The Western Cape resource has been under pressure since 2001 when it was decided that approximately 45000ha be exited and restored to natural fynbos. Subsequently it was determined that 22500ha (of the 45000ha) was sustainable for forestry and could be replanted. & The DAFF and MTO have entered into an interim agreement to ensure that the areas to be replanted are maintained and suitable for 'offer' to the sector. Some areas will be replanted as part of the agreement, the regenerated areas will be spaced and maintained. & This is a positive move for the industry and bodes well for future wood flows, though we have a long way to go before it can be deemed sustainable.& HMH (the holding company of Merensky Timber) CEO Claus Lippert believes the local industry is in an interesting place. The semi-arid nature of the country limits the sector in terms of its size but, globally, the SA forestry industry has a good reputation. & Forest Stewardship Council certification shows that our forests are well managed and provide environmental, social and economic benefits. We protect indigenous vegetation and take care of natural waterways. We look after huge tracts of unplanted land adjacent to our forests where biodiversity is preserved. We see ourselves as custodians for future generations.& Lippert does agree with Peter that the industry needs more government recognition. He says: & In terms of exports, Merensky currently sends consignments to various export markets, but it's difficult to remain competitive when labour and electricity costs are increasing so rapidly. In fact, it's now becoming economically viable to generate our own electricity. & In terms of job creation, we should beneficiate in SA and manufacture in SA, rather than importing. There are huge opportunities in this regard. Our biggest challenge as a country is that economic growth is low and poverty is high. There is much potential to address these issues by supporting and growing the forestry industry.& Abrahams sees the congress as an opportune time to highlight the importance of forestry. & The role of forestry in our lives is often misunderstood. The whole downstream area is not well appreciated in our lives. Forestry is often a bit of a stepchild of people's consciousness,& he says. & Forestry is not just about trees, it's about habitats. About people growing and living off the forests. About forests being a source of livelihood for the community.& The congress has come at a critical time for forestry, both locally and globally, says Abrahams, who urges the industry to use the event as an important lobbying tool. This view is supported by Nomkhita Mona, CEO of state-owned forestry company Safcol. & The new COP 21 Mona believes SA's hosting of the congress is a significant step for the continent and that the industry should grab the opportunity to put the importance of forestry under the spotlight. & The industry is usually overshadowed by issues like food security. However, its significant role is underplayed. The focus on people and forests and the benefits they bring is a welcome change. There is also a shift towards agriforestry - where forest land has multiple uses, including food crop production,& she says. & As Africa is largely dependent on wood products to use as fuel for cooking, building and other uses, we expect discussions around illegal logging and its effects.& In terms of her hopes for the congress, Mona says: & I hope there will be an increased awareness of the importance of forests and their economic value in the well-being of the human race.& Senzeni Zokwana Forestry sector affects us all \</doc>

COMMENT So much in what Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan announced to Parliament in hisbudget speech on Wednesday was pleasing, such as the myriad developmental accomplishments, and yet so much more is truly \'c2\Â£dhorrifying. Apparently,achieving a balanced assessment is beyond most commentators trying to steadyour feet on the SA Titanic, what with world financial markets roiling the rand. Inspite of bending over backwards to meet financial markets' demands for a lowerbudget deficit (he promised just 2.4% of gross domestic product by 2018, downfrom 3.8%), Gordhan was pummelled by an immediate 3.2% currency collapse in theminutes after he spoke. Frankly,most of us who pore over the budget speech are, in class terms, petit bourgeoisor above. That's revealed in the kinds of budget reviews that dominate mediasuch as the Mail& Guardian . When at theconversation.com a normally humane, democratic politicalscientist like Ongama Mtimka blithely praises Gordhanbecause "the increase in social grants continues toprovide a social security net to millions of South Africans, keeping them outof extreme poverty," he subliminally ignores the substantialafter-inflation cuts to poor people's grants. So does another Conversation contributor,Leon Schreiber, when he says: "The fact that government has avoided cuts tosocial assistance grants is a politically shrewd move." Lads, here's a fact check: Gordhan providesjust a 3.5% nominal increase to foster care providers (who play such a vitalrole, given our catastrophic Aids orphan rate) and a 6.1% rise for mothers whoare child support grant recipients. These poor families face double-digitinflation this year thanks to food, electricity and transport hikes. So Gordhan's "real" - after-inflation - cutsto welfare grants of several percent hurt us (in the petit-bourgeoisie) theleast, yes, but 16.5-million recipients from South Africa's lumpen-proletariatwill struggle to find more holes in their frayed belts to tighten up, giventhat 63% of our compatriots - mostly women - already live below the povertyline. Mtimku endorses South Africa proudly takingour financial place within the Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China, SouthAfrica) bloc: "The R2 billion allocated to the NewDevelopment Bank (NDB) focused on investments in Africa should bewelcomed." ." Reality check: what Tito Mboweni in 2013termed the "very costly" NDB - for which taxpayers in each of the Bricscountries will cough up $10-billion in capital - is run by hard-coreneoliberals best known for privatisation and high-interest monetarism. Thenonsensical "Africa rising" meme has come to a crashing end thanks to post-2011commodity price implosions. The continent's current account deficit issoaring since excess multinational corporate profits are expatriated soquickly, not only through illicit financial flows (knocking South Africa forR330-billion a year since 2004) but also through licit outflows, becauseexchange controls have been removed. And partly as a result, Africa's foreign debthas doubled since 2006 to $400-billion - just as South Africa's has doubled to$145-billion since Gordhan first took over the finance portfolio in 2009. Thatputs the continent back in the 1980s when fears of a developing countries debtcrisis drove finance ministers into self-destructive fits of austerity andstructural adjustment. And so, directly as a result, the chaps who reallyyank Gordhan's chain are not those of us in the vain intelligentsia overflowingwith advice, praise or critique. Let's worry more about upper-class twitsrunning Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's international credit ratingagencies, and financiers such as New York-based Goldman Sachs, which helpedraid our currency on January 11, sending it to R17.99 to the dollar in a fewminutes of flash-crash speculation, just after telling its traders thatglobally, the rand's decline is the bank's second most aggressive bet for 2016(after the dollar's rise). These men can obviously be charged withmalicious economic self-interest to the extent that in coming months it islikely they will hit Gordhan with junk-minister status. To that end, they'restill selling our currency short. But, more complicated than mere ill will,recall that back in 2009, when International Monetary Fund managing directorDominique Strauss-Kahn advocated deficit spending to save world capitalism fromimplosion, Moody's actually upgraded Gordhan after his soaring 7.3%deficit-to-GDP rise that year by raising our credit rating from BBB+ to A-.With similar wild abandon, Moody's clowns also rated Lehman Brothers as"investment grade" just days before it crashed. But now we see the impact of their turn fromthe whimsical to the wicked. Partly to their credit, these agencies have putpressure on Gordhan to throw cold water on President Jacob Zuma's $100-billionnuclear follies. And to Gordhan's credit, he dodged that round of Russian rouletteby kicking the bullet over to Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson to do"preparatory work for investment in nuclear power." But what else might be pleasing to a leftylike me, twice trained by Gordhan in Marxist revolutionary theory alongside NatalIndian Congress youth at Mahatma Gandhi's Phoenix ashram 31 years ago? On the horrifying side, Gordhan announced awhopping R600-million increase in funds for the notorious public order policingunit - the unpunished Marikana hit men who joked about defective muti whileplanting weapons on their victims - instead of replacing it with skilledpeace-broking units. But on the other hand, this remark wasuplifting: "Spending on defence, public order and safety services will risefrom R172-billion this year to R204-billion in 2018-2019." Pleasing? Yes, because without being blatantabout it, Gordhan just chopped out R8-billion of securocrat funds compared withNene's medium-term budget allocation last October. But it was when Gordhan bragged of thestate's most active spending that leaders of my residential community grewfurious. After living on Durban's Bluff for the past seven years, the highlightof budget day was reviewing the carnage with the South Durban CommunityEnvironmental Alliance in a long strategy session two hours after Gordhanfinished speaking. In the basement of a Wentworth community hallthat Gordhan himself once frequented, as rusty fans blew Durban's humid airback at us, two dozen hardened activists of all races, classes, genders andages mulled over his generosity towards Transnet, and how that will \'c2\Â£dultimatelybe etched on our wretched landscape. Gordhan would not be the first politicianaccused of pandering to the KwaZulu-Natal construction mafia by turning a blindeye to repeated collusion and overpricing here. The current outrage is Transnet's racistrerouting of the often exploding pipeline that doubles petrol-pumping capacityto Johannesburg from the Engen and Shell/BP plants here at Africa's largestrefining complex, sandwiching the Indian suburb of Merebank, whose SettlersPrimary School has an asthma rate that was not long ago measured at 52%, theworld's highest. Last month's cost estimate on what Transnetoriginally priced at R6-billion is now R29-billion. When Mtimku celebrates that Gordhan's "investment in infrastructure aimed at stimulating theeconomy is continuing, with over R870 billion planned," he should first dissect how much of thatvast sum goes to Zuma's KwaZulu-Natal white elephant breeding project. In south Durban, we look at the Baltic DryIndex that measures shipping capacity: it's now at its lowest in history (about300 after a 2008 peak of 12 000). And fossil fuel prices have hit the floor,casting a dark spell over Gordhan's bragging that "work has begun on a new gasterminal and oil and ship repair facilities at Durban". Ironically perhaps, this sentence came justafter Gordhan praised the Paris Cop21 summit's (highly dubious) commitment tofighting climate change. He continued: "We need to accelerateinfrastructure investment in the period ahead. So we must broaden the range andscope of our co-funding partnerships with private-sector investors. In takingthis forward, we are able to draw on our experience in road funding concessions."Oops, he hasn't been briefed by Premier David Makhura about the impact of thoseconcessions on the ANC's Gauteng voter base. Worst of all, violating both climate andeconomic common sense, Gordhan bragged about Transnet's financing of the leadpresidential infrastructure co-ordinating commission project, with itsplanet-threatening goal of rail-to-ship transfer of 18-billion tonnes of coal. That Waterberg-Richards Bay line - alsocosting in the hundreds of billions of rands - may have looked profitable in2008 with coal at $170 a tonne, but now the price is $50 a tonne. Yet theproject trundles on. Further south, describing frustrating delaysin getting Durban's dig-out port up and running in 2012, Toyota boss Johan vanZyl (whose plant is adjacent to the old airport site) complained: "If return oninvestment is the line of thinking, we may never see the infrastructure." Amid rumours of a two-year dig-out portdelay, in December Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry president ZephNdlovu insisted on adding this large white elephant to the herd: "We have topress ahead and if we are to unseat our competitors up north, we can't winthis battle if we pull back every now and then and look at accountingprinciples." Whether Gordhan goes ahead with reducing thestate payroll by tens of thousands of public servants or continues hisnudge-nudge-wink-wink towards corporations' illicit financial flows, it's inthe coddling of accounting-challenged KwaZulu-Natal cronies and the crackdownon welfare grant recipients that Gordhan has most decisively intervened inSouth Africa's world-leading class struggle. Pleasing to some, yes, andhopefully horrifying to most.

Professor Bob Scholes began working in climate change research in 1990 - the year that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published its first assessment report detailing the threats of a fast-warming world. "We are certain of the following ... emissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases", stated the report that would serve as a basis for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. "These increases will enhance the greenhouse effect, resulting on average in an additional warming of the earth's surface." Twenty-five years later, Scholes, one of the Intergovernmental Panel's lead authors on present and future impacts of climate change and how humanity can adapt or reduce it, is frustrated by the lack of substantive action. "It's still technically and economically feasible to avoid a very damaging future climate, but it will take urgent, concerted and strenuous effort," says Scholes, a systems ecologist and distinguished professor at the Global Change and Sustainability Research Institute at Wits. "We have left it very late. I'm frustrated that despite the clear evidence of climate change and its impacts, and the availability of affordable solutions, we're prevaricating." Debates about whether climate change is real are motivated by hollow self-interest. "I see far fewer people questioning that climate change is real and threatening, but a small group of vociferous deniers still trying to sow doubt among the public and decision-makers. "On the positive side, we've seen costs for renewable energy alternatives fall rapidly, to the point that it is now economically sensible as well as climatically necessary to take that route." But Scholes worries whether countries' emission reduction proposals, or intended nationally determined contributions, which are being submitted to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change as part of a new international climate agreement to be thrashed out at COP 21 in Paris in December, will stem the rising tide. He says South Africa's proposed contributions, which it submitted last month, are "far beyond what has been the typical ambition target for limiting climate change, by developed and developing countries, in the Kyoto and Copenhagen rounds of negotiations". Given South Africa's circumstances - a dependency on coal, its position as a developing country "with high climate vulnerability" and its ranking 12th among the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases - its proposed contributions represent a "fair balance, and a politically important one". However, even taken with those submitted by other nations, these are "too little" to keep the world below the nominal 2\'c2\'baC warming target, which could mean 4\'c2\'baC for South Africa. "But for the first time the major emitters have submitted substantial targets. Collectively, if implemented, they will make a huge difference - literally life and death for many people." The UN says an increase in global average temperature increases must be kept below 2\'c2\'baC above the pre-industrial average - anything higher would manifest in "irreversible" and "severe" impacts that would be widespread. When the Department of Environmental Affairs released the country's draft proposals in August, religious leaders, environmental groups and think tanks criticised the government for, among other things, its lack of ambition, for incorporating nuclear energy as a response to climate change and|for failing to tackle vested corporate interests. At two days of parliamentary public hearings, officials pledged to "tweak" the draft in line with the outcome of the hearings before South Africa made its submission to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. "There's no substantial difference, they've deleted the odd word here and there. If we're looking for 4\'c2\'baC, then (the proposed contributions are) the way to go." The submission is based on the finalisation of an "ambitious, fair, effective and binding multilateral agreement", with South Africa listing its priorities as equity, economic and social development and poverty eradication. It pledges to arrest its rising emissions between 2020 and 2025 and to keep its emissions on a plateau for 10 years before beginning to slash them. The national climate plan notes that "good progress has been made in implementing climate-compatible sectoral plans that will bend the curve of South Africa's greenhouse gas emissions towards a peak, plateau and decline trajectory range". Its adaptation component features six goals, "underpinned by key elements of adaptation planning, costing of adaptation investment requirements, equity and means of implementation". South Africa is putting in place a mitigation system to realise the opportunities of a low-carbon economy "while being mindful that an inclusive and just transition requires time and well-planned low carbon and climate resilient development". The key challenge for South Africa, its submission says, is to "catalyse, at an economy-wide scale, financing of, and investment in the transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy and society". It estimates that adapting to climate change will cost up to $30 billion (about R394bn) a year by 2030, and up to $50bn a year by 2050. It describes how South Africa is meeting an unequal share of this funding through its national contributions. Hallowes is critical, saying: "The notion of adaptation has absolutely no sense of the way in which our high carbon economy undermines adaptation, no sense of detoxing the highveld as an adaptive strategy, the acid mine drainage in our rivers and pollution. "It's not a good strategy if you've got dust from coal mine explosions going over farmland, if miners are digging out wetlands. There's no sense of mitigation being the front line of adaptation... They just leave out anything that comes into conflict with industry. "The impression is that they duck all the big issues, and put down a bunch of invoices for what looks like the bill they are putting in for climate financing." Climate Action Tracker, too, has rated the proposed contributions as "inadequate" as its commitments are not in line with interpretations of a fair approach to reaching a 2\'c2\'baC pathway. "If most other countries were to follow South Africa's approach, global warming would exceed 3-4\'c2\'baC." South Africa's growth in renewable energy won't displace coal generation, which is how 94 percent of its energy is produced, as its "coal generation capacity is likely to grow at a similar rate to renewable energy". "The adaptation component... is one of the strongest we've seen to date and is showing the way for many developing nations." Melita Steele, a senior climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace Africa, says several changes have been made. "The draft has been altered in a few key ways, but we have significant reservations. One of these changes... is that all mention of investments in nuclear as part of the country's response to climate change has been removed." But commitments remain insufficient to limit the potentially catastrophic effects of climate change. "The government must begin to plot a trajectory that is much more closely aligned with what is required by science, and avoiding 2\'c2\'baC warming... Ultimately, we should be aiming for 100 percent renewable energy by 2050." For his part, Scholes believes the rising global toll of natural disasters has not gone unnoticed. "I believe people are fundamentally concerned about their environment and future when the scenarios are made clear." \</doc>

The National Treasury today publishes the Draft Carbon Tax Bill for public comment, following on the announcement made by the Minister of Finance in the 2015 Budget. Cabinet approved the publication of the Bill and noted that the carbon tax forms an integral part of the system for implementing government policy on climate change as outlined in the 2011 National Climate Change Response Policy (NCCRP) and the National Development Plan. South Africa has committed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions below business as usual by 34 per cent by 2020 and 42 per cent by 2025, as well as adaptation measures, as outlined in South Africa's Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) recently submitted to the United Nations for the upcoming Conference of Parties ( COP ) 21 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris. The carbon tax seeks to price carbon by obliging the polluter to internalise the external costs of emitting carbon, and contribute towards addressing the harm caused by such pollution. The Draft Carbon Tax Bill marks the next step in the consultation process conducted over the past 5 years, starting with the 2010 discussion paper on carbon tax, the 2013 Carbon Tax Policy Paper and the 2014 Carbon Offsets Paper. It takes into account comments received in writing, and from meetings and workshops, from a wide range of stakeholders including business, NGOs, academia, civil society and labour. The publication of the Draft Carbon Tax Bill provides an opportunity for further comments on the design and technical details of the carbon tax policy and administration. It should be noted that the final tax rate, exemptions, and the actual date of implementation will be determined by the Minister of Finance through the annual Budget process. The carbon tax will be implemented together with complementary measures like a reduction in the electricity levy and other measures to recycle revenue. Stakeholders are invited to provide comments on the environmental and socio-economic impact of the carbon tax (taking into account revenue recycling measures), as well as the design and legal wording of the Bill. A revised Bill incorporating comments received will thereafter be submitted to Cabinet for approval for tabling in Parliament. Impact of the carbon tax on the economy The impact of any tax on the economy can only be assessed when taking into account both the direct impact of the tax, as well as the way the resulting revenue is spent. Hence, to assess the impact of the tax, the revenue recycling measures must be taken into account. The carbon tax will assist in reducing GHG emissions and ensure that South Africa is ready and better prepared to deal with future climate risks and challenges, and also be in a position to take advantage of new investment opportunities. The carbon tax aims to change the behaviour of firms, incentivising them to shift towards cleaner technology when replacing/renewing machinery, technology or processes. To ensure that South Africa transitions to a low carbon, climate resilient economy in a cost effective and economically efficient manner, it is important that the objectives of inclusive economic growth, poverty alleviation, job creation and the lowering of our GHG emissions are appropriately balanced and the trade-offs effectively managed. Hence, given the developmental challenges that South Africa has to deal with and the internationally accepted common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities principle (CBDR-RC) that requires more developed countries to make a greater effort to reduce global GHG emissions, South Africa's carbon tax will be gradually phased-in. Various economic modelling to estimate the impact of a carbon tax were previously undertaken. One of the modelling1 exercises initiated by the National Treasury indicates that a carbon tax with broad sector coverage implemented gradually and complemented by effective and efficient revenue recycling will contribute towards significant GHG emission reductions, and have only a marginal negative impact on economic growth over the shortterm. Over medium to long term, the carbon tax will support the transition to a more sustainable low carbon economy and green jobs. Additional modelling is being undertaken by various stakeholders. The tax has been designed to ensure that its overall impact (when taking into account revenue recycling measures) will, in the initial phase, be revenue neutral, and also neutral on the price of electricity. Hence, taking into account the current state of the mining and other distressed sectors, the combined effect of the rates/exemptions in the carbon tax and the reduction in electricity levy will be designed to ensure that such sectors are not adversely affected when the tax is implemented. The tax and revenue recycling measures are also designed to be revenue neutral from a macroeconomic perspective, but will not necessarily be neutral for (scope one) companies with significant emissions. Carbon tax design The revised carbon tax design as contained in the Draft Carbon Tax Bill includes the following features: A basic 60 per cent tax-free threshold during the first phase of the carbon tax, from implementation date up to 2020; An additional 10 per cent per cent tax-free allowance for process emissions; Additional tax-free allowance for trade exposed sectors of up to 10 per cent; Recognition for early actions and /or efforts to reduce emissions that beat the industry average in the form of a tax-free allowance of up to 5 per cent; A carbon offsets tax-free allowance of 5 to 10 per cent; To recognise to role of carbon budgets, an additional 5 per cent tax free allowance for companies participating in phase 1 (up to 2020) of the carbon budgeting system; The combined effect of all of the above tax-free thresholds will be capped at 95 per cent; and An initial marginal carbon tax rate of R120 per ton CO2-e will apply. However taking into account all of the above tax-free thresholds, the effective carbon tax rate will vary between R6 and R48 per ton CO2-e. These tax-free exemptions will range between 60 and 95 per cent of total emissions. This implies that the carbon tax will be imposed on only 5 to 40 per cent of actual emissions during this period. The Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) and the National Treasury have embarked on a process to ensure that the carbon tax is aligned with the proposed carbon budget system. During the first phase of the carbon tax (up to 2020), companies participating in the carbon budgeting process will qualify for an additional tax-free allowance of 5 per cent. The tax-free percentage thresholds will remain fixed during the first phase, until 2020. The percentage tax-free thresholds might be reduced thereafter or may be replaced with absolute emission thresholds. Both the tax-free percentage thresholds and their subsequent replacement with absolute emission thresholds will be aligned with the proposed carbon budgets. The carbon tax in the case of GHG emissions from the use of petrol and diesel will be added to the current fuel tax regime. Fuels used by the international aviation and international maritime sectors will initially be excluded from the carbon tax as these are covered by international agreements. Greenhouse Gas resulting from the use of such fuels will be priced in terms of the international agreements that are currently being developed. However, domestic aviation will be subject to the domestic carbon-related fuel taxation. The National Treasury is in the process of finalising Regulations to give effect to the carbon offset scheme and is engaging the Department of the Energy (DoE) and the DEA on the administration aspects of the offset scheme. Draft regulations will be published for public comment in early 2016. The Regulations with respect to the emissions intensity benchmark as required by the performance based tax-free allowance will be developed over the next six months based on inputs received from the respective industry associations. Such inputs should use as reference acceptable benchmark methodologies. Revenue recycling and Administration The effectiveness of the carbon tax to reduce GHG emissions and the socio-economic impact of the carbon tax will be determined by the carbon tax rate, tax-free allowances and the various revenue recycling measures. These revenue recycling measures will include: (ii) a reduction in the electricity levy, (iii) additional tax relief for roof top (embedded) solar photovoltaic (PV) energy as already provided for the in 2015 tax legislation; (iv) a credit for the premium charged for renewable energy (wind, hydro and solar, as per the Integrated Resource Plan); (iv) additional support for free basic electricity to low income households; and (v) additional allocations for public transport. Measures to encourage the shift of some freight from road to rail will also be supported. Investments in green technologies and the growth of some sectors will benefit from this intervention especially the renewable energy sector which will be able to compete on a more level playing field in comparison to fossil fuels. A carbon tax will also have health co-benefits by helping to reduce local air pollutants. The carbon tax will be administered by the South African Revenue Service (SARS). SARS will liaise with the DEA and be able to access the National Atmospheric Emissions Information System (NAEIS) which will contain emissions information as reported by companies. Energy use data reported to the DoE will also be incorporated into the NAEIS which will strengthen the monitoring and verification system to support the implementation of the carbon tax. Due date for comments The Draft Tax Bill, is published for public comments and is available on the National Treasury website: HYPERLINK www.treasury.gov.za Written comments should be submitted to Dr. Memory Machingambi, email: mailto:Memory.Machingambi@treasury.gov.za Memory.Machingambi@treasury.gov.za \</doc>

Obamacare case to be turned against government on emissions rule By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON, July 29 (Reuters) - Opponents of President Barack Obama's soon-to-be-implemented policy to cut carbon emissions from power plants are planning to use an unlikely and potentially potent weapon against him: the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that saved Obamacare. In that June case, the court said that the healthcare law was an issue of such importance that the court would not stick to its usual practice of deferring to a government agency's legal expertise when interpreting ambiguously written laws. That same argument will now be turned against the government to challenge a crucial plank of Obama's strategy to cut U.S. emissions and fight global warming, several lawyers likely to be involved in the litigation told Reuters. Obama's Clean Power Plan to cut emissions from coal-fired power plants is expected to be finalized as early as next week, ahead of a crucial United Nations climate change conference in Paris at the end of the year. The rule requires each U.S. state to cut its greenhouse gas emissions to achieve a nationwide reduction of 30 percent by a target date of 2030. With less than 18 months left in Obama's presidency, a legal loss would blow a hole in his hopes of leaving a significant legacy on tackling climate change. Opponents, mainly Republican-leaning states and the coal industry, say the rule will cost hundreds of billions of dollars and lead to a spike in electricity prices. They view it as part of an Obama "war on coal," which disproportionately affects coal-producing states like West Virginia. At the core of their legal challenge will be the argument that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not have such broad authority to influence the economically crucial area of energy policy. The challengers will argue that the government agency has exceeded its legal authority, in part by allowing states to meet their targets not only through limiting power plant emissions but via additional measures such as promoting renewable energy. In its June 25 ruling in the healthcare case, called King v. Burwell, the court rejected a conservative challenge to the 2010 Affordable Care Act on a 6-3 vote. Even though the government won, Chief Justice John Roberts included language in his majority opinion that could help challengers to government regulations. He stressed that when a case is of "deep economic and political significance" the court will depart from its usual practice of giving considerable weight to an agency's interpretation. "LITIGATED TO DEATH" Courts ruling on the Clean Power Plan should adopt the same approach as Roberts did in the healthcare case and decline to defer to the agency, the lawyers are expected to say. If courts endorse the argument that the EPA does not merit deference, the government would lose one of its best legal defenses. "That's an issue that will be litigated to death" by lawyers on both sides, said Theodore Hadzi-Antich, a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative legal group likely to support the legal challenge. Vocal opponents of the new regulation, including states like West Virginia and Texas and coal companies, including Murray Energy Corp, have indicated they will file suit as soon as it is officially announced. Lawyers, some set to represent states and industry groups challenging the rule and others with environmental groups likely to support the government, differ over how much influence the Obamacare case will have. The challengers are also likely to question whether the EPA is even due the usual deference that it gets as the "expert agency" considering the broad implications of the regulation. Industry lawyers say the EPA is moving beyond its role as an environmental regulator and is instead seeking to direct energy production and distribution. In the healthcare case, the court found that the Inland Revenue Service, which had issued regulations implementing Obamacare insurance subsidies, did not deserve deference because it is not the "expert agency" when it comes to health insurance policy. Lawyers representing environmental groups expected to help defend the EPA downplay the Obamacare case's significance. They say that, unlike the IRS's role in the Obamacare case, Congress clearly intended the EPA to have considerable leeway in implementing the Clean Air Act. An EPA spokeswoman said the agency is confident it has the legal authority to issue the rule, based in part on other recent Supreme Court rulings. In those cases, including one that came out just days after King v. Burwell, the court has continued to use the same legal methodology in which the court defers to agency expertise. The court first adopted that approach in an environmental case decided in 1984. As such, the Obamacare case is "very unlikely to significantly influence the outcome of the Clean Power Plan one way or the other," said Sean Donahue, a lawyer who represents environmental groups.

The MEC for Transport in the WC Province, Mr Donald Grant; His Worship, the Executive Mayor of George, Cllr Alderman Standers The Chairperson of ACSA board Mr Skhumbuzo Macozoma ACSA CEO, Mr Bongani Maseko; Councillor Henry McCombi Officials from the three spheres of government Ladies and gentlemen of the media; Distinguished guests; Firstly, my expressed joy is deeply rooted in the honour that I have been divinely afforded to be in your presence, within this very enchanting city, to consummate a project of such substantial magnitude and importance for sustainable socio-economic and environmental development. So please allow me to take this opportunity to confer my highest gratitude to the George Local Municipality and the Western Cape Provincial Government for hosting us on this highly significant and windy day. Secondly, as fate would have it, my feelings of nostalgia can be largely attributed to the nature of this massive project and its resonance with my previous role as the Minister of Energy in the Republic of South Africa. Ladies and Gentlemen; Many of you would know that my 4-year tenure at the Department of Energy corresponded with the watershed emergence of South Africa's internationally acclaimed Renewable Energy: Independent Power Producers Programme (RE: IPPP). This IPP Procurement Programme has been designed so as to contribute towards the target of 3 725 megawatts (MW) and towards socio-economic and environmentally sustainable growth. More importantly the program was initiated in order to start, as well as stimulate the renewable industry in South Africa. South Africa has a high level of Renewable Energy potential and presently has in place a target of generating 42% of its power needs through Renewable Energy sources by 2030. Sources of renewable energy that have been identified to meet this target include: On Shore Wind, Concentrated Solar Thermal, Biomass Solid, Biogas, Landfill Gas, Small Hydro, and more significantly for the purposes of our engagement here today, Solar Photovoltaic. This is in line with the integrated resource plan of 2010Programme Director; The George Airport Photovoltaic (PV) Power Plant was initiated by the Department of Transport's globally esteemed state owned entity, the Airports Company of South Africa (ACSA) as part of its commitment to reduce the load on the country's constrained power grid and to contribute towards sustainable development. The activation of the 75 kilowatts (KW) solar plant represents the first phase in generating independent power for George Airport. Built at a reported cost of R16 million and commissioned in September 2015, the plant generated 47 megawatt hours of power within the first month of its existence and is reliably expected to save in excess of 1.2 million liters of water per year. With South Africa currently grappling with its worst drought in decades, this is a phenomenal achievement of note, which I believe must be applauded. Ladies and Gentlemen; You would all be pleased to note that the completion of the plant is in keeping with a multitude of local and international obligations that the Republic of South Africa has committed to in relation to sustainable development and they include; in ascending order: The United Nation's (UN) global aim of Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL), which is intended to eradicate global energy poverty by 2030 - some 1.3 billion people are estimated to not have access to electricity and the bulk of those still in Africa; The African Union's Agenda (AU) 2063 - Aspiration number one of the Agenda is entitled a Prosperous Africa Based on Inclusive Growth and Sustainable Development. His Excellency, President Jacob Zuma's Nine Point Plan to boost the economy and create jobs, as pronounced during the State of the Nation Address 2015. The very first and most critical point of the Plan conveyed the heading Resolving the Energy Challenge in South Africa; The resolutions taken at the Conference of the Parties ( COP ) 21 Our achievements in this field are not to be downplayed when considering that South Africa achieved universal democracy only 22 years ago yet we continue to punch well above our weight. Indeed, in his State of the Nation Address (SONA) 2016, the Honourable President, Mr Jacob Zuma, announced that the Department of Energy released a report titled the State of Renewable Energy in SA revealing that the renewables sector attracted R192.6 billion in investment, contributed more than 109 000 construction jobs and cut the equivalent of 4.4 million tons of carbon dioxide in the country. This is ample evidence that the Intergrated Resource PlanNational Development Plan's (NDP) is in motion and is being implemented rigorously to improve the lives of ordinary South Africans. The gains spoken to in the report, also illustrate that South Africa's economy remains globally competitive and conducive to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), job creation and poverty alleviation. Ladies and Gentlemen; It is reported that global power generation is comprised of approximately 22% renewable energy. To ensure the sustainability of our eco-system it is imperative that countries all over the world continue to upsurge the utilisation of clean energy, which contributes immensely to the preservation of our natural environments. Collectively, Africa contributes very little to the dangerously high global Green House Gas emissions, but our benign culpability does not suggest that we do not have a very significant role to play when it comes to climate change. As a matter of fact, as recently as three weeks ago (09 February 2016), the world's largest Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plant went live in Morocco. The CSP plant will supply electricity to over 1.1 million people in that country and will cut carbon emissions by 760,000 tons a year. Once complete, the Great Inga Dam Project, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, is anticipated to become the largest HydroPower scheme in the world and will supply electricity to numerous countries on the African continent. These two mammoth projects reflect Africa's prowess and capacity with regard to generating clean energy. Clearly, Africa as a continent, has so much to offer in the renewable energy space and as the best natural resource endowed continent on the planet, we cannot afford to allow the clean energy revolution to transpire in our absence, as it so tragically happened with the industrial revolution. I believe that ACSA must be greatly congratulated and commended for the George Airport Solar Plant project because this wonderful venture will reduce our global emission footprint and also reduce pressure on the national grid, and highlights Africa's prominence in the global renewable energy revolution. Furthermore, Mr Bongani Maseko informs me that the completion of the plant forms part of ACSA's broader plan to install solar energy panels at all six regional airports over the next three years to make them more self-sufficient. The remaining five regional airports include: Port Elizabeth International Airport, East London Airport, Bram Fischer International Airport, Kimberley Airport and Upington Airport. All the aforementioned projects align with the entity's vision to be a world leading airport business that uses advanced technologies to run its operations. Our internationally acclaimed and state of the art airports are a harbinger of ACSA's success and future plans in relation to transforming the South African aviation sector into global leader and pioneer. I, therefore, want to indicate to ACSA CEO, Mr Maseko, that your outstanding achievements have not gone unnoticed. Ladies and gentlemen join me in congratulating Mr Maseko for his election as the new Vice President of the Airports Council International. Congratulations and Good luck sir. Last year, ACSA was recognised with several awards at the Airports Council International (ACI) - Annual Awards and Skytrax - The World Airports Awards. Under the stewardship of the board and the team you are leading South Africa was recognized for the following:2015 - Airports Council International (ACI) - Annual Awards Airports Company South Africa's airports have won four Airports Council International (ACI) Awards. Best airport by region - Africa category: Second place: King Shaka International Airport Third place: Cape Town International Airport Fourth place: O.R. Tambo International Airport Best airport by region (fewer than two million passengers per year) First place: Upington International Airport2015 Skytrax - The World Airport AwardsWorld's top 100 airports 24th place: O.R. Tambo International Airport 26th place: Cape Town International Airport 28th place: King Shaka International Airport World's best domestic airports Third place: King Shaka International Airport Best airports in Africa First place: O.R. Tambo International Airport Second place: Cape Town International Airport Third place: King Shaka International Airport Fifth place: East London Airport Seventh place: Port Elizabeth International Airport Eighth place: Bram Fischer International AirportI want to emphasise that all of the stellar achievements obtained by ACSA cannot be reached without sound leadership, hard-work, determination and excellent vision. As patriotic South Africans, we are well and truly proud to have such an accomplished and highly innovative institution serving our country with distinction. We want to encourage you to keep up the good work and to gently and protectively remind you to keep out the old age evil known as complacency! Programme Director; In closing, I want to reiterate that our special convergence, here today, has fatefully intertwined two very crucial government portfolios that I have grown increasingly fond of and feel particularly proud to have served under as a member of the South African Cabinet - transport and energy. Whether it is by coincidence or by fate, I cannot express in words how humbled and honoured I am to be here on this blissful day. Albert Einstein once said the Coincidence is God's way of remaining anonymous. So I am convinced that this official launch is richly blessed and was divinely preordained. Allow me to close with knowledge from Ancient Roman Emperor, Marcus Aurelius, who uttered the following stimulating and wise words when talking about fate; he said: Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together, but do so with all your heart. Indeed, I fully appreciate the opportunity to be here and I wholeheartedly wish to declare the George Solar Plant Officially open. I thank you Enquiries: Ishmael Mnisi Cell: 072 566 0827 \</doc>

International Relations Peace and Security briefing to Heads of Missions and Media by President Zuma, Sefako Makgatho Presidential Guest House, Pretoria Ministers, Deputy Ministers, Excellencies Ambassadors and High Commissioners, The media, Good afternoon to you all. We pride ourselves of having a huge presence of foreign missions in our country. You are all very welcome in South Africa and to this briefing on international matters. We thought it important to give this briefing as we prepare to go to New York to attend the 70th anniversary of the United Nations General Assembly. Our briefing will focus especially on peace and security issues. Excellencies, South Africa's foreign policy is premised on the directive in the Freedom Charter, which stipulates that There Shall be Peace and Friendship''. Informed by this principle, and the vision of building a better Africa and a better world, the following guides our diplomatic relations; A commitment to; the promotion of human rights and democracy; Justice and international law in the conduct of relations between nations; Promoting the African Agenda in world affairs; and The world will gather at the United Nations headquarters in New York next week, for the historic 70th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, which will take place under the theme: The United Nations at 70: the Road ahead for Peace, Security and Human Rights. This year's session will commemorate the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War and the establishment of the United Nations. We attended the commemoration of the end of the Second World War in Russia in May and China in August this year. The two events were a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and the need for the world to work harder as the UN turns 70 years old, to promote peace and security. South Africa will use her participation in the 70th Session to continue our relentless work to achieve the reform of the United Nations, specifically of the Security Council, which has a key role to play in promoting world peace and security. We are also currently chairing the G77 and China. In this context, developing countries will also advocate for the reform of the United Nations System, to make it more responsive to the interests and needs of the majority of its Members, the developing countries. This is more so for Africa, a continent with more than one billion people, which is not represented in the UN Security Council as permanent members. World leaders are also scheduled to adopt an outcome document titled; Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at the General Assembly. This development agenda builds on the Millennium Development Goals and would be the guiding global development framework for the next fifteen years.Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen As Nkosi Albert Luthuli said at the 42nd ANC Annual Conference;Our interest in freedom is not confined to ourselves only. We are interested in the liberation of all oppressed people in the whole of Africa and in the world as a whole. As the UN meets, some outstanding peace and security issues will still be looming large. We believe that there can be no lasting peace in the Middle East for as long as Palestinians are denied their inalienable right to a state of their own. Last week a historic and landmark development took place when the UN General Assembly approved a resolution to allow the Palestinian flag to fly in front of the UN headquarters. This is a great victory for the Palestinian cause and the quest for peace worldwide. South Africa supports the international efforts aimed at the establishment of a viable Palestinian state, existing side by side and in peace with Israel within internationally recognised borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Our special envoys to the Middle East, Dr Zola Skweyiya and Mr Aziz Pahad have concluded two rounds of consultations that took them to Palestine, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Iran, Turkey, Qatar, UAE, Egypt and Syria. Our view is that in order to make progress, the basic issues which have in the past proved to be stumbling blocks to a conclusive agreement need to be resolved as a matter of priority. These are namely; All Palestinian parties and groupings need to form a cohesive collective solidarity front for negotiations; The unacceptable blockade of Gaza by Israel must be lifted in order to stop its inaccessibility with respect to humanitarian aid and the general dire humanitarian situation that this causes, The Israeli settlement expansion, including in East Jerusalem, must be stopped An urgent solution is required with respect to the right of return of Palestinian refugees and There should be a full recognition of the borders, based on those existing on 4 June 1967. Excellencies, Your Excellencies, We also believe that the time has come for the United Nations (UN) to determine a date for the holding of a self-determination referendum for the people of Western Sahara, the last colony in Africa. We further urge the UN Security Council to look into the questions of the respect for human rights and the illegal exploitation of Western Sahara's natural resources. We also welcome some positive developments in the world which augur well for the 70th anniversary, such as the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States after more than 50 years of tensions. We reiterate our call for the immediate repeal of all legislation that maintains the Embargo against Cuba. We also welcome yet again the release of the Cuban Five who visited our country recently. Excellencies, The impact of wars and poverty in the world is manifested through the expanding refugee crisis. The world has witnessed the horrific and deadly journeys by African and Middle Eastern immigrants across the Mediterranean, in search of a better life in Europe. The painful human tragedy of over four million Syrian refugees has also reminded us of the need to find a lasting solution, which is to stop the war in Syria. It took the painful drowning of a four year old Syrian child to shake the world into action. Attempts to shut the borders by some European countries will not assist the situation. To achieve lasting peace in Syria, the international community must reject all calls for regime change in that country. The international community must not support external military interference or any action in Syria that is not in line with the Charter of the United Nations. Support for non-state actors and terrorist organisations that seek to effect a regime change in Syria is unacceptable. As immediate relief for the refugees, we call on our European Union (EU) partners as well as Syria's regional neighbours to assist the Syrian refugees, in full accordance and compliance with all Human Rights and Humanitarian laws. We pledge our support to the EU as it grapples with this challenging situation. These are all issues that put enormous pressure on the UN Security Council to find solutions, as we move towards the 70th anniversary next week. In January and April this year, our own country was forced to confront the difficulties of migration when foreign and African nationals were attacked. We have since then, been working hard with Southern African Development Community (SADC) sister countries to find solutions to this international challenge, especially the problem of illegal migration. South Africa experiences a mixed migration flow comprising people who are genuine asylum seekers and those who flee to the country in seek of economic relief. Another challenge within the SADC region exists where borders separate communities and families. In some instances, the borderline does not effectively act as a barrier to these communities, particularly those that conduct normal day-to-day activities such as schooling, trade and medical care as they will keep coming each day. This situation demands innovative solutions. We are partnering with SADC neighbours to ensure proactive facilitation of designated community crossing points. We will launch such an innovative project soon in Tshidilamolomo, a village situated on the border between South Africa and Botswana. To combat illegal migration, we engage within SADC through the Joint Permanent Commission on Defence and Security with Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Tanzania. Joint immigration inspections are regularly held at selected ports of entry by officials from respective partner countries. South Africa is also chairing the SADC Organ on Public Safety and Security Sub Committee, promoting the free movement of persons. Currently, the Organ is discussing protocols related to a SADC UNIVISA, as well as a strategy on combatting illegal migration, smuggling and human trafficking. The Organ has established a Refugee Commissioners Sub-Committee to coordinate the regional effort and to manage a Draft Common Regional Asylum and Refugee Management Policy Framework. In this context, the committee cooperates with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to ensure that international protocols are adhered to, and that all migrants entering the Republic will have a right to representation and for the case to be heard and adjudicated. Excellencies Ministers, and Deputy Ministers, South Africa chaired the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Co-operation until August this year. Work continues to implement decisions taken in relation to peace and security matters in the region, especially in the Kingdom of Lesotho, the Republic of Madagascar, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). To further promote African solutions to African problems, the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises has to be operationalized. South Africa, on behalf of the SADC region, has offered to host the AMANI AFRICA II Field Training Exercise next month. This will bring into operation, the African Standby Force as one of the pillars of the African Peace and Security Architecture. Further north, we are extremely concerned about the ongoing conflict in South Sudan, which has resulted in a massive displacement of people, causing a humanitarian crisis. We note and commend the peace efforts as led by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). We further commend all the parties to the conflict for signing the Compromise Agreement. The Agreement provides a basis for a transitional authority and the important beginning towards resolving the conflict. We therefore call on all the parties to honour and respect the Agreement in order for the country to move forward. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will continue to represent us in assisting the people of South Sudan to find one another. With regards to Burundi, we urge the East African Community, through its mediator in Burundi, President Yoweri Museveni of the Republic of Uganda, to continue with the political dialogue, with a view to finding a lasting solution. We reiterate our support for the signing of the Malian Peace and Reconciliation Agreement in May this year by the Malian Government, the Algiers Platform Movement and some groups of the Coordination Movement of the Azawad (CMA). We call for the strict implementation of the Agreement, and the mobilization of the needed resources. Excellencies The situation in Libya continues to be of serious concern. As such, we fully support the UN-led political dialogue. We also commend Libya's neighbouring countries for their role in the search for a solution in that country. South Africa stands ready to assist Libya in post-conflict reconstruction and development and to share experiences in reconciliation and constitution making processes. We condemn in the strongest terms the various terrorist acts committed on the Continent by terrorist groups in Somalia, Kenya, north eastern Nigeria, Mali, the larger Sahel, as well as in North Africa. We will play our role through the AU Peace and Security Council to assist the affected regions. Your Excellencies, beyond security issues, the matters of sustainable economic growth in our continent and the world is on our agenda given the economic crisis. We will participate in the G20 forum in Turkey in November, which drives a collective response to the global financial and economic crisis and recovery. Ongoing priorities for South Africa include the promotion of employment, improving investment in infrastructure and international coordination on tax matters. We will continue to advocate for the reform of international financial institutions at this august forum. Further economic cooperation in the South, will be pursued when the 3rd India-Africa Partnership Forum Summit convenes in New Delhi, India next month. In December, South Africa will host the Second Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Johannesburg. During our tenure as co-chair of FOCAC, South Africa will continue to ensure that the principles of South-South cooperation are realised and that special attention is given to assisting in the implementation of the African Union's Agenda 2063. Questions have been raised with regards to whether President Al Bashir of Sudan will be invited to FOCAC. The South African Government is aware of the order made by the International Criminal Court on 4 September 2015 requesting submissions from South Africa in relation to the case of President Al-Bashir. We are currently studying the order. We will then make a determination as to the next course of action, if any. Our own courts are also still considering the matter of President Al-Bashir's last visit to South Africa in June which makes this matter therefore sub-judice. It should however be remembered that Sudan is a member of FOCAC. As such, it is expected that the Sudanese Government will participate in FOCAC. Your Excellencies, As such, there is a need for sustained mobilization in order to completely eradicate the scourge, and to provide more economic and financial support to ensure sustainable economic recovery in the affected countries. We will also participate in the important climate change summit in Paris, France. We go to Paris happy with our contribution in Durban in 2011. If South Africa had not produced the historic outcomes at COP17/CMP7 under the UN Climate change conference in December 2011, the world would not be where it is today, with leaders agreeing on what needs to be done on Climate Change. South Africa revitalised this negotiation structure, producing the current framework for negotiations under the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action. This is the basis on which negotiations towards COP21 /CMP11 in Paris are taking place. As we approach Paris, we continue our leadership on Climate Change as Chair of the G77 and China which comprises 134 countries. We are determined to ensure that the outcomes of Paris support development. Key for developing countries out of the Paris talks are the following: Adaptation, Finance, Technology Transfer, Capacity Building and all the things which are essential to support developing countries in order for them to continue doing more on mitigation. As Chair of the G77 and China, I would like to emphasize that a Paris package that is hollow and weak on finance will be not be acceptable. South Africa will also participate at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta later this year. Your Excellencies, We look forward to a successful UN General Assembly 70th anniversary session next week and all the other important international forums. We also look forward to cooperating with your governments in the pursuit of many of these goals. I thank you. \</doc>

Ministers and Deputy Ministers Directors-General Senior managers Members of the media Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the International Cooperation, Trade and Security (ICTS) Cluster media briefing following President Jacob Zuma's State of the Nation Address (SoNA) to Parliament in Cape Town on Thursday, 11 February 2016. The ICTS Cluster is responsible for the implementation of the Medium Term Strategic Framework: 2014 - 2019 commitments, as articulated in Outcome 11. Our vision is to Create a better South Africa, contribute to a better and safer Africa in a better world. Government fulfils its commitments through the cluster system that promotes coordination and integration of interrelated functions to accelerate service delivery. This media briefing aims to amplify the pronouncements made by President Zuma in his SoNA, in relation to the ICTS Cluster. During 2015, we sharpened our focus on economic diplomacy to strengthen relations that will bring foreign investment and help us to address the triple challenge of poverty, unemployment and inequality. This focus has led to a number of partnerships with like-minded countries and significant funds have been committed towards African development by our international partners. South Africa's priorities enhanced in bilateral and multilateral engagements We ended the year 2015 by hosting the State Visit by the President of the People's Republic of China, Xi Jinping, which took place on the eve of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) Summit during which a number of agreements were concluded. President Zuma took part in the 2016 World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos with a delegation comprising Ministers and business leaders. The WEF was an important platform to promote and profile South Africa's attractiveness as an investment destination of choice. Building on WEF Africa, this delegation took a united message to WEF Davos that South Africa is open for business. Despite challenges in the global economy, South Africa remains a competitive business and investment destination. In the first three quarters of the current financial year South Africa attracted R64.3 billion in Foreign Direct Investment pipeline, far surpassing the target of R45 billion. For a citizen, the investments mean an opportunity to work, to develop their skills, earn a sustainable income and feed a family. Participation in multilateral institutions Some of our achievements include the work we have been doing with multilateral institutions. The Minister of Environmental Affairs, Mrs Edna Molewa, led the South African delegation to the twenty first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and eleventh Meeting of the Parties serving as the Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (UNFCCC COP 21 /CMP11). This global conference, which took place from 30 November - 12 December 2015 in Paris, France, led to the adoption by consensus of the Paris Agreement and a package of supporting decisions, addressing climate action in both the pre-and-post 2020 periods. President Jacob Zuma delivered the South African national statement, held bilateral meetings and was accorded the special honour by the French President of chairing a full session of the leaders' event. This was in recognition of President Zuma's special role as initiator of the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, under which the Paris negotiations took place, as well as a key contributor to broader United Nations processes on environment and sustainable development. South Africa participated in these negotiations as Chair of the Group of 77 and China, whose 136 members represent well over 80% of the world's population, as well as in its role as a member of the Africa Group of Negotiators (AGN), the Brazil, South Africa, India and China group (BASIC) and in its national capacity. Minister Molewa led the G77 and China at the ministerial-level meetings in Paris, while Ambassador Nozipho Mxakato-Diseko, Deputy Director-General: Global Governance and Continental Agenda at the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO), chaired the Group for all other meetings during 2015. South Africa drafted key text that helped forge the political deal underpinning the legal agreement and also made successful interventions on process. Under South Africa's Chair the G77 and China demonstrated unprecedented unity, which resulted in securing the best deal possible for developing countries. The successful finalization of the Paris Agreement is extremely significant for South Africa as we strive to enhance our efforts to transition to a lower carbon economy and society, as well as to adapt in the short, medium and long term to the impacts of increasing temperatures, and reduced rainfall in many parts of the country. South Africa also assumed a seat on the UN Broadband Commission which noted that 3.2 billion people are connected to the internet. The Commission is now focused on finding ways to connect the next 4 billion people mostly in underdeveloped areas and trying to bring down the costs to connect them. South Africa is implementing the roll-out of broadband to ensure that all our citizens are able to use the transformative power of the Internet to keep pace with global developments and market their businesses internationally. We want to ensure that ultimately, access to broadband is at competitive prices as we move to lower the costs of doing business in South Africa. In his State of the Nation Address, President Zuma emphasised that the African continent remains central to our foreign policy engagements. South Africa hosted the Summit of African Union (AU) Heads of State and Government in June 2015. At that time the negotiations for a Continental Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) were launched. The CFTA will also follow the developmental integration approach for which South Africa has consistently been advocating. The developmental integration agenda is premised on three pillars: market integration complemented by the concurrent pillars of industrial and infrastructure development. More recently, the President and senior officials attended the Summit of the AU on its 24th Ordinary Session in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 30 to 31 January 2016. The AU launched the theme: Year of Women's Empowerment and Development towards Africa's Agenda 2063. This year's Human Rights Day on 21 March will be commemorated as the national day against racism and also looking at the Human Rights Empowerment to Women. South Africa's plans are underway to domesticate and align Agenda 2063 and the first Ten-Year Implementation Plan. This is response to the Summit call for all AU Organs and continental institutions to align their Strategic and Master Plans to the 1st Ten Year Implementation Plan and ensure maximum coordination in its implementation, in the spirit of complementarity and subsidiarity. South Africa also participated in the important World Radiocommunications Conference, which took place in November 2015. This conference agreed on new allocations and reassignment for spectrum for critical services. We are happy to announce that South Africa was successful in advancing its national position. The outcomes of which have positive benefits for the national priorities including universal broadband roll-out, universal broadcasting roll-out, satellite communication services, aircraft services, maritime and the ocean economy programmes, environmental public protection and disaster relief, emergency services and security services, as well as other future programmes to support economic transformation and to realise the National Development Plan (NDP) objectives. A strong, mutually beneficial South-South Cooperation South Africa participated in the India-Africa Summit held in New Delhi, India from 26 to 30 October 2015 and the FOCAC hosted in Johannesburg from 4 to 5 December 2015 as we strengthened these important partnerships. China announced investments of US$50 billion of which South Africa will receive US$10 billion for infrastructure, industrialisation and skills development. The Preferential Trade Agreement between Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and the Southern Common Market (Mercosur), comprising Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, has now been ratified by all member states and this agreement is expected to enter into force in the first semester of 2016. The agreement will offer new market access opportunities for South African exports and also strengthen our South-South Cooperation. Economic cooperation with our Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRICS) partners was strengthened when the first two intergovernmental agreements were concluded on the occasion of the sixth BRICS Summit. These were the Agreement on the New Development Bank (NDB) and the Treaty Establishing a Contingent Reserve Arrangement. The NDB will approve its inaugural projects during 2016. South Africa participated at the inaugural BRICS Ministers of Communications whose aims include demonopolising the electronic manufacturing sector, opening their markets to each other and increasing cooperation amongst each other. Strong, mutually beneficial and strategic formations with the North Countries of the developed North remain important strategic partners for South Africa. We continue our engagements with the EU as a bloc (28 members), which is our largest trading partner and foreign investor. Over 2 000 EU companies operating within South Africa have created over 350 000 jobs. The EU also contributes 100 million Euros (about R1.5 billion) to infrastructure development for domestic and regional programmes through the Infrastructure Investment Programme. In 2015 South African exports to the EU amounted to more than R216 billion, of which half are manufactured goods. The legal scrubbing of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) between the Southern African Development Community (SADC) EPA group and the EU was concluded in October 2015. The agreement will be put forward for ratification within the next few months. This agreement brings improved market access for some South African products into the EU, beyond that which was enjoyed under the earlier South Africa-EU Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement. Furthermore, AGOA was re-authorised in June 2015 for 10 years until 2025, with South Africa's inclusion. This will secure continued market access for South African products, including in value added generating sectors such as agriculture and automobiles. South Africa and the United States (US) have now resolved all outstanding issues relating to the agricultural imports from the US, paving way for continuation of AGOA benefits for South Africa's agricultural exports into the US market. South Africa is working with relevant stakeholders to facilitate the first shipment of US poultry imports under the agreed quota. South Africa and the US have recommitted themselves to work towards resolving issues affecting South Africa's agricultural exports into the US. The affected agricultural exports include, among others, citrus, avocadoes, litchis, beef, mutton and racehorses. The renewal of AGOA beyond September 2015 and a pledge to support African-led peace initiatives in the continent are among the significant outcomes of the US-Africa Leadership Summit held in the US last year. Economically, regional economic integration efforts have gained considerable momentum through the launch of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa-East African Community-SADC Tripartite Free Trade Area (FTA) in June 2015 in Sharm El Sheik, Egypt. The Tripartite FTA comprises of combined markets of 26 countries. The combined Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of these countries in 2014 was estimated at US$1.3 trillion and amount to 58% of Africa's GDP. Efforts are underway to also engage in the Continental FTA negotiations launched by the Assembly in June 2015, which will integrate all the AU member states with a market of over one billion people with a projected GDP of approximately US$3.4 trillion by 2017. The year will also seek to explore more business and developmental opportunities, and demonstrate South Africa's innovations, and best practices in various areas such as science and technology, fashion, mining, arts, culture, tourism and greater people to people interaction. Member states were also encouraged to urgently develop a continental initiative on Critical Technical Skills, and to prioritise investments in the development of skills, especially in the areas of science and technology, essential for implementing Agenda 2063, including vocational skills and trade technicians, and the design and management of large-scale projects. An economically integrated Southern Africa Closer to home, South Africa assumed the position of Chair of the SACU in June 2015. Following a special meeting of the Council of Ministers and Heads of State and Government in November 2015, there is agreement to convene a Retreat in April 2016 to give strategic direction to the implementation of the six-point work programme. This will be followed by a Summit of SACU Heads of State and Government by June 2016. In SADC, the review of the Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan was completed and adopted by an Extraordinary SADC Summit in April 2015. In the area of economic integration, industrial development was given centre stage and is being front-loaded in the implementation plan. It is important that all partners develop their industrial sectors in order to benefit fully from integration initiatives. In further elaboration of this new orientation, the SADC has also developed a regional industrialisation strategy. As a final component of that work, the action plan of the strategy is currently being developed. A peaceful, secure and stable Africa President Zuma stated in the State of the Nation Address that: South Africa continued to support peace and security and regional economic integration through participation in the AU and the SADC initiatives. The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) and South African Police Service continue to participate diligently in conflict prevention and peacekeeping in the continent. The SANDF continues to participate in the UN Peace Support Operation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (Operation Mistral), the UN/AU Hybrid Peace Support Operation in the Sudan (Operation Cordite). The Force Intervention Brigade which the SANDF is part of had a very successful operation which saw the biggest armed group in the eastern DRC M23 surrendering. In December 2015, one of our own Lieutenant Generals (Lt Gen) Derrick Mgwebi was appointed as the new Force Commander of the UN Mission in the DRC, called MONUSCO. He takes over command of a 20 000-strong UN Mission in the eastern part of the DRC. This is the largest UN peace-support operation in the African continent and the world. The SANDF, under operation Team Bulisa, has assisted with the development and completion of the Military Strategy of the Armed Forces of the DRC. This is part of capacity building that the SANDF is involved in, with other defence forces of the region through defence cooperation. Maritime security continues to be the other key operation for the SANDF in the east coast of the continent. The SANDF successfully deployed two ships, SAS Spioenkop and SAS Galeshewe on Operation Copper in the Mozambique Channel at alternating times during the reporting period. The SANDF has been in the Mozambique Channel since 2011. They carried out operations to counter piracy activities and there has been a drastic reduction of piracy in the Mozambique Channel. South Africa's efforts have resulted, amongst others, to a number of key outcomes such as the operationalisation of the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises (ACIRC), of which South Africa is a contributing and founding member. South Africa continued to support peace and security, and regional economic integration by participating in the AU and the SADC initiatives. Following the operationalisation of the ACIRC we hosted the AMANI AFRICA II Field Training Exercise (19 October - 7 November 2015) to test its full operational capability as a build-up to the operationalisation of the African Standby Force. The success of this exercise was a significant milestone in our quest to fully operationalise the African Peace and Security Architecture. The South African Government will continue to contribute to peacekeeping on the continent through various peacekeeping missions. Our involvement in peacekeeping missions is premised on our appreciation that Africa's economic development depends on the substance of peace and stability. Working in partnership with regional and international partners and as a member of the AU Peace and Security Council, South Africa continue to play a critical role in the restoration of peace and stability in the DRC, Burundi, Central African Republic, Libya, South Sudan and other conflict-torn countries. Political cohesion within Southern Africa to ensure a peaceful, secure and stable Southern African region At regional level, South Africa Chaired the SADC Organ on Peace, Security and Defence Cooperation from August 2014 to August 2015 and led SADC Electoral Observer Missions to Mozambique, Botswana, Namibia, Mauritius, Zambia and the Kingdom of Lesotho. It is worth noting that all these elections were declared peaceful, credible, transparent, free and fair. The elections in Lesotho were a culmination of the successful facilitation by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa under the auspices of the SADC. South Africa also continued with the regional peace and security initiatives in the Republic of Madagascar and the DRC. South Africa will continue to support conflict-resolution initiatives in Lesotho, Sri Lanka and South Sudan, led by the Deputy President as Special Envoy of the President. Tourism contribution to the South African economy Tourism remains a key driver of our national economy. The sector contributes about nine per cent of our GDP. The country received a total of 8 903 773 foreign tourist arrivals during 2015, generating a significant revenue contribution to the economy. Last year, the tourism sector raised concerns about the impact of new immigration regulations that were introduced to combat child trafficking and improve security at our country's points of entry. We listened to these concerns. We committed ourselves to finding a better balance between our security and our economic development interests. An Inter-Ministerial Committee on Immigration Regulations, chaired by Deputy President Ramaphosa, brought several government departments together to find this balance. Cabinet has approved several measures to make it easier for tourists coming to South Africa to apply for visas and to travel with children. At the same time, we have ensured that the safety of all children and the security of our country is not compromised. We are confident that tourism will continue to contribute significantly to our economy as the revised measures are implemented. Several skills-development and capacity-building programmes are underway to unlock the full potential of tourism. These include training 577 young people as chefs this year, instructing 300 youths in the art of serving wine expertly as professional Sommeliers, and teaching unemployed graduates to become Food Safety Assurers, who ensure that the food served at our establishments is stored, prepared and served safely. Over 1,6 million local and international tourists visited the Kruger National Park in 2015. They enjoyed the magnificent biodiversity of one of the world's leading successes in wildlife conservation. An additional access point into the Kruger National Park will be developed near Muyexe in Limpopo. The new Shangoni Gate will improve access to the park, and it will provide economic opportunities for local communities by producing arts and crafts, providing supplies, operating tours and other hospitality services. The Department of Tourism is implementing revised Tourism Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Codes of Good Practice. The black ownership target has been set at 30%, which is higher than the target in the generic codes of good practice to assist in our efforts to drive transformation in the sector. To address women empowerment, this 30% must consist of 50% women and 50% men. South Africans and international tourists should visit our important cultural and heritage sites, and our beautiful landscapes and diverse attractions. Access to these sites is being improved as part of a broader strategy to create a culture of travel among our people. The tourism industry is a major contributor to the South African economy and employment of our citizens. This shows that ongoing efforts to showcase our country as a tourist, investment and destination of choice are bearing much-needed fruits during this low global economic outlook. The Nation Brands Index recognises South Africa as amongst the top 50 most globally competitive countries in the world. The Index looks at six pillars of the brand of a nation with a number of criteria - the pillars include: tourism, people, exports, immigration and investment, governance, and culture and heritage. The Nation Brands Index is the result of 20 342 interviews in 20 countries. According to the Index, South Africa's strengths are seen as sports - particularly football, pristine landscapes and game reserves. Participants in the survey also indicated that the citizens of South Africa are described as, amongst others, desirable friends, good employees, hardworking and skillful. This demonstrates that South Africa has so much good to offer. We call on South Africans to work much harder at promoting the nation's brand abroad. Conclusion The year 2015 was a special year for international relations as it marked 70 years of existence of the UN. South Africa used the occasion to continue to advocate for the reform of the Global System of Governance, particularly the UN Security Council and the Bretton Woods institutions. South Africa's international relations engagements will continue to be based on South Africa's national priorities and the pursuit of continental aspirations. Domestically, 2015 marked the 60th anniversary of the Freedom Charter, which called for peace and friendship among nations. President Zuma stated that we are proud of our democracy and what we have achieved in a short space of time. Our democracy is functional, solid and stable. This year we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996. Building on this strong foundation, we are resolute in our determination to create a better South Africa; contribute to a better and safer Africa in a better world. Together, let's move South Africa forward. I thank you \</doc>

Recognition of Dignitaries His Majesty - HlangaLomhlabathi Madam Speaker Deputy Speaker Honourable Members of the Provincial Executive Honourable Members of the Legislature Mayors and Councillors of Local Government Amakhosi and Members of Traditional Councils present Acting Director-General Social partners in business, Inter-faith and broader civil society Members of the Diplomatic Corps Distinguished Guests, Sanibonani! Introduction and scene setting statements We are honoured and humbled to get this opportunity to address you on the state of our province. The challenges we are facing as a country and as a province as outlined by the President of the Republic, His Excellency Jacob Zuma during his State of the Nation Address and how we intend dealing with them as articulated by the Minister of Finance, PravinGordhan yesterday, are by their very nature all humbling. KwaZulu-Natal, like all other Provinces and the whole country, has no doubt that the combination of economic downturn in our country, severe drought and high unemployment have connived to create a very difficult situation for us indeed. In February we trust. This is a month that lifted our spirits as a nation beyond any imagination in 1990. The announcement that Tata Madiba would be released and banned political organisations would be unbanned sounded unbelievable, as announced on 2nd February in the National Assembly. When the 11th of February 1990 indeed came, it was true inspiration to see Tata Nelson Mandela walking tall out of prison. He touched the powerless and the powerful through his compassion and values of humanity. We invoke his spirit not out of convenience but because of its moral authority and its inspirational power, which must continue to guide our nation even in the most of difficult times. Budget cuts and implications thereof limit government's ability to deliver the way we would under normal circumstances. I have always taken as common course that Indlalaibangaulaka, nothing else, I now know that budget cuts also have the same effect among us as the Executive. Here in this address we will remind you of undertakings we made last year, give you progress we have made on them and outline priorities for the future. In the last two weeks we have received news of lightning disaster related deaths which took place in Harding and Mhlabuyalingana resulting in the death of 12 people in our Province. We also note with great concern the deaths that have taken place on our roads especially Ruth First Highway where cyclists were killed by motor vehicles a few months ago. The taxi incident at Reunion Railway Station near uMlazi also which saw the death of 3 (three) children of which two were siblings is disheartening indeed. Children are the future and as society we need to care and protect them at all times. We have also received news of storms in some parts of the province which have caused serious damage to property. To the families, relatives and friends of those who parted we say 'Akwehlangalungehli'. Our message to the people of KwaZulu-Natal today is that we must be full of hope and use this opportunity to gather strength physically and mentally to propel ourselves further with much vigour, and WE CAN\'c2\Â£6 In crafting the State of the Province Address, we invited the public to make their suggestions. We used the mainstream media and social media to enable the people of this province to tell their government what it should do to improve their lives. We heard your calls and listened to your suggestions. The following excerpts called us to more action! NhlanhlaKhumalo: uMongameliuthi "UmnothoWezweUleleKwezolimo"akesiqinisekakhulukumkhankasowokuthiakubuyelweemasiminikulinywehlezinobubhaobusikhungethebungehlakakhulu.

Jerome MfanufikileDlamini: Macingwane, akekukhulunywekuphindekusukunywengentuthukoemakhaya. KwaVulamehlokuWard 9 awukhougesinamanzi. We wish to assure these fellow compatriots of our commitment to them and we will look at these matters and many more. Madam Speaker, after careful consideration on an appropriate theme for 2016 State of the Province Address, we came up with KwaZulu-Natal - A Growing, Developing and Caring Province Firmly FocussedOn Vision 2030! Madam Speaker, the 2016 State of the Province Address is the second one to be delivered in this five year cycle in the implementation of the National Development Plan (NDP) and our own Provincial Growth and Development Plan (PGDP). As announced in the 2015 State of the Province Address, we have now shifted our focus to the 2015 to 2020 period, or the second quarter of the 20 Year Plan. As we do so we are mindful of the fact that as much as we have our eyes set on longer terms goals and objectives, we also have to account for what it is that we have been able to deliver in the past year; as well as to ensure that we achieve particular predetermined outcomes and deliverables within the next financial year. In looking back at what we have achieved, against what it was that we committed to do in the 2015 State of the Province Address, one soon realises that we have indeed moved our Province forward and that we have remained well on track to 2030 and beyond. Both the NDP and the PGDP, spell out our long term plan. Year on year our plans must reflect the long-term vision. We want to reaffirm that we have a stable framework. In highlighting our achievements last year, I would like to recognise upfront the efforts made not only by government, but also that of our partners in this process, namely business, labour and civil society. The KZN Economic Council has been a very successful institution to draw all of us together around the various social accords and has united us in our quest to work towards a shared vision. As an effort to ensure continued planning, we have started the review of our Provincial Growth and Development Strategy with the intention of retaining a 20 year planning horizon and therefore extending our planning timelines to four five year quarters between now and 2035. We are on track to present this to the Provincial Executive Council Lekgotla scheduled for August this year. This revised Strategy is informed by three very critical documents for the Province, namely: the Revised KZN Situational Analysis as an objective assessment of exactly where the Province finds itself within the local and global context in 2016; the 2015 Citizen Satisfaction Survey, which gives a clear indication of the perceptions of our citizens on services they receive from government, as well as what they regard as their highest priorities to be attend to; and the PDGP Implementation Report where we measure our performance against the targets we had set in 2011, and a clear indication of areas requiring special attention. The Economic and Fiscal Situation We are extremely concerned about sluggish international, national and provincial trends. The global growth was estimated at 3.1% in 2015 with a projected growth at 3.4% in 2016 and 3.6% in 2017. In advanced economies, a modest and uneven recovery is expected to continue. The picture for emerging market and developing economies is diverse but challenging. The slowdown of the Chinese economy, lower commodity prices, and strains in some large emerging market economies will continue to weigh on growth prospects in 2016-17. Risks to the global outlook remain tilted towards the downside informed amongst others by: A generalized slowdown in emerging market economies; China's economic slowdown; The gradual exit from extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy (brakes on quantitative easing) in the United States. If these key challenges are not successfully managed, global growth could be derailed. Most countries in sub-Saharan Africa will see a gradual pickup in growth, but lower commodity prices will retard this growth. The domestic economy is under severe pressure as a result of subdued global economic performance. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has reduced SA's economic growth outlook for this year from 1.3% to 0.7%, the lowest forecast on record so far. As such, the combination of factors like high debt service costs, high costs of compensation of employees and contracting tax base, places a severe strain on the fiscus. The emerging consensus is that unless we public spending, we will have trouble with our debt obligations thereby risking further downgrade to possible junk status in sovereign credit rating. This situation has understandably impacted negatively on government revenue streams and the fiscal situation of the state, where we are now have to absorb substantial budget cuts. This will obviously have a significant impact on our ability as a Province to achieve our growth targets, which were set in 2011 on an assumption of an annual growth rate of 5%. 3.2 KZN Real Growth Trends in Gross Domestic Product GDP growth rebounds to 1.2 % q-o-q in 2015 Q3, bolstered by manufacturing (6.2%), finance (2.7%) and Trade (2.6%). This came after contracting by -1.6% q-o-q in 2015Q2 on account of a contraction of -17.4% in agriculture, -8.6% in Mining and -6.3% in manufacturing. Agriculture, mining and electricity contracted again in 2015:Q3 falling into recession. Manufacturing rebounded at 6.2% after posting -6.3% in 2015:Q2 In terms of the composition of the Provincial labour market, the provincial unemployment rate (official) is currently siting at 20.5 and expanded rate is 35.5. Between Q3:2014 and Q3:2015, the number of discouraged and unemployed persons have decreased quite significantly. The Community and social services, trade and manufacturing sectors are the biggest contributors to employment in the province. Implications for KwaZulu-Natal are substantial cuts at over R1 billion in the first year of MTEF. For us as the Executive Council, this meant holding several meetings and at times strenuous negotiations on these directives to cut, in order to find solutions that will not negatively impact on service delivery. Serious pressures like FeesMustFall and the construction of the government precinct, further compound the situation in economic departments. However, progress on economic major projects especially infrastructure, must not be halted. This calls for teamwork amongst ourselves in the leadership, amongst officials in various departments and between government and our stakeholders. The KZN Situational Analysis of the Province, takes into account the current situation in the Province in relation to: physical environment, demographic landscape, social landscape, human resource development environment, economic landscape, infrastructure landscape, and governance and policy landscape. There are clear indications that we need to take certain issues into account in our immediate and future plans. The Citizen Satisfaction Survey was undertaken in 2015 as a collaboration between the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Government, represented by the Provincial Planning Commission and Statistics South Africa. This survey was a perception survey done in a very representative sample of 22 000 households across the length and breadth of our Province. This survey indicated that although 64% of the KZN population was happy with the services it received from Provincial Government, 36% were not satisfied. This survey also clearly pointed out what KZN citizens regarded as key priorities they want Provincial Government to attend to. At the top of this list is the need for increased employment opportunities, followed closely by a need for accelerated housing delivery. A third clear priority is pointing to the need to attend to matters related to crime and corruption and to bolster actions aimed at curbing social ills related to substance abuse and violence against women and children. The citizens of this Province indicated that they were happy with the level of health and education services, largely as a result of the levels of access to these services. There is however an expectation that the quality of these services are to improve. There also seems to be a high level of satisfaction about the fact that access to piped water had improved from 76% in 2002 to 87% in 2014 and over the same period access to sanitation improved from 51% to 76% and access to electricity for cooking increased from 69% to 82%. The progress we are reporting here today is therefore once again verified information via the Structures we have put in place to implement and continuously refine our PGDP, and we are also confident to make the commitments we will make in this address, reassured in the knowledge that there are structures and systems in place to deliver on these commitments in a coordinated and integrated manner. We are also committed to further strengthen and support these structures to promote unity in action amongst all our development partners and to reinforce our relations. As a Provincial Executive, we have reviewed our own strategies and plans and adopted the 2015 Version of the PGDP. All Provincial Departments and Public Entities have now adjusted their 2015 - 2020 Five Year Strategic Plans and Annual Plans for the 2016/17 Financial Year are substantially completed. We are therefore ready to start the new financial year on 1 April 2016, well prepared with programmes and projects to propel us on our trajectory to 2030. We are motivated about the fact that in our Province we have: Further increased employment by 6% from the 2 419 000 we reported on in 2015 to 2 558 000 in quarter 3 of 2015 as reported by the Quarterly Labour Force Survey. This has been achieved despite a lower than anticipated economic growth rate and the prevailing drought in the Province. The results for the 4th Quarter of 2015 will be released today and we will keep a watchful eye on any new trends that may emerge from these survey results; Followed through on the implementation of the outcomes achieved from Operation Phakisa or Ocean Lab, as well as the Poverty Eradication Lab and the Lab on the Development of the Makhathini. These processes have all resulted in focused action plans which are now in implementation and are starting to deliver tangible outcomes which I will elaborate on a little later; With the proclamations of the Regulations on the establishment of Special Economic Zones (SEZs), the Dube Trade Port (DTP) and Richards Bay Industrial Development Zones (IDZs), are now designated as the first SEZs in our Province. The significance of this step cannot be underestimated as this finally provides opportunities for large national and international investors to pursue the very favourable incentives to promote in particular our export capabilities. Both these SEZs are key to the success of initiatives related to the Oceans Economy and the KZN Aerotropolis Strategy. We have seen good progress in the rollout of the Eskom electrification programme in KwaZulu-Natal with only 60 000 connections having been made in the last year. This linked to the fact that load shedding has been halted, which improved access to and reliability of electricity connections. We are however mindful that there is still much to be done in this regard. The overall infrastructure spend in the Province across the budget votes of the 14 provincial departments has now reached the R12 billion mark. The added advantage is that this expenditure is now being coordinated through the newly developed decision matrix emanating from the KZN Infrastructure Master Plan aimed at improving integration and alignment of key infrastructure development projects within all spheres of government. We are however going to have to increase our focus on matters related to the operation and maintenance of our infrastructure to ensure that we get full value and optimal employment opportunities out of these massive capital investments. As promised in the previous address we have now made significant progress with the implementation of the InkululekoProgramme in KwaZulu-Natal. More than R1, 2 billion was invested in Ndumo by government to ensure that we add meaning to word Freedom for the majority of people of Umkhanyakude. Following on the from the success of Ndumo, we are now moving on to Cwaka in Msinga, where we launched Inkulukelo 2 on the 2nd of February 2016, We are also investing billions of rands as part of efforts aimed at driving rural development and attracting more investments into these areas that were previously neglected. Made good progress on a range of slums clearance projects in the sense that the following 4 slums clearance projects are now 100% completed, namely, Louisiana in Hibiscuss Coast, Trennance Park in eThekwini, Franklin in Greater Kokstad and Gingindlovu Slums in Umlalazi. A further 30 projects are in construction, of which 10 are nearing completion such as Vryheid Ext. 16 Phase 1, Umlazi-Uganda, the Lamontville Ministerial Project, Old and New Dunbar, as well as Umlazi B10. Although the establishment of Agri-Villages in the Province has not fully progressed to the extent that we had anticipated, good progress has none the less been made. We have developed a deep understanding of the underlying causes of social tensions amongst land claimants, traditional leadership, commercial and subsistence farmers and have made good progress to lay a sound foundation for more tangible results in the next year. I am now more convinced than ever that these Agri-Villages are essential if we want to succeed in providing better services to rural communities and protecting valuable agricultural land at the same time. There is no place for complacency and there is much more to do Guided by the measurement of progress we have made thus far and balanced by the views expressed by our citizens, we are not comfortable against the backdrop of the reviewed KZN Situational Analysis, the latest KZN Citizen Satisfaction Survey, as well as the progress reports on the implementation of the PGDP, we are able to point directly to areas of slow or poor delivery as highlighted by the targets that have not been achieved. We are unfortunately still faced with a situation where: Levels of poverty, unemployment and inequality still remains unacceptably high persistent. In this regard we are concerned about the slow progress made with enterprise development through SMMEs and Cooperatives. We are clearly lagging well behind our 2020 target to have more than 21 000 SMMEs and Cooperatives established that have been in existence for a period of more than 2 years with only 7 500 of them currently meeting this standard. The Grade 12 pass rate declined for the second year in a row and is now at 60.7% after the Province had achieved a pass rate of close to 80% in 2013. As much as we remain steadfast in our resolve to provide quality education with quality outcomes, we are also committed to ensure that we improve our pass rate without compromising quality standards. The rate of HIV/AIDS Infections are still far too high even though we have dramatically improved access to treatment. This, coupled with a stubborn high maternal mortality rate and TB incidence are still areas we have to improve on in our aim to meaningfully improve the quality of life of our citizens. Land as a means to achieve access to economic freedom is well recognised, but progress in the resolution of land reform and land restitution programmes have been slow. It is important to acknowledge the fact that this government has made strides in ensuring access to land for our people. The original objective that underpinned land reform and land restitution was that the land returned to our people would become a catalyst in changing their lives for the better. We acknowledge the fact that limited budgets for land reform programmes have resulted in a slow pace which has created a perception that there is no commitment on the part of government. Apart from these limitations, I have personally observed a number of challenges which by and large are very subjective and should be dealt with urgently in order to ensure access to land for the majority of our people. The second challenge is that efforts aimed at speeding up land reform are stalled by quarrels and disputes arising after the land has been returned. This has given rise to two major problems for the government. One is the perception that government is corrupt. The other one is real corruption that may have taken root affecting many people who would have benefited and their lives changed for the better. This problem needs to be tackled head-on because any corrupt activity that is man and woman made can be removed. The affected people themselves must tackle this particular challenge. They must just have a resolve to reject any form corruption that negates their own interests. To a lesser extent the land reform programme is affected by post settlement conflicts involving trustees and Amakhosi. While many people believe that this is a real problem - my own view is that it is a manufactured problem. In the main this argument is based on the fact that many claimants would have no land. They would then decide to exercise their rights and out of a claim. As soon as land is made available they then manufacture problems. There is no reason why trustees and Amakhosi cannot co-exists in a settled land. It's a matter that we must address through our heads than our hearts. The pace of delivering housing and specifically integrated human settlements has been too slow. We understand that this process is being affected by a range of inhibiting factors, such as available infrastructure, access to land, the state of spatial planning and reduced budgets. I believe that the time has come to pursue alternative delivery models to achieve greater participation and contributions from beneficiaries, and to ensure that the delivery of housing goes hand in hand with access to land ownership and that we can achieve much needed densification to reduce the related infrastructure service delivery costs. The Province of KwaZulu-Natal is still lagging well behind in the contribution to energy to the National Grid, in particular to renewable energy from its abundance of biomass reserves available within the sugar, paper, pulp and timber industry. The inability to improve the regulatory framework which is hindering the unlocking of the full potential of these bio resources has been a source of frustration, but we remain committed to pursue this cause. We are definitely not happy about the persistently high rate of crime, violence and corruption in our Province. Rape is rampant. Crime such as murders, attempted murders and aggravated assault are increasing to levels last seen in 2010/2011. Murders, attempted murders and other crime related to transport-related disputes, intergroup conflict and community protests have also shown an upward trend. Burglaries at non-residential and residential premises as well as Robbery at Residential Premises have shown small decreases, whereas business robberies are increasing. The high levels of stock theft and Rape also remain a concern. As measured by 2015 audit outcomes, we are not pleased with the fact that only two departments received clean audits, whilst four departments received qualified audits. I have called on our Provincial Treasury to provide guided support to these departments to ensure an improved audit outcomes from here on. Vision and high level focus areas for the next five years Madam Speaker, as we have already stated in our opening remarks, we remain on track to deliver on our Vision 2030. We are therefore determined to be A prosperous Province, with healthy secure and skilled people, acting as a gateway to Africa and the World. We have a clear plan of action expressed in our Provincial Growth and Development Plan setting clear targets of what it is that we have to achieve to ensure that we realise this Vision. At most, we are refining these targets in the current review of our PGDP. As we move into the next five year cycle of the NDP and the PGDP, we reconfirm our commitment to the Key National Priorities namely: Creation of more jobs, decent work and sustainable livelihoods for inclusive growth; Rural development, land reform and food security; A long and healthy life for all South Africans; Fighting crime and corruption; and in particular The implementation of the 9 Point plan to grow the South African Economy. These National Priorities, and for that matter all 14 Outcomes of the NDP remain the foundation of our PGDP. Focussing on the issue of radical economic transformation, we have to align with the National 9 Point Plan. Priority Intervention 1: Revitalisation of the agriculture and agro-processing value chain (APAP) Honourable Members, the Revitalisation of the agriculture and agro-processing value chain, remains a critical component of our economy to unlock growth and expand employment opportunity. It is for this reason that we are currently implementing a KZN Agrarian Transformation Strategy, which will contribute to rural economic development, increased production, job creation and market access for farmers mainly in rural areas through their integration into global value chain. In our programme for the development of commercial farmers (i.e. new entrant, small scale and land reform farmers), we have 3 483 beneficiaries. The agricultural sector including forestry and livestock farming, saw an increase in employment, which rose to 134 000 from 110 000 at end of September 2015. We have 122 Communal Estates that have been registered as legal entities and have transferred 163 tractors with implements to Communal Estates. In the last financial year, the Department was able to plant 7 380 ha of maize, 1 418 ha of beans, 575 ha of soya beans and 200 ha of cotton. In addition, 139, 6 ha of groundnuts, 6 ha of chicory were also planted. The Groenvlei at Emadlangeni has been identified as Agri-village and will be prioritised for implementation in the new 2016/17 financial year. A feasibility study is underway for the development of this area. The District Agri-Park Operation Task Teams as well as District Agri-Parks Management Committees have been established to facilitate the participation of all relevant stakeholders including farmers. Priority Intervention 2: More effective implementation of a higher impact Industrial Policy Action Plan The Richards Bay Industrial Development Zone (RBIDZ) remains an engine for job creation and a catalyst for foreign direct investment. We are satisfied with interests generated around this IDZ thus far. This facility has already attracted investments of over R6, 8 billion including a R4, 5 billion Titanium plant. Key milestones include: - R2 billion biomass plant, R300m pipe manufacturing plant, R16m paint manufacturing enterprise, R20m logistic services Manufacturing sector is the backbone of the economy of the province. The reality is that this sector has huge demand on electricity. It is for these reasons that we are using RBIDZ to pioneer an energy production hub. Currently, about 20 hectares of land have been identified at the Bayside to host gas-to-power operations in an effort to yield diversified energy generation capacity from renewable sources. More than 1800 jobs will be created during construction. Priority Intervention 3: Advancing beneficiation (adding value to our mineral wealth) The mining sector remains critical component of the provincial economy, with great potential for beneficiation along the mineral value chain. In 2013, mining contributed R9, 3 billion to the provincial Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which represents about 1.9% of the Provincial economy. In August 2015, we convened a small-scale mining Imbizo to look specifically into regulatory support mechanism, access to funding, and technical support mechanisms for small-scale mining. We have since developed a KZN Mineral Beneficiation Strategy, which is aimed at driving the minerals sector in KwaZulu-Natal towards a more profitable, socially accountable and environmentally sustainable future. We are currently conducting an analysis of the contribution of coal and phosphate in terms of their socio-economic development, risks and opportunities. As a Province, we will be pursuing Waste Material Recovery Industry as a source for beneficiated building materials. The Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs, has conducted a coal discards study that identified all existing coal mines and coal discards in the province. These discards have been classified according to their economic value, environmental impact and logistical or ease of access to the discards. In taking the process forward, we will hold stakeholder engagements around this Mineral Beneficiation Strategy and focus specifically on at least 5 key commodity value chains, namely Aluminium, Coal, Iron and Steel, Phosphates and Mineral Sands. Priority Intervention 4: Unlocking the potential of SMMEs, cooperatives, township and rural enterprises The presentation of the State of the Province Address last year coincided with the 60th Anniversary of the Freedom Charter. It is widely accepted that progress has been made in achieving some of the tenets of the Freedom Charter except two clauses - these being the economy and the land. It is for this reason that on the 7th February 2016, we convened a Cooperatives Summit to discuss issues in the sector. We view co-operatives as vital element in our efforts to eradicate poverty and de-racialise the economy. The Co-operatives Programme has two very specific objectives, namely to provide food security and to create economic activity at a very basic community level. Ordinary people continue to testify that following the introduction of this programme, they have been able to support their families. As of 2015 over 2,000 Cooperatives had received funding from Ithala and a few had made own savings and were operational without any funding from Ithala. More than R169, 6 million in loan capital had been approved to fund Cooperatives, contributing to the creation of more than 7,130 jobs. Our long-term goal as government is to ensure that our Cooperatives are competitive and operate on equal footing with co-operatives in developed countries. It is for this reason that we are investing in training and mentorship. When we started this term of office in 2014, EDTEA set aside R25, 6 million for training. To date, more than 127 students have been enrolled for a diploma in the management of co-operatives and 9 students enrolled in Bachelor Commerce through a partnership with the University of Zululand. In another partnership with Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT), in 2015 we implemented an Incubation programme on chemicals with. We are encouraged by such partnerships. More than 56 graduate students who have completed a diploma in the management of cooperatives have been employed under the internship program by the EDTEA, and are placed with cooperatives to providing administrative and management support. Plans are advanced to get cooperatives involved in the production of commodities that can be branded and marketed, for both domestic and international market. The department of economic development is providing technical expertise in the production and branding of various chemicals products such as soaps, oils and perfumes. In addition, the KZN Small Business Development Agency together with Ithala, provide holistic financial and non-financial support services to the co-operative sector. We have taken a decision to establish the Provincial Association of Traders to handle bulk-buying and warehousing for the co-operatives and SMMEs. We have identified buildings that are owned by Ithala across the province to be used as warehouses. This is to create direct access to suppliers and reduce costs of goods. It further makes them accessible within local municipalities from where they operate. An SMME Academy is to be established to provide the necessary skill desperately needed by SMMEs both in the formal and informal economy. Honourable Members, as government we do acknowledge that shopping malls have become drivers of economic development in recent years. If you go around the province you can notice shopping malls in major cities, townships and small towns. They are becoming hubs of local communities and a place to share quality time with friends and families. It is for this reason that EDTEA, through the Revitalisation of Township and Rural Enterprises, is currently finalising the Framework Document that will inform and influence Mall Tenancy in the townships and rural areas. We are determined to create an environment that is conducive to broader economic participation. Priority Intervention 5: Growing the oceans economy Madam Speaker, the launch of Operation Phakisa in the province by President Zuma a few years ago ushered in a new era for the country. The interests that has been generated in the maritime industry is overwhelming. It is becoming abundantly clear that this sector has potential to be an engine for sustainable economic growth and a game changer for the province in a number of secondary areas. We have profiled and stratified specific marine based opportunities that can be implementable to realise the inherent potential of the vast ocean economy by being embedded in the Operation Phakisa. Opportunities comprise of port optimisation in sectors such as containerisation, oil and gas, ship and rig repair, boat building and aquaculture. Although there have been a number of private sector interest, no firm deals have been done yet other than the Phangela Storage Tank Farm in Port Durnford. We have also realized that the low levels of investments in skills development in this sector means that the maritime sector's contribution towards the country's GDP will remain relatively small in comparison with other sectors of the economy. Our answer therefore is the establishment of the KZN Maritime Institute. We can confirm to this house that a feasibility study to assess the most suitable model of the institute has been completed. We want the institute to focus on the production of enough skilled workforce that will ensure a sustained growth of this sector. The world fleet of over 50,000 employs about 1, 4 million seafarers this opposed to South Africa which employ about 1,500. On board the 12,000 merchant ships visiting the South African ports annually, they carry about 240,000 seafarers who transport and handle our imports and exports (98% of total trade). The South African port mariners have only about 1,500 The global shortage in seafarers presents an opportunity for becoming a labour supply nation to the global shipping transport industry, thereby creating jobs particularly for the youth in rural and township areas. Madam Speaker, we also do not want the doors to this sector to remain closed for small businesses. That is why we held a Fisheries Indaba to engage widely on opportunities in the sector. A feasibility study on catfish farming is to commence before August this year. We have negotiated a lease agreement with the EMacambini Tribal Authority for Sofoco Fish Farm as identified in Operation Phakisa. This will benefit local communities and also open new opportunities in aquaculture for rural small-scale farmers and cooperatives. Priority Intervention 6: Resolving the energy challenge Madam Speaker, we are cognisant of the fact that the manufacturing sector is the backbone of the economy of the province. However, the reality is that the manufacturing sector has a huge demand on electricity. It is for these reasons that we are using RBIDZ to pioneer an energy production hub. Currently, about 20 hectares of land have been identified at the Bayside to host gas-to-power operations in an effort to yield diversified energy generation capacity from renewable sources. More than 1800 jobs will be created during construction. Last year we convened the Energy Indaba having recognized the electricity supply sector as a major player in the province's energy economy. Its importance lies both in improving the quality of life for the previously disadvantaged majority as well as supporting large-scale industrial development. This lack of access to efficient modern energy has significant impact on socio-economic development. We are determined to ensure that energy infrastructure programmes are extended to rural areas. More than 24 000 households will be electrified following an injection of about R600 million into our electrification programme from the Integrated National Electrification Programme. The key milestones include: Key bulk energy stations such as Ndumo Substation and Manguza Network Normalization have been completed by Eskom. Government spent R125 million and R15 million on both stations with 15 000 households in Jozini set to be connected. About 2000 household in Umhlabuyalingana will also be connected. Other bulk energy projects that have just been completed in the year 2015/2016 include Nongoma Sub-Station with a budget of R35 million. Jozini Town Network upgrade with a budget of R15 million Eshowe Sub-station upgrade with a budget of about R32 million) Priority Intervention 7: Managing work place conflict In hard economic times like the ones we are facing, we must all work together to minimise workplace labour conflict that impact negatively on productivity. All of us must work together to resolve any emergent disputes and place together pull our country to prosperity. We remain concerned by any prevalence of labour conflict that leads to work stoppages. We confirm our commitment to working together with labour in ensuring that our Province moves forward. I call on both organisedlabour and organised business to work together in finding solutions and to enter into a social compact that places the future of our country first. Together we can support delivery and progress in meeting our 9-Point Plan. Priority Intervention 8: Scaling up private sector participation We have made major strides in attracting significant private sector investment projects since the last State of the Province Address. The following projects are in the pipeline: Vossloh Project - which is a French company looking at setting up a manufacturing facility in Kwadukuza. They are currently exporting rail fasteners to South Africa and supplying PRASA and Transnet. This is an import substitution project to the value of R75m creating between 75 -100 jobs. HBM and SA Health Project - This is a condom manufacturing project to supply the local market and export to the rest of the continent, and is a partnership between a local company and a USA headquartered company. The value of this investment will be R65million and create 200 potential jobs. Multi-Smelter Park Project - localisation and beneficiation prospect of establishing 5 - 8 metallurgical smelters, attracting in the order of R 16, 5 billion in foreign direct investment and creating approximately 8 000 new jobs in the Colenso and Newcastle area. This will include power stations that will supply energy to the smelters. Iron Ore Project - The Melmoth iron ore project is a joint venture between Jindal Mining SA (Pty) Ltd and Sungu-Sungu Mining, as the principal Prospecting Right License holder. The project is currently at exploration level, and is estimated at R40 billion. This is expected to create 1 500 jobs on full operation. Manufacture of Ethanol from Sugar Project - The project promoter, Silvapen (South African/Brazilian Company) intends to establish an ethanol manufacturing plant near Jozini on the Makhatini Flats to the value of R1.2 billion and potential of 1000 jobs. St Lucia Wind Farms Project - This project will produce 48 MW of renewable energy. The first phase of the project is investment value of R150million and potential of 100 jobs. We are facilitating one of the biggest investment by a Chinese company - Hebei Iron and Steel. The prospects look good and this will be in the in Richards Bay IDZ to the total of R75 billion. The Company plans to be operational around 2018/19. Priority Intervention 9: Cross-cutters related to ICT, Transport infrastructure, Science and Technology and Water Our continued investment in infrastructure development, must be accelerated with greater efficiency. We have to eliminate wastage of resources through escalation costs that flow from projects not implemented within budget and scheduled time-frames. Over the last year we have built required strategic infrastructure and transport logistics necessary for a competitive modern economy; and provision of electricity and expansion of access has been improved. The King Shaka International Airport is growing as a strategic air transportation hub. In the last year, we have opened direct international flights to and from King Shaka International Airport by Turkish Airlines, Ethiopian Airlines and Qatari Airlines. This transforms our economy and add much needed revenue to the GDP of the country. We are planning to spend R12 billion on infrastructure in 2016/17. Department of Transport will spend the lion's share of this budget at 55%, followed by the Department of Education at 20% of the infrastructure budget and Department of Health at 13%. Other departments spend will be the remaining 12%. The Education infrastructure budget includes funding allocated in the Adjustments Estimates of R150 million. This funding is ring-fenced to address the water and sanitation backlogs in schools. This funding will address the sanitation and water backlogs in 453 schools in the Province. ICT and E- GOVERNANCE In 2015 we set a target of 15 000km of Broadband Fibre Optic roll out in the Province. We have completed a total of 14 683 km (80%) of fibre that is being rolled out to all schools, post offices and hospitals and 119 clinics in the NHI Districts have been connected. In terms of e-health, we have established 8 District Primary Open Access POPS, which are now ready for connection of Access networks. We have further identified and prioritised 5 towns for free Wi-Fi rollout namely, Durban, PMB, Richards Bay, Port Shepstone and Newcastle. Our e-procurement tool has been completed and is being piloted at the Departments of Transport, Treasury and COGTA and will be rolled out to all other government departments by end of 2016. In September 2015 we had 1 928 schools with access to Internet connection compared to the total of 6 258 schools in the province. There is potential to connect further 1800 schools. There are further initiatives for connectivity of Iboxes to 500 schools in uThungulu, uMgungundlovu and uMkhanyakude, 2 schools in Ugu and eThekwini, and Broadcast Technology to 200 schools in Harry Gwala and Amajuba. Developing and protecting our human capital 5.3 Human and Community Development Honourable Members, our strategic goal of Human and Community Development shows upward progress, however, the socio-economic challenges remain a barrier to the wellbeing of our people and deep inequality. Over the last year, 552 PhilaMntwanaCentres were established to promote and improve monthly growth monitoring; education and provision of oral rehydration; support for breastfeeding; and identification of children with incomplete immunisation schedules. Integration with PHC re-engineering and OSS has again been prioritised to reach more children at household level. To reduce morbidity and mortality from cervical cancer, a total of 162 000 women were screened for cervical cancer and 136 415 Grade 4 girls received the Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. In our continued fight against HIV and AIDS, we registered a milestone of over 1 million patients on Anti-Retroviral Treatment. Our province has turned the corner and runs the biggest treatment programme the world has seen. The successes have been seen in the implementation of the prevention of mother-to-child transmission, which now stands at 1,3 %, making the goal of an AIDS free generation by 2030 a reality. We want to express our appreciation as the provincial government to our partners who have worked with us over the years to turn around the situation. We want to single out the Global Fund which has provided financial support for the programme which focuses on prevention and it is targeted at young women. This programme has yielded positive results that are beyond our expectation. We are grateful that the Global Fund has pledged R440 million for this programme over three years starting in April this year. Our main target is young girls. In addition, this province has benefited from the partnership involving the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Nike Foundation. This partnership involves a new initiative aimed at reducing new HIV infections among adolescent girls and young women in selected high HIV-burden countries. This new initiative is called DREAMS, reflecting PEPFAR's vision that girls should be Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-Free, Mentored and Safe. This initiative will be implemented at UMgungundlovu, Ethekwini and Mkhanyakude municipalities. UNAIDS has also supported the province by seconding a senior official as a technical advisor who is attached to the Provincial Council on Aids Secretariat. BroadReach Health has also supported our programme by seconding 2 senior officials (M and E specialist to support the monitoring of HIV response and also Operation SukumaSakhe. They are also supporting the response by developing an IT system which will assist in the reporting at Local District and provincial AIDS council level. We value the partnership with all various donor agencies and the private sector. In our quest to improve the quality of life of our people, we have to acknowledge the factors that play a significant role in creating promoting crime and violence in our Province. These include the availability of illegal firearms, the availability of a market for stolen goods, substance abuse, cross-border mobility, community apathy and a lack of trust in the criminal justice system. It is therefore important to significantly improve the implementation of legislation relating to firearms control and second-hand goods, substance abuse, border management, community engagement and the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system. Effective visible policing and crime detection are essential to combating crime and the constitutional monitoring role of the Province in respect thereof should be strengthened to enhance people being and feeling safe. Good Governance We are pleased to note: that the vacancy rate in our Provincial Departments was below 9% and within the national norm of 10%; a significant improvement in the municipal audit outcomes for 2014/2015. A total of twenty two (22) Clean Audits; thirty seven (37) Unqualified Audits; nine (9) Qualifications and one (1) Disclaimer opinion. I have instructed the MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs to provide me with a report on what is happening in Umkhanyakude. Honourable Members, we are pleased with the performance of our municipalities as they continue on an upward trend to register positive audit outcomes. This demonstrates progress is being made in building a capable state with qualified individual in right positions. Even though we have recorded such progress, it is important to report that since our last State of the Nation Address, 5 municipalities had to be placed under section 139 Municipal Intervention. These were Imbabazane, Indaka, Abaqulusi, Mtubatuba and Umkhanyakude. The interventions were later terminated at Mtubatuba and Abaqulusi municipalities upon achieving substantial progress. The Steering Committee hold meetings with stakeholders from KZN CoGTA, National COGTA, SALGA, municipalities and relevant Public Entities on monthly basis to assess and monitor support. The Provincial Growth and Development Plan, continues to serve as the compass for the Province and incorporates the business, labour, civil society and government. The Citizens Service Charter has been adopted to improve service delivery by the public service in order to improve citizen satisfaction. We have developed and aligned municipal anti-corruption strategy with the National Anti-Corruption Strategy as well as the Provincial Integrity Management Strategy in order to implement anti-corruption measures and controls across all municipalities in the Province. Our Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, chairs and convenes an Anti-Corruption Technical Working Group. It meets bi-monthly and is made up of representatives from National Prosecuting Authority, Asset Forfeiture Unit and the Office of the Premier. Relevant programmes aimed at instilling ethics and curbing corruption, will be implemented on continuous basis so that officials and office-bearers are empowered to deal with risk assessment and fraud. We will continue to increase the performance of the Premier's Hotline above 85% resolution mark under I Do Right Awareness Campaign. An area of great concern is with regard to the state of our workforce in government. It is not reflective of the demographics of the provincial population. Women and people with disabilities are still under-represented particularly at senior management level. Departments are thus directed to set their targets in line with their Employment Equity gap, using targeted advertising to fill any of their vacant funded posts. Develop Strategic Infrastructure As a Province with a clear Vision of being a Gateway between Africa and the World, it speaks for itself that infrastructure development will always be one of our highest priorities. We have therefore prioritised the development of a Provincial Infrastructure Master Plan as announced in the 2015 State of the Province Address. I am now pleased to report that extensive progress has been made and that we are now in a much stronger position to coordinate and integrate infrastructure planning and development across all spheres of government in KwaZulu-Natal. I am also encouraged by the levels of cooperation we have received from all infrastructure development agencies in this process. It however remains work in progress and we are a track of continuous improvement and refinement. The main focus on infrastructure development is to ensure that we support and facilitate processes in respect of the 18 Strategic Integrated Projects, commonly referred to as SIPs as identified in the National Infrastructure Master Plan. I am obviously not able to elaborate on each of these SIPs and their application to KwaZulu-Natal, but highlight the following. SIP 1 is about unlocking the mineral wealth of the inland Provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga. Its significance for KwaZulu-Natal lies in the fact that these resources are to be exported via the Richards Bay Harbour and therefore requires improving this rail connection, as well as the expansion of the Port of Richards Bay. These expansions will at the same time be aimed at improving facilities to support the development of the Richards Bay SEZ. In this regard we have engaged Transnet on improving the container handling facilities in Richards Bay and the prospect of relocating decommissioned container handling equipment from the Port of Durban to Richards Bay. SIP 2 is arguably the largest and most complicated of all SIPs and is aimed at expanding and developing the Durban, Free State, Gauteng Logistics and Industrial Corridor. The intent here is mainly to improve the efficiencies of moving goods and services into, out of and through this corridor in a manner that will attract investment and create jobs not only in the infrastructure development, but in the related industrial development expansions. Without detracting from or pre-empting any more detailed reports that will be made by Members of the Executive Council when they deal with infrastructure development in their Budget Speeches, I would like to highlight the following: Expansion and maintenance of the Richards Bay Coal Line to improve its capacity from 81 Mtpa to 97 Mtpa. Transnet has proceeded with this upgrade and has also started the process of refurbishing existing as well as building and procuring new rolling stock on this line. This project also involves major upgrades to power supply and overhead track electrification, to cope with the increased freight demand. Durban-Free State-Gauteng Logistics and Industrial Corridor, which includes the expansion and improvements in the existing Port of Durban through, increased container handling Capacity, the Pier 1 improvements and the Salisbury Island Infill, which will collectively create additional 1.4 million TEU capacity. Many questions have recently been asked about the new Durban Dugout Port. I am aware that some pessimists have even declare this project dead. The fact of the matter is that planning is proceeding as per our previous reports on this project. What has changed is that with the downturn in the economy, freight volume have also declined and that studies had to be revised. Transnet has indicated that existing freight demands would comfortably be handled by the expanded Durban Port developments in the short term. This has allowed for more detailed planning and consultations on the Dugout Port and implementation has been delayed by about 4 years. Develop Small Craft Harbours - A revised and scaled down layout for the proposed Point Development has been submitted for approval, subsequent to the appeals process. This has been fully incorporated into the new point development as Durban Dube Trade Port Aerotropolis is a 250ha industrial/logistics park with a 1 400 000m2 business offices and 240 000m2 commercial floor area that can accommodate 10 000 units. There has been substantial interest from private sector investors to develop in this area, which was largely supported by the establishment of Samsung in this park in the previous financial year. A further R640 million private sector investment has already been committed and we are close to conclude a further investment of R180m fin the Trade Zone. The further expansion of the Aerotropolis is guided by the Durban Aerotropolis Master Plan which directs land use planning, infrastructure planning, environmental planning, investment planning and also provides the framework for an Airport city model. A great deal of emphasis has recently been placed on the development of a High Speed Rail connection of the King Shaka International Airport with surrounding feeder nodes of Ballito, uMhlanga, Durban, Westville/ Hillcrest and Pietermaritzburg. This project is seen as a potential legacy project in preparation for the 2022 Commonwealth Games. I must however also declare that there is still much work to be done on this project and various options are still being explored. On the issue of Road Developments we have seen an investment of R 7.1 Billion Rand from SANRAL in improving, maintaining and expanding the National Road Network in KZN. Our Provincial Department of Transport has been very active in the current financial year and they have completed 68.8km new gravel roads and upgraded a further 59.4 km of gravel roads in the Province. All of this is to improve access to rural areas and we are committed build 240km new gravel roads and to upgrade 70km of gravel to surfaced road in the next year. This is in addition to the extensive maintenance programme being rolled out throughout the Province. In respect of water infrastructure we are obviously focussing on increasing water storage capacity through engaging the Department of Water and Sanitation on the dam building programmes in the Province. With the current impact of the drought in the Province, there is increased pressure and focus on making progress with particularly the Hazelmere and Smithfield Dams. I am also pleased to announce that there has been more than satisfactory progress made with the larger water schemes, such as Greater Mthonjaneni Phase 2, the Lower Tugela Scheme as well as the Western and Northern aqueducts in eThekwini. We are spending a total of R 872 million via the Municipal Infrastructure Grant on water projects in KZN in the current financial year. As far as electricity is concerned, we are satisfied that between the Department of Energy and Eskom, we have been able to rollout new connections to 58 000 households and it is anticipated that a similar number of households will be connected in the next financial year. Madam Speaker I would like to assure the people of KwaZulu-Natal that we have a firm grip on all infrastructure development in this province and that we are monitoring progress on these projects now on a quarterly basis through a dedicated Infrastructure Management Team Chaired by myself. Education, training and developing skills to meet growth demand Madam Speaker, it pleases us to report that the number of learners in the number of learners in Grade R have increased to 250 000 in 2016. This is an indication of our commitment towards ensuring the acquisition of knowledge during early stages of development. We are making a conscious effort to strengthen the entire schooling system as we understand without quality education, there can be no socio-economic development in this province. We have taken the position that good quality education has to be relevant to the needs of the economy, and it should be judged by the extent to which it makes an individual self-sufficient and able to maintain sustainable livelihoods on leaving school, irrespective of the level attained. This province faces a major challenge in producing the required number of skills needed by the various sectors of our economy to sustain and indeed improve our current growth rates. We are encouraging the uptake of subjects in accounting, maths, science and technology amongst young people. We are encouraged by statistics, which show that our maths and science enrolments are high compared to other Provinces. As 30 percent of total school children are in KwaZulu-Natal, we are thus mindful of the responsibility we have to this nation in making education system to function efficiently and produce expected quality results. We are emphasizing the importance of developing teachers as facilitators of knowledge acquisition. We are singling out school principals as leaders who must lead with integrity and show a sense of urgency. We are calling upon the entire schooling community, organized labour, teachers, school governing bodies to work towards the creation of a stable schooling environment. KwaZulu-Natal Human Resource Development Council - STRATETGIC SKILLS DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TARGETING GRADUATES, TVET LEARNERS AND UNEMPLOYED YOUTH In terms of the NDP, Outcome 12 and DPSA Directives on learnerships and Internships, the Public Sector has to undertake initiatives to facilitate youth skills development by turning every public service workplace into a training space. Currently the provincial government departments have used funds from their 1% skills levy to accommodate 1237 graduates on the Public Sector Internship Programme at a cost of R74 029 344.36 and with SETA funding of R1.2 million The Department of Higher Education launched its Work Integrated Learning Programme for the purpose of encouraging employers to take on TVET students for the workplace portion of their studies. We have 255 TVET learners that were placed in Provincial Departments funded by the SERVICES SETA and PSETA to the cost of R14.6 million. In terms of learnerships and apprenticeships in the fields of Manufacturing, engineering and construction in trades such as Electricians, Fitter Machinist, Diesel Fitters, Millwrights, Fitters and Turners, Petrol Mechanics, Diesel Mechanics, Spray Painters, Auto Body Repairers, Tool, Jig and Die Makers, Boilermakers and Welders, Bricklaying, Carpentry, Plumbing and Painting - we are supporting 680 learners to the cost of R61 million. We are thankful to the National Skills Fund and MERSETA for their financial support. We are also thankful to the 35 private sector companies who are accommodating 200 of our apprentices. Municipal Infrastructure Support Agency in partnership with the KZN Academy in the Office of the Premier, we recruited and placed 86 young learners from TVET Colleges in 8 municipalities to gain workplace experience in technical skills for them to do their experiential learning, obtain their qualifications, undergo trade test and become qualified artisans. This was funded directly by MISA. These projects sees this Government supporting 2642 youth at a cost of R 172 million on Strategic Skills Development Projects. On making the Public Service a Career of Choice, we successfully hosted a Public Service Careers Exhibition wherein 4 500 in- and-out school youth from Ugu, Umgungundhlovu and Harry Gwala were exposed to scarce and critical skills as well as career opportunities in the Public Service. We will soon be launching a second project that will accommodate 100 apprentices and 850 unemployed youth on short technical skills programmes in manufacturing and engineering. The total cost of the project will be R22 million funded by the MERSETA. Part of the 850 young people will be drawn from the 5 Municipalities with the highest level of poverty being targeted by the Skills Pillar in the Poverty Eradication Master Plan. Our Youth Chief Directorate has ensured that government is responding to the challenges facing needy students through proper co-ordination of bursary program. To date, about R 316 million has been committed by different provincial government departments this year for needy students across the province. 5467 students have benefited from bursaries awarded by provincial departments and municipalities in 2016. We have through our engagement with NSFAS, been advised that we have 15 636 Government employees in KZN who studied through NSFAS and still owing. This means that from this Province, NFSAS is owed R400 million. The Office of the Premier will lead efforts of mobilising those civil servants owing to payback the money. During the 2015 State of the Province Address, we reported about the prospects of Project Sukuma which is a joint training initiative between the KZN Department of Health, South African Military Health Services, KZN Department of Education and the Office of the Premier, to train our Youth to serve in the emergency medical service including maritime, medical, diving and rescue service within our Province. We are pleased to report that the first intake of project Sukuma has started with their training at the Lephalale in Limpopo Province on the 11th December 2015, they will be trained for the military driving and maintenance course. Negotiations are in advance stage with Transnet to transfer two buildings at Mayors in Pietermaritzburg to host this program. Environmental sustainability Honourable Members, we continue to push on goal of ensuring that development is sustainable, that global greenhouse gas emissions are reduced and that social-ecological capacity is created to be able to adapt to climate change. In this regard, we are mindful that climate change impacts have wreaked havoc in this current year with excessive drought levels being experienced. As we had committed in the previous SOPA to develop a Climate Change Response Measure, we are pleased that two sector adaptation plans out of the five targeted for 2019, have been completed. We have made progress by setting up of the District climate change committees and development of Adaptation strategy framework document. In December 2015, we participated at the COP 21 in Paris with an objective of developing beneficial bilateral relations with countries from the developed world. Our objective is to build relations that will facilitate financial as well as knowledge support. Our focus in 2016/17 will be on completing the Carbon Footprint to ensure that there is tracking and reduction of carbon emissions as enjoined by the COP 21 resolutions, outcome 10 and our provincial growth strategy. The entity is also completing a study on investigating the harvesting of rain water to improve water provisioning at protected area levels and reduce utility costs. Acknowledging the role of ecological infrastructure/natural resources towards mitigating the excessive impact of climate change (i.e. drought, major flood leading to loss of human life, etc), we intend to develop a flagship programme on coordinating provincial efforts towards building a climate change resilient province. We will place more efforts on awareness, research, and programme implementation that is geared towards investment in critical ecological infrastructure to support the growing economy. The result of this significant initiative will also contribute towards securing water resource areas, improving the management of catchment areas to prevent excessive soil erosion towards dams. A Provincial Indaba is planned for 2016 to establish the extent of gullying and soil erosion in the midst of drought that is engulfing the Province. Further to this Indaba, at the COP21 Climate Change negotiations in Paris, we undertook to host the Climate Change Summit on Africa in Durban later in the year. KZN A CARING PROVINCE Madam Speaker, as a caring government we are making progress in addressing the plight and advancing the rights of widows in this province. We have approached the national government to look into the impact of taxation, inheritance and the administration of deceased estates on the lives of widows. We have come to realise that the South African system of taxation does not appear to be gender neutral, but in many cases, results in prejudice and hardship. It is apparent that urgent policy and legislative interventions are required. These measures fall within the functional area of exclusive national competence and must be addressed by the national sphere of government. We have, therefore, requested the Minister of Finance to consider appropriate interventions in the short term to ensure that the obligation of gender mainstreaming be extended to the tax regime of our country and that the immediate prejudice and hardship is mitigated. In the longer term, an in-depth gender analysis and reform of tax legislation must be undertaken. To this end, we respectfully request that the South African Law Reform Commission be tasked with undertaking research with a view to the ultimate reform of South African tax and related legislation. The envisaged brief of the South African Law Reform Commission may extend beyond the terms of reference of the Davis Commission on Tax Reform. In the interim, we have made the following suggestions to the Minister of Finance for his consideration - the possible implementation of a special rebate under section 6 of the Income Tax Act which could alleviate the tax burden of a household with a single earning widow (or widower) as the sole breadwinner of that household (in respect of insurance policies deemed to be property in the estate of a deceased spouse and subject to estate duty); the possible extension or widening of the exemptions under section 3(3) of the Estate Duty Act either in the form of increasing the deductions or widening the exemption do not only include marriages registered under ante nuptial contract (so as not to discriminate against customary marriages); and the possible reduction in the overall VAT rate or, at least, the zero rating of basic foodstuffs could, possibly, be extended to include baby formula and also clothing for babies and children. We are positive that the national government will look into this matter and provide a long lasting solution. We have also brought to the fore the plight of the elderly who had illegal deductions from their pension grants. This matter is receiving further attention as it is apparent that its prevalence is not only confined to our Province. Commitment to partnership Madam Speaker, over the past 21 years of our democracy this province has developed a positive image in the eyes of potential trade partners and international investors. We attribute this to the good leadership in politics, government and the private sector. We are indeed grateful for the support that has been extended to the executive council since the beginning of this term office. Building a winning province is the responsibility of all of us. Therefore, we must cooperate with one another today and tomorrow. The health of a nation is measured by the extent to which government creates synergies and partnerships. We are committed as the provincial government to strengthening co-operation with leadership of this province across all sectors of society. We undertake to act in concert with a number of other bodies in the communities, that is, mayors, councillors, traditional leaders, izinduna, and religious leaders, etc. These structures must be mobilized to create an environment that will provide for the development of the entire community - which is a crucial tool which can eliminate any form of social instability. And indeed, if we are able to create this environment, we will be able to promote the respect of human lives and the respect of individual property. Community involvement means that anybody's life is as important as your own. This culture promotes love, a sense of belonging, generosity, caring and compassion. It creates an environment where anybody's property is safe under anybody's watch. That is really what we wanted freedom to bring along - not the rampant and violent criminality that we are experiencing. Therefore we must stand up and say our road towards freedom cannot be complete until we stand together and eradicate crime. We are continuously looking for strengthening our relationship with our social partners. KZN Growth Coalition convened and sponsored a workshop on from the 9th to the 10th February 2016. We also appreciate the work done by our Provincial Planning Commission and the various Councils that we have established to advise us and to harness our relationship, such as the HIV/AIDS Council, the HRD Council, the Climate Change Council, the BBBEE Council, to name but a few, are functional. Sports and Recreation On a very exciting note, KZN continues to be a preferred destination of international sporting events. The announcement that KZN and Durban in particular will host the 2022 Commonwealth presents this province with endless possibilities. At this stage, I want to congratulate all participants in the Dusi Canoe Marathon. This is an enduring and exciting canoe marathon which has grown in leaps and bounds. I want to single out the following participants:- Andy Brackett Lance Kieme 2nd Position Hank McGregor Jasper Mocke 3rd Position SboneloKhwela BanetseNkhoesa 4th Position Shaun Reunstein ThulaniMbanjwa Conclusion Madam Speaker, I want pay tribute to His Majesty. We appreciate your guidance and your message during the Opening of the Legislature that was loud and clear. We wish to announce that on the 3rd March 2016 we will release reports of investigations commissioned by the provincial government. The first report is on social cohesion and the second report is on xenophobia. The reference group on migration was led by Judge N. Pillay. We also undertake to present the two reports during the Peace Process Dialogue announced by His Majesty during the opening of the Legislature. As I draw towards conclusion, may I take a moment to pay tribute to the leadership of the governing party, the African National Congress. Since 1912, the ANC has given responsibilities to many of its volunteers who have without fail acted as agents of change. As I pledge to work tirelessly to improve the lives of our people and build a better future together, I undertake to ensure that the struggle of the forebears of our democracy is not in vain. To the entirety of our civil service, let us serve with an increased sense of urgency and show compassion to the vulnerable members of our society. Let us draw lessons from the words of Charles Darwin, a Naturalist in one of his books where he says: If the misery of the poor be caused not by the laws of nature, but by our institutions, great is our sin. 2016 is a year of historic anniversaries for our nation at large. We celebrate with great pride the 200th anniversary of King ShakakaSenzangakona's accession to the throne in 1816. ILembe set in motion a chain of events that was to create both a formidable state and a proud nation. Two hundred years later, we as his political heirs can proudly say that the Zulu nation is an integral part of the wider and diverse South African people - a people at peace with itself and the world. We must mark these celebrations with pride spurning any prospect of narrow ethnic or nationalistic sentiment. All people of South Africa must feel comfortable with collectively celebrating this emotional milestone anniversary. We must prize our social cohesion and unity above all other sentiment. We also acknowledge the great act of resistance to colonial oppression led by InkosiBambatha, 110 years ago this year. The heroes of that epic struggle must forever be etched in our consciousness. You will recall that our founding president, Madiba, was always at great pains to express gratitude for international solidarity in the struggle against colonialism and apartheid. This year is 100 years since the great Irish resistance to colonial rule in the form of the Easter Rising. We remain grateful to our Irish sisters and brothers in arms for their tireless solidarity. It was the same year that the iconic University of Fort Hare was established as one of our continent's greatest institutions. Those hallowed portals educated Madiba, Sir SeretseMaphiriKhama, uMntwanawakwaPhindangene, Robert Mugabe, Gertrude Ntlabathi, Professors Herby Govinden and KrishBharuthram as well as a host of others who have played an important role in the political and scientific advancement of our continent. We remember too with considerable bitterness the 1936 Natives Land Act, which 80 years ago further compounded the material deprivation and land dispossession of the African people. The land and housing challenges we experience today are a direct result of that and earlier legislation. Ten years later in 1946 our progressive compatriots of Indian origin undertook the Passive Resistance Campaign to wage civil disobedience against legal measures to deprive them of property and occupation rights. The actions taken against the Indian community was a forerunner of the notorious Group Areas Act of 1950. Among the activists in that 1946 campaign was Comrade Kay Moonsamy who was imprisoned for defying the unjust laws. Not to be outdone, Cde Kay was among our 156 leaders charged in the 1956 Treason Trial along with Inkosi Albert Luthuli, LilianNgoyi, Alex la Guma, Ruth First and Helen Joseph. After his arrest again in the early 1960s he was instructed to leave the country and worked for almost three decades in the ranks of the African National Congress in exile. He celebrates his 90th birthday later this year. To use an old Jewish prayer, we wish him good health and long life. We should also not forgot the workers who rose in revolt in the great 1946 African Mineworkers Strike. So too we must remember the gallantry of our nation's women from all backgrounds who marched to the Union Buildings in 1956. They changed the course of history declaring for posterity, "You strike a woman, you strike a rock." Malibongwe! Forty years ago our children rose in revolt in Soweto. Their brave acts of defiance found a resonance among the youth in other places like Langa, Lamontville and Chatsworth. My colleague in the Executive Council, Cde Ravi Pillay hails from that generation of activists of the Black Consciousness Movement who in 1976 ensured that the University of Durban-Westville became a site of struggle. The Soweto Uprising was a watershed in our history heralding the eventual defeat of apartheid. How else could we celebrate two decades since our remarkable democratic Constitution was adopted in 1996? It's been a long road bringing us to where we are today. I wish to thank all the people of KwaZulu-Natal for their support and for listening to this address, which I hope will stimulate discussion about what each citizen will do to help us build a better future together. A special word of gratitude goes to the Members of the Executive Council and their Heads of Department for the work they have done planning for the year ahead and their support since we assumed office. I appreciate the dedication of the Acting Director General MrFrikkie Brooks and all categories of staff in the Office of the Premier and KZN government. For their unwavering support and being the pillar of strength I wish to thank my wife Thembeka, my kids and the rest of the family. Lastly but not least, I want to pay a tribute to His Majesty HlangaLomhlabathi. Bayede!! I thank you all. \</doc>

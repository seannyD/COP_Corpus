The following information was released by the United Nations Human Settlements Programme: COP21 , the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference will be held in Paris from November 30 to December 11. The conference objective is to achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate change. COP-21 , as the conference is frequently referred to, stands for the 21st Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The international political response to climate change began at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, where the 'Rio Convention' included the adoption of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This convention sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to avoid "dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system." The UNFCCC, which entered into force on 21 March 1994, now has a near-universal membership of 195 parties. Parties are the member states that ratified the convention, making it the leading international negotiation mechanism on climate change. The main objective of the annual Conference of Parties (COP) is to review the Convention's implementation. The first COP took place in Berlin in 1995 and significant meetings since then have included COP3 (in Kyoto, Japan) where the Kyoto Protocol was adopted, or COP17 in Durban where the Green Climate Fund (GCF) was created. UN-Habitat is an observer organization to the UNFCCC, and member states, the UNFCCC secretariat and other observers have frequently asked UN-Habitat to provide inputs and recommendations on urban climate change issues. \</doc>

The following information was released by the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia: Today I will travel to Paris for the 21st Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). I will lead Australia's delegation and will work with my ministerial counterparts to deliver a strong and effective global climate change agreement. Our priority is to deliver an agreement where all countries set and regularly review emission reduction targets. The agreement should also ensure countries accurately report on their emissions and progress towards targets. At the conference I will outline Australia's commitment to climate action at home and in our region, including our responsible and achievable target to reduce emissions by 2628 per cent by 2030. I will also highlight measures Australia is taking to support the uptake of new technologies and to improve energy efficiency, and our support for developing countries, particularly in the Pacific, to build resilience to climate-related events. I will address the opening of the COP21 High-Level Segment, the High-Level Assembly of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition and a Carbon Market Institute event. These events will highlight the world-leading efforts of the Australian Government and businesses to reduce emissions and deliver new and improved technologies. \</doc>

The following information was released by New Mexico Senator Tom Udall: U.S. Senator Tom Udall is participating in a two-day congressional delegation to the United Nations conference on climate change in Paris. Udall, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee, will meet with U.S. and international negotiators and others gathered for the 21st annual Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) on the U.N. Convention on Climate Change. Delegates from more than 190 countries are seeking an international agreement to reduce global carbon emissions. A longtime advocate for action to prevent global warming and its serious consequences for national security and the economy, Udall will discuss his work on the Appropriations and Foreign Relations committees to prevent efforts in Congress to roll back U.S. commitments to reduce the carbon pollution that contributes to global warming. Udall will discuss the global warming impacts the United States is already experiencing -- particularly in New Mexico -- including rising temperatures and increasingly severe drought and wildfires, as well as positive steps the states and the administration are taking to drive the global effort to fight climate change. "Americans want action to prevent climate change, and New Mexico is a great example of how we're taking that action. New Mexico has every kind of energy resource, and we've embraced efforts to diversify and reduce carbon emissions. We're hitting our renewable energy goals and our efforts are boosting the economy, building new opportunities and creating well-paying clean energy jobs," Udall said. "But we have to keep it up. America's leadership in reducing carbon pollution is crucial - the United States must drive progress across the world. As a member of key Foreign Relations and Appropriations subcommittees, I will be helping lead the charge in Congress to keep the U.S. climate goals on track. We will stop efforts that would turn back progress on global warming." \</doc>

Six attendees of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris - where 195 nations negotiated a historic climate change agreement - shared their perspectives on the conference at a forum Wednesday night at Tompkins County Public Library. The library was packed with engaged townspeople and students with many questions about the conference, commonly referred to as COP21 . The represented nations agreed that any temperature rise above 1.5 degrees Celsius will cause serious harm to the planet and said society must aim to limit this increase, according to Prof. Bob Howarth, ecology and evolutionary biology, a conference attendee. "In terms of where we are, that is a very, very aggressive target, but it is what the scientific community and the island nations of the world were asking for, what we need if we are going to protect the planet," Howarth said. The summit's atmosphere was very positive and cooperative, according to public health biologist Sarah Steingraber. "[The mood] was urgent, it was determined, and it was in good faith," Steingraber said. "I don't think it was in any sense cynical, though there were certainly forces at work trying to undermine and neutralize the treaty at every turn." Steingraber said her opinion of the treaty was generally favorable, expressing her confidence in the agreement's structure. "There are good bones, the science is sound,"?Steingraber said. "There are pledges in place for almost every nation and there is a ratchet mechanism in place to make the pledges more significant over time." Prof. Johannes Lehmann, soil science, agreed, expressing his belief that the treaty was a step in the right direction. "There was a lot of trepidation ... that we would end up with no hope,"?Lehmann said. "It turned out to be very different this time, and you could feel it." Lehmann also called the attending the summit a "really a huge opportunity." "From my perspective as a scientist ... this is as close to political decision-making as you can get," said Lehmann. Prof. Karen Pinkus, romance studies added that the conference was interesting from a language perspective. "It was fascinating to sit in on the negotiations where it would be a discussion ... talking about syllables, comma placement, very precise terminology," Pinkus said. "There is an incredible amount at stake in this." Other panelists attended COP21 as members of activist groups, according to Colleen Boland, a conference attendee and a founding member of We are Seneca Lake - a group campaigning to stop a company from fracking near Seneca Lake. "Advocacy groups of all kinds ... had gathered outside the official summit, to bear witness, exert pressure, change the media narrative and otherwise appeal to the better angels of those who were inside negotiating on behalf of the citizenry of the entire planet," Boland said. Pinkus, however, said she did not feel as hopeful as Lehmann did about the agreement's prospects. "We forget that we are a very small segment of the population in a very small part of the world, and we matter very little when we think about the enormous capital and investments and infrastructure of the big carbon monoxide institutions that we're up against," Pinkus said. \</doc>

The American Institute of Architects issued the following news release: The American Institute of Architects (AIA) today issued the following statement as leaders of nearly 200 nations converge in Paris for COP21 , formerly known as the United Nations Climate Change Conference . Please attribute the statement to AIA President Elizabeth Chu Richter, FAIA: "When our board adopted our position statement on resilience in 2014, we saw this as a call to action for architects to address issues of climate adaptation in their practice. Architects welcome the COP21 talks as a way to make sure that the role buildings play in sustainability is forefront in the delegations' minds. "Residential and commercial buildings account for almost 40 percent of both total U.S. energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Meanwhile more and more architects globally are making the commitment to design sustainable buildings, according to the AIA 2030 Commitment report, a voluntary initiative by architect firms to commit their practice to advancing the AIA's goal of carbon-neutral buildings by the year 2030." "Unfortunately, just as COP21 commences, the U.S. House of Representatives may vote as early as this week to abolish energy conservation requirements for new and existing federal buildings. These requirements have kept the United States in a leadership position when it comes to achieving carbon neutrality goals in buildings by 2030. "As we have said before - and will say again - the AIA stands ready to support legislation that keeps energy conservation goals for the federal government and positions the United States as a leader globally in conserving resources. But we will continue to oppose legislation that only encourages use of fossil fuels at great cost to the environment."

United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) issued the following news: Environmentalists, government and NGO officials gathered in Bogota, Colombia between 20 and 23 September for the Latin American summit, as part of preparations for the UN Conference on Climate Change ( COP21 ) in Paris in December this year. UN-Habitat took part in the summit. Beyond advocating immediate action and the empowerment of non-state actors, the summit paved the way for the adoption, during COP21 in Paris, of an ambitious and exhaustive global agreement on climate change. The focus was placed on the development of a new global climate agenda that also includes the participation of citizens, civil society groups, the private sector and local governments. It also pressed for pro-climate commitments at national and international levels, as well as the presentation of a strong and concerted message at the COP21 . "Most of the vital economic and social infrastructure, government facilities and assets are located in cities. When disaster strikes, these are at risk of collapse. Cities need to fully accept the inevitable effects of climate change and adapt, while, at the same time, curb and mitigate the causes of climate change," said Elkin Velasquez, UN-Habitat's regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean. The summit also addressed the articulation of climate change, resilience, risk reduction and water in regards to sustainable urban development. These considerations were organized in four themes: Cities and the new global climate agreement; Inclusive cities, resilient cities; Climate change and cultural change; and Climate Finance. UN-Habitat is currently active in 20 countries implementing climate change related programmes. Projects range from assistance to local authorities to improve systems aimed at climate proofing urban infrastructure to ensuring that climate change adaptation becomes a key component of infrastructure design and urban planning.

LE BOURGET, France  Talks on a global pact to fight global warming appeared to make progress late Friday, with some negotiators telling The Associated Press a deal was close. Negotiators emerged from meetings with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, the host of the talks, amid an air of optimism that had been lacking just hours earlier. Fabius was expected to present a new, potentially final draft of the elusive accord Saturday morning. "We are pretty much there," Egyptian Environment Minister Khaled Fahmy, the chairman of a bloc of African countries, told the AP late Friday. "There have been tremendous developments in the last hours. We are very close." A negotiator from a developed country was equally positive. "I think we got it," said the negotiator, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Negotiators from more than 190 countries in Paris are aiming to create something that's never been done before: an agreement for all countries to reduce man-made emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases and help the poorest adapt to rising seas, fiercer weather and other impacts of global warming. This accord is the first time all countries are expected to pitch in - the previous emissions treaty, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, only included rich countries. The talks, originally scheduled to end Friday, dragged into an extra day as the French hosts said they needed more time to overcome disputes. A French official expressed confidence that the draft to be presented Saturday would be the final one. The official was not authorized to speak publicly because the negotiations were ongoing. Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga of the Pacific island nation of Tuvalu was also upbeat. "The signals that have come to me give me encouragement that we are going to have a very ... comprehensive and strong agreement in Paris," Sopoaga told the AP. Liu Zhenmin, deputy chief of the Chinese delegation, was more cautious. Asked by the AP whether the draft would be the final one, he said only if "it's more or less acceptable." Earlier Friday, Liu stood firm on his nation's demand that rich countries should assume most responsibility for the costs and argued against an agreement that sets too-tough goals for weaning the world off using oil, gas and coal - the biggest source of carbon emissions. The U.S. and European countries want to move away from so-called "differentiation" among economies and want big emerging countries such as China and India to pitch in more in a final climate deal. Liu told reporters that that issue is "at the core of our concern for the Paris agreement." He said he wants different rules for different countries "clearly stipulated" in the global warming pact. China is among the more than 180 countries that have submitted emissions targets for the new pact but is resisting Western proposals for robust transparency rules that would require each country to show whether it's on track to meet its target. Liu also argued against sharply limiting the number of degrees the planet warms this century because that would involve huge lifestyle and economic changes. "We need heating. We need air conditioning. You need to drive your car," he said. Indian Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar also said differentiation was the biggest dispute and accused developed countries of not showing enough flexibility in the talks. However, signs of divisions among major developing countries surfaced Friday as Brazil joined an informal coalition of Western countries and some developing ones in a "high-ambition coalition" that is calling for a strong deal. Liu dismissed the coalition as a "performance." The talks are the culmination of years of U.N.-led efforts to create a long-term climate deal. U.N. climate conferences often run past their deadlines, given the complexity and sensitivity of each word in an international agreement and the consequences for national economies. Analysts said the delay until Saturday was not necessarily a bad sign. "This needs consensus," said Michael Jacobs, an economist with the New Climate Economy project, speaking to reporters. "There's a lot of negotiating to do." A 27-page draft released Thursday said governments would aim to peak the emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases "as soon as possible" and strive to reach "emissions neutrality" by the second half of the century - a vague term generally understood to mean no more emissions than the Earth can naturally absorb. That was weaker language than in previous drafts, which included more specific emissions cuts and timeframes. China's Liu said negotiators don't understand what is meant by "neutrality" and argued for an even softer "low-carbon" goal. The draft didn't resolve how to deal with demands from vulnerable countries to deal with unavoidable damage from rising seas and other climate impacts. One option said such losses would be addressed in a way that doesn't involve liability and compensation - a U.S. demand. Fabius said the world would not find a better moment to reach a global climate deal. "All the conditions are met to reach a universal, ambitious agreement," he said. \</doc>

The following information was released by the Scottish Government: First Minister hails 'historic' UN climate change agreement. Following the outcome of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 The agreement sets a new international context for nations' use of fossil fuels and action on climate change, including limiting global temperature rise to well below two degrees Celsius and pursuing efforts to limit the rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Nicola Sturgeon said: " COP21 has, as we had hoped, achieved a big step forward in the international fight against climate change. "This historic agreement sends a signal of certainty about the global economy's low carbon future, in the same way as we did for Scotland through our world-leading climate legislation in 2009. We want to avoid the worst impacts of climate change falling on the poor and vulnerable. "Now that the talking is over, what's important is that the rhetoric is backed up by meaningful action not least in the crucial area of energy policy where we need the UK to assist Scotland's drive to develop renewables and Carbon Capture and Storage, not stymie it as they have done this year. "Devolved administrations, like the Scottish Government, will be strong drivers of a progressive climate agenda. We look forward to working with our international partners to secure the successful implementation of the Paris agreement." Notes to editors Notes to editors Scotland's First Minster and Climate Change Minister Aileen McLeod represented Scotland at the COP21 Scottish Ministers promoted the strong Scottish story, which has been praised by the Head of the UN Climate Body, Christiana Figueres By 2013 Scotland had cut emissions by 38% since 1990, much more than the 31% originally envisaged, while we are now producing half our electricity demand from renewables The Scottish Government delivered the 500MW target for community and local renewables five years early with the potential for 2.2bn of income for communities and local owners over the lifetime of these projects We have met our energy target consumption seven years early with a 13% reduction, while Scotland is benefiting from 45,000 low carbon and environmental services jobs Contact information \</doc>

The following information was released by American University: WHO: American University experts COP21 ) WHEN: December 7 - ongoing WHERE: Instudio, on campus, via email or via telephone Background: American University faculty and students join Heads of State this week in Paris for the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Conference leaders will try to reach a global agreement to reduce carbon emissions and keep global warming below 2C. Two American University professors are attending the conference, which runs through Dec. 11. School of International Service professor Paul Wapner is attending COP21 to conduct research on the negotiations. He will be tracking negotiations about "loss and damage" how developed countries will respond to the climate change hardships experienced by developing countries. School of Public Affairs professor Todd Eisenstadt, who has a National Science Foundation grant regarding climate change in Latin America, is also attending and blogging from COP21 . COP21 . The group is primarily attending adjacent events in the Climate Generations area of Le Bourget conference complex and writing posts for AU WCL's Sustainable Development Law andPolicy blog: HYPERLINK https://wclsdlp.wordpress.com/ https://wclsdlp.wordpress.com/ COP21 COP21 is focusing on. Climate Justice, Policy, Hardships and Adaptation Experts: Paul Wapner is an expert on global environmental politics, environmental thought, transnational environmental activism, and environmental ethics. He is currently editing a book, "Reimagining Climate Change," and continues to lead workshops for professors that explore contemplative practices and environmental engagement. Wapner is also the author of "Living through the End of Nature: The Future of American Environmentalism," (MIT Press) and co-editor (with Simon Nicholson) of "Global Environmental Politics: From Person to Planet" (Paradigm Press). He can discuss climate suffering, adaptation, and climate justice. Wapner says: "Paris will not be an answer to climate change but a crucial pivot for turning toward a post carbon world. Paris needs to build global solidarity for climate protection and then direct such concern into meaningful policies. Final agreements will be simply a down payment on the hard work ahead. But, make no mistake, that work can only be done if state officials, corporate actors, and civil society groups demonstrate genuine leadership in Paris. They must unite behind an uncompromising vision to reduce and then stop the use of fossil fuels and build a more just global society. The city of light offers a chance to light up the world with clean energy and social compassion." Todd Eisenstadt's research focuses on the intersection of formal institutions and laws with informal institutions and practices, mostly in democratizing countries in Latin America. While in Paris at COP21 , Eisenstadt will produce a daily blog about this international climate change discussion that can be viewed here. He teaches in the government department and is presently a Principal Investigator of the National Science Foundation (NSF) project, "Lawsuits for the Pacha Mama [Mother Earth] in Ecuador: Explaining the Determinants of New Indigenous Movements to Mitigate Environmental Impacts." He can discuss the relationship between constitution-making processes and democratization across scores of nations. Eisenstadt says, "The optimism of people going in to the Paris meeting has been of hope, but also wishful thinking. A better chance for an agreement would be between the world's top six emitters. If they are able to come to an agreement, that would cover about 60 percent of the world's emissions. The top two, the U.S. and China, started this process via a voluntary, unilateral agreement they signed last year. They will reach an agreement, but it will, as they have every year over two decades, fall woefully short of what is needed and what the top six emitters can do, or even the top three emitters. There is also a vital role for the private sector and for technological innovation." Dan Fiorino is the director of the Center for Environmental Policy and executive-in-residence in the School of Public Affairs. He teaches courses on environmental policy, energy and climate change, environmental sustainability, and public management in the public administration and policy department. Fiorino had a career at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency before joining AU. He can discuss environmental policy. Fiorino says: "With our work at American University, we're trying to identify the sweet spots, the potential for positive outcomes and how you design energy, environmental and economic policy. It's not necessarily a tradeoff, despite what the critics say that you can really get some economic health and other kinds of benefits from clean energy." Kenneth Conca, professor in the School of International Service, is also a member of the United Nations Environment Programme's Expert Advisory Group on Conflict and Peacebuilding. His research and teaching focus on global environmental governance, environmental peacebuilding in war-torn societies, environmental politics and policy in the United Nations system, water governance, and environmental policy analysis. His latest book is "An Unfinished Foundation: The United Nations and Global Environmental Governance" (Oxford University Press, 2015). Conca says: "The UN must make full use of all of its powers under the UN Charter. When the right to clean water and air become a human rights issue, the UN can deploy its most powerful tools for accountability." Golub says: "Uncertainty over the future of climate policy may cost billions dollars in forgone revenues and stranded assets. Policy uncertainty increases cost of capital and discourages investments. Inability of politicians to agree on climate change sends misleading signals to business and delays an inevitable decarbonization of the U.S. and global economy." Malini Ranganathan, assistant professor in the School of International Service, is a critical geographer with a special interest in postcolonial cities. Ranganathan is concerned broadly with the political economy of the urban environment and sits at the intersection of urban geography, urban studies, and development studies. Most of her research to date has focused on water and land governance in Bangalore/Bengaluru in India. Her historic and ethnographic research here argues that new water pricing policy is central to struggles over the right to tenure security and urban belonging given widespread urban informality. She can discuss the political economy of the urban environment and the critical need for climate justice between cities and countries. Ranganathan says: "We need climate justice not just between countries but also within our cities. While the responsibility for the climate crisis sits overwhelmingly on developed countries, developing countries like India cannot afford to divorce development from sustainability." Global Environmental Governance/Climate Engineering Expert: Simon Nicholson, assistant professor of International Relations, is the director of the Global Environmental Politics program in the School of International Service and. His work focuses on global environmental governance, global food politics, and the politics of emerging technologies, including climate engineering (or "geoengineering") technologies. He also co-director of the Forum for Climate Engineering Assessment initiative at AU. He can discuss global environment governance and geoengineering. Nicholson says: "One thing that won't be talked about much in Paris is climate engineering or "geoengineering" -- basically, large-scale technological responses to climate change. Yet the bulk of the computer models negotiators are relying on as they search for pathways to limit global warming already have climate engineering built into them. An unspoken assumption is that technologies will be invented that will draw large amounts of carbon out of the atmosphere. We need a more open and honest conversation about the options for tackling climate change, including a conversation about currently unpalatable technological schemes." Climate Change Conference Coverage Risk Factors Expert: Scott Talan, professor of public andstrategic communication, is an expert in social media, digital media, new media, personal branding and multimedia. He has been a writer, producer, and reporter for numerous media organizations, including ABC News/Good Morning America. Talan can discuss the risks associated with the large amount of media coverage COP21 has produced that covers the talks and promises made between leaders without including concrete plans for action. Talan believes the public can become skeptical and further disenchanted with the lack of progress as a result of the summit. However, he is also able to talk about the progress made by non-state actors such as NGO's and WWF companies like Coca-Cola. Talan says: "Looking back these type of global climate summits such as the UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro gathering in the early 1990s, then the Kyoto Protocol five years later, and more recently the Copenhagen Summit in 2009, leads some to conclude 'it's all hot air' and no concrete steps are being taken. If there were accomplishments why is there another global gathering? It is a tough challenge for leaders to finesse in terms of meeting and talking, but also taking action as well." Sustainability Experts: Megan Litke, is Director of Sustainability Programs and oversees all sustainability related initiatives, including efforts to achieve carbon neutrality by 2020 and sustainability outreach and education efforts. Litke can discuss higher education sustainability trends and priorities. Litke says: "Seeing the international community come together to reach an agreement at the global level is inspiring and exciting, and could eliminate some of the barriers we face at individual institutions in creating change." Richard Linowes, Director of Sustainability Management Program and Assistant Professor of Management, teaches strategy, global leadership, entrepreneurship, cross-cultural management and sustainability. Linowes studies how companies adjust themselves to operate internationally. He examines the strategic vigilance required for international business and focuses on how multinational companies adjust to cultures around the world. Linowes says, "The gathering of nations in Paris has two vital aspects that build confidence that humanity may face the crisis brought on by climate change: nations are pledging goals for reducing greenhouse gases, and countries and cities are sharing their innovations and achievements in dealing with the world's changing conditions and resource limits. Whether it is the Dutch teaching others about holding back rising sea levels, or Japanese discussing how Tokyo accepted 82-degree office buildings to cut electricity use, or Perth Australia explaining how they became drought-proof by storing underground water produced by water desalination plants, or Washington, D.C. obtaining electric power via wind farms, countries are learning from each other about how to adjust to our changing planet." American University is a leader in global education, enrolling a diverse student body from throughout the United States and nearly 140 countries. Located in Washington, D.C., the university provides opportunities for academic excellence, public service, and internships in the nation's capital and around the world. \</doc>

Dec 22, 2015( EPA Connect: http://blog.epa.gov/epaconnect http://blog.epa.gov/epaconnect / Delivered by Newstex) By Ann Hunter-Pirtle Last weekend in Paris, negotiators from nearly 200 countries reached a historic, universal climate agreement that had eluded the global community for two decades. I was proud to be at COP-21 helping communicate EPA and U.S. efforts on climate action at the U.S. Center, the State Department's public diplomacy space at the COP. I had the opportunity to meet attendees from around the world and to hear about global efforts to combat climate change so I wanted to share a few thoughts from the conference. The most striking thing about the COP was its size. Forty thousand attendees came from around the world educators, students, government officials, and non-profit and private sector leaders so it was held at Le Bourget, best known as the airplane hangar for the Paris air show. The U.S. Center was one of the many pavilions where visitors could learn more during COP21 . Play Video[1]This short video gives a sense of the scale of the COP21 venue at Le Bourget, outside Paris, France. \~ HYPERLINK http://blog.epa.gov/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1-US-Center.gif http://blog.epa.gov/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1-US-Center.gif The U.S. Center COP21 during an event at Le Bourget, outside Paris, France. In the spirit of the event, conference organizers went all-in on sustainability with an extensive biodegradables and recycling program. Participants could return reusable plastic coffee cups for a 1 Euro deposit, and the cups quickly became as good as currency. Participants were spotted scooping up coffee cups from empty tables and desks, returning several at a time. HYPERLINK http://blog.epa.gov/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2-Coffee1.gif http://blog.epa.gov/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2-Coffee1.gif Reusable coffee cup with the COP21 logo from United Nations Climate Change Conference in Le Bourget, outside Paris, France. Something I didn't fully appreciate before arriving in Paris was that the COP is a consensus process so for the negotiations to succeed, all 195 countries had to be in favor of a deal. So the Paris Agreement reflects the threat climate change poses to every nation on Earth, as well as the global community's determination to do something about it. The Paris Agreement is ambitious, universal, and durable. Before the negotiations even began, 180 countries, representing more than 95 percent of the climate pollution on Earth, put forward individual pledges to cut carbon pollution. The Paris Agreement was built from country-level plans, and it states that countries will limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius on average and make efforts to keep it under 1.5 degrees Celsius levels science tells us will help avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. The agreement calls for transparent reporting and accountability about how nations keep track of carbon emissions. It creates a mechanism for countries to come back to the table every 5 years with increasingly ambitious national carbon pollution reduction pledges, and it includes provisions for financing to developing countries to help them grow their economies with clean energy. American leadership paved the way for global action. Secretary Kerry spoke in the second week about the need to seize the moment for an ambitious, universal climate agreement, and how U.S. efforts have led the way. EPA's Clean Power Plan is a centerpiece of U.S. climate efforts, and Administrator McCarthy spoke at the U.S. Center about why she's confident the rule is built to last. \~ HYPERLINK http://blog.epa.gov/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kerry1.gif http://blog.epa.gov/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kerry1.gif Secretary of State John Kerry speaks at COP21 about the need for countries to seize the opportunity for an ambitious, lasting climate agreement. \~ http://blog.epa.gov/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/4-Admin.-McCarthy1.gif http://blog.epa.gov/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/4-Admin.-McCarthy1.gif EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy speaks at the U.S. Center about why the Clean Power Plan will stand the test of time. American businesses are also leading the way. On the first day of the COP after President Obama and other world leaders spoke, Bill Gates and other business leaders launched 'Mission Innovation' to develop the next generation of clean technologies. Meanwhile, 154 of the largest U.S. companies including WalMart, AT...Coca-Cola, and Facebook, representing 11 million jobs and more than 7 trillion dollars in market capitalization, signed the White House American Business Act on Climate Pledge. Major companies know that climate impacts increase their financial risk, while climate action represents an unprecedented economic opportunity. That is the real triumph of the Paris Agreement: it sends a global market signal that a low-carbon future is inevitable, and climate-smart investments are not only the right thing to do, but the profitable thing to do. Despite the size of the COP, climate change is personal. So it was powerful to hear from the following two local leaders at a U.S. Center side event hosted by Interior Secretary Sally Jewell. Councilwoman Maija Lukin of Kotzebue, Alaska, and Alson Kelen of the Marshall Islands each explained that climate change threatens their communities' existence today. Homes in Kotzebue are slowly sinking into the sea as the permafrost underneath thaws and the sea level rises. Traditional food sources caribou, seals, berries are disappearing. And thinning ice has made travel dangerous Councilwoman Lukin lost 2 uncles when they fell through thin ice while traveling to the next town, which doesn't have a road. In the Marshall Islands, rising sea levels mean just about every time it rains, garbage and sewage wash through communities, making people sick. Warming waters mean fish are disappearing. \~ HYPERLINK http://blog.epa.gov/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/5-Councilwoman-Lukin.gif http://blog.epa.gov/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/5-Councilwoman-Lukin.gif Councilwoman Maija Lukin of Kotzebue, Alaska speaks about dwindling sea ice in her region due to climate change. Climate change is threatening our health, our economy, and our national security today. But I am convinced we will meet this challenge, in part because of the incredible will it took from countries around the world to reach the Paris Agreement. Attending the COP was a tremendous opportunity and an experience I'll never forget it'll be a story for the grandkids.

Long-term goal  Keep global warming "well below" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) Still to be ratified  At least 55 countries linked to at least 55 pct. of global emissions must sign off Critics remain  Nicaragua balks, and thousands demonstrate, calling accord too weak to save planet LE BOURGET, France  About 200 nations adopted the first global pact to fight climate change on Saturday, calling on the world to collectively cut and then eliminate greenhouse gas pollution but imposing no sanctions on countries that don't. The "Paris agreement" aims to keep global temperatures from rising another degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit) between now and 2100, a key demand of poor countries ravaged by rising sea levels and other effects of climate change. Loud applause erupted in the conference hall after French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius gaveled the agreement. Some delegates wept, others embraced. "It's a victory for all of the planet and for future generations," U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said, adding that the pact will "prevent the worst most devastating consequences of climate change from ever happening." Brazilian Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira added: "Today, we've proven that it's possible for every country to come together, hand in hand, to do its part to fight climate change." In the pact, the countries pledge to limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between 2050 and 2100. In practical terms, achieving that goal means the world would have to stop emitting greenhouse gases - most of which come from the burning of oil, coal and gas for energy - altogether in the next half-century, scientists said. That's because the less we pollute, the less pollution nature absorbs. Achieving such a reduction in emissions would involve a complete transformation of how people get energy, and many activists worry that despite the pledges, countries are not ready to make such profound, costly changes. The deal now needs to be ratified by individual governments - at least 55 countries representing at least 55 percent of global emissions - before taking effect. It is the first pact to ask all countries to join the fight against global warming, representing a sea change in U.N. talks that previously required only wealthy nations to reduce their emissions. "History will remember this day," U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said. "The Paris agreement on climate change is a monumental success for the planet and its people." Speaking from Washington, President Barack Obama said the climate agreement offers "the best chance to save the one planet we have." The deal commits countries to keeping the rise in global temperatures by the year 2100 compared with pre-industrial times "well below" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and says they will "endeavor to limit" them even more, to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The world has already warmed by about 1 degree Celsius since pre-industrial times. Ben Strauss, a sea level researcher at Climate Central, said limiting warming to 1.5 degrees instead of 2 degrees could potentially cut in half the projected 280 million people whose houses will eventually be submerged by rising seas. More than 180 countries have ready presented plans to limit greenhouse gas emissions - a breakthrough in itself after years of stalemate. But those pledges are not enough to achieve the goals in the accord, meaning countries will need to cut much more to meet the goal. "We've agreed to what we ought to be doing, but no one yet has agreed to go do it," said Dennis Clare, a negotiator for the Federated States of Micronesia. "It's a whole lot of pomp, given the circumstances." It says wealthy nations should continue to provide financial support for poor nations to cope with climate change and encourages other countries to pitch in on a voluntary basis. That reflects Western attempts to expand the donor base to include advanced developing countries such as China. In a victory for small island nations, the agreement includes a section highlighting the losses they expect to incur from climate-related disasters that it's too late to adapt to. However, a footnote specifies that it "does not involve or provide any basis for any liability or compensation" - a key U.S. demand because it would let the Obama administration sign on to the deal without going through the Republican-led Senate. The adoption of the agreement was held up for nearly two hours as the United States pressed successfully to change the wording on emissions targets from saying developed countries "shall" commit to reducing emissions to they "should." Experts said that means the deal probably won't need U.S. congressional approval. OPPOSITION REMAINS Nicaragua said it would not support the pact. Its envoy, Paul Oquist, said the agreement does not go far enough to cut global warming and help the poor countries affected by it. Nicaragua is one of eight participating countries that haven't submitted emissions targets, after Venezuelan envoy Claudia Salerno said her country - which had been holding out - liked the agreement and had submitted its pledge. Thousands of protesters demonstrated across Paris, saying the accord is too weak to save the planet. Kumi Naidoo of Greenpeace said the accord is a good start but isn't enough. "Today the human race has joined in a common cause, but it's what happens after this conference that really matters," he said. "This deal alone won't dig us out the hole we're in, but it makes the sides less steep." --- KEY POINTS OF CLIMATE DEAL LONG-TERM GOAL The long-term objective of the agreement is to make sure global warming stays "well below" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and to "pursue efforts" to limit the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). To achieve that goal, governments pledged to stop the rise in heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions "as soon as possible." By some point after 2050, the agreement says, man-made emissions should be reduced to a level that forests and oceans can absorb. EMISSIONS TARGETS To reach the long-term goal, countries agreed to set national targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions every five years. More than 180 countries have already submitted targets for the first cycle beginning in 2020. Only developed countries are expected to slash their emissions in absolute terms; developing nations are "encouraged" to do so as their capabilities evolve over time. Until then, they are expected only to rein in the growth of emissions as their economies develop. REVIEWING TARGETS The initial targets won't be enough to put the world on a path to meet the long-term temperature goal. So the agreement asks governments to review their targets in the next four years and see if they can "update" them. That doesn't require governments to deepen their cuts. But the hope is that it will be possible for them to do so if renewable energy sources become more affordable and effective. TRANSPARENCY There is no penalty for countries that miss their emissions targets. But the agreement has transparency rules to encourage countries to do what they say they will do. That was one of the most difficult pieces to agree on, with China asking for softer requirements. The agreement says all countries must report on their emissions and efforts to reduce them. But it allows for some "flexibility" for developing countries that "need it." MONEY The agreement says wealthy countries should continue to offer financial support to help poor countries reduce their emissions and adapt to climate change. It also encourages other countries to pitch in on a voluntary basis. That paves the way for emerging economies such as China to contribute, even though it doesn't require them to do so. Actual dollar amounts were kept out of the agreement itself, but wealthy nations had previously pledged to provide $100 billion annually in climate finance by 2020. LOSS AND DAMAGE In a victory for small island nations threatened by rising seas, the agreement includes a section recognizing "loss and damage" associated with climate-related disasters. The U.S. long objected to addressing the issue in the agreement, worried that it would lead to claims of compensation for damage caused by extreme weather events. In the end, the issue was included, but a footnote specifically stated that loss and damage does not involve liability or compensation. \</doc>

The following information was released by the office of the Prime Minister of Australia: Prime Minister Check against delivery Mr President, Secretary General, Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen. From Australia we come with confidence and optimism. We are not daunted by our challenge. It inspires us. It energises us. We do not doubt the implications of the science, or the scale of the challenge. But above all we do not doubt the capacity of humanity to meet it - with imagination, innovation and the prudence that befits those, like us, who make decisions that will affect not just our own children and grandchildren but generations yet unborn. And Mr President while we come to you in Paris with our deepest condolences, we bring you the most resolute solidarity in our common cause for freedom in the face of terrorism. Here in Paris Australia supports a new and truly global climate agreement. It is an agreement that must drive humanity's capacity for inventiveness and a new wave of technological advances. Good for our environment, good for our economies. I join over 150 leaders in calling for a strong and effective agreement. And over 180 countries have now announced post-2020 targets. This is an extraordinary effort. For Australia's part, our 2030 target represents real economic effort, and will halve our per capita emissions one of the biggest reductions of any G20 country. We will meet and beat our 2020 emissions reduction target. Today I announce that Australia will ratify the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. We firmly believe that it is innovation and technology which will enable us both to drive stronger economic growth and a cleaner environment. We are a highly social and innovative species and so the more we share innovative technologies, the better they will become. Today Australia joins with many other countries in supporting Mission Innovation which aims to double investment in clean energy innovation over the next five years. Australian universities are at the forefront of energy and climate science innovation. To give one example, the University of New South Wales has held the world record for solar cell efficiency for 30 of the last 32 years. And by 2018 over 60 per cent of the world's solar cells are to use technology developed by Australian researchers. But our task, and that of the technologies we deploy, is not just to reduce emissions. Adaption to the impacts of climate change is equally important and there too innovation is a key. Some of the most vulnerable nations are our Pacific neighbours and we are helping them to build resilience through practical action and assistance. To this end, Australia will contribute at least $1 billion over the next five years from our existing aid budget both to build climate resilience and reduce emissions. Our agreement here in Paris must provide a common platform for action, the dynamism to build ambition and a robust and transparent reporting system. Australia is not daunted by the challenge. With great optimism and faith in humanity's genius for invention, we are confident that with your leadership, Mr President, we will, in common cause, secure our future. \</doc>

This year, the annual gathering aims to establish, for the first time in more than 20 years of UN negotiations, a binding, international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough to keep global warming below two degrees Celsius.<nl/> ' COP21 is currently our best shot at taking global collective action to bend the greenhouse gas curve,' says Asim Zia, UVM associate professor of Community Development and Applied Economics, who's studied the conference since its beginning in the 90s.<nl/> He's one of four representatives from UVM attending the conference, including one student.<nl/> Sophomore Gina Fiorile, twice invited to the White House this year for her work developing and implementing a model to teach and engage youth around climate change, will speak on two, livestreamed panels at the conference. 'Attending COP21 as a youth delegate is an incredible opportunity to share what I've seen happening among students around the country,' she says. 'I want to showcase what actions students have taken to reduce the impacts of climate change in order to exemplify our unified call for strong climate legislation and policy.' As part of that effort, Fiorile will take with her work created by Vermont students at the Nov. 20 Youth Climate Summit held at UVM.<nl/> Lini Wollenberg, research associate professor of environement and natural resources, will present at least two of her research projects at the Global Landscapes Forum, one of the side events of the conference predicted to draw massive attention. One of her projects is a new resource for policy-makers. 'It provides better estimates of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and ranks the most effective low-carbon agricultural practices for 34 crops, depending on your soil type and geography. It is simple to use and available for free online.'<nl/> Jennie Stephens, UVM's Blittersdorf Professor of Science and Policy, will attend the conference, she says, to inform her research on 'renewable energy transition, societal responses to climate change, and energy democracy and justice.'<nl/> 'I will pay attention to conversations about inequality, gender and renewable energy,' Stephens says. 'As the energy sector transforms, opportunities for a more inclusive workforce are emerging. But we must intentionally prioritize diversity, or the transition to renewable energy could perpetuate and deepen  rather than reduce  inequalities.'<nl/> Read more from each of UVM's COP21 team, how their work connects with the international climate change conversation, and their hopes and predictions for the conference's outcome.

The following information was released by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE): Debating a move from climate science to parliamentary action, the legislators gathered in Paris on 5-6 December 2015 during the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) asked themselves: are we fit for purpose? How can national parliaments push for a strong global deal on climate? Parliaments should focus on what they do best: promote national climate laws and get them recognised in the global agreement; they must hold governments to account on national commitments to combat global warming and press negotiators in a bottom-up manner, said Lord Prescott, former Chairperson of the PACEs Sub-Committee on Environment and Energy, when addressing a major parliamentary gathering organised by the IPU and the French Parliament. More than ever before, legislators are taking centre stage in steering efforts against global warming. They can act forcefully in proposing climate-friendly law packages, validating national budgets with ample provisions for climate action and ratifying the international agreement, hopefully to be agreed by the end of this week,- continued Lord Prescott. Both the public and private sectors should seize the low-hanging fruit via sustainable climate action, because what is good for the planet is good for its people and businesses. Let us get our priorities right and honour our promises, insisted Lord Prescott speaking at the panel discussion on the Credibility of national actions: worldwide legislative and policy developments, organised at the initiative of the IPU and the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment on 8 December 2015 in Paris, on the premises of COP21 . \</doc>

The World Council of Churches issued the following news release: The Executive Committee of the World Council of Churches (WCC) released a statement in the lead-up to the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) in Paris expressing hope that the event will achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2degreeC. The texts affirms the longstanding ecumenical commitment to promote effective intergovernmental, social and individual action to address climate change, a key challenge for human stewardship of God's precious and unique creation. Among other expressions of this commitment is the position adopted on Climate Justice by the WCC 10th Assembly, in Busan, Republic of Korea, on 8 November 2013 and the recent "Statement of Faith and Spiritual Leaders" issued in advance of COP21 . The action continues, "To all those engaged in the struggle for climate justice, and all those exerting their efforts to protect the beauty, diversity and sustainability of the natural environment of this earth, the executive committee expresses its solidarity and support." The WCC has been involved in the UNFCCC process since 1991. It is the only faith based-organization that has had a permanent presence in the UNFCCC process. The Executive Committee's public declaration in regard to COP21 is a significant part of the Council's climate justice advocacy strategy that aims to underline the significance of climate talks for human rights throughout the world. It reiterates the 10th Assembly's call to churches and ecumenical organizations to insist that their respective governments look beyond national interests and "urge them to safeguard and promote the basic human rights of those whose existence is threatened by the effects of climate change". The WCC Executive Committee also released a statement on the terror attack in Paris, condemning terrorist atrocities justified in the name of God and expressing "support and solidarity of others, of their families and of their neighbours - whoever or wherever they may be".

LE BOURGET, France  French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius presented a new draft of a global climate accord that showed headway on some key issues and stalemate on others as negotiators headed into the final stretch of talks outside Paris. The 27-page draft - two pages shorter than a previous version - included a long-term goal of keeping global warming "well below" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees F), while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C. The draft also said governments would aim to peak the emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases "as soon as possible." Previous drafts had included more specific timeframes. Diplomats from 196 governments are trying to forge a global pact in Paris to slow global warming by collectively slashing emissions, mostly from the burning oil, coal and gas for energy. The biggest challenge is to define the responsibilities of wealthy nations, which have polluted the most historically, and developing economies including China and India where emissions are growing the most quickly. The draft suggested compromises were emerging in some sections. But the text still contained competing options on the key issue of making sure countries follow through on their emissions targets. Several options remained on the contentious issue of financing to help poor and vulnerable countries such as small island nations cope with climate change. The draft didn't resolve how to deal with demands from vulnerable countries to cope with unavoidable damage from rising seas and other climate impacts. One option said such "loss and other damage" would be addressed in a way that doesn't involve liability and compensation - a U.S. demand. \</doc>

U.S., Nov. 27 -- On the eve of the United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP 21 , taking place in Paris next week, the members of the Global Travel Association Coalition (GTAC) reiterate the industry's commitment to contribute to fight climate change, and express their hopes for successful talks. Speaking as Chairman of GTAC, David Scowsill, President and CEO of the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), said: "The travel and tourism sector expresses its hope for a successful outcome to the talks in Paris and reiterates that our organizations, working together as the Global Travel Association Coalition, are committed to make a meaningful and long term contribution to fighting climate change. "Travel and tourism contributes nearly 10% of the world's GDP and supports one in eleven of all jobs on the planet. Over one billion people cross international borders each year, a number expected to reach 1.8 billion by 2030. This growth in travel and tourism will bring about enormous social and economic development across the world, particularly for Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs) and Small Island Developing States.

Because of this plan, the U.S. is now on track to slash carbon pollution from the power sector 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The cuts to smog and soot that come along with these reductions will bring economic opportunities for clean energy innovation and major health benefits for American families. EPA's plan building on six years of concerted effort by the Obama Administration means that in the year 2030, the U.S. will avoid thousands of premature deaths and trips to the hospital, tens of thousands of asthma attacks, and hundreds of thousands of missed school days and missed work days.Details for the Administrator's trip, press events and stakeholder meetings will be shared as more information becomes available. NEW Video: Administrator Gina McCarthy reflects on the United States' progress on climate, as well as how far the U.S. has come on environmental protection since the EPA was established. Watch the video[1] to learn why she's optimistic that we can take a big step forward during the Paris talks.

The Global Renewable Fuels Alliance issued the following news release: Today, Bliss Baker, the President of the Global Renewable Fuels Alliance (GRFA), called upon world leaders participating in the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 21 ) in Paris to signal their support for biofuels as one of the tools to fight climate change. "This conference is a real opportunity for world leaders to recognize the role that renewable fuels have played, and will continue to play, in the transition to a low-carbon global economy," Baker said. "The climate problem is accelerating and biofuels represent one of the most cost-effective solutions to reduce oil use and greenhouse gas emissions from transport in the short and medium term," he added. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has said that October 2015 was the hottest October on record by a third of a degree making it the most above-normal month since records began being kept in 1880. This was the eighth month this year when a heat record was set, representing a record number of broken records in any year. So far, 36 countries have already recognized the opportunity presented by biofuels in reducing GHG emissions and combating climate change, and have included them in their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) plans. Studies have shown that most biofuels, like ethanol, are proven to reduce harmful GHGs from 40% to 90% compared to fossil fuels around the world. "Given the significant contribution biofuel is making in reducing global GHG emissions today, we believe COP 21 participants should call for an increase in biofuel use through the introduction of supportive policies, particularly for advanced biofuels," concluded Baker.

PARIS  It's a challenge few people could take on: making it possible for some 40,000 world leaders, environmental activists and others to coexist for two weeks in a logistical and negotiating ballet aimed at reaching an unprecedented global climate accord. Here's a glimpse behind the scenes: GREEN(ISH) CITY  The conference site of Le Bourget near Paris looks like a small city, with its medical center, prayer rooms, restaurants, post office and even a mini-Eiffel tower made of recycled chairs. CROWDED PLACE  For almost two weeks, officials from 196 parties - meaning 23,000 government officials - are negotiating under the watchful eye of 9,000 observer organization members and more than 3,000 journalists. You can see Britain's Prince Charles listen to a speech by American actor Sean Penn and meet ministers going incognito into the conference's side streets. PROTESTING, CAREFULLY  Environmental activists organize dozens of meetings and news conferences, but they are also allowed to participate in authorized, not-too-noisy protests. Activists dressed as Star Wars heroes appeared at the Paris climate conference Wednesday, as part of a push by the activist group Avaaz for governments to abandon oil, gas and coal in favor of renewable energy. SECURITY  The conference is officially U.N. territory for the duration of the two-week talks. U.N. guards are carrying out security checks at the site, used for other trade shows when it's not the center of world climate negotiations. Outside, 2,800 French police officers are in charge of the security, some of them on horseback. \</doc>

Tarkett, to engage alongside 79 multinationals calling for concrete action on climate change ahead of COP 21 Paris, November 23, 2015 Tarkett, a global leader in innovative and sustainable solutions for flooring and sports surfaces, joins a coalition of global businesses calling for concrete action on climate change, ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties 21 (COP211) to be held in Paris from 30 November - 11 December 2015. This new coalition - comprising 79 CEOs from global companies operating in more than 150 countries and territories and with a combined revenue of $2.13 trillion - believes that the private sector has a responsibility to actively engage in global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Open Message(2), facilitated by the World Economic Forum, extends an offer to national governments to meet and co-design tangible actions as well as set appropriate and effective targets. The global CEOs agree on the need to take voluntary action to reduce environmental and carbon footprints, for meaningful and inspirational global action and to actively manage climate risks and incorporate them into decision making, not least to realize positive growth opportunities. The coalition urges the world's leaders to reach an ambitious climate deal at COP21 , aligned with the UN Post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs3). "Our whole vision is geared to drawing on innovation and human ingenuity to transform our business towards a collaborative circular economy model, positively impacting people, planet and profits," says Michel Giannuzzi, CEO of Tarkett, "and for this reason, we had no hesitation in supporting this vital climate change initiative, as we believe that a long-term commitment, extending beyond COP 21 , is required to tackle these issues. Smart businesses of the future will have to reduce their carbon footprint, one of the key goals of the circular economy. In this way, we can innovate and drive economic growth that is both profitable and fully sustainable." Tarkett is committed to conducting business in a sustainable way, inspired by the goals of the regenerative circular economy and Cradle to Cradle principles. Since 2011, Tarkett has been deploying a comprehensive sustainability strategy based on its 'closed loop circular design' model, driven by an extensive eco-innovation strategy which positively contributes to people's health and well-being and the planet, at every step of the product life (design, production, use and recycling). Tarkett's support for the 'Open Letter' comes one month after announcing its membership of the World Economic Forum, where it will be engaged in both the Global Challenge initiative on the 'Environment and Natural Resource Security' and as an Industry Partner for 'Infrastructure and Urban Development'. Following the long-term commitment of Desso, now part of Tarkett, to promote circular action, Tarkett will continue contributing to Project MainStream4, a multi-industry and CEO-led global initiative to accelerate innovation and help scale up the Circular Economy, organized by the World Economic Forum and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

At a gathering of African leaders at the United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ), UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stressed that their continent has an enormous stake in the success of the global event which aims to reach a new universal climate agreement to limit the rise of global temperature. Africa is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, Mr. Ban told top government officials at a High-level meeting at the Paris-Le Bourget site of the conference, in the north-east of the French capital. Noting that COP21 Already, your leadership has helped make 2015 a year of opportunity, he told them. Many of you were present in Ethiopia in July for the adoption of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development. Many of you were part of the historic gathering in New York in September for the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 SDGs. These agendas aim to wipe out poverty, fight inequality and tackle climate change over the next 15 years. Now, here in Paris, governments have the opportunity to secure a global climate change agreement that can pave the way towards a safer, healthier, more prosperous and sustainable future, Mr. Ban insisted. He reminded leaders that sustainable energy offers huge economic opportunities: With the plummeting price of solar and other renewables, many African countries are moving quickly to embrace a greener pathway that still enables them to meet growing energy demand. Despite strong momentum towards a meaningful agreement, Mr. Ban said key political issues remain unresolved. There is a lot of work to do here in Paris, and the stakes are very high, especially for the most vulnerable people and countries, he underlined. Science tells us we have only a few years left before the window could close on our ability to prevent severe, pervasive and irreversible climate impacts. \</doc>

Students publish COP observations and analysis on their blog, 'Substantial and Sustained' (vlscop.vermontlaw.edu[2]), during and in the months leading up to the conference. Recent blog posts include 'Empowering Women in the Fight for Global Food Security' and 'Carbon Tax-More of the Same or Energy Miracle?'<nl/> ' COP21 is a historic moment in the international climate change negotiations,' said Bach. 'All 196 parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are determined to create a new global agreement to govern their individual and collective mitigation and adaptation actions post-Kyoto Protocol.'<nl/> The Kyoto Protocol, which sets internationally binding emission reduction targets, ends in 2020. To replace the Kyoto Protocol, the UN's Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP) requires parties to 'develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties' by the end of 2015.<nl/> According to a recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report, developed countries are making progress on a $100 billion-per-year by 2020 climate financing goal. However, the negotiation text shows there is still plenty of bracketed language indicating disagreement about how to reach a final outcome.<nl/> 'Vermont Law School students will have a unique opportunity to take it all in,' said Bach. 'And they will use their research and analysis to support a least developed country delegation, or LDC, engage in the negotiations. In this way, our students embody the VLS motto, 'law for the community and the world.''<nl/> They and Bach will tweet from Paris via @ProfTBach and @VTLawSchool.<nl/> 'The opportunity to participate as a member of the COP20 delegation truly opened my mind to the stark reality we face as individuals, as a nation, and as a global community facing the threats posed by climate change,' said past COP delegate Rebecca Davidson '15, who earned a Master of Environmental Law and Policy (MELP) at VLS. 'Yet, I have never been so inspired by the efforts of so many countries coming together to make meaningful and long-lasting decisions. The integrated learning we provided to the developing country, both to improve their understanding of the COP process and to build their capacity for action, provided a meaning to the class that went beyond the academic effort an amazing opportunity.'<nl/> COP21 /CMP11 represents the 21st session of the United Nations Conference of the Parties and the 11th session of the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol.

PARIS  In climate math, the difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees is much greater than 0.5. Small nations say that for them, that half-degree could mean the difference between life and death. For larger nations, the question is what's realistic and what's not when it comes to limiting global warming. The warming goal is what experts call a guardrail, and it has the potential to derail the climate talks going on in Paris if negotiators can't agree on a number. Small island nations - such as the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and St. Lucia - and some other countries are pushing 1.5 because they see it as an issue of survival. They talk about sea level rise inundating cities, salt water killing off crops and more dangerous storms wiping out cities. "It's a fight that really should not be focused on numbers, 1.5, 2, 2.5," said James Fletcher, St. Lucia's minister for sustainable development, energy, science and technology. "It should be focused on lives. We're not fighting for numbers, we're fighting for lives." Climate scientists say both numbers are a bit arbitrary, but keeping warming to 1.5 degrees could increase the chance of survival for coral reefs, slow the rise in the number of ever-increasing severe weather disasters and help keep the planet from hitting dreaded but so far unseen tipping points of irreversible environmental damage. "There is no such thing as a guardrail where we are free from all the impacts of climate change; we've already seen climate change and it's widespread," said Chris Field, a Carnegie Institution scientist who headed an international scientific assessment of climate impacts two years ago. For some countries, keeping warming to 1.5 degrees may require steep and painful cuts in carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of coal, oil and gas. But United Nations climate chief Christiana Figueres and climate talks president Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, were optimistic about compromise. So far, international negotiators trying to broker a deal say it's a challenge they think they can handle. There are many issues in the talks, which continue through mid-December. Climate negotiators are trying to figure out how much countries must reduce carbon dioxide emissions to keep the planet from heating up to dangerous levels; how to make sure countries do what they promise; and who pays for it all. But how much countries cut and pay could depend in part on the planetary goal. "Whether the text will also take into account a very justifiable request from the most vulnerable countries to improve on those efforts, it remains to be seen how that is going to be handled," Figueres said in an interview. "It wouldn't surprise me if there is a recognition of the intense vulnerability of some nations." Fletcher said that based on reports from his negotiators, there would be pushback from some countries on the 1.5 goal. U.S. chief climate negotiator Todd Stern said his delegation had talked with the small islands about their position. "We haven't landed anywhere yet, but we hear the concerns of those countries and we think those concerns are legitimate," he said. India's chief climate negotiator, Ashok Lavssa, said India believed that the number should be below 2 degrees, but whether it goes all the way to 1.5 is difficult to say. Fletcher said he could see a compromise by which both goals - 2 and 1.5 - would be listed in whatever pact comes out of the conference and countries would agree to try to hit 1.5 but commit to 2 if they can't. He calls achieving a 2-degree goal difficult and a 1.5-degree goal "very difficult." His numbers show that current pledges by nations would only limit warming to 3.5 degrees, down from the current trajectory of 4.5 degrees if nations continue producing emissions as they have been. For example, to do its part in keeping warming to 2 degrees, the U.S. must cut emissions by 4.1 percent a year by 2030, but to get to 1.5, it must cut emissions by 6.2 percent a year. Those cuts would need to increase even more between 2030 and 2050. The fastest a country has ever cut carbon emissions was about 4 percent a year during the 1970s oil crisis, when France switched heavily to nuclear power. But Jones and MIT professor John Sterman said people shouldn't get bogged down in the numbers right now. They said it's like driving from New York City to San Francisco, arguing about where you are going to park when you get there when you are still only on the East Coast. Field said it wa's a bit of an academic question, especially because the emissions already spewed stay around for so long the world is nearly already committed to 1.5 degrees of warming. Others, such as James Hansen, a former NASA climate chief turned activist, said 2 degrees was too much warming, calling it "a crazy target to have; you cannot say that's a safe guardrail." Hansen, often considered the godfather of global warming science said that "1.5 is certainly less dangerous than 2 degrees; I wouldn't even want to characterize that as a guardrail." \</doc>

The following information was released by the United Nations: Recognizing that transportation has the highest growth of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of any industrial sector, transport representatives at the United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ) presented 10 initiatives today that aim to reduce these emissions and build more sustainable transport systems. Among the events was the launch of the Paris Declaration on Electro-Mobility and Climate Change and Call to Action. Endorsed by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the International Energy Agency, as well as Tesla Motors and Michelin Nissan-Renault, it reportedly builds on commitments from companies, cities, States and associations that have undertaken decisive efforts towards sustainable transport electrification. "Of course I think the sector of transport is one of the most important to succeed in fighting climate," Segol ne Royal, the French Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy told the UN News Service. With energy-related CO2 emissions expected to jump from one quarter of total energy-related emissions today to one-third by 2050, the actors that are part of the Lima to Paris Action Agenda (LPAA) are underlining that significant changes can be made in transport to keep the global average temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius. The LPAA was launched one year ago at the the previous UN climate change conference in Peru, and aims to strength climate action beyond COP21 . The effort comes as demand for public and freight transport is projected to grow rapidly, especially in emerging and developing countries. Yet, projections reveal a 50 per cent reduction of transport CO2 emissions compared to a "transport-as-usual" scenario can be achieved by 2050, without hampering sustainable economic growth. Moreover, according to the International Energy Agency, if global warming is to be limited to 2 degrees or less, at least 20 per cent of all road vehicles (cars, two and three-wheelers, trucks, buses and others) must be electric-powered by 2030, in conjunction with the low-carbon production of electricity and hydrogen. Other announcements today at COP21 , which centered around the themes of 'Transport' and 'Building,' included new efforts to stabilize emissions from the aviation industry by 2020. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), said it has received 74 action plans to advance the implementation of mitigation measures by States, which accounts for 80.6 per cent of global CO2 emissions from international flight. \</doc>

The Environmental Protection Agency issued the following news release: As the White House announced today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Gina McCarthy will be traveling to Paris for the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference during the 2nd week, December 5-10, to focus on the progress the U.S. has made under President Obama's Climate Action Plan and the need for ambitious climate targets from all countries. Last summer, President Obama launched EPA's Clean Power Plan -- the biggest single step America has ever taken to address climate change. Because of this plan, the U.S. is now on track to slash carbon pollution from the power sector 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The cuts to smog and soot that come along with these reductions will bring economic opportunities for clean energy innovation and major health benefits for American families. EPA's plan -- building on six years of concerted effort by the Obama Administration -- means that in the year 2030, the U.S. will avoid thousands of premature deaths and trips to the hospital, tens of thousands of asthma attacks, and hundreds of thousands of missed school days and missed work days. Details for the Administrator's trip, press events and stakeholder meetings will be shared as more information becomes available. NEW Video: Administrator Gina McCarthy reflects on the United States' progress on climate, as well as how far the U.S. has come on environmental protection since the EPA was established. Watch the video to learn why she's optimistic that we can take a big step forward during the Paris talks.

Sep 08, 2015( Embassy of France News: HYPERLINK http://www.ambafrance-us.org Published on September 8, 2015 Today, Thursday 3 September, Prime Minister Manuel Valls had a meeting with Claude Bartolone to discuss the organization of the UN Conference on Climate Change , to be held from 30 November to 11 December on the site of the Parc des Expositions in Le Bourget, in Seine-Saint-Denis, of which he is the elected representative. No security challenges must be neglected in the organization of this conference, which is of global significance in political and diplomatic terms. Manuel Valls was able to set out the major preparatory work done by police headquarters under the authority of the ministers responsible for the interior and transport. One thousand five hundred police officers, gendarmes and firefighters are directly mobilized on the site and the surrounding area to guarantee the security of the 195 delegations and the 35,000 visitors expected every day (compared with visitor numbers ranging from 50,000 to 100,000 a day for the Paris Air Show in Le Bourget). To guarantee the best welcome and avoid any inconvenience to local people, transport will be a major focus of the event's organization. Priority will be given to the use of public transport, through an increase in the daily supply (70,000 additional places a day on buses and trains) and increased security on the lines concerned. Moreover, a traffic plan will be established in order to signpost, and ease congestion on, the main roads leading to the conference. Accommodation sites for the participants have been carefully selected to ensure that the economic benefits go mainly to Seine-Saint-Denis. Finally, the sites to host the many events associated with COP21 will be chosen in such a way as to minimize their negative impact on the management of public spaces. Special attention will also be paid to security and traffic conditions in the centre of the capital, in this busy shopping period for the people of Ile-de-France in the run-up to the festive season. On 16 September, the chief of police will bring together the elected representatives of the districts concerned, to explain the operation to them and listen to their opinions./. \</doc>

LE BOURGET, France  With dramatic vows to save future generations from an overheated planet, the largest gathering ever of world leaders began two weeks of talks Monday aimed at producing the most far-reaching pact yet to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and avert environmental havoc. "We should ask what will we say to our grandchildren if we fail," British Prime Minister David Cameron said as the U.N. climate summit opened under heavy security on the outskirts of Paris, two weeks after extremist attacks that left 130 people dead. "Instead of making excuses tomorrow, let's take action today." Even before the gathering, more than 180 countries pledged to cut or curb their emissions, but scientific analyses show that much bigger reductions would be needed to limit man-made warming of the Earth to 3.8 degrees Fahrenheit over pre-industrial times, the internationally agreed-upon goal. The biggest issue facing the 151 heads of state and government at the summit is who should bear most of the burden of closing that gap: wealthy Western nations that have polluted the most historically, or developing countries like China and India that are now the biggest and third-biggest emitters of greenhouse gases? "Addressing climate change should not deny the legitimate needs of developing countries to reduce poverty and improve living standards," Chinese leader Xi Jinping told the conference. The last major climate agreement, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, required only rich countries to cut emissions, and the U.S. never signed on. Since then, global temperatures and sea levels have continued to rise, and the Earth has seen an extraordinary run of extreme weather, including severe droughts and storms. This new round of talks seeks to produce an agreement that would require all countries, rich and poor, to take action. While the specifics have yet to be worked out, the pact is meant to chart a path toward reduced reliance on coal, oil and gas and expanded use of renewable energy such as wind and solar power. The negotiations will focus on whether emissions targets should be binding or voluntary and how to verify that countries are hitting their targets. Another big issue will be how to provide the finance and technology that developing countries will need to reduce their emissions and cope with the effects of rising seas, intensifying heat waves and floods. "The future of the people of the world, the future of our planet, is in your hands," U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told negotiators in his opening remarks. "We cannot afford indecision, half measures or merely gradual approaches. Our goal must be a transformation." China and India say they want the agreement to clearly reflect that industrialized nations bear the biggest responsibility for the problem. President Barack Obama offered assurances that the U.S. isn't trying to shirk its duty. "I've come here personally, as the leader of the world's largest economy and the second-largest emitter, to say that the United States of America not only recognizes our role in creating this problem, we embrace our responsibility to do something about it," Obama told the conference. Statistics since 1959 from the U.S. Department of Energy show the United States has been by far the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, the top man-made greenhouse gas. It has released about 258 trillion tons of carbon dioxide over the past half-century, compared with China's 158 trillion tons, the figures show. China is catching up, though, and is now the world's biggest greenhouse gas polluter, accounting for 28 percent of the world's current emissions - twice as much as the United States. Beijing has pledged to put a ceiling on its emissions around 2030 as part of the latest negotiations. Developing countries say they need financial support and technology to make the transition to cleaner energy. On the bustling first day of the conference, a number of such initiatives were announced, including one backed by 19 governments and 28 leading global investors, including Bill Gates and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg. Their initiative would provide billions of dollars in investments to research and develop clean energy technology, with the ultimate goal of making it cheaper and more reliable. Separately, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Francois Hollande unveiled an initiative to get rich and poor countries to cooperate on expanding solar power. "It's making the dream of universal access to clean energy become more real," Modi said. Many of the leaders said the world must keep the average temperature within 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit of current levels - and, if possible, to half that, to spare island nations threatened by rising seas. The world has already warmed nearly that much since the beginning of the industrial age. Beijing on Monday reported one of the worst spells of air pollution in years, saying levels of soot were 25 times what the World Health Organization considers safe. That's a different pollution from carbon dioxide, but both come from burning fossil fuel, especially coal. Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which had binding emissions targets for wealthy nations, the new deal will be based on a bottom-up approach where countries set their own targets. One of the things being negotiated is a ratchet-up mechanism that would encourage countries to review and improve their targets every five years. --- 'What greater rejection of those who would tear down our world than marshaling our best efforts to save it?' PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA 'The fight against terrorism and the fight against climate change are two major global challenges we must face.' FRENCH PRESIDENT FRANCOIS HOLLANDE 'Addressing climate change should not deny the legitimate needs of developing countries to reduce poverty and improve living standards.' CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING 'Consider the needs of the youngest generation, because none of us has the right to assume that for our today they should give up their tomorrow.'

CUPE National Secretary-Treasurer Charles Fleury will lead the delegation that will represent Canada's largest union at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) in Paris. CUPE's delegation will be part of 35 Canadian trade unionists coordinated by the Canadian Labour Congress and the International Trade Union Congress (ITUC). On December 3, Fleury will be among the speakers at the "One Million Green Jobs" forum sponsored by the Canadian Labour Congress and the Climate Action Network at the Le Bourget conference centre in Paris. Several of Canada's premiers and environment ministers have confirmed their attendance at the Canadian forum. On behalf of CUPE, Fleury will argue for world governments, including Canada, to adopt ambitious greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets for 2020 that meet scientists' recommendations. According to Fleury, we can no longer rely on states acting in good faith: the final accord must include a mandatory review process for all countries. "However, the fight against climate change cannot be waged at the expense of workers, communities or developing countries. The final accord should involve a just transition to a carbon-free economy, including financial incentives for the poorest countries," explained Fleury. For CUPE's National Secretary-Treasurer, the fight against climate change also presents an excellent opportunity for the creation of new green jobs. "Public services are a main source of green jobs. A growing public sector and public infrastructure will help us reduce the effects of climate change. Private companies have created the problem; governments and the public sector need to be part of the solution," said Fleury. CUPE is a signatory of the Leap Manifesto advocating that environmental protection, economic development, and a fairer society go hand in hand. "We'll make sure that the Leap message is heard loud and clear in Paris," concluded Fleury. CUPE is Canada's largest union, representing 634,000 workers.

(AP Photo/Francois Mori) <nl/> The once black-and-white world of climate negotiations for poorer countries has evolved into many shades of gray at talks this week in Paris. <nl/>For years, many in the developing world said richer countries created the global warming problem with their industrial emissions so it is up to them to clean it up a sticking point in past climate negotiations.<nl/> But there's no way that global warming can be kept below the international goal of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times without dramatic limits in future carbon dioxide emissions[1] from the developing nations, climate experts[2] and even officials from developing nations say. The Earth has already warmed up about 1 degree Celsius since then.<nl/> "Everybody has to participate in cleaning up the mess," said Richard Somerville, a Scripps Institution of Oceanography climate scientist. "If you are going to take it seriously, everybody has to play a part."<nl/> Tuvalu Prime Minister Enele Sosene Sopoaga said even though developing nations like his which is being threatened with being wiped out by a rise in sea levels didn't cause the global warming problem, they still have to limit future fossil fuel use because the problem has gotten so serious. But poorer nations need financial aid to help pay for renewable energy over often-cheaper fossil fuels.<nl/> "Yes they are ready, because they recognize it is a global issue," Sopoaga said Thursday. "Let's do it together."<nl/> China's climate change[3] special envoy, Xie Zhenhua, said even though it will be difficult, China is committed to changing its energy system, peaking its emissions by 2030, if not earlier. China is by far the world's No. 1 carbon emissions polluter.<nl/> Activists of "Climacts Angels Guardians" from Australia arrive for a demonstration in Paris, Thursday, Dec. 3, 2015 .

And we will do it well."<nl/> At a Thursday news conference, some least-developed nations continued to make the case for an agreement that reflects that poor countries can't do as much as rich ones.<nl/> Pa Ousman Jarju, minister of environment and climate change of Gambia, called the issue "the elephant in the room."<nl/> "We are different. We have different capabilities," Jarju said. "We need to ensure that we have an agreement that would reflect those realities."<nl/> Nozipho Mxakato-Diseko of South Africa, who heads the bloc of developing countries in the climate talks, said the group was united and insisted that that's a good thing for everyone.<nl/> "If you have a fragmented group it makes the management of the negotiations that much harder," she said.<nl/> Tuvalu Prime Minister, Hon.

(AP Photo/Christophe Ena) <nl/> "Approximately two-thirds of avoided emissions would have to come from developing worlds," said Andrew Jones, co-director of the Climate Interactive, a group of scientists that use computer simulations to model how much warming will happen under different pollution cuts offered up in the international negotiations.<nl/> The reason for that is, under a scenario where emissions continue at the current pace, most of the pollution growth comes from the anticipated increase in fossil fuel use by developing nations[4], said Ellie Johnston of the Climate Interactive.<nl/> Former NASA chief climate scientist James Hansen, often considered the godfather of global warming[5] research, said Thursday there is a sense of unfairness about climate[6] change. He said the problem was caused by developed north nations, but it is felt by "nations at low latitude that did almost nothing to cause the problem."<nl/> Activists from the NGO "Non violent action COP21 " gather in front of a bank to protest against tax evasion, in Paris, Thursday, Dec. 3, 2015 .

Washington: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has issued the following news release: As the White House announced today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Gina McCarthy will be traveling to Paris for the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference during the 2nd week, December 5-10, to focus on the progress the U.S. has made under President Obama\' s Climate Action Plan and the need for ambitious climate targets from all countries. Last summer, President Obama launched EPA\' s Clean Power Plan  the biggest single step America has ever taken to address climate change. Because of this plan, the U.S. is now on track to slash carbon pollution from the power sector 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The cuts to smog and soot that come along with these reductions will bring economic opportunities for clean energy innovation and major health benefits for American families. EPA\' s plan  building on six years of concerted effort by the Obama Administration  means that in the year 2030, the U.S. will avoid thousands of premature deaths and trips to the hospital, tens of thousands of asthma attacks, and hundreds of thousands of missed school days and missed work days. Details for the Administrator\' s trip, press events and stakeholder meetings will be shared as more information becomes available. NEW Video: Administrator Gina McCarthy reflects on the United States\' progress on climate, as well as how far the U.S. has come on environmental protection since the EPA was established. Watch the video to learn why she\' s optimistic that we can take a big step forward during the Paris talks.

Perhaps, writes Oliver Tickell. But failure to reach a strong climate agreement now looks more probable. And that's an outcome that would suit ISIS - which makes $500m a year from oil sales - together with other oil producers.<nl/> Hey John Kerry, would that make this a tragedy with some rationale?[2]<nl/><nl/>Eric Worrall at WUWT [3](H/T for the link and quotes) finds epic faults in this thinking.<nl/> This line of reasoning is deeply flawed. ISIS are not a legitimate supplier of oil, they are oil smugglers. If a future climate agreement were to place a prohibition on oil, or slap on a massive global carbon tax, the black market price of oil would skyrocket - groups like ISIS would make a fortune, helping oil consumers avoid carbon taxes which legitimate providers would have to pay. It seems much more likely that ISIS didn't know or didn't care about the COP 21 climate conference[4], or who knows - perhaps the recent atrocity was just a prelude, a distraction from a much bigger planned attack on world leaders, when they gather in Paris.<nl/> No matter what the question is the\~answer, and correct me if I am wrong, is the compassionate embrace of more refugees.<nl/> Lets make a drum circle and pray to Gaia by the light of our iPhones.<nl/> The post Left Wing Climate Nut Jobs Wonder if Paris Attack Was a 'Big Oil' Plot[5] appeared first on GraniteGrok[6].<nl/> [ 1]: HYPERLINK http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/2986288/paris_attacks_cop21_and_the_war_on_terror.html http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/2986288/paris_attacks_ HYPERLINK cop21 _and_the_war_on_terror.html HYPERLINK http://granitegrok.com/blog/2015/11/john-kerry-charlie-hebdo-massacre-had-a-rationale http://granitegrok.com/blog/2015/11/john-kerry-charlie-hebdo-massacre-had-a-rationale [ 3]: \~ HYPERLINK http://wattsupwiththat.com/2015/11/17/claim-paris-terrorist-atrocity-was-a-big-oil-plot/ http://wattsupwiththat.com/2015/11/17/claim-paris-terrorist-atrocity-was-a-big-oil-plot/ [ 4]: \~ HYPERLINK https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_ HYPERLINK United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference [ 5]: \~ HYPERLINK http://granitegrok.com/blog/2015/11/left-wing-climate-nut-jobs-wonder-if-paris-attack-was-a-big-oil-plot http://granitegrok.com/blog/2015/11/left-wing-climate-nut-jobs-wonder-if-paris-attack-was-a-big-oil-plot [ 6]: \~ HYPERLINK http://granitegrok.com http://granitegrok.com \</doc>

Moravian College issued the following news release: Students and faculty from Moravian College are attending the 21st United Nations Framework Conference on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris, France. Professors Diane Husic and Hilde Binford are joined by students Laura McBride '16, Audrey McSain '16, Paige Malewski '16, Stephen Stoddard '16, and Matthew Bosch '16 (who is also a liaison to the American Chemical Society Delegation) and alumna Sarabeth Brockley '10, who is a policy analyst at the United Nations Division of Sustainable Development. Paris2015 logo"The goal of the conference is to have a legally binding international agreement that will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, address adaptation to climate change through policy and funding to help developing countries," said Diane White Husic, chair and professor, Department of Biological Sciences, Moravian College."Our students will be interacting with researchers, other youth, and, potentially, negotiators to learn the process and issues.They will also assist delegations from developing nations that need note takers and other support." Husic has organized and will be moderating an international panel entitled "Bridging the Research Gap: A Discussion of New Directions and Research Needs for Climate Policy" for the Research and Independent NGOs, that will be held on December 2. This event will highlight new climate change research conducted by 12 members of the RINGOs constituency. These individuals will share perspectives on a range of research topics via a series of "mini-TED talks." Audience discussion will follow on the implications of the research for climate policy locally and internationally. Husic is blogging from the conference on the Huffington Post website, see Standing Up to Fear: COP21 HYPERLINK http://www.moraviancollegeatunfccc.blogspot.com www.moraviancollegeatunfccc.blogspot.com . Husic and Binford have led a delegation from Moravian College to the conference every year since 2009, when only six private liberal arts institutions from the United States were selected to serve as "civil society observers." Participation in the UNFCCC is restricted to parties of the conference, observer states, admitted observer organizations, and accredited press/media. The sessions are not open to the public. President Obama at UN conferenceYesterday, Husic was one of only 32 researchers from around the world to attend the leadership plenary with talks by President Obama, Ban Ki Moon, U.N. secretary general, and the presidents of France, China, Germany, Egypt, Russia, among others. On Monday, the Moravian College students met with representatives from various countries learning about their views on climate change, how it is influencing their livelihoods and lifestyles, and what can be done to reach a solution.

The following information was released by the United Nations: Meeting with civil society groups today at the United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ), UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he counts on these groups to help keep governments accountable, so they implement what they have committed to in words. One of the very valuable lessons that I've learned as Secretary-General during the last nine years is that no government, no international organization, can do its work properly without active engagement and support from civil society, Mr. Ban told members of non-governmental organizations in Paris, alongside Al Gore, the former Vice-President of the United States and Chair of the Climate Reality Project. On behalf of civil society groups, Mr. Gore thanked the Secretary-General for his tireless leadership to solve the climate crisis: I've had the opportunity to work with you for quite a few years now and not many people know the focus and constant dedication that you have had to this issue, he said. The former Vice-President also presented a petition signed by 6.2 million people from around the world, as well as a joint statement on behalf of all civil society groups at COP21 . It stated that these millions of individuals are demanding a strong agreement that will shift the world away from carbon pollution and rapidly towards climate solutions. Noting his appreciation for the signatures, the UN chief highlighted that he thinks the world is standing at a very critical moment: I'm hopeful and I'm reasonably optimistic that we'll be able to have for the first time in the history of the United Nations a universal and very ambitious climate change agreement which will make our lives healthier and more prosperous. Since the beginning of last week, government representative have been negotiating a new agreement with the goal of limiting global temperature rise to less than two degrees Celsius. Yesterday, Laurent Fabius, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs and President of COP21 , said the intention is to have an adopted agreement by Friday. We would not be where we are today here in Paris, with 196 Parties poised to adopt a global climate change agreement, without the leadership and vision of civil society, Mr. Ban insisted, adding that after Paris is over, their voices will be needed more than ever. He also underlined civil society's critical role in driving climate action on the ground: You have provided examples of new ways of working and innovative new solutions that are creating a greener, more sustainable world. I urge you to continue to demand more from all Governments, the UN chief stated. Meanwhile, the Deputy Director of Avaaz, a global web movement, told Mr. Ban she was at COP21 representing over three million people who are calling for 100 per cent clean energy by 2050. That ambitious goal is for them the metric of success, but they're watching for something elsethis conference can be a renewed level of hope in the UN process and the ability of governments to come together and cooperate, said Emma Ruby- Sachs. It's greater than climate. This is about how we solve global problems. Holding back tears, Ms. Sachs also told the Secretary-General that she is expecting her first child in a couple of months, and she wants the next generation to feel hopeful about their planet. \</doc>

The following information was released by the United Nations: Speaking at the opening of the United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ) which seeks to reach a new universal agreement to protect people and planet, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said a political moment like this may not come again. You are here today to write the script for a new future, Mr. Ban told around 150 world leaders attending the kick-off of the much-anticipated conference in Paris, France. We have never faced such a test, he continued. But neither have we encountered such great opportunity. You have the power to secure the well-being of this and succeeding generations. Opening the floor alongside the President of France, Fran ois Hollande, the French Foreign Minister, Laurent Fabius, and the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Christiana Figueres, the UN chief recalled that last September, an inspiring new sustainable development agenda with ambitious goals was endorsed by all Heads of State and Government. You showed your commitment to act for the common good, he underlined. It is now time to do so again. I urge you to instruct your negotiators to choose the path of compromise and consensus. Bold climate action is in the national interest of every single country represented at this conference. Insisting that Paris must mark a turning point, Mr. Ban stated that the world needs to know that it is headed to a low-emissions, climate-resilient future, and that there is no going back. Ahead of COP21 , countries submitted voluntary climate action plans to UNFCCC, the UN entity organizing the conference. These are formally called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs, and will form the basis of the agreement expected to be reached in two weeks. The Secretary-General announced today that more than 180 countries have now submitted their national climate plans which cover close to 100 per cent of global emissions. This is a good start, he said. But we need to go much farther and much faster if we are to limit global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius. According to experts, even a 2-degree rise will have serious consequences for food and water security, economic stability and international peace, which is why a universal, meaningful agreement in Paris is crucial, Mr. Ban told the leaders. Turning to success criteria at COP21 , Mr. Ban said the agreement must be durable, dynamic, embody solidarity with the poor and most vulnerable, and finally, the agreement must be credible. Developed countries must keep their pledge to mobilize $100 billion dollars a year by 2020, he added. A new agreement must also include a single transparent framework for measuring, monitoring and reporting progress. And countries with low capacity should receive flexibility and support so they can meet the requirements of this new system. \</doc>

The following information was released by the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group: As attention turns to Paris for the much-anticipated UN climate conference ( COP21 ), US President Barack Obama has agreed with proponents of a pro-poor deal that ensures more support for developing economies to adapt to climate change impacts. The US President's message echoes what some stakeholders, such as the African Development Bank (AfDB), have been calling for over the years, namely more support to developing countries, most of which are in Africa, not only to adapt, but to transform their economies to low carbon pathways. "As one of America's governors said, we are the first generation to feel the impacts of climate change, and the last generation that can do something about it," said Obama in his address at a leaders' event on Monday, November 30, attended by 150 Heads of State and Government, on the opening day of a crucial climate summit where expectations of delegates, especially from Africa, are high. In adding impetus to delegates' hopes for a fair and legally binding climate deal, President Obama acknowledged the USA's historical contribution to the current problem and its readiness to take responsibility. However, Sam Ogallah, Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA) Programme Manager, said acknowledgements alone are not enough. "We have heard this before. Major pronouncements have been made before, but nothing has come to fruition yet. So, we are eager for further steps than what has been the case in the past," he said. In its COP21 position paper, the AfDB warns that Africa's hard-earned development progress could go into reverse if the new climate deal does not limit warming to 1.5\'cbC and provides more help for Africa to adapt to climate change. The AfDB, Africa's premier financial institution on climate change initiatives, particularly highlights Africa's vulnerability to climate change, a continent that is already suffering from its worst effects. The Bank emphasizes that a strong deal at the 2015 United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ) is particularly vital for Africa because the continent faces acute climate risks. "Climate change is the greatest challenge of our time in development. COP21 presents a unique opportunity to meet that challenge. The voice of Africa is crucial to ensure the success of COP21 . And the voice of Africa will be heard, said Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank Group. According to the Bank, seven Africans in 10 depend for their livelihoods on agriculture, which is the economic sector most vulnerable and exposed to climate impacts as over 90% of African agriculture relies on rainfall. Climate extremes such as drought, flooding, heat stress and tropical cyclones are set to become more intense and more frequent. In fact, experts warn that in some cases, today's climate extremes may become tomorrow's "normal" weather. Rising sea levels will threaten Africa' large coastal population, while agriculture, tourism, cities, water levels, health, energy and fisheries are already negatively affected, and the problems are set to intensify. And these issues were also highlighted by the COP21 President and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who identified terrorism and climate change as this century's greatest enemies and called on governments to step up their efforts: "The stakes are too high, and the menace of climate change is too great for us to be content with a minimalistic agreement. The Heads of State and Government who have come to Paris have come to express the voice of ambition," he said. Speaking at the opening ceremony, which was webcast live around the world, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres said that the eyes of millions of people around the world were on the governments meeting in Paris, not just figuratively but literally. "You have the opportunity, in fact the responsibility, to finalize an agreement that enables the achievement of national climate change goals, that delivers the necessary support for the developing world and that catalyses continuously increasing ambition and action by all," she told delegates. Figueres said that the past year had been a turning point and that after many years of hard work, the world was finally seeing that the direction towards a low-carbon, resilient future was irreversible. "This turning point is truly remarkable, but the task is not done. It is up to you to both capture this progress and chart an unequivocal path forward, with a clear destination, agreed milestones and a predictable timeline that responds to the demands of science and the urgency of the challenge," she said. On the eve of the COP21 conference, 184 countries covering around 95 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions had delivered their National Climate Action Plans-INDCs to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The world will find out if those goals and projections are attainable over the next two weeks as negotiations get underway. \</doc>

The Church of England issued the following news release: Nearly 50 pilgrims set off today on a 200-mile journey from London to Paris calling on world leaders to agree a fair, ambitious and binding climate deal at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. At a service at St Martin in the Fields to celebrate creation and bless the pilgrims before they leave London, the Bishop of Salisbury, the Rt Revd Nicholas Holtam, the Church of England's lead bishop on the environment, said: "We walk in solidarity for climate justice for the world's poorest and most vulnerable. We are all aware of the impact of climate change and we can not be the first generation to knowingly turn away from our responsibilities to protect the planet. These 50 pilgrims are highlighting the need for those involved in the climate change talks to reach an agreement that moves us towards a fairer, low-carbon future at Paris and beyond." The pilgrims will arrive in the French capital on the 27th November, as negotiators from more than 190 nations gather for the start of the talks. The pilgrims will be joining with other faith groups to hand in campaign petitions to Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), as well as participating in the mass mobilisation through the centre of the city, ensuring the Church has a strong voice in and around the talks. James Buchanan who is leading the Pilgrimage2Paris, said: "After months of hard work we are now on our way. This morning's service is a reminder of what is at stake at the upcoming UN Climate Change conference, and we can't wait to add our voice. There is no planet B so please do join us on this journey to Paris for climate justice." The pilgrimage has the backing of the Church of England and major aid agencies Christian Aid, CAFOD and Tearfund. Pilgrims will be staying in churches and in the houses of church members along the route, following in a centuries-old tradition. Join us on the journey.

Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore has used the 2015 Lifetime Achievement Award, bestowed on him by the Zayed Future Energy Prize in January, to provide critical funding to the COP21 climate action campaign, run by the Climate Reality Project. Gore established the Climate Reality Project, in 2006, to train volunteers to highlight the effects of climate change and ways to address it. The Climate Reality Project's 'Road-to-Paris' campaign aims to unite citizens, corporations and organisations, across the globe, to demand a strong agreement to dramatically cut emissions and accelerate the planet-wide shift to clean energy, at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP21 . The summit that will seek to achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate action will be held in Paris from 30 November to 11 December. The Zayed Future Energy Prize award has aided Climate Reality Project's core campaign work by financing branch offices in eight key countries - Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, the Philippines, South Africa and the United States - the leaders of which are being urged, by the Climate Reality Project, to make and keep to strong commitments at COP21 . It has also funded four Climate Reality Leadership Corps training sessions held in India, Canada and the United States. In the first six months of this year, the Climate Reality Project has trained 800 volunteers from across the world as Climate Reality Leaders. Many of these volunteers are students, teachers, or project managers in their fields. Collectively, the Climate Reality Leaders have completed 600 actions to combat climate change. Gore was awarded the Zayed Future Energy Prize for his personal and political commitment to raise international awareness about the dangers of climate change, while reinforcing optimism that the global community can and will successfully tackle the challenge.

The following information was released by the United Nations: As the United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ) reaches its final hours, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told delegates today that the world has been presented a historic document which promises to set it on a new path to a low-emissions, climate-resilient future. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the commitment, engagement and leadership of all the Heads of State, Government ministers and negotiators who have brought us so far in this very difficult negotiation, Mr. Ban said as all COP21 stakeholders prepared to receive the final draft outcome, the version which will be proposed for adoption. For the new universal climate change agreement to come into effect, the 196 Parties to the United Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will need to adopt the outcome document. At this morning's plenary meeting of the Committee of Paris [Comite de Paris]the body which is overseeing the negotiations at COP21the UN chief spoke alongside the President of France, Fran ois Hollande and the President of COP21 and French Foreign Minister, Laurent Fabius. The end is in sight. Let us now finish the job. The whole world is watching. Billions of people are relying on your wisdom, the Secretary-General declared. At the opening session of the conference on the last day of November, the UN chief had told 150 world leadersan unprecedented number to have shown up for such an occasionthat a political moment like this may not come again. Today, he said leaders have listened. They want a flexible, robust, meaningful, universal agreement that will help us rise as one to the climate challenge. The issues are many and complex. But we must not let the quest for perfection become the enemy of the public good, he warned. The solutions to climate change are on the table. They are ours for the taking. Let us have the courage to grasp them, he said ending his remarks, adding that he looks forward to joining delegates later today to celebrate the new agreement. Opening the floor in an emotional address during which he held back tears, Foreign Minister Fabius said if the world doesn't adopt the agreement, it is the credibility of multilateralism that would be in play. He announced that the document presented today as the final draft is differentiated, just, dynamic, balanced and legally binding. It calls for global temperature rise to be limited to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and endeavored to reach 1.5 degrees. It also provides for a transparency framework, monitoring progress every five years. It is rare to be given the opportunity to change the world, said President Fran ois Hollande, wrapping up the meeting. You have the opportunity to do that. \</doc>

Nov 30, 2015( International Business Times Australia: HYPERLINK http://au.ibtimes.com http://au.ibtimes.com United Nations Climate Change Conference 2015 is variously referred to as COP 21 and CMP 11. It will take place from Nov 30 to Dec 11 at Le Bourget - a suburban commune in Paris, France. Here are five things about the 2015 Climate Conference everyone needs\~to know and might be embarrassed to ask:<nl/> 1. The Paris Climate Conference of 2015 is the 21st annual session of the Conference of Parties to the 1992 UNFCCC[1] - the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It is also the 11th Meeting of the Parties to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol[2].<nl/> The 2015 Climate Conference aims to achieve a universal and legally binding agreement on climate change from all the countries on the globe. According to the organisers[3], the COP 21 , 'for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations, aims to achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2\'b0C.'<nl/> 2. Governments at the 2015 Climate Conference are expected to produce a continued agreement to tackle climate change.<nl/> The current greenhouse gas emission reduction targets of the Kyoto Protocol ran out in 2020. The countries will be expected to enter into agreement for the decade after 2020 and potentially beyond.<nl/> 3. The COP21 is the largest conference the French government has ever organised, according to CNN[4].<nl/> The UNFCCC has 196[5] member parties - a near universal number, while 192 parties of the UNFCCC have ratified the Kyoto Protocol. French Prime Minister Francois Hollande will welcome major world leaders such as US President Barack Obama, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.<nl/> 4. The crucial objective behind setting targets beyond 2020 is keeping global average temperature rise under 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels.<nl/> Scientists have warned that a continued rise in greenhouse gas emissions will breach this safety threshold and lead to catastrophic changes[6] in the global environment. Current emission trajectories are dangerously posed for a global temperature rise above 5 degrees.<nl/> 5. The 2015 Paris Climate Conference may be expected to see contentions regarding financing and Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) of developing countries.<nl/> The biggest emitters of greenhouse gases - China, the US and EU have already committed to emission reduction targets for the decade after 2020. According to The Guardian[7], poorer countries want the rich and developed world to provide them with financial help required to make clean technology investments in order to cut greenhouse gas emissions, as well as to mitigate the likely damage of climate change on their infrastrcuture.\~<nl/> Contact the writer at HYPERLINK mailto:feedback@ibtimes.com.au feedback@ibtimes.com.au HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/items/6036.php http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/items/6036.php [ 2]: \~ HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php [ 3]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.cop21paris.org/about/cop21 http://www.cop21paris.org/about/ HYPERLINK cop21 [ 4]: \~ HYPERLINK http://edition.cnn.com/2015/10/30/world/cop21-paris-conference-five-things/ http://edition.cnn.com/2015/10/30/world/ HYPERLINK cop21 -paris-conference-five-things/ HYPERLINK http://newsroom.unfccc.int/about http://newsroom.unfccc.int/about HYPERLINK http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/21/record-co2-emissions-committing-world-to-dangerous-climate-change http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/21/record-co2-emissions-committing-world-to-dangerous-climate-change [ 7]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/02/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-paris-climate-summit-and-un-talks http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/02/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-paris-climate-summit-and-un-talks \</doc>

Posted by Noosha Uddin on December 2, 2015 \'b7 Leave a Comment (Rob/Flickr) This Monday marked the beginning of the 21st annual United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP21 The objective is to reach a unanimous decision on keeping the rise in global temperature capped at two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2020 - a means of regulating how much greenhouse gas emissions each nation produces now in comparison to the pre\£dindustrial era and how much each needs to cut down. In short, it's meant to create a game plan in dealing with the current global climate crisis once and for all. But how can we be sure this conference isn't just another high profile meeting that leads to nothing but more debates on whether or not climate change is real? It's the one topic that U.S. politicians have been alone in arguing, while the rest of the world has moved on in at least recognizing it's an actual problem. Nevertheless, world leaders are hopeful, discussing what could be monumental for the next generation in a city recently struck with tragedy. The State of Emergency that French President Fran\'e7ois Hollande declared immediately following the Islamic State attacks calls for a ban on protests and demonstrations, a directive that's sparking unrest between policemen and climate activists. And so, outside the gates of what could be the most important conference of the time a too familiar dispute between the police and citizens of the state ensues once more. Notable speakers include U.S. president Barack Obama, who called upon other leaders to set an example for the next generation, since we're all waiting and watching to see what kind of mess us Millennials will have to clean up. Russia's president Vladimir Putin reiterated the point that the growth of the global economy is independent from gas emissions and stated that the participating nations "can ensure economic development and take care of our environment at the same time." Even president Xi Jinping, leader of the nation responsible for 28 percent of global CO2 emissions as of 2011 in China, is pledging to cut emissions by 2030. Why two degrees? The number was proposed by Yale economist William Nordhaus back in 1977, where he argues anything more than a two degree rise in temperature "would take the climate outside of the range of observations which have been made over the last several hundred thousand years." But even that may be too high of a threshold; nations among the equatorial regions are already experiencing intense hurricanes, crop shortages, decline in freshwater, and other normalized natural disasters that would've been categorized as rare occurrences a generation ago. Placing the cap at two degrees Celsius protects northern states - the richer states - from the impending climate crisis just a little longer. World leaders, business CEOs and activism groups can give speech after inflammatory speech calling for action, pledging to change and congratulating themselves on domestic cuts on greenhouse gas emissions. Ultimately, however, only a collaborative effort from all nations, business, non\£dgovernmental organizations, citizens and the like will prevent us from destroying the planet. COP21 has just begun; let's see how the next couple of weeks unfold. Noosha Uddin is a Collegian Columnist and can be reached at HYPERLINK mailto:nuddin@umass.edu nuddin@umass.edu \</doc>

Dartmouth alumni, faculty and students were among the many delegates and attendees at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. After approximately two weeks of negotiations and meetings, the conference culminated in 195 countries adopting the first legally binding and universal agreement on slowing global warming. The agreement, which comes into force in 2020, establishes an international action plan for avoiding dire climate change by limiting global warming to well below two degrees Celsius, according to the European Commission. Prominent among the Dartmouth participants in the conference, also known as COP21 , was U.S. State Department's special envoy for climate change Todd Stern '73, the lead negotiator for the U.S. delegation. Morgan Curtis '14 and Leehi Yona '16 both attended COP21 representing SustainUS, a youth-led delegation advocating for justice and sustainability in United Nations meetings on sustainable development, climate change, eradicating poverty, biodiversity loss and women's rights. As a youth delegate and a Dartmouth senior fellow, Yona followed the negotiations at the conference, conducted interviews of delegates and academics attending the conference, participated in symbolic protests and wrote opinion pieces, she said. Before arriving in Paris, Curtis spent the five months before the conference cycling and gathering stories in eleven countries on a Climate Journey project. She focused on grassroots mobilization in climate action and gathering the stories of people who have made the transition from individual to collective action for the climate. Curtis recalled her two weeks at the conference as the "most stimulating, difficult and transformative" of her life. A group of students from the Tuck School of Business also attended COP21 as observers. "It is important for my students who will be entering the work force soon to attend because we want them to be global leaders and think about their role as the cause and solutions to these climate change problems," Tuck School of Business professor and pioneer of the course "Business and Climate Change" Anant Sundaram said. Corporations are both the problem and solution to climate change as they are the biggest contributors to the emissions of greenhouse gases, Sundaram said. He added that the industry will have to do a lot of the research and development that goes into developing these clean energy technologies to solve the climate change problem. Patrick Turevon Tu'16, observed many of the "behind the scenes negotiations" and attended the various panels and lectures held throughout the second week of the conference. "I tried to attend a lot of the business lectures on building a clean energy market and investing in clean energy," Turevon said. Sundaram said he finds it important for his business students to see how global negotiations and consensus building processes work or do not work. The main objective of this annual conference is to review and revise the implementation of the Rio Convention, which in 1992, established a framework for action aimed at stabilizing the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Although delegates and leaders from countries meet annually, an agreement is not reached every year, environmental studies professor and Union of Concerned Scientists delegate at COP21 Anne Kapuscinski said. \~ "This [conference] was really important because the international agreement that these nations are currently operating from was the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2020," Kapuscinski said. "Countries have been hard at work for the past 20 years to negotiate a new agreement and it was understood and agreed upon that at this meeting, they were going to try to reach a new agreement for the global community." The countries at this conference took a more cooperative approach in Paris. States agreed to individually reduce their carbon emissions to a specific target rate and mutually enforce and coerce each other into continuing to lower their emission numbers in the future, Kapuscinski said. \~ Before and during COP21 , countries submitted individual comprehensive national climate action plans to reduce carbon emissions. The long-term goal of the plans was to keep the increase in global average temperature to below two degrees Celsius. The governments also agreed to track each country's commitment through an extensive transparency and accountability system. \~ The COP21 \~ Although the agreement is a step forward, Sundaram said he is less optimistic about its timeline. Yona expressed similar sentiments about some of the agreement's weaknesses. She said that the reality of the agreement, although positive on the surface, is that the sum of the individual commitments will be emissions well over the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit and around 3.5 degrees according to an independent study by Climate Interactive. \~ "The agreement is a big step forward, but at a time when we need a marathon," she said. The Paris agreements affect the Dartmouth community since it is a public statement about the end of the fossil fuel era. To meet the goals of this agreement, a "deep and systemic transformation of our energy systems" is needed, Curtis said.\~ \~ "With our $4.7 billion endowment still exposed to the fossil fuel industry, we must act swiftly to divest, demonstrating both our moral leadership and financial prudence," she added. \</doc>

The following information was released by the United Nations: With countries reaching a new agreement at the United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ), the global meeting has been qualified as a monumental triumph by top UN officials. While many continued to hail the outcome document as the walls of COP21 were torn down on Sunday, the UN News Centre looked back on other aspects that contributed positive energy to the two-week event. Highlighting what made COP21 green was Fanina Kodre-Alexander from the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), who manages communications on climate change, disasters and conflicts. She said UNEP worked with the organizers the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Government of France to ensure sustainability throughout the Paris-Le Bourget site located north-east of the capital. We work under our Eat, Think, Save campaign in collaboration with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, and we believe that food waste is the third largest emitter after a couple of countries, Ms. Koder-Alexander noted. To reduce waste, all the food provided at UNEP events, including those during COP21 , is sourced from rescued food, resources that would otherwise have been destroyed. Ms. Kodre-Alexander highlighted that its always provided in a very appetizing and lovely way. Another exciting feature at COP21 related to food, which attracted a lot of attention, was the boulangers brought on premise to avoid trucking kilos of fresh baguettes ever day. They welcomed the UN News Centre into their lab, which is visible to all conference-goers through a thin see-through plastic tarp. Every day, COP21 To go with the bread, of course theres cafe. Were very happy to see theyre using recyclable cups, said Ms. Kodre-Alexander. The method which theyve employed is that people are returning them to get a credit. Its quite successful and you dont see them left around and dropped in the garbage. Scenes from COP21 In addition, welcome packs handed out to all participants included water bottles to limit the number of plastic ones purchased. Water stations to fill these were abundantly found around every corner, similarly to the many recycling bins, clearly labeled to support the separation of paper, plastics and compostable organic waste. UNEP has also tried to be as paperless as possible, added Ms. Kodre-Alexander. There are certain documents that need to be printed and distributed but we believe in either providing links to our website or USB keys when available. On Saturday, the printed final draft of the agreement was handed out to delegates to review before they reconvened hours later for its adoption. This was a rare time paper was seen throughout the venue, as negotiators met in all free spaces including the cafeteria. Scenes from COP21 Meanwhile, several eco-friendly options were available to get to and from the site. In addition to free public buses, 300 electric cars were provided by Renault-Nissan to anyone seeking a ride. Reservations could be made online just hours in advance, or in person with a little extra wait time. Two hundred of the drivers were professional chauffeurs, while the rest volunteered to help limit COP21s carbon footprint. According to Renault-Nissan, a total of 16.32 tons of carbon dioxide were diverted during the two weeks thanks to the initiative. Scenes from COP21 While the cars recharged during the day, so did thousands of cell phones at power stations provided by a group called Solar Sound Systems. Unlike a typical plug, participants had to pedal to activate the charging. Similarly, this applied to making ones own juice and contributing to power a DJ booth located in the Generation Climat hall, a space open to the public and dedicated to the exchange of idea, mainly between younger climate advocates. Scenes from COP21 Scenes from COP21 Scenes from COP21 Despite all these green options, the UN News Centre asked Ms. Kodre-Alexander whether there was anything more she had wished to see at the conference. Personally for me its always the heating/air conditioning issue, she answered. I always find that if youre overheating the venues and then air conditioning others, youre consuming a lot of resources that would normally be saved. Perhaps this is an additional aspect to consider next year, when a new COP convenes next November in Marrakesh, Morocco. \</doc>

The World Affairs Council-Washington, DC (WAC-DC) hosted 180 students and teachers from the DC-metro area for the 'Youth Forum on Climate Change' at the historic Thurgood Marshall Center Trust in Washington, DC. The Forum - now in its 15th year - coincided with the COP21 - UN Conference on Climate Change Students learned about issues surrounding climate change, the effect on the global community, and how youth leaders can impact climate policy. "Climate change is significant," said Rachel Gebre, a sophomore from Benjamin Banneker High School in Washington, DC. "It has the potential to affect the next generation and it is important to emphasize that simple things can make a big difference." Students completed a mock- COP21 experience through interactive group simulation, and after learning the debate and decision process were inspired to act to address climate change in their own lives. "There is really no better time to take action than now," said Lilly Karim-Negad, a freshman at George C. Marshall High School in Virginia. "Our future depends on the actions we take today," added Tamara Muhammad, a sophomore from New Hope Academy in Maryland. "The Youth Forum provides a relevant platform for students to engage with their peers on an important issue affecting all of us, globally," said Amanda Stamp, Director-Global Education at the World Affairs Council-Washington, DC. "Students can apply the information they learned at the Youth Forum to their every-day lives to make a difference."

LE BOURGET, France  With just two days left to reach a deal, negotiators at the world climate talks released a new draft Wednesday that drops the most radical ideas - including an international tribunal to punish polluters - but leaves major issues unresolved, such as who should pay to help the most vulnerable nations cope with global warming. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry challenged diplomats to reach agreement by Friday's deadline, promising American funding for low-lying island nations and other countries hit hardest by the rising seas and extreme weather that scientists attribute to man-made emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. "Our aim can be nothing less than a steady transformation of the global economy," Kerry said. The new draft released by the U.N. climate agency is 29 pages, down from a 43-page version issued Saturday. There are about 100 places where there are decisions still to be made, including multiple options left in brackets, or blank spaces. "We have never been this close to a climate change agreement," said Maldives Environment Minister Thoriq Ibrahim, chairman of an alliance of island nations. "It's now up to us ministers to show the leadership needed to make hard decisions that put the interests of people and the planet ahead of shortsighted politics." Ministers from more than 190 countries are trying to craft the first climate accord asking all nations to reduce or slow their emissions. The previous agreement, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, required only rich countries to do so. Most man-made emissions come from the burning of oil, coal and gas - fossil fuels that meet about 80 percent of global energy demand. Replacing them with renewable sources like wind and solar power requires big investments, which poor countries say they can't afford without help. A previous draft suggested that intellectual property rights to clean technology be removed so that developing countries such as India could get access to it more easily. That was deleted from the latest draft. But the document doesn't settle the sensitive question of whether advanced developing countries such as China and oil-rich Arab nations should join industrialized countries in providing financial aid. It also doesn't spell out the long-term goal of the accord - whether it is to remove carbon emissions from the economy entirely or just reduce them. Nor does it settle whether governments will aim to limit the global temperature rise to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial times or closer to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. "It is not bold enough," European Climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete said of the draft. In an attempt to bridge the rich-poor divide that has often stalled progress in the U.N. talks, the foreign minister of the Marshall Islands, Tony de Brum, announced a "high-ambition coalition" including small island nations, the European Union and the United States, among others. It was not immediately clear whether the move would yield a breakthrough in the talks. At a plenary session in the evening, several developing countries, including India and Malaysia, accused wealthy nations of not living up to their commitments to provide climate aid for the poor. Earlier, Kerry announced that the U.S. will double its contribution to helping vulnerable nations adapt to the effects of climate change, increasing grant money to $860 million from $430 million by 2020. Developing nations have been demanding more money as they struggle with an increase in extreme weather events such as hurricanes, heavy rains and floods. \</doc>

The following information was released by the United Nations: A new stage in the development of a final agreement on climate change to limit global temperature rise to below two degrees Celsius or less has been reached today, according to the United Nations Assistant Secretary-General on Climate Change. All the delegations have received the documents, they're reading them, they will be discussing the paper in their groups, and then there will be feedback provided to a new plenary organized this evening, said Janos Pasztor in an interview with the UN News Service on the sidelines of the United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ). Following a long night of negotiations, the President of COP21 today held a plenary session, to release the new version of the draft agreement to government representatives who will continue meeting to settle the last outstanding issues, in view of its intended adoption on Friday. I am convinced we will be able to find an agreement but to achieve this we need to join our forces, we need to unite our efforts, and we need to be guided by this need to achieve compromises, Laurent Fabius, COP21 President and French Minister of Foreign Affairs, said during a meeting of the Paris Committee [Comite de Paris]. This Committee oversees the negotiations process and replaces the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP) established in 2011 at the 17th Conference of the Parties (COP17). The text that you will be receiving in a moment strives to reflect as faithfully as possible the compromises that are emerging, Mr. Fabius explained. The rule we have followed in all of this has been not to prejudge the resolution of the most political points contained therein, and to maintain a balance between the various options that remain open in the text. He called on delegates to continue discussions that will enable to reach a legally binding agreement that is also ambitious, balanced, durable and sustainable. However, he warned them this is not the final version of the document. In fact, it might still contain certain elements that are not quite precise yet or that are erroneously interpreted. Apologies in advance and we'll seek to remedy that, he said. Compared to the last draft, this one is 29 pages rather than 43. There has also been a three quarters reduction in the number of points that are left in square brackets. That is substantially better of course, but it's still too many, the Minister insisted, noting the issues on which negotiators have almost completed their work, and for which the text is clean. These include capacity building for mitigation and adaptation, adaptation to climate change impacts, issues of loss and damage, a transparency framework, and the development and transfer of technologies. Some initial progress has reportedly also been made on issues related to forests. Of course nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, he stressed, reminding delegates that certain political issues still remain to be decided upon and will be subject to in depth discussions, namely differentiation, financing, and the level of ambition of the agreement. On these issues we have sought to put forward clearer options which I hope will have reflected the diversity of the positions that have been voiced, and it is on these issues in particular that I will ask you to scale up your consultations, to speedily come to compromise solutions, he stressed. Finally, he said the situation can be summarized as follows: we've made progress but still a lot of work needs to be done. He then gave delegates until 8:00pm today to study the document closely before reconvening in the same setting for further discussions. Meanwhile, the United Nations Secretary-General is studying the document as he returns to COP21 . He is reading the documents as we speak, said Mr. Pasztor. We will be advising him to engage with some of the countries and hear from them what their view is on the document, and strategize together with countries on what could be done to move the document forward. \</doc>

The World Council of Churches issued the following news release: "Church leaders and other leaders of faith communities played a vital role in Paris," said Rev. Dr Olav Fykse Tveit, general secretary of the World Council of Churches (WCC), in an interview during the week following the COP21 UN conference on climate change . In Paris, he said, there was a creative interaction among civil society, the most vulnerable communities and politicians, "working together in ways we haven't seen before." He praised representatives of religious organizations for "learning to speak the same language" in "representing the voice of the poorest communities who are worst affected by climate change." "Monitoring and implementation of the Paris agreement are of the utmost importance now," Tveit continued, adding that pressure for environmental action must be maintained by religious bodies, civil society, business people and scientists. "We have to be strong in our conviction that implementation of the Paris accord is possible," he said, "and we must act to hold world leaders accountable to the commitments they have made." Since leaving Paris, Tveit has engaged in a series of meetings from Rome to London. The plight of refugees seeking shelter in Europe was one subject of discussion, as were COP21 and the papal encyclical on climate change, Laudato Si, released by Pope Francis earlier in the year. In Rome, Tveit met with Roman Catholic cardinal Peter Turkson of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, Professor Andrea Riccardi of the Sant'Egidio community and the newly elected president of the Federation of Protestant Churches in Italy, Rev. Luca Maria Negro. In London, Tveit met with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and with Archbishop Josiah Idowu-Fearon, general secretary of the world-wide Anglican Communion. At the conclusion of the week's travels, Tveit characterized his encounters as "very valuable meetings with discussions of many issues, including the possibility of building on the momentum of COP21 as religious leaders contribute to the ethical discourse at Davos early next year." The World Economic Forum will hold its annual meeting at Davos, Switzerland in late January 2016. Copyright Targeted News Services AutoTriage6yd 151218-5386731 MSTRUCK \</doc>

LE BOURGET, France  Attempts to inscribe a long-term goal to phase out carbon emissions in an envisioned global climate pact are facing pushback at U.N. talks from developing countries including India and Brazil. Negotiators from both countries said Wednesday that they favored sticking to the already established goal of limiting global warming to 3.6 degrees F above pre-industrial times - a level that scientists say could avoid the worst impacts of climate change. That goal was formally introduced in the U.N. talks in 2010. But many countries are calling for the Paris deal to include a road map on how to achieve it, such as a target for phasing out the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases blamed for global warming. Various options have been proposed. The United States and members of the Group of Seven wealthy countries endorsed earlier this year a "decarbonization of the global economy over the course of this century." "Decarbonization is something that has appeared recently. We don't even know what that means," Indian delegate Ajay Mathur said. "Does it mean zero carbon? Does it mean net zero carbon?" The term is generally understood to mean sharp reductions of carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, but it hasn't been defined precisely. Brazil's lead negotiator Antonio Marcondes said there was no need to come up with a new joint climate goal. Marcondes added that Brazil would consider options that emphasize that phasing out fossil fuels will be easier for some countries. He referred to a Brazilian-German declaration in August that backed a "decarbonization of the global economy" while noting that some countries will need help to transition to cleaner energy. The long-term goal is one of the issues that split the larger group of developing countries in the climate talks. Oil-rich Saudi Arabia opposes wording calling for a phase-out of carbon emissions, while island nations at risk from rising seas are among advocates. It's among the crunch issues that need to be resolved before negotiators can finalize what would be the first climate deal to ask all countries to limit their greenhouse gas emissions. "We must speed the process up because we have much work to do," French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told a news conference on Wednesday. \</doc>

(AP Photo / Jacky Naegelen)<nl/> Paris, France It's the first night of COP21 . Free food and action planning are the irresistible combination that draw dozens of youth to an art space in late-night Paris. The passion in the room is real. So is the fear as our generation bears the burden of unprecedented global upheaval. Ad Policy[1] <nl/>I ask myself: Why is it that we feel this issue so deeply, but global leaders do not? For us, the climate crisis is a matter of identity. It's personal, profound, existential. But for the heads of state who speak at COP21 , climate change is politics and policies. <nl/>    <nl/> My family watches the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy each holiday season. I look forward to the Ents' uprising, no matter how many times I've seen it. The Ents, for those unfamiliar with Tolkein's world, are the ancient tree-beings of Fangorn Forest in Middle Earth. They learn that the evil warlord Saruman is building power at the edge of the forest to wage a massive war. The Ents call a meeting to discuss how to address the threat. Their language (Ent-ish) is slow and tedious it takes them nearly all day simply to say 'hello.' <nl/> Merry and Pippin two Hobbits traveling with the Ents are outraged by the slow pace of conversation. If Saruman's forces win, their home the Shire and all of Middle Earth will be submerged in darkness and evil. Merry and Pippin frantically interrupt the Ents' discussion, pleading for a sense of urgency and rapid action. 'Our world teeters on the edge of doom!' they cry. 'Do something!' they scream. The Ents begrudgingly make their way to the edge of the forest to better understand Saruman's plans. <nl/> The Ents emerge from the deep woods to discover that Saruman has obliterated a massive tract of Fangorn Forest. They stand stunned, staring in disbelief at a hideous graveyard. Their mothers, fathers, cousins, aunts, uncles, sisters, brothers, friends had once stood proud on that land, but they were slaughtered as fuel for Saruman's takeover. Something shifts in the Ents' collective soul. Reeling in pain and shock, they let out mighty bellows to summon the entire forest. The Ents storm Saruman's castle and demolish his operations. GET THE LATEST NEWS AND ANALYSIS DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX EACH MORNING<nl/> <nl/>What shifted for the Ents? At first, Sarumon was a far-off political abstraction that didn't affect their sense of self and shared fate. But the assault on family and home turned a distant threat into an immediate challenge to their identity. In an instant of illumination and revulsion, the fight became personal. As suddenly as 'the bursting of a flood that had long been held back by a dike,' it had finally become clear that 'our trees and our lives are in great danger,' Tolkien wrote. <nl/> Climate change, for most, is a far-off political issue. It doesn't define who we are. This is because the climate movement is one of very few social movements that are not defined by identity. My wise friend Kirin Gupta rightly observed that the civil-rights, LGBTQ, women's-rights, and Black Lives Matter movements are each centered on a central aspect of our beings: gender, sexual orientation, race, religion. Whereas\~climate change is a scientific phenomenon. <nl/> How do we create common identity around climate change? How does everyone from youth activists to world leaders feel the crisis in their souls? We do it through love. Climate change becomes a personal issue of identity for all when we understand how it affects what we cherish. The sad reality is that the climate crisis has and will affect all of our lives. We will each experience an urgent connection with this emergency. Once something threatens who you are and what you love, you have no choice but to take action. <nl/> To each politician, global leader, and decision-maker at COP21 and beyond, I ask: What do you love? What are you willing to do for all that you hold dear? Can you feel the pain, the possibility, of losing your home, your family, your community? Hold on to that feeling. Bind it to your heart. That is what I feel. That is what my generation feels. <nl/> My greatest hope for COP21 is that global leaders can secretly become Ents. I hope that the endless effort of youth to convey the dire urgency of this crisis works its way into their hearts. I hope that they find a way to grasp what we feel and make it their own. If they do, it will become impossible to delay meaningful\~action any longer. I hope that they realize that they have the power and the ability to move beyond the slow ambiguous conversations of the status quo and lead the world out of crisis. Just like the Ents. <nl/> As they marched to challenge Saruman, the Ents' leader, Treebeard, declares: 'if we stayed at home and did nothing, doom would find us anyway, sooner or later. That thought has long been growing in our hearts; and that is why we are marching now . we may help the other peoples before we pass away.'<nl/> [ 1]: HYPERLINK http://www.thenation.com/advertising-policy http://www.thenation.com/advertising-policy \</doc>

Delta Group announced today that group founder Bruce Cheng would be leading management executives and representatives from the Delta Electronics Foundation to the COP21 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. To show Delta's active support for the goals of COP21 , the delegation will take part in Delta's Road to Paris Campaign activities through a number of side conferences and exhibitions to share the progress made by Delta in green buildings, energy conservation, and carbon reduction with representatives from around the world. An advance team from Delta set up a corporate display at the COP21 main venue on November 30. On December 1, they entered the Grand Palais to begin setting up the "Delta 21 Green Buildings Exhibition". Premiering a documentary that follows the Foundation from Lima (COP20) to Paris ( COP21 ), Delta will demonstrate its strength and continuous efforts in green buildings over the past year. During the press conference, Delta's advance team in Paris sent back first-hand imagery and shared their progress through an international video conference link. Delta is expanding its involvement with COP21 this year to showcase all of Delta's results in energy conservation and green buildings. Delta Founder and Honorary Chairman Bruce Cheng, Chairman Yancey Hai, CEO Ping Cheng as well as Director of Delta's Road to Paris Campaign and Executive Director of the Delta Electronics Foundation Ms. Shan-Shan Guo will all deliver speeches or take part in panel discussions at various official forums and side conferences. They will cover a variety of topics such as sustainable cities, innovative energy conservation and the carbon reduction of green buildings, as well as share Delta's strategy and success stories on pursuing sustainability. Group founder Bruce Cheng said that Delta is fighting against climate change by progressively increasing the efficiency of its power supply products. Delta's high-efficiency products and solutions have helped customers save nearly 14.8 billion kWh of electricity and reduced carbon emissions by about 7.9 million tons of CO2e from 2010 to 2014, exceeding the total annual carbon emissions of some countries. Delta also actively supports the Commit to Action corporate carbon reduction initiative of the CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project). Having already reduced its energy use intensity by 50% over the last 5 years, Delta is now committed to a further reduction of 30% by 2020. He hoped that COP21 would bring the efforts made by Delta to the attention of the world and called for more businesses and people around the world to join in the fight against climate change. Delta has also compiled its experience and commitment to energy conservation into its Delta's Plan for Action on Climate Change to show Delta's active support for the goals of COP21 , COP21 . Delta has long focused on improving the efficiency of energy use and provides not only the expertise to the three key requirements of Communications, Connectivity and Computing essential to smart cities, but also high-efficiency energy storage, smart grids, electric vehicle charging, energy management and renewable energy solutions that can be used to build a low-carbon power infrastructure for cities. At the "Sustainable Innovation Forum", a key event at COP21 that will be held at the Stade de France on December 7, Mr. Hai will take to the stage along with representatives from national governments and leading companies to promote their perspectives on sustainable cities. Director of Delta's Road to Paris Campaign and Executive Director of the Foundation Ms. Shan-Shan Guo stated that the Delta Foundation hosted its first side event at COP20 Lima in 2014. Their presentation on the rebuilding of Namasia MinQuan Elementary School using green buildings gained significant international attention. This time at COP21 Paris, as negotiators from countries try to reach a legally binding climate agreement, Delta will take this opportunity on the international stage to highlight its energy-saving practices as an enterprise through various side events. At the same time, Delta will demonstrate its technical strength through the exhibition with a large-screen film in the Grand Palais in Paris. Delta will show both its concerns in climate change and commitment to carbon reduction.

By Nilanjan Ghosh From this month end (November 30 to December 11), the United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP21 is beginning in Paris. This will be the 21st annual session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 21 ) to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 11th session of the Meeting of the Parties (CMP 11) to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The objective of the 2015 conference is to achieve, for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations, a binding and universal agreement on climate, from all the nations of the world with an overarching goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature increase to 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. I have my clear doubts on whether a binding and universal agreement can emerge. The reasons for my cynicism are not one. The first point of contention arises from the differential impacts of climate change on the developing and the developed nations. Recently, a number of authors have opened up a whole new area of research by using the natural variations in temperature among different years caused by the El Ni\'f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which produces extreme weather conditions in different parts of the world. For instance, research by Solomon Hsiang and colleagues shows that for rich countries, an additional degree of warming has a nominal effect, but for poor countries, the same change leads to very significant costs in the form of reduced economic growth and increased costs of military and other conflicts. This is akin to what Thomas Homer-Dixon, cherished political scientist, talked of in the 1990s, when he hypothesized about the environmental scarcities leading to the violent conflicts, and the limited capacity of the poor nations to cope up with the problems, due to the "ingenuity gap", the critical gap between our need for ideas to solve complex problems and our actual supply of those ideas. The second point of contention is the concern of distributive justice. The concern begins with: who pays for damages? Most developing countries firmly believe that mitigation should start in the rich countries that bear the largest part of the responsibility for historical emissions. How can one deny the position that the developed world has grown by emitting, whereas the developing and poor world are still on the learning curve? Can one deny the position that only after historically emitting CO2 extensively they have started talking of the perils of the planet, and want the developing world to share parts of the responsibility for the follies committed by them? The very suggestion that all countries should reduce their emissions by similar percentages clearly favors the countries that have large emissions today. Therefore, the calls that the developed nations should compensate the developing nations for the losses caused by the former to the latter through pollution damages also impinging on the ecosystem services is proper, just, and equitable. The third point of contention arises with the capacity of the scientific knowledge and skilled manpower of developing and poor nations to defend their interests in the international climate negotiations. The risks are different across the globe some developing countries have much to lose from climate change, while others are more concerned over the costs of global agreements that will limit their markets for fossil fuel or hamper their perceived chances of development. As a result, building coalitions, even among the low-income countries, will be very difficult. The fourth point of contention arises from the divergence in priorities. Interestingly, the divergence in goals between developed and developing nations can be witnessed in the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted by developed and developing nations. Whereas the INDCs of the developed world like US, EU, and Japan do not consist of the term "adaptation" but only consist of the "mitigation" commitments, the developing and emerging nations have a significant portion of INDC's dedicated to "adaptation". The need to adapt arises for the poor of the developing world because of livelihoods losses due to ecosystem service losses. The bigger concern of climate change and global warming for the poorer nations is the changes in the land use patterns and forest cover, resulting in changes in ecosystem structures and functions, thereby impeding on the various ecosystem services. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) of 2005 enhanced human understanding of nature's capacity to provide ecosystem services (benefits) to the human society in the form of provisioning services (e.g., food, raw materials, genetic resources, water, minerals, medicinal resources, energy, etc), regulating services (e.g., carbon sequestration, climate regulation, pest and disease control, etc), cultural services (tourism, religion, etc), and above all, supporting services that are necessary for production of all other ecosystem services (e.g. nutrient recycling, gene-pool protection, primary production, soil formation, etc). For the poor people in the developing world, the ecosystem services adds up or complements their low incomes, and is often referred to as "GDP of the poor". So, the concern of the poor nations is with the impacts of global warming and climate change on ecosystems-livelihoods linkages, and not really carbon-dioxide emission! How can the poor adapt to such vulnerabilities? Who will pay for this adaptation? The fifth issue of contention arises again from the perspective of understanding the local priorities and bringing them in global platforms like COP 21 . Developing nations including India has failed to do that so far! India will again fail to bring that, as I see it, simply because of complying with the carbon-centric approach of global negotiations, as decided by the prime movers of this negotiating process, which are primarily the developed nations. With India being one of the lowest per capita emitter of CO2, its bigger concern is the concern of the poor who are getting poorer because of the losses in the ecosystem services due to global warming and climate change. Unfortunately, the Indian dialogue initiators in the global platform, most of whom will be retired bureaucrats, are likely to adopt the same techno-centric and carbon-centric approach, and argue on lines of mitigation. They will yet again fail to bring in the concern of ecosystems-livelihoods linkages, and the impacts of climate change on the vulnerable sections of the community, especially women and children. After all, that is not the priority of the developed world, who has proclaimed about their priorities of mitigation only in their INDCs.

Dec 02, 2015( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com Today marks the opening of COP 21 in Paris where Government leaders will negotiate an agreement to reduce emissions and put us on a path towards climate neutrality. The recent attacks underscore the importance of these negotiations and the opportunity for the global community to come together to address one of the most critical issues of our time.<nl/> We are encouraged by the political will of global leaders from more than 190 countries to reach an agreement and, at the same time, never before have we seen this level of engagement from the private sector. It is clear that the momentum is unstoppable.<nl/> It is no longer a question of if we transition to a low-carbon economy. Rather, it is a question of how. The private sector can help to fill the gap between what has been committed by Governments though the INDCs and what is needed to reach carbon neutrality in the second half of the century.<nl/> The UN Global Compact is playing a vital role in this process. We have built the largest coalition of businesses that are taking action on climate and have consistently challenged companies to go further in transforming their business models, adopting policies that reduce their emissions and being transparent about their efforts.<nl/> Since 2007, through our Caring for Climate initiative, we have brought over 450 companies together to call for a robust international agreement, recognizing that this is essential for providing predictability, unlocking capital and advancing the power of sustainable business.<nl/> Now, we will be in Paris to support an international agreement that sends the right market signals to reward responsible business and put a stop to damaging behaviours. Our Business Forum on December 8th is the official platform for business at COP21 to showcase corporate leadership on climate in key areas like carbon pricing, responsible policy engagement, science-based targets and adaptation.<nl/> While we have seen an acceleration in the pace and ambition of corporate sustainability as the risks and opportunities have become more apparent, we know that this is not enough. We need 100% participation from the business community.<nl/> An agreement in Paris is the catalyst needed to mobilize the majority of companies to join this movement and accelerate progress.

Dec 16, 2015( Western Free Press: http://www.westernfreepress.com/Delivered http://www.westernfreepress.com/Delivered by Newstex) ;; Heartland's James Taylor enjoying his warm welcome to Paris for COP-21 The Heartland Institute just got back from Paris for COP-21 [1], the 'Conference of the Parties,' commonly known as the United Nations' annual global climate conference. The world declared COP-21 a historic moment: The 'Paris Agreement' will stop humanity from raising the global temperature by 2 degrees Celsius before the end of the 21st Century! Balderdash! Hubris of the highest order. Not only does humanity not have the ability to put its collective hand on the global thermostat, humans are not causing a climate crisis. Heartland's contingent to Paris presented something unique and sorely needed: the only examination and explanation of the latest climate science, economics, and sensible global energy policy one could find in the city. For committing that sin heresy against what has become to many a sort of religion Heartland was subjected to protests. We brought reason and science. The environmental extremists pasted all over Paris 'WANTED' posters, accusing us of being 'Climate Criminals.' Well, then. Bring it on!

As host for the 21 st United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ), which took place over a span of nearly two weeks, from November 30 to December 12, Paris Le Bourget proved a safe and productive venue for the 40,000 people who attended. Viparis, the company that manages Paris Le Bourget and nine other conference centers and expositions venues in greater Paris, reports that COP21 went off without incident following the terrorist attacks in Paris on November 13. "This conference of unprecedented scale was a real success from an organizational point of view," said Pierre-Henri Guignard, Secretary-General responsible for organizing COP21 . "The safety and security measures allowed us to meet the requirements inherent to such an event." [CHARTBEAT:3] More than 850,000 square feet of temporary spaces were constructed at Le Bourget exhibition complex to accommodate the conference's needs. Among the 40,000 attendees were 155 heads of state and 117 government ministers. In addition to COP21 , Viparis also successfully hosted events at its other sites between November 17 and 28. These included EWEA (the world's largest offshore wind energy event), the annual meeting of the French Dental Association, and Milipol (the worldwide exhibition of internal state security). "The efforts by government officials and heightened security measures in and around the Paris Nord Villepinte site ensured that the event was held in total safety," according to a spokesperson for Milipol. "We are pleased to note that we welcomed 24,056 visitors from 143 countries." Conveying future confidence in Paris as a congress site, EuroPCR, the official congress of the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions, will hold its congress in the Palais des Congr\'e8s de Paris for the next three years (2016-2018) with annual attendance of 14,000 participants expected from all over the world. \</doc>

The following information was released by the World Health Organization: This week's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) in Paris offers a chance to save the planet from severe, pervasive and irreversible damage. Though often lost in the debate, saving the planet also means saving the conditions that sustain human life in good health. If sufficiently ambitious and effective, the climate agreement will be a major turning point in environmental policy, but also a far-reaching treaty for protecting public health. The stakes are high. Unless a deal is clinched to keep the temperature rise within two degrees Celsius, the consequences will be catastrophic. Many of the same inefficient and polluting energy choices that are driving climate change are also devastating human health. Climate change degrades air quality, reduces food security and compromises water supplies and sanitation. Climate change and heatlh WHO estimates that, each year, more than 7 million deaths worldwide can be attributed to air pollution. Climate change is also causing tens of thousands of yearly deaths from other causes. Records for extreme weather events -- like droughts and floods, storm surges, heatwaves and wildfires -- are being broken a record number of times, claiming human lives and livelihoods. The World Meteorological Organization says 2015 is already the hottest year since records began in 1880. Next year is predicted to be even hotter. Droughts, especially in poor countries where subsistence farming is rain-fed, threaten already perilous food supplies. Outbreaks of cholera thrive under conditions of too much or too little water. Insects and other carriers of disease are exquisitely sensitive to variations in heat, humidity and rainfall. Climate change has already given dengue a vastly expanded geographical range and may do the same for malaria. Experts predict that, by 2030, climate change will be causing an additional 250,000 deaths each year just from malaria, diarrhoeal disease, heat stress and undernutrition. Investing in better health Implementing and enforcing higher standards for vehicle emissions and engine efficiency can reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants, like black carbon and methane. Doing so could save at least 2.4 million lives a year by 2030 and reduce global warming by about 0.5o C by 2050. New estimates could raise that to 3.5 million lives saved annually by 2030, and between 3 to 5 million lives per year by 2050. Policies that promote walking and cycling bring added dividends for health. In preparation for COP21 , countries have made important commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions and scale up adaptation to climate change, but more needs to be done. If the right commitments are made, efforts to combat climate change will produce an environment with cleaner air, more abundant and safer freshwater and food, and more effective and fair systems for social protection. Healthier people -- arguably the world's most important resource -- will be the bonus. Earlier this year, member states of the United Nations agreed on a set of supremely ambitious goals and targets for sustainable development that leaves no one behind. Without a strong climate deal, most of the 17 goals will be utopian. The tremendous progress made since the start of this century in reducing deaths among children and during childbirth, and turning the epidemics of AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis around is likewise at stake. All these hard-won gains can easily be swept away by the tidal wave of health threats unleashed by climate change. We are recklessly late in taking action and must not fail. A ruined planet cannot sustain human lives in good health. \</doc>

The following information was released by the United Nations: Dozens of non-governmental organizations rallying outside the United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ) in Paris today voiced the importance of bringing more women to the forefront of discussions, both in terms of who is negotiating the new climate agreement and what will be written within its pages. Women will not give up on the planet, said Titi Akosa, a Nigerian lawyer and the Executive Director of the Centre for 21st Century Issues, who led much of the action at the rally and brought impressive energy, chanting we're [going to] keep on moving forward, never turning back, never turning back. The second week of negotiations to reach a climate deal began yesterday; they are due to end within days, and are expected to produce a document guiding international policy on climate change to limit global temperature rise to below two degrees Celsius. We were very distressed two months ago when all gender related references that were there in the text were streamlined out, Lakshmi Puri, UN Women Deputy Executive Director, told the UN News Service ahead of 'Gender Day,' marked Tuesday at COP21 . Ms. Puri explained that the agreement currently being negotiated makes reference to gender equality, women's empowerment, as well as women's leadership and role in the preamble, while also referencing gender responsive adaptation, gender sensitive financing, and gender responsive capacity building in its body. Unfortunately, it wasn't there in the technology part, but we hope to see it inserted, she pointed out. Meanwhile, at the rally outside the conference halls, which include 32 negotiating rooms, gender imbalance was a term used by many who still don't believe their rights are being fully considered. This morning we have been with the women ministers from all over the world to tell them that we need them to stand strong in the negotiations on behalf of women, and talk to their delegations so that they will do what is just and right for women, stressed Ms. Akosa. Also speaking to the crowd with a loud, persuasive voice was Lean Deleon, an American with ties to the Philippines who identifies as a gender-nonconforming person. Zie [gender-neutral pronoun] was there representing the Women's Major Group, which works to promote sustainable development and gender equality. We want to say that with the current crisis of climate, women and the marginalized are mostly being affected, Lean Deleon explained. They do not have access to the table to make these decisions, so we want to make sure that we amplify the voices coming from the grassroots communities. According to UN Women, climate change affects women and girls in particular, as many spend a disproportionate amount of time searching for food, fuel and water, or struggling to grow crops. This close relationship with their surroundings also signifies that women need to be part of the solution. The women we work with around the world the first thing they'll say to us is you know what, we're not victims, we're the solutions, and they're really right, because 60 to 80 per cent of all household food production in developing countries is done by women, said Osprey Orielle Lake, the co-founder and Executive Director of WECAN the Women's Earth and Climate Action Network. UN studies show that if you have all these different water programmes in developing countries, if you don't involve women in the decision making around it, the programmes don't work because the local water knowledge is held by women and also they're the ones collecting the water, she further stressed. Just days away from discovering what elements will figure into the new climate change agreement in Paris, those fighting for gender equality are continuing to raise their voices for more seats at the decision-making table, while the UN also pursues its work to empower women and girls as key leaders and agents of change. \</doc>

The following information was released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Spain: The State Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Ignacio Ybaez, took part on Thursday in the ministerial meeting of the ASEM Asia-Europe dialogue in Luxemburg. Driving connectivity between Europe and Asia was at the core of the work of this ASEM meeting, connectivity not only conceived as the development of physical infrastructures and conventional and legal frameworks for the transport of people, goods and services between the two continents, but more significantly on the wealth of contacts between institutions and, especially, between civil society in the two regions. The second major strand of Thursday's ASEM meeting was the fight against climate change, a current affairs issue at a time when we are on the verge of the United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in Paris from 30 November to 11 December ( COP 21 ). Although it can be seen that there is a shared intent on the part of the two regions for COP21 to be a success, differences remain in terms of the ambition of its results, the distribution of the burden between countries according to their level of development and on the physical and legal effects of forest fires. The situation in the South China Sea was another of the issues tackled at the ASEM meeting, without an agreement being reached. The Spanish delegation highlighted its confidence in dialogue and respect for international law as a means to resolve differences. The situation in the Korean Peninsula was also discussed. In his speech, State Secretary Ybaez highlighted the importance placed by Spain on initiatives that will configure the world and globalisation in the coming decades, such as the Transpacific Partnership (TPP), the One Belt One Road initiative and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, of which Spain is a founding member. He also underlined the geographic position and excellent infrastructure in Spain as a port of entry to Europe of the new Silk Road through the Mediterranean and for the connection between Euro-Asian economies and Africa and America. On the sidelines of the ASEM meeting, Ignacio Ybaez held bilateral meetings with his counterparts from Singapore and Norway and with the Executive Director of the Asia-Europe Foundation (ASEF), among other contacts. \</doc>

However historically, international negotiations have not recognized the significant contributions that cities can make in cutting carbon emissions. The Climate Summit for Local Leaders will bring cities' and local governments' commitments into the United Nations process, for the first time, to ensure their efforts are reflected there. Participants will deliver a declaration of their commitments to UN negotiators at the end of the Summit.

The World Council of Churches issued the following news release: In a recent statement, religious leaders called for an ambitious climate agreement, reminding all governments to commit to emission cuts and climate risk reduction. They promised to continue working for climate justice, including divestment from fossil energy. The statement was developed by the World Council of Churches (WCC), ACT Alliance, CIDSE - an international alliance of Catholic development agencies and Religions for Peace with regard to the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 21 ) in Paris. The statement was handed to the secretary general of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Christiana Figueres, on 19 October in Bonn, Germany. This was on the occasion of the last round of climate negotiations before COP21 and the inter-sessional meeting of faith leaders from various traditions. "As representatives of the majority of the global population who live with religious affiliations and values, we will not only hold leaders to account, but will also support politicians working towards an ambitious global climate agreement in Paris and beyond", reads the statement. The statement is a follow-up to the Interfaith Summit on Climate Change organized by Religions for Peace and the WCC in September 2014 in New York, as well as Pope Francis' Encyclical on "care for our common home". The document also refers to international faith initiatives such as pilgrimages for climate justice and fasting for the climate. Dr Guillermo Kerber, WCC programme executive for Care for Creation and Climate Justice, said, "Once again faith leaders have expressed an urgent need for a fair, ambitious and binding treaty as an outcome from Paris. Time is running out, and present commitments by states, although relevant, do not match with the needs of people in the most vulnerable communities in various places who are already suffering the impacts of climate change." Religious leaders have argued in the statement that an ambitious Paris agreement is not only a scientific, political and economic necessity but also a fundamental ethical and moral challenge, and the religious communities immensely care about it. In the statement they also referred to five key religious convictions regarding climate justice that they share across different faith contexts. They stressed that COP 21 offers the right momentum to translate fundamental values and beliefs into concrete climate action, leading to transformation towards a zero carbon, climate resilient, more equitable and just future. Apart from addressing governments, the statement calls on all other stakeholders in climate negotiations to act responsibly and strengthen their efforts. A firm commitment by the signatories of the statement was made to focus on their own emission reduction targets, to continue addressing climate risks, raise climate consciousness and divest from fossil fuels.

The following information was released by the United Nations: A powerful online research tool launched today in Paris at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) offers a window on the world's global future to the 2080s, according to the UN World Food Programme (WFP). What the tool shows us is that we must reduce emissions and we must also invest in adaptation, Ertharin Cousin, the Executive Director of WFP, told the UN News Service in an interview following the launch of the new map at a COP21 press briefing. Reducing emissions without investing in adaptation will not allow us to deliver the durable, sustainable results over the next century to ensure that we can provide the prosperity and peace that the 2030 Agenda [for Sustainable Development] so boldly supports, she added. Ms. Cousins further highlighted that the map paints a stark picture of how climate disasters drive hunger: In Paris, we must decide between a future world where ending hunger is achievable or one where we and every future generation continue this losing struggle responding to the scourge of global hunger, she said. In less than two weeks, Member States are expected to adopt a new universal climate change agreement intended to limit the global temperature rise to below two degrees Celsius. Experts have reported that a rise beyond this level will cause irreversible damage to the planet by exacerbating droughts, floods, food and water shortages, affecting the most vulnerable countries first. According to WFP, the new research toolcalled the Food Insecurity and Climate Change Vulnerability mapexamines how over time climate change may increase hunger vulnerability across the globe. Depending on the outcome of the Paris negotiations, the agency says future generations will inherit a world with less vulnerability than today, or a world significantly more vulnerable to food insecurity. Produced with the Met Office Hadley Centre, it illustrates how strong adaptation and mitigation efforts can prevent the worst impacts of climate change on hunger globally and help make people less vulnerable to food insecurity. But it also shows how failure to adapt along with increases in greenhouse gas emissions, could increase the vulnerability of millions of people to hunger and malnutrition. Helping vulnerable people adapt and build their resilience to climate related disruptions requires identifying sufficient and predictable funding, while simultaneously investing in a low carbon future, Ms. Cousin said. Only if leaders get it right in Paris will we end hunger by 2030 and provide future generations with the opportunity to enjoy sustainable and durable global food security. The map incorporates five years of research between WFP's food security experts and world-renowned scientists from the Met Office Hadley Centre. It shows how climate change affects food security vulnerability in least developed countries today, and through sophisticated projections, the extent to which it will do so in the future, depending on climate action. Users can select a time present day, 2050s and 2080s and view vulnerability to climate-induced hunger (low at white, high at deep red) according to adaptation efforts and levels of emissions. Our joint research shows how climate change can affect the scale and geography of food insecurity, and how adaptation and mitigation can address the challenges of future food insecurity in developing and least-developed countries, said Kirsty Lewis, a Climate Security Science Manager at the Met Office, in a press release. In the meantime, WFP recalled that climate disasters affect hungry and vulnerable people disproportionately, and that such disasters increase hunger by destroying land, livestock, crops and food supplies, making it harder for people to access markets and food networks. \</doc>

Dec 07, 2015( The Huffington Post: HYPERLINK http://www.huffingtonpost.com http://www.huffingtonpost.com United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 21 [1]).<nl/><nl/>The project, dubbed One Heart One Tree, projected "virtual forests onto the Eiffel Tower in order to encourage the reforestation of the planet,' Mestaoui told HuffPost Tunisia.<nl/> <nl/>The interactive digital installation turned the Eiffel Tower green from Nov. 29 to Dec. 3. Participants around the globe downloaded the One Heart One Tree[2]\~app, which could detect their heartbeats and used them to create the flora projected onto the Paris landmark. Also projected on the tower were the names of the app users, along with personal messages they wrote.\~<nl/><nl/>There is no conflict between nature and technology; quite the opposite, they can go hand in hand.<nl/>Naziha Mestaoui<nl/><nl/> <nl/><nl/>But the initiative doesn't end with the simple virtual projection. With a charitable donation, users could pick a location to plant actual trees -- in Australia, Brazil, Senegal, India, France, Peru or the Ivory Coast. They will be able to follow their tree's growth for three years, thanks to the app.<nl/><nl/>"So far, we've counted 52,000 trees that are going to be planted," Mestaoui said. This has significantly surpassed the artist's exceptions; she had hoped to plant at least 180 trees[3], to cancel out the carbon footprint left by the large-scale digital installation. <nl/><nl/> The artist's objective is "using technology to reconnect with nature," she said. <nl/><nl/>This marriage of technology and nature is a way for the artist to help us understand that contrary to "preconceived notions that would prefer environmentalists to be anti-technology, there is no conflict between nature and technology; quite the opposite, they can go hand in hand," she explained.<nl/><nl/>"It's up to us to build bridges to connect the different sectors," Mestaoui said. "Art serves above all to connect, to show us the world, to stimulate the imagination, and to expand the realm of what's possible."<nl/><nl/>The planet's future is at the center of the COP 21 debates, but for Mestaoui, beyond political decisions, it's social decisions that can bring about change.\~"We are creating the future that we're heading toward, the future that we want,' the artist said.<nl/><nl/>\~This story originally appeared on\~HuffPost Tunisia[4]\~and has been translated into English. <nl/> This article originally appeared on The Huffington Post HYPERLINK http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/virtual-trees-forest-eiffel-towel_5665aa35e4b079b2818f3113<nl/> http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/virtual-trees-forest-eiffel-towel_5665aa35e4b079b2818f3113<nl/> [ 1]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paris-climate-talks_56454bd6e4b045bf3dee964a?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paris-climate-talks_56454bd6e4b045bf3dee964a?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 2]: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1188361087/1-heart-1-tree?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1188361087/1-heart-1-tree?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 3]: \~ HYPERLINK http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/feed-a-digital-forest-on-the-eiffel-tower-with-your-heartbeat?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/feed-a-digital-forest-on-the-eiffel-tower-with-your-heartbeat?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 4]: \~ http://www.huffpostmaghreb.com/2015/12/04/tunisie-cop21-naziha-mest_n_8706664.html?utm_hp_ref=maghreb...d=txtlnkusaolp00000603 http://www.huffpostmaghreb.com/2015/12/04/tunisie- HYPERLINK cop21 -naziha-mest_n_8706664.html?utm_hp_ref=maghreb...d=txtlnkusaolp00000603 \</doc>

The following information was released by the University of Vermont: Jennie Stephens, Blittersdorf Professor of Science and Policy, is one of four UVM people three faculty members and one student to make the trip to Paris for the United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP21 . One week in, Stephens shares her perspective on the events surrounding the negotiations, how this year's COP differs from those of the past, and the feelings of both hope and futility in the air as world leaders attempt to create a plan to keep global warming below two degrees Celsius. Read her thoughts: Reflecting on my experiences in Paris during the first week of the international climate negotiations, I am struck by the paradoxes the tangible tensions between hope and frustration, between optimism and futility. Among the thousands of international visitors in Paris for the climate conference including the official national delegations of negotiators as well as the many more representing NGOs, private sector organizations, environmental activists, the energy industry (both fossil fuel and renewables), universities, youth, parents, and other parts of civil society there is a diversity in perspectives and priorities that includes both a simultaneous sense of unprecedented positive collective action as well as assumed inadequacy in the highly anticipated agreement scheduled to be finalized by the end of the week. Last week began with motivating speeches by prominent world leaders, including the president of France, the prince of Wales, and President Obama highlighting the urgency and significance of the Paris negotiations. Unlike the disappointing 2009 Copenhagen Accord which was pieced together at the eleventh hour by a few prominent leaders on the last night of COP15, the organizers this time strategically coordinated the heads-of-state to show up at the beginning (rather than the end) of the two-week negotiations to offer support and encouragement for the process ahead. These speeches also acknowledged links between climate disruption and security, offering condolences and solidarity to the people of Paris as they recover from the tragic terrorist attacks of Nov. 13. Chilling effect of the attacks Before the attacks, an unprecedented level of civic engagement, mass mobilization, protests, demonstrations and marches on the streets of Paris was anticipated. But in response to the attacks, the French government declared a state of emergency prohibiting for three months any gatherings of people for political purposes. While sports and music events are allowed, events that bring people together in public places with political messages are illegal. So instead of the large climate march on the Sunday before the meetings started, activists organized a distributed human chain with people holding hands along the march route. The plan for how activists will conclude the two weeks, how to replace the huge march that was originally planned for Saturday Dec. 12, is still emerging with tentative plans for a single police-authorized event in a stadium in the southern part of the city (far from the official conference site). Despite scaling back of the demonstrations on the streets of Paris, many other publicly accessible events of all kinds have proceeded within the official conference center and in multiple other venues throughout the city. With the People's Climate Summit organized for this weekend, a concentration of public events are happening now. Among the highlights of the events I attended, a panel on fossil fuel divestment was inspirational as international leaders of the divest-invest movement described the growing impact of this rapidly expanding social movement. At this event I connected with Bill McKibben, Vermont resident and founder of 350.org and heard from Stephen Heintz, of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, who talked about how the divestment-investment movement is changing the world of philanthropy, and Jess Worth of "BP or not BP?" who described efforts to reduce corporate fossil fuel donations to museums and cultural events. Ice inspires Another highlight included a stunning art exhibit in front of the historic Pantheon in the Paris city center where twelve huge blocks of ice broken off from the Greenland ice sheet are arranged in a circle to represent a clock. Throughout the two weeks of the climate negotiations these pieces of ice are gradually melting, representing the limited time left to take effective action. This artistic expression of urgency, demonstrates in a very simple and tangible way the precarious global situation. This powerful exhibit, funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, was coordinated by two Danish artists (Olafur Eliassson and Minik Rosing). The ice melting in Paris represents for me the paradoxes of climate change and the Paris negotiations. We simultaneously understand on one level that these efforts are in some ways futile (we are already locked in to a severe degree of climate disruption even if/when we can achieve drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions) while on another level these unprecedented efforts of collective action represent extreme optimism and hope. At a personal level, the growing level of commitment and passion to address climate change, demonstrated by individuals and organizations in Paris and around the world, offers great inspiration. \</doc>

The following information was released by the office of the Federal Chancellor of Germany: Mr President, my dear friend Fran ois Hollande, Secretary-General, Colleagues, We are meeting here in Paris in turbulent and worrying times. Only a few days ago, not far from this venue, terrorists launched an attack on the people of Paris, and by extension on us all. We condemn terrorism wherever it strikes. By coming here today we are demonstrating that we are stronger than any terrorists. Today, heads of government from some 150 countries have the chance to look beyond all the controversies and differing interests, and to send a very clear joint message a message that will determine the future of our planet. At stake are the foundations on which the life of future generations will depend. We are well aware of the need to act today. That is what this Conference is all about. That is the defining feature of the outcome we will have to agree on in the next few days. I would like to start off by thanking everyone involved in preparing this meeting, in particular the French Government and the United Nations. After a long hiatus, we now have the chance to reach our goal an international agreement. Put simply, this means no more and no less than ensuring that the rise in global temperatures remains under 2C in comparison with pre"industrial levels. This goal is necessary. But, as the small island states show, it is not sufficient. We therefore need a UN agreement which is ambitious, which is comprehensive, which is fair and which is binding. What does that mean? Let's look at these four elements individually. First comes ambitious: For the very first time, more than 170 countries industrialised nations, emerging economies and developing countries have submitted information on their intended national contributions towards reaching the 2C target. The good news is that these relate to 95% of CO2 emissions worldwide. The bad news is that the submitted INDCs won't be enough to reach the 2C target. At this Summit we must therefore state credibly what we can do in the coming years in order to meet the target. We will be required, no more and no less, to undertake a far"reaching decarbonisation of our economies in the course of the 21st century. Secondly, comprehensive: Comprehensive means that we need a fundamental transformation of our societies embracing all sectors, including industrial production, mobility, energy generation, thermal insulation and energy efficiency. Germany has set itself clear targets. We are going to reduce our CO2 emissions by 40% by the year 2020. And by the year 2050, we want to have reduced emissions by 80 to 95% from a 1990 baseline. We have already agreed an ambitious climate protection package comprising more than 100 measures. Renewable energies are already the central plank in our energy mix. This year they will account for more than 27%. Thirdly, fair: Fair means that the industrialised countries have to play a leading role as regards the development of decarbonisation technologies. It was us who caused the emissions of the past. Now we have to develop the technology needed to reduce emissions in the future and to make it possible for developing countries to reduce their emissions. Germany will participate in various programmes. We will, for example, double our research funding for clean energy. We must also provide financial aid to ensure sustainable development is an option available to the poorest and most vulnerable countries. Here in Paris we have to show that we can deliver what we promised in Copenhagen and make available US$100 billion a year from 2020 each and every year so that others can beat climate change. In this context Germany will double its public aid, taking 2014 as the base year, for the years to 2020. And fourthly, binding: We need to create a framework for a binding UN agreement. We also need a binding review mechanism. Germany would like to see reviews happen every five years, starting before 2020. We know that countries' contributions are made on a voluntary basis. But it is also important that we live up to our commitments. We cannot allow any of these contributions to be watered down over the years. On the contrary, they will have to be augmented. We need transparency regarding the methods of measurement if our pledges are to be credible. Ladies and gentlemen, ambitious, comprehensive, fair and binding a global climate agreement should and indeed must be all those things. This is a question of both ecological necessity and economic common sense. It is a question of intergenerational equity. It is a question of our humanity, and on it depends the future of the human race. Germany will make its contribution so that we can look ahead to a livable future. Billions of people are pinning their hopes on what we do in Paris. Let us do everything we can not to dash those hopes. Thank you very much. \</doc>

Santa Fe: NM Solar Energy Association has issued the following news release: In time for the kick-off of the UN conference on climate change , Ecoppia has inked a deal to retrofit a 40 MW PV solar site jointly owned by EDF RE and Arava Power with its autonomous and waterless robotic cleaning solution. Ecoppia\' s automated and waterless technology is increasingly in demand as the solar industry matures. The agreement is significant because it lends increasing commercial clout to a technology that is disrupting the solar energy business. Dirt and dust cover (soiling, in industry speak) on solar panels are a significant challenge and can decrease energy output by up to 40%. Existing solutions - oftentimes labourers with water and brushes - can damage panels, use huge amounts of water and be cost-inefficient. Ecoppia provides a solution in the form of autonomous, waterless robots that are managed through the cloud and clean panels every night after production stops. "It's the next step for the solar industry," says Eran Meller, CEO of Ecoppia. "We're seeing significant value creation in all the projects we're currently involved in, both here in the Middle East and in India. For many of the big industry players, a solution that can clean panels nightly, can respond instantly to weather and is waterless - we feel solutions like ours have the potential to become the industry standard." The site is among the largest solar parks in the Middle East and is located in Southern Israel's Arava Valley - next to the Jordanian border and 20 and 60 miles from Egypt and Saudi Arabia, respectively. The cleaning technology is so promising that Meller has been asked by Israel to attend COP21 as part of a special delegation of green technology companies from Israel. "It's very exciting to see the progress Ecoppia is making in terms of winning large clients - it's because of promising technology like theirs that we believe Israel has a bright future in the International Solar Industry and why Ecoppia was chosen to take part in a side event on "Israeli Innovation in response to climate change". This special event which the Government of Israel has organized together with Israel Green Energy Association, is part of the COP21 ," said Ron Adam, the permanent representative of Israel to IRENA (The International Renewable Energy Agency).

The Green Party issued the following news release: U.S. Green Party leaders said that the nonbinding deal reached in Paris at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 21 ) showed progress but ultimately failed to address the crisis as a global emergency. Greens from the U.S. and around the world attended the summit, with many taking part in public demonstrations outside of the summit and demanding that participating nations "Keep Coal, Oil and Gas in the Ground" and commit to 100% clean renewable energy. Statements by Greens: Dr. Margaret Flowers, Green candidate for the U.S. Senate in Maryland ( HYPERLINK http://www.flowersforsenate.org "While it is remarkable that an agreement was reached by all 195 nations, the agreement is not a solution. The severity of the climate crisis and the pressure of the global climate justice movement forced the nations to reach consensus, but the final language is completely inadequate to address the crisis and provide financial support to those who need it. The final treaty, which will replace the Kyoto Treaty when it expires in 2020, is non-binding; and thus the inadequate commitments made by each nation are not mandatory. Current commitments to reduce greenhouse gases are too little, too late. Though the stated goal of the Paris Treaty is to keep the global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius, the stated commitments won't achieve that. And although previous drafts of the treaty called for phasing out fossil fuels in the second half of the century, the final draft excludes that language. Countries are also not required to cut emissions before the new treaty commences in 2020." Andrea Merida, co-chair of the Green Party of the United States: "The decision to limit warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels was a positive step. But the deal combines this with only voluntary pledges from nations for the actions necessary to prevent average global temperatures from rising further. Scientists and environmental groups have warned that the pledges, especially those from wealthy developed countries, to curb greenhouse gas emissions are more likely to result in a dangerous rise of 2.7C or more. Furthermore, the pledges are not legally binding. The deal tells us that it's unlikely that the global community will reach the 'net zero emissions' goal by 2070, based on imperatives established by U.N. scientists." Audrey Clement, co-chair of the Green Party of the United States: "Republicans continue to deny anthropogenic climate change, while Democrats like President Obama acknowledge the crisis but are reluctant to seek deep cuts in domestic fossil-fuel consumption and emissions. The positions of both parties show the pervasive influence of Big Oil and we can be certain that Republicans in Congress will block ratification by the U.S. of any climate-change agreement. The Green Party calls for a complete reorientation of our national energy priorities, beginning with the elimination of subsidies for petroleum and coal energy, divestment from fossil-fuel companies, enactment of carbon fees and dividends to reflect the true cost of fossil fuel extraction, and phasing out of off-shore drilling, mountaintop removal mining, hydrofracking, and new pipeline construction. Ending dependence on fossil fuels requires massive investment in hybrid and electric vehicles, low-cost public transportation and new ecologically sound electricity transmission infrastructure. We must develop safe and clean energy technologies -- excluding nuclear power, which has its own risks -- and retrofit homes and buildings for energy efficiency. All of these measures and more will create millions of new jobs across the U.S. Unfortunately, our current political establishment lacks the will to fight climate change or bar corporations from interfering in negotiations and legislation affecting the health of our planet. The future depends on popular movements, civic organizations, and political alternatives like the Green Party." (See the Green New Deal, HYPERLINK http://gpus.org/organizing-tools/the-green-new-deal/ http://gpus.org/organizing-tools/the-green-new-deal/ ) Sanda Everette, Green Party co-chair (Ms. Everette attended the summit and related events in Paris): "By deferring higher aid levels until 2025, the COP 21 deal imposes little financial responsibility on wealthy nations with high rates of energy consumption -- especially the U.S. -- for poorer countries that will suffer the worst effects of climate change, including flooding, drought, extreme weather, disruption of agriculture, and food shortages. These same poorer nations of the Global South have provided the resources and labor that have fed richer nations for centuries. This is a formula for civic unrest and global conflict for the rest of the 21st century. A truly effective climate deal must include a recognition that the world's economic structures must be transformed so that exploitation and plunder, which pumped greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, are replaced by humane systems that meet the needs of all the world's people."

As the climate conference advances into its final stages amid the colossal challenge of having 195 countries agree on a single and unified global policy on climate change, urban areas appear a a different issue but complementary solution for all. Cities are undeniably one of the key players in the global warming arena, being the leading source of greenhouse gases, of population settlements and of energy consumption, grouping three highly interconnected driving factors of global warming. As humanity walks deeper into the 21st century their relevance will only grow. Cities and municipal level government offices have proven to move faster than the international country-driven negotiations in addressing climate change, as international alliances both inside and outside the UN umbrella show. However, they don\'e2??t live in another world and their solution portfolio is intertwined with the fate of the 2015 UN Climate Conference ( COP21 ). \'e2??The way decisions will be made as part of the agreement, including the funding and the agenda of solutions, all these decisions will be implemented at that sub national level so they are key to success,\'e2? said French French Minister of Ecology, Energy and Sustainable Development S\'c3\£9gol\'c3\£8ne Royal. The minister spoke during the presentation at COP21 of a five-year plan to raise action from cities and regions spanning across five continents representing almost one-fifth of the world\'e2??s population. The plan was launched under the Lima to Paris Action Agenda (LPAA) platform, a mechanism created during last year\'e2??s climate conference as a way to include so-called non state actors into the search for the climate solution. Its urban workstream currently includes over 2200 settlements around the world, from Mongolia\'e2??s capital Ulan Bator to globalization strongholds like New York and London and adds to previous efforts like C40. Tokyo, for instance, emits as much as 62 million tons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per year, which accounts to the equivalent of the 37 countries least polluting countries in Africa. Their transition to a greener economy is also an economic necessity. If the world keeps a business-as-usual high-carbon economy, about 90 trillion dollars, or an average of six trillion a year, will be invested in infrastructure in the world\'e2??s cities, agriculture and energy systems over the next 15 years, according to the New Climate Economy report \'e2??Better Growth, Better Climate\'e2?. But the report adds that only around 270 billion dollars a year would be needed to accelerate the global transition to a low-carbon economy, through clean energy, more compact cities, better public transport systems and smarter land use. These and other low-carbon local decisions are going to be taken by country delegates at the climate conference, but the actual heavy lifting will come from sub national efforts. \'e2?? COP21 is the first time that cities will have their voices fully recognized at a global UN conference on climate change and the first time mayors are gathering in great numbers to demand bold action,\'e2? said UN Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Michael Bloomberg during the Cities for Change, a parallel event in Paris. The conference comes at a crucial moment. Earlier this year, Paris suffered from haze masking city\'e2??s landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and this week Beijing raised a \'e2??red alert\'e2? warning over smog and the city has gone on a shutdown to protect its people, so mayors and city planners are moving fast. The city of Ghent in Belgium has implemented projects that address climate change. Speaking at a side event in COP21 called \'e2??Global Covenant of Mayors: Towards Carbon Neutral and Inclusive Cities,\'e2? the city\'e2??s mayor Tine Heyset emphasized climate policies at the local level. \'e2??Climate policy should contribute to reduce emissions. It can contribute to a livable city, reduction of poverty, and better housing. Local authorities can demonstrate that local climate policy is not only good for climate but also good for citizens,\'e2? she said. And it\'e2??s not just developed cities that are making bold steps of climate action. Mayor Josefa Errazuris of Chile\'e2??s Providencia also shared about their city-wide projects such as changing street lights to LED and having a target of 50 per cent carbon reduction of GHG based on 2014 levels. \'e2??In order to protect our commune and the sustainability of our territory, we have efforts to include climate change as part of policies,\'e2? she said. But urban areas also have to carry a heavy burden. During her intervention, minister Royal highlighted the double nature of the cities as \'e2??both places with highest greenhouse gases but also where you need concrete and urgent action\'e2? to address the negative impacts of climate change. A 2013 paper published in Nature showed that without major new defences or emissions cuts, the global costs of flooding in cities could rise to one trillion dollars a year in 2050 and the negative effects span to all corners of the world. As poverty hotspots around the world, cities lack the necessary resilience to withstand climate change and its impacts, which usually harder on the most vulnerable among communities and settlements. The 2014 World Urbanization Prospects revealed that 828 million people are currently living in slums, as satellites or metropolis in all continents, a number enlarged by 6 million on a yearly basis. But it\'e2??s not only the world\'e2??s most vulnerable. A paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows that if global warming continues as it is now, half the homes in 21 cities in the United States will be underwater by 2100. COP21 is scheduled to deliver a final text by Thursday noon, Paris time, in which all 195 countries that signed to the UN Climate Convention agree on a global plan to combat climate change.

Orlando, FL, December 14, 2015 --(PR.com)-- As global leaders and stakeholders concluded discussions and negotiations at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) and the eleventh session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP) in Paris, Akwa Ibom State is sponsoring the first Post COP 21 Event. Tagged, Post COP 21 Dialogue, at the Sheraton Hotel, Lagos Nigeria, on Tuesday 15th December, 2015. The Governor of Akwa Ibom state, Mr. Udom Emmanuel will deliver a Keynote speech on Climate Solutions at the Post- COP 21 Dialogue, to showcase the state's milestones in climate change mitigation and adaptation, renewable energy, environmental protection, jobs creation, youth development and plans for growth to a strategic audience and comity of stakeholders. The Governor will also speak on the new face of Akwa-Ibom; Akwa-Ibom at COP 21 , the experience & follow up programmes of activities in Akwa Ibom State. The Post COP21 COP21 ). The Conference of Parties (COP): The journey of active international climate change advocacy and political response began at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, where the 'Rio Convention' included the adoption of the UN Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This convention set out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to avoid "dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system." The main objective of the United Nations Annual Conference of Parties (COP) is to review the Convention's implementation. Post COP21 In line with the global mandate of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Number 13: "Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts," a national Post COP21 Dialogue will hold at the Sheraton Lagos Hotel, Nigeria in December 15, 2015. The Africa Clean Energy Summit (ACES) and the Young Africans Leadership Initiative (YALI) are in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Environment and other stakeholders. The Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI), is a signature effort to invest in the next generation of African leaders launched by President Obama in 2010 to support young African leaders as they spur growth and prosperity, strengthen democratic governance, and enhance peace and security across Africa. Theme & Objectives: The Role of Youth in Climate Change Mitigation & Adaptation The objectives of the Post- COP21 Dialogue include: To fulfil the 13th goal of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by building capacity and engaging the youths to take action on climate change mitigation and adaptation. To fulfil the mandate of YALI Network and educate the youths on Climate Change in non-technical terms. The Post COP21 Dialogue is also positioned to be the veritable platform to engage our youths in the Climate Action Process following the decisions at the ongoing United Nations Conference of Parties in Paris ( COP21 ). The Africa Clean Energy Summit is positioned to be one of the world's foremost annual climate solution events in Africa, dedicated to advancing green cities, energy efficiency and clean technologies in Africa. ACES brings together decision makers, policy makers, industry leaders, investors, experts and media around the world to explore and further understand the challenges and opportunities that arise from Clean Energy solutions; Clean Energy and Security, Defence, Health, Buildings, Agriculture, Power, Homes, Transportation, Education and many more.

Jun 15, 2015( CleanTechnica: HYPERLINK http://cleantechnica.com http://cleantechnica.com HYPERLINK http://c1cleantechnicacom.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2015/06/IEA-3.jpg'We http://c1cleantechnicacom.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2015/06/IEA-3.jpg'We face a moment of opportunity, but also of great risk,' writes Maria van der Hoeven, the Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), in the forward to the organization's latest report,\~World Energy Outlook Special Report 2015: Energy and Climate Change[2].\~'The world is counting on the UN climate talks in Paris later this year to achieve a global agreement that puts us on a more sustainable path.'<nl/> As such, the IEA has identified four key outcomes that it\~believes the\~21st UN Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) in Paris in December 2015 must achieve for it to be considered a success. They are:<nl/>Peak in emissions - set the conditions to achieve an early peak in global energy-related emissions. Five-year revision - review national climate targets regularly, to test the scope, to raise ambition. Lock in the vision - translate the world's climate goal into a collective long-term emissions goal. Track the transition - establish a process for tracking achievements in the energy sector.<nl/>'As IEA analysis has repeatedly shown that the cost and difficulty of mitigating greenhouse-gas emissions increases every year, time is of the essence,' van der Hoeven said in the IEA's press release[3] accompanying the release of the report. 'It is clear that the energy sector must play a critical role if efforts to reduce emissions are to succeed. While we see growing consensus among countries that it is time to act, we must ensure that the steps taken are adequate and that the commitments made are kept.'<nl/> The first of four 'key pillars' the IEA believes is essential is an earlier 'peak in emissions,' which the IEA believes 'can be achieved relying solely on proven technologies and policies, without changing the economic and development prospects of any region.' The authors of the report detail this idea in the 'Bridge Scenario' which depends upon five separate measures:<nl/>Increasing energy efficiency in the industry, buildings and transport sectors Reducing the use of the least-efficient coal-fired power plants and banning their construction Increasing investment in renewable energy technologies in the power sector from $270 billion in 2014 to $400 billion in 2030 Gradual phasing out of fossil-fuel subsidies to end-users by 2030 Reducing methane emissions in oil and gas production<nl/>The Bridging Scenario would see coal use peak before 2020 and then decline, while oil demand rises until 2020 before plateauing. Total energy related greenhouse gas emissions would peak around 2030, followed by both energy intensity of the global economy and carbon intensity of power generation improving by 40% by 2030.<nl/> China would need to decouple its economic expansion from emissions growth by around 2020, 'mainly through improving the energy efficiency of industrial motors and the building sector.' Regions like the European Union and United States have already achieved impressive decoupling of economic expansion and emissions growth, thanks to improved energy efficiency and renewable energy deployment.<nl/> Unfortunately, the bridging scenario does not include universal access to modern energy, but the efforts to reduce energy-related emissions do go hand-in-hand with delivering access to electricity to 1.7 billion people and access to clean cookstoves to 1.6 billion people by 2030. Nevertheless, this is likely to be a sticking point for certain countries that are required to make cuts without the benefits of universal energy access.<nl/> The IEA also recommends a five-year review cycle 'to test the scope for further action' in a world where necessary change will need strong guidance and implementation. As the IEA notes, £ny delay in taking action can be costly,\~while the pace of energy sector innovation means that a five-year review would allow national targets to keep up with events and help build investor confidence.'<nl/> A long-term greenhouse gas emissions target is also vital, according to the IEA, helping to £nchor future expectations, guide investment decisions, provide an incentive to develop new technologies, drive needed market reforms, and spur the implementation of strong domestic policies.'<nl/> Finally, the IEA suggests a 'strong process for tracking progress' throughout the energy sector.<nl/> 'Any climate agreement reached at COP21 must have the energy sector at its core or risk being judged a failure,' said IEA Chief Economist Fatih Birol. 'Climate pledges submitted for COP21 are an important first step to meeting our climate goal, and our report shows that they will have a material impact on future energy trends.'<nl/> 'A transformation of the world's energy system must become a unifying vision if the 2\'b0 climate goal is to be achieved,' said Maria van der Hoeven in her speech at the launch of the special report. 'This challenge is daunting, but IEA analysis has shown how to responsibly decarbonise the energy sector over the long term. This potential can, ultimately, be collectively achieved.'<nl/><nl/>Keep up to date with all the hottest cleantech news by subscribing to our (free) cleantech newsletter[4], or keep an eye on sector-specific news by getting our (also free) solar energy newsletter[5], electric vehicle newsletter[6], or wind energy newsletter[7].<nl/><nl/>Tags: COP 21 Paris[8], COP21 [9], IEA[10], International Energy Agency[11], Paris[12], Peak emissions[13], UN Conference of the Parties[14]<nl/><nl/> About the Author HYPERLINK http://cleantechnica.com/author/joshuashill/<nl/>Joshua http://cleantechnica.com/author/joshuashill/<nl/>Joshua S Hill[15] I'm a Christian, a nerd, a geek, and I believe that we're pretty quickly directing planet-Earth into hell in a handbasket!

The following information was released by the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF): More than half a billion children live in areas with extremely high flood occurrence and 160 million in high drought severity zones, leaving them highly exposed to the impacts of climate change, UNICEF said in a report released ahead of the 21st United Nations climate change conference , known as COP21 . "The sheer numbers underline the urgency of acting now," said UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake. "Today's children are the least responsible for climate change, but they, and their children, are the ones who will live with its consequences. And, as is so often the case, disadvantaged communities face the gravest threat." Climate change means more droughts, floods, heatwaves and other severe weather conditions. These events can cause death and devastation, and can also contribute to the increased spread of major killers of children, such as malnutrition, malaria and diarrhoea. This can create a vicious circle: A child deprived of adequate water and sanitation before a crisis will be more affected by a flood, drought, or severe storm, less likely to recover quickly, and at even greater risk when faced with a subsequent crisis. The vast majority of the children living in areas at extremely high risk of floods are in Asia, and the majority of those in areas at risk of drought are in Africa. World leaders gathering in Paris for COP21 held from November 30 to December 11 will seek to reach agreement on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, which most experts say is critical to limiting potentially catastrophic rises in temperature. "We know what has to be done to prevent the devastation climate change can inflict. Failing to act would be unconscionable," said Lake. "We owe it to our children and to the planet to make the right decisions at COP21 ." ### \</doc>

Dec 13, 2015( Assemblymember John P#233;rez: HYPERLINK http://asmdc.org/speaker/Delivered SACRAMENTO Assembly Speaker Toni G. Atkins (D-San Diego) released the following statement regarding the agreement signed at the end of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change: 'The Paris Agreement that was signed at the end of the United Nations' COP21 conference is transformational. It will change the world's approach to fossil fuels, and it establishes an achievable path to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to respond to the potentially devastating changes caused by climate change. That almost 200 countries from around the globe signed on to the agreement is a breathtaking sign of unity and commitment. I am proud to have been part of California's delegation to COP 21 , and I am proud of our state's leadership and vision on climate change. By showing what is possible, California helped open the door to this historic agreement. The Paris Agreement is by no means the end, however. In California we know the serious damage climate change can cause to everything from our supply of food and water to the health of our neighborhoods to our national security. And we will continue to push the envelope.' Website of Assembly Speaker Toni G.

PARIS - Le Bourget, the location of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference , was surprisingly far from the center of Paris. Conference-goers got off in the periphery of the metro at Fort d'Aubervilliers before taking a shuttle ride that offered views of the fairly drab suburb of Le Bourget, filled with plain storefronts and often-dilapidated apartment buildings. It did not seem like the kind of place the entire world would be watching. I chose the second week of negotiations to visit the conference to attend an event hosted by Georgetown, a panel discussion titled "The Subnational (State and Provincial) Foundation for Action." The other three events hosted by Georgetown officials were titled "Challenges and Opportunities in China-U.S. Cooperation on Energy and Climate Change," "Subnational Cooperation on Clean, Resilient Transportation" and "U.S. State Actions to Achieve Significant GHG Reduction." By the time I attended the conference, the overwhelming security-presence brouhaha that surrounded the arrival of 150 heads of state in France had subsided, and entering the Climate Generations space, located behind the main negotiations area, involved nothing more than a straightforward security check. The space, intended for civil society and open to the public, aimed to drive dialogue about climate change between ordinary citizens, nongovernmental organizations and policymakers. Three sections of the giant tent were designated for stalls operated by NGOs and cities to inform the public on particular initiatives, including everything from the basics of recycling to the intersection of poverty and the environment. Ten conference rooms in another section hosted panel discussions throughout the day, while a projection room screened environmental documentaries. The panel I attended was a dialogue on subnational efforts by American states and Canadian provinces to combat climate change. It featured Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin, Manitoba Premier Gregory Selinger and senior officials from Quebec, California and Washington state. Georgetown Climate Center Executive Director Vicki Arroyo moderated the event. The Climate Center is an affiliate of the Georgetown Law Center that collaborates with the federal government to coordinate state policies around the country. As the Climate Center works closely with state and provincial governments, Arroyo highlighted the outsized impact of subnational actors on the fight against climate change. "They're not subnational, they're super-national," Arroyo said at the panel. Shumlin credited the Climate Center with bringing these various actors together. "We were all working too hard to think about working together," Shumlin said. "We would not be working together without Vicki and her team at Georgetown." Establishing a theme that other panelists would also emphasize, Shumlin pointed to transportation as a primary area of action, noting the importance of the Climate Center's Transportation and Climate Initiative in designing improvements to electric vehicle infrastructure. Selinger expanded on Shumlin's remarks, explaining the importance of state-level focus. "Every jurisdiction has its own challenges," Selinger said. Yet the panelists also acknowledged the interconnectedness of issues across borders. Quebec Environmental Minister David Heurtel said that his province had just established a sub-national $25.5 million Solidarity Fund to invest in developing countries, the first of its kind. "We have a responsibility worldwide as well," Heurtel said. Quebec and California have also teamed up to implement a cooperative cap-and-trade system, a partnership which California Environmental Protection Agency Secretary Matt Rodriquez said developed naturally. "I thought I'd just be focused on California throughout my time as secretary, but a number of other governments around the world were interested in what we were doing," Rodriquez said. Sarah Rees, special assistant to the director for climate policy at the Washington State Department of Ecology, underlined the urgency of action now and presented worrying signs of advancing climate change in Washington. "We need to go a bit further," Rees said. "With people seeing these effects firsthand, I'm hopeful we can change the political dynamic." However, protestors constantly interrupted the discussion. During Shumlin's remarks, a man stood up and began singing, while two women held up a sign reading "Fracked Gas = Climate Change." Rees and Rodriquez were interrupted as well, with protestors reading statements greeted with loud applause from other protestors and quiet exasperation from audience members. As the question-and-answer portion of the event concluded, Arroyo made a final plea. "I care deeply about these issues, and I've devoted my life to working on them. When I was your age, I protested too, but I was respectful when I did it," Arroyo said. "You're protesting the wrong people." However, the loud activism during the panel contrasted with the rest of the civil-society space. As I strolled through the center, I repeatedly heard "I don't know," and "This is incredibly complicated," but I also heard, "This might help." These phrases seem to encapsulate the tension at the heart of the conference. The negotiations were undoubtedly complicated; countries around the world are divided, primarily between developed and developing nations. But they are also searching for some way to address a crucial issue, one that, according to President Barack Obama, "affects all trends." The vibrancy of the civil-society space seemed to draw energy from the focus on that central issue. Even despite the contentiousness of the panel I attended, one moment during Selinger's speech highlighted this common unity against climate change. "This is one of the defining issues of our time," Selinger said. "It inspires us. It inspires the protestors, as well. We may come at it from different angles, but we all are working to figure out a way to ensure sustainable development and to save the environment." Have a reaction to this article?

The American Petroleum Institute issued the following news release: While API reviews the agreement reached at the COP21 climate negotiations, the trade association is urging world leaders to recognize the proven results of America's market-driven model for addressing climate challenges, according to API President and CEO Jack Gerard. "America's private sector has already taken the lead on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, even as we increase economic activity and domestic energy production to keep energy reliable and affordable for consumers," Gerard said. "Our success is driven, not by government mandate or legislative fiat, but through innovation, investment and entrepreneurial spirit. "The United States has become the world leader in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. And EPA data show that methane emissions are also plummeting, with the largest reductions coming from hydraulically fractured natural gas wells. "Our nation's 21st century energy renaissance, which has made domestically produced natural gas cheap and abundant, has helped us achieve substantial and sustained emissions reductions without command-and-control style regulatory intervention. Where other nations have pledges, we have progress and results." "We will closely scrutinize the COP 21 agreement to see how it references the U.S. model of reducing emissions through technological innovation and increased use of natural gas."

The following information was released by the office of Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego: Rep. Ruben Gallego released the following statement after delegates to the COP21 United Nations Climate Change Conference announced a final agreement to limit carbon pollution: "The agreement reached during the Paris Climate Summit is an important first step to addressing a worsening climate crisis. The historic plan will reduce carbon pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels in favor of cleaner, more sustainable energy sources. "But we must ensure that the consensus reached in Paris is the floor, and not the ceiling of our ambition. As we implement this agreement, it remains important for the United States to lead the way to a new clean energy economy. "We must fully commit to taking strong steps that will put us on a safer path for future generations. We must take charge to develop new technologies that will boost our economy and make it possible to meet our obligations under this pact. "I thank President Obama and Secretary Kerry for their leadership during the negotiations on this critical issue. Thanks to this agreement, our children and our grandchildren will inherit a cleaner planet and a healthier environment. " ## \</doc>

Nov 20, 2015( PA Pundits: http://papundits.wordpress.com http://papundits.wordpress.com / Delivered by Newstex) By Kate Scanlon ~ Some witnesses questioned the president's climate initiative, the Clean Power Plan, during a House Committee on Science, Space and Technology hearing[1] on Wednesday. Anne Smith, the senior vice president and environmental practice co-chair at NERA Economic Consulting, cautioned that on the CPP, the 'EPA's cost estimate is an underestimate.' Smith said the CPP's 'net costs to the economy are substantial,' with higher electricity costs and reduced consumer spending. President Barack Obama holds a press conference at the White House to announce the new Clean Power Plan on Aug. 3. World leaders will meet at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris Nov. 30-Dec. 11 to negotiate a global climate change agreement. (Photo: Patsy Lynch/Polaris/Newscom) Paul Knappenberger, the assistant director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute, said 'climate change is real' and that it is due to 'human and natural factors.' What is disputed is 'the degree to which we can separate those factors.' Knappenberger added that the Clean Power Plan would result in a 'global temperature savings by the end of the century of about two one-hundredths of a degree.' 'This is neither meaningful nor scientifically detectable.' Other witnesses were supportive of an international agreement. Katie Dykes, the deputy commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and the chair of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, Inc., defended the president's initiative, comparing it to a climate agreement among\\xA6states[2] that she argued has created jobs and reduced carbon emissions. 'The Administration's Empty Promises for the International Climate Treaty' hearing was held to examine the Obama administration's climate agenda before the president participates in upcoming global climate talks. United Nations Climate Change Conference , also referred to as\\xA6COP 21[3], in Paris to\\xA6negotiate[4] a global climate change agreement.\\xA6The conference\\xA6takes place[5] from Nov. 30 to Dec. 11. The president announced his\\xA6Clean Power Plan[6] earlier this year, which he has said he hopes will lead the way to a global climate agreement. 'In December, with America leading the way, we have a chance to put in place one of the most ambitious international climate agreements in human history,' Obama said during\\xA6a speech[7] in August announcing the Clean Power Plan. More recently, Obama reiterated his remarks. 'My definition of leadership would be leading on climate change, an international accord that potentially we'll get in Paris,' the president said during\\xA6an interview[8] with '60 Minutes' in October.

The chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee issued the following news release: U.S. Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, released a statement on the pending climate deal being developed at the 21st session of the Conference of Parties ( COP21 ) pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris, France. "EPA and CEQ traveled 3,800 miles to present their roles in the implementation of the president's Climate Action Plan and corresponding international commitment yet refused to travel two miles to testify with the State Department before elected representatives of the American people," Inhofe said. "In refusing to testify before a joint subcommittee hearing on the international negotiations and the president's Climate Action Plan, EPA asserted 'the agency does not have a witness that can speak to the issues of the hearing.' Following EPA and CEQ's refusal to testify, I requested the agency provide a list of officials who had participated in previous negotiating meetings and who would be attending the COP 21 in Paris. These simple oversight requests went unanswered. It is hard to understand how EPA and CEQ have the expertise to explain their involvement with the president's international climate agenda to the United Nations and broader international community when just two months ago, they lacked the ability to do so before Congress. I plan to invite administration officials, once again, to provide testimony before the Senate EPW committee so they can explain their actions to Congress and the American people."

Washington: Airports Council International has issued the following news release: On the eve of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 21 Speaking as Chairman of GTAC, David Scowsill, President & CEO of the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), said:  The travel and tourism sector expresses its hope for a successful outcome to the talks in Paris and reiterates that our organizations, working together as the Global Travel Association Coalition, are committed to make a meaningful and long-term contribution to fighting climate change.  Travel and tourism contributes nearly 10% of the world\' s GDP and supports one in eleven of all jobs on the planet. Over one billion people cross international borders each year, a number expected to reach 1.8 billion by 2030. This growth in travel and tourism will bring about enormous social and economic development across the world, particularly for Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States. We have a serious responsibility to ensure that we decouple the growth of the sector from its impact on our environment to ensure that tourism can continue to contribute to socio-economic inclusiveness and development in the long term. Important industries which comprise the travel and tourism sector have previously stated their long-term commitments to alleviating climate change: Aviation The aviation industry and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) have set aligned goals of improving fuel efficiency and stabilizing net aviation CO2 emissions from 2020 through carbon neutral growth. The aviation industry also set a long-term goal to halve aviation\' s net CO2 emissions by 2050, compared with a 2005 baseline. Since the above goals were set, ICAO Member States and the aviation industry, have been working to make them a reality through the implementation of a basket of different measures which include new technology and alternative fuels; improved operations; better use of infrastructure; and the development of a global market-based measure to enable the industry to stabilize its CO2 emissions from 2020. Furthermore, ICAO is developing an Aeroplane CO2 Emission Certification Standard that will be established in 2016. Through invaluable partnerships and cooperation with the aviation industry and other organizations, half of ICAO\' s Member States have prepared and submitted national action plans to reduce aviation CO2 emissions to ICAO. For its part, ACI\' s Airport Carbon Accreditation programme, developed by ACI EUROPE in 2009 for airports to achieve self-determination in setting and meeting rigorous environmental standards, went fully global last year with 135 airports participating in the programme to date. Moreover, ACI\' s do-it-yourself airport carbon inventory tool, ACERT, is now available in version 3.0 and can be used across all accreditation levels with a focus on helping smaller airports join the Airport Carbon Accreditation programme. Cruise/shipping Building new cruise ships with energy efficiency design standards for a 30% reduction in CO2 by 2030 Implementing Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plans for route planning and maintenance to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions since 2013 Utilizing special lighting to reduce power consumption by up to 20% Painting hulls with special coatings to reduce fuel consumption by 5% Sector-wide The World Travel & Tourism Council published  Leading the Challenge on Climate Change in 2009 to support the global climate talks backing international agreements wherein its Members, the leading travel and tourism companies globally, committed the sector to cutting its CO2 emissions by 50% from 2005 to 2035. Earlier this month, this commitment was reiterated in new report:  Travel & Tourism 2015 - Connecting Global Climate Action. Notes to editors 1. Airports Council International (ACI), the only worldwide association of airports, has 595 member airport authorities, which operate 1,855 airports in 173 countries. ACI\' s mission is to promote professional excellence in airport management and operations, and this mandate is carried out through the organization\' s multiple training opportunities, as well as the customer service benchmarking programme, a wide range of conferences, industry statistical products and best practice publications. 2. The Global Travel Association Coalition exists to promote a better understanding of travel and tourism\' s role as a driver of economic growth and employment, and to ensure governments develop policies which contribute to the profitable, sustainable and long-term growth of the industry. Under its goal to provide a stronger consolidated  One Voice, the leaders of GTAC continue to align their messaging and efforts in order to amplify awareness of the viability of the travel and tourism sector. An Agenda for Growth and Development was launched in April, 2015 consolidating the common efforts to be followed by all.

Washington: Inter-American Development Bank has issued the following news release: The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) and the government of Chile will host the 9th Latin American and Caribbean Carbon Forum (LACCF 2015) in Santiago de Chile from September 9-11. The conference will cover the latest developments in market-based mechanisms to address climate change, carbon trading, climate finance, and low-emission development. Coming just months before the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, where countries are to adopt a new, universal climate agreement, the LACCF 2015 is an important opportunity for private and public-sector representatives to leverage market and finance opportunities for ambitious and effective climate action in the region.  As countries are busy preparing and making public their intended contributions to a new universal climate change agreement to be adopted in Paris in December, the Forum offers a golden opportunity to explore the use of market-based mechanisms and approaches to increase emission reduction ambition and stimulate sustainable development now and over the years and decades to come, said Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a co-organizer of LACCF 2015. Aneffective response to climate change requires strong interlinkages between politics, finance, technology and execution strategies. Thus, the three-day event will cover the latest in climate policy, low carbon technology solutions, carbon pricing and climate finance options throughout 8 plenaries,12 thematic workshopsand 4 side events. Different mechanisms and sources that help to support low carbon development goals, provide access to climate finance, and to promote innovation and policies addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation will be discussed. Participants will also explore ways to leverage and scale up private investment in the region and business leaders will learn how to incorporate environmental considerations into their business planning while preparing for future "clean" opportunities. Furthermore, since achieving clean development requires building the capacity in the public and private sectors to identify, adapt and deploy the most appropriate low carbon technologies, renowned climate change experts from both sectors will highlight the importance of innovation in the energy sector, Climate Smart Agriculture & land use, and transport, among others. As momentum grows for transition to carbon neutral economies, this year\' s regional carbon forum will also show how individuals, governments and the private sector can spur action through offsetting, featuring achievements of Latin American carbon offset projects, and showcase the experience of those who are already helping to create a climate resilient future. This conference is jointly organized by the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the World Bank Group, the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE), the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the UNEP DTU Partnership, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and CAF -Development Bank of Latin America (CAF).

Washington, D.C. - Rep. Ruben Gallego released the following statement after delegates to the COP21 United Nations Climate Change Conference announced a final agreement to limit carbon pollution: "The agreement reached during the Paris Climate Summit is an important first step to addressing a worsening climate crisis. The historic plan will reduce carbon pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels in favor of cleaner, more sustainable energy sources. "But we must ensure that the consensus reached in Paris is the floor, and not the ceiling of our ambition. As we implement this agreement, it remains important for the United States to lead the way to a new clean energy economy. "We must fully commit to taking strong steps that will put us on a safer path for future generations. We must take charge to develop new technologies that will boost our economy and make it possible to meet our obligations under this pact. "I thank President Obama and Secretary Kerry for their leadership during the negotiations on this critical issue. Thanks to this agreement, our children and our grandchildren will inherit a cleaner planet and a healthier environment.

Nov 30, 2015( Smart Grid News: HYPERLINK http://www.smartgridnews.com http://www.smartgridnews.com COP21 ) in Paris to reach an agreement that encourages a transition to a low-carbon society by making better use of nuclear energy alongside other mitigation options.<nl/> \~ HYPERLINK http://www.smartgridnews.com/story/pushing-nuclear-cop21/2015-11-30<nl/> http://www.smartgridnews.com/story/pushing-nuclear- HYPERLINK cop21 /2015-11-30<nl/> "To implement the goals of an ambitious COP 21 agreement governments need to develop policies that encourage investment in low carbon generation, especially nuclear energy. We need 1000 GWe of new nuclear capacity by 2050 to combat climate change. This will require effective regulation and markets that value low carbon emissions and reliable supplies," said WNA Director General Agneta Rising. "France has shown that with nuclear energy an affordable low carbon generation mix is achievable. COP 21 must deliver an agreement that helps us achieve a low carbon emissions world."<nl/> The Paris talks represent a rare opportunity for world leaders to lay the framework for an ambitious and meaningful plan that transforms the global energy economy for the better, according to Nuclear Matters.<nl/> "As President Obama and other world leaders convene in Paris for the United Nations Summit on Climate Change to discuss groundbreaking measures that aim to combat the effects of global warming, carbon-free nuclear energy must be recognized for its role in helping us transition to a cleaner energy future," said Nuclear Matters co-chair and former Senator Evan Bayh (D-IN).<nl/> In the United States, existing nuclear power provides 20 percent of electricity and more than 60 percent of carbon-free energy.\~<nl/> "Unfortunately, a number of our existing nuclear power plants are at risk of premature shutdown or have already announced their retirement, which will lead to an increase in carbon emissions. Further premature closures must be prevented to ensure that the progress we've made in reducing carbon emissions is not compromised, and to help the United States retain its position as a leader on climate change," Bayh said. "As a recent White House Summit underscored, the administration supports nuclear for its role in addressing climate change, but more must be done, including implementing public policies that properly value nuclear for its carbon-free benefits. This would help us retain the existing nuclear fleet and ensure nuclear is a part of our carbon reduction plan, as any credible attempt at this must include nuclear."<nl/> Nuclear for Climate said in a new position paper that a significant expansion of nuclear energy is necessary for the world to achieve an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 to prevent a greater than two degrees Celsius rise in average global temperatures.<nl/> "We strongly believe the world must use all available low-carbon energy sources, including nuclear energy, if it is to mitigate the effects of climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while meeting development goals and not impeding on economic growth," said Val\'e9rie Faudon, director-general at the French Nuclear Energy Society (SFEN).<nl/> While meeting this goal appears challenging, electricity generation is one sector where a low carbon path has been proven with technology available today, WNA contends. Countries such as Switzerland, Brazil, Sweden and France have achieved low carbon electricity supplies through combinations of generation from nuclear energy and renewables.<nl/> Globally, 438 reactors generate around 11 percent of the world's electricity, with almost no greenhouse gas emissions. In the European Union, nuclear energy accounts for more than half of all low-carbon electricity. In the United States, it accounts for 63 percent of all low-carbon electricity.<nl/> Going forward, developed and developing countries alike will expand nuclear energy as part of their transition to a lower carbon electrical grid. For example, China is expected to account for one-third of the world's installed nuclear energy capacity by 2050 to meet its energy and climate change goals.<nl/> Over the last 50 years nuclear generation has been estimated to have avoided the emission of more than 60 billion tons of carbon dioxide, according to "Prevented Mortality and Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Historical and Projected Nuclear Power" -- more than ten times the annual carbon dioxide emissions from the world's road transport.<nl/> For more: - see this report[1]<nl/> Related articles: Shifting focus: Owner of world's largest nuclear fleet looks to renewable energy[2] Warm and fuzzy?

The Canadian Union of Public Employees issued the following news release: "Even if we strengthen our power as a union, we won't be better off if our planet is destroyed," CUPE National Secretary-Treasurer Charles Fleury told delegates at the national convention in Vancouver. With that harsh reality in mind, Fleury will travel to Paris in December for the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ). CUPE, the Canadian Labour Congress and other affiliated unions will participate in a meeting organized by the International Trade Union Confederation. On behalf of CUPE, Fleury will argue for world governments, including Canada, to adopt ambitious greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets for 2020 that meet scientists' recommendations. According to Fleury, we can no longer rely on states acting in good faith: the final accord must include a mandatory review process for all countries. "However, the fight against climate change cannot be waged at the expense of workers, communities or developing countries. The final accord should involve a just transition to a carbon-free economy, including financial incentives for the poorest countries," explained Fleury. For CUPE's National Secretary-Treasurer, the fight against climate change also presents an excellent opportunity for the creation of new green jobs. "Public services are a main source of green jobs. A growing public sector and public infrastructure will help us reduce the effects of climate change. Private companies have created the problem; governments and the public sector need to be part of the solution," said Fleury. CUPE is a signatory of the Leap Manifesto advocating that environmental protection, economic development, and a fairer society go hand in hand. "We'll make sure that the Leap message is heard loud and clear in Paris," concluded Fleury. CUPE's action against climate change will continue well beyond COP21 , since delegates at the last national convention made protecting the planet a major priority for the union over the next two years.

The following information was released by the United Nations: More than half a billion children live in areas with extremely high flood occurrence and 160 million in high drought severity zones, leaving them highly exposed to the impacts of climate change, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) said in a report released ahead of the 21st United Nations climate change conference , known as COP21 . "The sheer numbers underline the urgency of acting now," said UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake, in a press release. "Today's children are the least responsible for climate change, but they, and their children, are the ones who will live with its consequences. And, as is so often the case, disadvantaged communities face the gravest threat," he continued. Climate change means more droughts, floods, heatwaves and other severe weather conditions. UNICEF is underlining that these events can cause death and devastation, and can also contribute to the increased spread of major killers of children, such as malnutrition, malaria and diarrhoea. This can reportedly create a vicious circle according to the agency a child deprived of adequate water and sanitation before a crisis will be more affected by a flood, drought, or severe storm, less likely to recover quickly, and at even greater risk when faced with a subsequent crisis. The report, Unless we act now: The impact of climate change on children, finds that the vast majority of the children living in areas at extremely high risk of floods are in Asia, and the majority of those in areas at risk of drought are in Africa. Meanwhile, world leaders gathering in Paris for COP21 held from November 30 to December 11 will seek to reach agreement on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, which most experts say is critical to limiting potentially catastrophic rises in temperature. "We know what has to be done to prevent the devastation climate change can inflict. Failing to act would be unconscionable," said Mr. Lake. "We owe it to our children and to the planet to make the right decisions at COP21 ." \</doc>

The following information was released by the UK Government: From: Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Fiona Clouder Delivered on: 5 January 2016 (Transcript of the speech, exactly as it was delivered) First published: 13 January 2016 Part of: Chile Ambassador Fiona Clouder delivered a speech at post- COP21 networking event held in Santiago, Chile. Ambassador Hammer, Professor Scott, Members of the Corporate Leader's Group, ladies and gentlemen. I am grateful to the CLG and the Harvard Law School for the invitation to address you this evening. It is right that we all reflect on the "historic" outcomes of the COP21 , but most importantly, focus on how we intend to implement the measures we have agreed upon. The British Embassy is supporting the Chilean Chapter of the Corporate Leaders Group on climate Change (CLG) since its creation after the visit to Chile of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales in 2009.The Chilean chapter is modelled after the UK Chapter, the Prince of Wales's Corporate Leaders Group (CLG). Prior to the COP21 The agreement reached in Paris marks a clear turning point towards a sustainable and low carbon future. As Prime Minister David Cameron said "this global deal now means that the whole world has signed to play its part in halting climate change. It's a moment to remember and a huge step forward in helping to secure the future of our planet." In particular, the Paris deal clears the way for the private sector to drive a long-term solution by investing in low carbon transition. In the UK, we already have a clear long-term approach. We have a legally-binding 80% emissions reduction target for 2050 and legislation -the Climate Change Act which introduces 5-year carbon budgets, set 12 years in advance. This system allows us the flexibility to keep costs low while giving long term certainty to business. The UK is already benefitting from the transition to a low carbon economy. In 2013 the UK's annual turnover in this sector was 122 billion the equivalent to twice that of our car manufacturing and food and drink industries UK businesses have also welcomed the deal. We saw many examples in Paris where businesses and investors made billions of pounds worth of commitments to a low carbon economy, including the insurance sector collectively investing over $100 billion in smarter risk and resilience projects. Additionally, one of the main announcements of the COP 21 events included the launch of the Mission Innovation initiative by President Obama, President Bachelet and Prime Minister Cameron, together with heads of state from 17 other countries in collaboration with 27 private sector investors. Through Mission Innovation, these actors pledged a doubling in low carbon innovation a great example of the public and private sector coming together. We have long said that Paris is not a one-stop, top-down treaty where Governments 'solve' the problem of climate change. Through the collective participation of its members, initiatives like the CLG should and can have a key role towards driving long term solutions and accelerating the transition to a low carbon economy in Chile. Tonight's event is a great example of how we can encourage more members of the private sector to participate in dialogues, collective actions and networks that will support a more sustainable and low carbon future for Chile and the world. Thank you. \</doc>

Dec 22, 2015( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com COP21 will affect JLL's clients, employees and investors.<nl/> Sarah Nicholls, JLL's Global Corporate Sustainability (GCS) team leader, and Dan Probst, JLL's Global Chairman of Energy and Sustainability Services, participated in COP21 and you can read more about their experiences on JLL's Green Blog[2]. COP 21 was the first United Nations climate conference to gather experts from both the private and public sectors to address global climate change. Sarah shared her impressions on the landmark conference and what it means to JLL in reducing greenhouse gases across its global footprint and helping clients do the same.<nl/> Q: COP21 was the first global climate change conference to include both the private and public sectors to tackle global warming. What were your overall impressions of the conference proceedings?\~<nl/> A: What resonated with me was the presence of big, multinational company CEOs - several of whom are JLL's clients - who spoke with unwavering conviction about the economic drivers of climate change. This was echoed, too, by politicians such as US Secretary of State John Kerry who remarked that climate change was the biggest market opportunity in the history of humankind. <nl/> I viewed the critical discussions and negotiations as a means to obtain a clearer understanding of the countries' respective positions and how this would provide certainty and a unified signal for business action.<nl/> Q: One conference session particularly relevant to JLL's global business concerned the Buildings Efficiency Accelerator (BEA) initiative. What are the links to JLL's ongoing efforts to educate and guide its clients in energy reduction?<nl/> A: The Sustainable Energy for All's Energy Efficiency Accelerator Platform aims to double the rate of energy efficiency by 2030. Buildings is one of several accelerators such as Industry, District Energy Systems and Lighting that will help drive forward this energy efficiency goal.<nl/> Our industry leadership in property and corporate facility management services spans a portfolio of 3.4 billion square feet worldwide, so we have a vested interest in the building sector that accounts for about 40% of global energy consumption. The Buildings Efficiency Accelerator session at COP 21 was, not surprisingly, the one most relevant to JLL.<nl/> The BEA encourages widespread implementation of progressive policies that boost the use of best available technologies, low-energy building design and energy efficient renovation that can deliver 25-50% reductions in energy demand from new and existing buildings.\~<nl/> Q: Were there any examples of what U.S. companies were doing proactively to reduce their CO2 emissions that you found particularly progressive?<nl/> A: As you might imagine, technology companies like Google and Microsoft are leading the way in reducing their carbon footprints. Google, for example, has been carbon neutral since 2007. Google described how long-term (10-20 years) renewable energy contracts (committed to using renewable energy) help create financial certainty, but may not be something that a building landlord wants to sign given the duration. So they, as well as others in the industry, are still trying to figure out which constructs make the most sense to achieve the scale that is crucial to drive down costs for renewable energy.<nl/> Regarding Microsoft, I learned more about their internal carbon fee in Paris. Microsoft spoke to the power of putting carbon on a company's profit and loss statement. And in Microsoft's experience, the carbon fee also helps to provide an accountability mechanism. So even for a company like JLL that has a total carbon footprint of around 52,000 metric tons of CO2e (compared to 30,000+ metric tons of CO2e for Microsoft), a carbon fee may help speak in terms of money i.e. a tax instead of carbon. This could be the key to engaging a company's business leaders such as the Chief Financial Officer.\~<nl/> Q: Given JLL's long-term involvement with the UN Global Compact and other global organizations dealing with climate change, do you foresee additional engagement with other organizations moving forward?<nl/> A: We're committed to: continued involvement with the UN Global Compact; active participation in green building councils around the world; a longer-term collaboration with the World Economic Forum where our CEO has been actively engaged; and steady interest as a Business Network member in the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), which seeks to align capital allocation and corporate behavior to wider goals of financial stability and sustainable development.\~<nl/> To show our support for a positive COP21 outcome, we joined the UN Caring for Climate[3] initiative and the Non-state Actor Zone for Climate Action[4] (NAZCA). We also used our time in Paris to better understand the vast array of external organizations that are driving forward climate changes actions both within our industry and more broadly. As encouraged by our CEO, this will help JLL carefully review our climate change partnerships so that we are involved in the most focused and relevant way possible. This is especially important considering how the conversation on climate change has significantly advanced in the last few years.<nl/> Q: How does the outcome of the Climate Change agreement align with JLL's commitment to GHG emissions reduction and global sustainability?<nl/> A: Since 2008 JLL has recognized the impact of GHG emissions and committed to helping our clients address energy and sustainability in their real estate. Over time, we have also recognized that we cannot credibly offer these services without doing the same in our own operations.<nl/> As a result, we set 3 targets in 2013 for JLL offices to reduce our own environmental footprint. Our latest Global Sustainability Report[5] has details on these targets and our progress. COP 21 has spurred JLL to consider how we can reset our targets according to a longer timeframe and based on climate change science. We had considered this approach in 2013 and the Climate Change agreement provides extra impetus to raise our ambitious.\~<nl/> This reminds me of a powerful theme from COP 21 : the thresholds are continually getting higher and higher. Let's take a simple example based on company scores in initiatives such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index or CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project). Companies may score X in year 1, then X+1 in year 2. Even though improvement has been shown in year 2, the market is actually starting to require X+3.<nl/> This means expectations are higher over a shorter duration. Companies that do not innovate and that cannot change will lose the race. It's great to see that the Climate Change agreement - and general tone of the conference - was that we're all expecting more from one another. And that climate change is here to stay.\~<nl/> Q: How do you see the COP21 conference outcomes and the Climate Change agreement being received by your company's leadership and sustainability teams?\~<nl/> A: Ahead of the conference, JLL's CEO sent a note to all staff worldwide, which was then followed shortly by a note from me and Dan to JLL's internal sustainability stakeholders. The main aim of these notes was to make the firm's presence at COP 21 known, and it has started a great dialogue in many different directions about JLL's role in advancing climate change. It's terrific to see that the momentum and positivity from Paris carry over into conversations within JLL as well. <nl/> We certainly believe the conference outcomes are consistent with our long-term sustainability strategy, and our immediate plans include several briefings with JLL leadership to provide our COP 21 observations. We will also issue internal guidance that ensures our client account managers understand what COP 21 means for their clients across all sectors.<nl/> We see these developments as the perfect springboard to engage our clients and supply chain partners, further extending our influence beyond our business to create permanent, sustainable behavioral change.<nl/> Ultimately, our involvement in COP 21 - and even more so, the actions that we take following the Climate Change agreement - will help ensure we have a sustainable enterprise that clients, investors and employees can rely on for the long term.\~<nl/> About JLL's Sarah Nicholls\~<nl/> Sarah Nicholls is JLL's Global Corporate Sustainability (GCS) team leader. The GCS team focuses primarily on the sustainability strategy and reporting for JLL's own operations across the 80 countries where JLL serves its clients. As the inaugural GCS team member, Sarah serves on the firm's Global Operating Board alongside other corporate function leaders.

Rep. Albio Sires, D-N.J. (8th CD), issued the following statement: "The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ), held in Paris, France, concluded on December 12th with a progressive agreement amongst the 195 participating nations to work towards reducing the negative impacts of climate change. "The resulting Paris Agreement is a pact to reduce global carbon emissions and to keep global warming to under 2 degrees Celsius. This agreement undoubtedly marks a positive step forward and signifies an international recognition that climate change is a serious issue that needs to be addressed immediately. "Legally binding agreements to reduce global carbon emissions have always been difficult to achieve. Although issues like air pollution or sea level rise are acknowledged and dealt with on an individual basis, implementing strategies to curb them is often challenging. However, COP21 has proven that global attitudes about investment in climate change research and alternative energy development are shifting. Both the private and public sectors are showing willingness and an urgency to tackle these issues through investing in innovative technology. "In addition to the collective pledge of $100 billion by 2020 by participating parties to help developing nations mitigate climate change, major financial initiatives were undertaken by developed nations and the private sector to invest in clean energy. "Mission Innovation, for instance, is an agreement amongst 20 governments to double their investments in clean energy research and development (R&D) over the next five years. The coalition includes the five most populated countries (China, India, the United States, Indonesia, and Brazil) that together emit 75 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions from electricity. This equates to around $20 billion pledged by these countries to be invested in wind, solar, geothermal, and hydrogen energy R&D. "As Mission Innovation exemplifies the steps be taken by international governments to address investments in clean energy development, the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, formed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates, represents the steps taken by private investors to invest in similar progress. The Coalition's goal is to speed up the development of technologies to improve reliable, affordable, non-carbon producing energy. To do this, investors from around the world have come together to make significant financial commitments to a public research pipeline linked to substantial private investment. "The Agreement reached at COP21 is certainly promising and the emergence of an international commitment from both the public and private sectors to invest in affordable clean energy is equally encouraging. "Technological innovation is paramount to combatting the issue of climate change, and the multi-billion dollar pledges made at COP21 represent a global readiness to work together in taking a positive step forward. As we begin the New Year, I look forward to watching these partnerships cultivate the clean energy technologies of the future."

PARIS, Dec. 1 -- The United Nations Economic and Social Council's Economic Commission for Africa issued the following news release: The President of Benin, Boni Yayi, today praised the intellectual leadership role that Mr. Carlos Lopes and his team at the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) played in bringing content into the Africa Pavilion that was inaugurated this morning at the ongoing climate conference ( COP 21 ) in Paris France. Speaking at the ceremony, President Boni Yayi also thanked other development partners - the Africa Development Bank, the NEPAD Agency and the African Union Commission - for setting up "one of the most impressive pavilions at COP 21 " and said that the seriousness of documents and positon papers prepared by ECA's Africa Climate Policy Centre (ACPC) show that Africa has not come to COP 21 as beggars (financial or otherwise) but as a region ready to propose concrete solutions to climate change whose consequences "are burning our common house" - the planet. Other keynote speakers at the event: Madame Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, Chair of the African Union Commission; Mr. Ibrahim Assane Mayaki, CEO of the NEPAD Planning Agency; as well as Mr. Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank also had kind words for the Economic Commission for Africa. Earlier, Mr. Carlos Lopes, Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa addressed the audience in what observers dubbed Africa's indisputable case for action at COP 21 . He made the case for the new climate framework to speak to Africa's development priorities, as African countries have made and continue to make efforts to turn climate change challenges into development opportunities, in order to transform their economies for low-carbon and inclusive growth and prosperity. The said that African economies depend heavily on climate-sensitive sectors, citing the 5th Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, which confirms that without concerted global effort to curb runaway climate change, Africa will continue to suffer from increased extremes in its weather systems, increased water stress, reduced crop production and food security, increased health risks, land degradation and uncontrollable migration. He also elaborated on the adverse effects that climate change has on Africa's agriculture on which some 75 % of its people depend for their livelihoods. "It is one of the most vulnerable sectors to the impacts of climate change and it is also a sector that has huge potential for international trade. As a result of climate change crop yields are generally projected to decrease across Africa, putting security at risk." "Therefore, the COP21 must deliver a fair climate deal for Africa", he argued. He called on African negotiators to speak with one voice and work tirelessly to ensure that the new climate agreement is a fair deal for Africa. "It is in this spirit that the Economic Commission for Africa, the African Union Commission, the African Development Bank and the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency have come together to provide the Africa Pavilion at this a COP. The Pavilion is a platform for coordination of events, interests and stakeholders as well as an intellectual hub for exchange and fusion of ideas on climate change and its implications for the continent. Most importantly, the Pavilion is a symbol of the unity of an Africa speaking with one voice on issues of common concern. He said that with the momentum and successes arising from the Third International Conference on Financing for Development (FFD3) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and given the underlying importance of climate change on development and finance, "it is indeed the case that the COP21 is too big a climate conference to fail!" "This is particularly so for Africa whose long term development to meet the objectives of the continent's Agenda 2063 is highly at risk from the adverse impacts of climate change, even though the continent contributes the least to the nearly 50 giga tons of global greenhouse emissions", he added. Mr. Lopes took the opportunity to address the concerns of some participants who have incessantly questioned what constitute Africa common positions at COP 21 . He outlined at least 5 areas of common concern for the Continent: Ensuring that the agreement respects Article 2 of the UNFCCC to greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system; even 1.5 degrees could be too dangerous for Africa  Respecting the Article 3 of the Convention with regard to the core principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities, the precautionary principle and the right to sustainable development  Addressing the "polluter pays principle" and a balanced emphasis on adaptation and mitigation  Operationalizing concrete actions to address loss and damage associated with climate change impacts  Ensure appropriate, adequate and means of implementation covering finance, technology transfer, and capacity building As countries submit, evaluate and implement their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), African countries need to recognise the opportunities for low-carbon development pathways for their national strategies, he advised. President Boni Yayi is a known advocate for climate change adaptation and mitigation in Africa. At national level he launched the 10 Million Souls and 10 Million Tree Programme thanks to which Benin has planted over 10 million trees annually for the last three years. He is the only African president to have made a direct financial contribution towards the organisation of an African Pavilion at COP 21 .

Administration of Barack Obama, 2015 President Hollande, Mr. Secretary-General, fellow leaders: We have come to Paris to show our resolve. We offer our condolences to the people of France for the barbaric attacks on this beautiful city. We stand united in solidarity not only to deliver justice to the terrorist network responsible for those attacks, but to protect our people and uphold the enduring values that keep us strong and keep us free. And we salute the people of Paris for insisting this crucial conference go on, an act of defiance that proves nothing will deter us from building the future we want for our children. What greater rejection of those who would tear down our world than marshaling our best efforts to save it? Nearly 200 nations have assembled here this week, a declaration that for all the challenges we face, the growing threat of climate change could define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other. And what should give us hope that this is a turning point?that this is the moment we finally determined we would save our planet?is the fact that our nations share a sense of urgency about this challenge and a growing realization that it is within our power to do something about it. Our understanding of the ways human beings disrupt the climate advances by the day. Fourteen of the 15 warmest years on record have occurred since the year 2000, and 2015 is on pace to be the warmest year of all. No nation?large or small, wealthy or poor?is immune to what this means. This summer, I saw the effects of climate change firsthand in our northernmost State, Alaska, where the sea is already swallowing villages and eroding shorelines, where permafrost thaws and the tundra burns, where glaciers are melting at a pace unprecedented in modern times. And it was a preview of one possible future, a glimpse of our children's fate if the climate keeps changing faster than our efforts to address it: submerged countries, abandoned cities, fields that no longer grow, political disruptions that trigger new conflict, and even more floods of desperate peoples seeking the sanctuary of nations not their own. That future is not one of strong economies, nor is it one where fragile states can find their footing. That future is one that we have the power to change?right here, right now?but only if we rise to this moment. As one of America's Governors has said, "We are the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and the last generation that can do something about it." I've come here personally, as the leader of the world's largest economy and the second largest emitter, to say that the United States of America not only recognizes our role in creating this problem, we embrace our responsibility to do something about it. Over the last 7 years, we've made ambitious investments in clean energy and ambitious reductions in our carbon emissions. We've multiplied wind power threefold, solar power more than twentyfold, helping create parts of America where these clean power sources are finally cheaper than dirtier, conventional power. We've invested in energy efficiency in every way imaginable. We've said no to infrastructure that would pull high-carbon fossil fuels from the ground, and we've said yes to the first-ever set of national standards limiting the amount of carbon pollution our power plants can release into the sky. The advances we've made have helped drive our economic output to alltime highs and drive our carbon pollution to its lowest levels in nearly two decades. But the good news is, this is not an American trend alone. Last year, the global economy grew while global carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels stayed flat. And what this means can't be overstated. We have broken the old arguments for inaction. We have proved that strong economic growth and a safer environment no longer have to conflict with one another; they can work in concert with one another. And that should give us hope. One of the enemies that we'll be fighting at this conference is cynicism, the notion we can't do anything about climate change. Our progress should give us hope during these 2 weeks, hope that is rooted in collective action. Earlier this month in Dubai, after years of delay, the world agreed to work together to cut the superpollutants known as HFCs. That's progress. Already, prior to Paris, more than 180 countries representing nearly 95 percent of global emissions have put forward their own climate targets. That is progress. For our part, America is on track to reach the emissions targets that I set 6 years ago in Copenhagen: We will reduce our carbon emissions in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. And that's why last year I set a new target: America will reduce our emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels within 10 years from now. So our task here in Paris is to turn these achievements into an enduring framework for human progress, not a stopgap solution, but a long-term strategy that gives the world confidence in a low-carbon future. Here in Paris, let's agree to a strong system of transparency that gives each of us the confidence that all of us are meeting our commitments. And let's make sure that the countries who don't yet have the full capacity to report on their targets receive the support that they need. Here in Paris, let's reaffirm our commitment that resources will be there for countries willing to do their part to skip the dirty phase of development. And I recognize this will not be easy. It will take a commitment to innovation and the capital to continue driving down the cost of clean energy. And that's why this afternoon I'll join many of you to announce an historic joint effort to accelerate public and private clean energy innovation on a global scale. Here in Paris, let's also make sure that these resources flow to the countries that need help preparing for the impact of climate change that we can no longer avoid. We know the truth that many nations have contributed little to climate change, but will be the first to feel its most destructive effects. For some, particularly island nations, whose leaders I'll meet with tomorrow, climate change is a threat to their very existence. And that's why today, in concert with other nations, America confirms our strong and ongoing commitment to the Least Developed Countries Fund. And tomorrow, we'll pledge new contributions to risk-insurance initiatives that help vulnerable populations rebuild stronger after climate-related disasters. And finally, here in Paris, let's show businesses and investors that the global economy is on a firm path towards a low-carbon future. If we put the right rules and incentives in place, we'll unleash the creative power of our best scientists and engineers and entrepreneurs to deploy clean energy technologies and the new jobs and new opportunities that they create all around the world. There are hundreds of billions of dollars ready to deploy to countries around the world if they get the signal that we mean business this time. Let's send that signal. That's what we seek in these next 2 weeks. Not simply an agreement to roll back the pollution we put into our skies, but an agreement that helps us lift people from poverty without condemning the next generation to a planet that's beyond its capacity to repair. Here in Paris, we can show the world what is possible when we come together, united in common effort and by a common purpose. And let there be no doubt, the next generation is watching what we do. Just over a week ago, I was in Malaysia, where I held a town hall with young people, and the first question I received was from a young Indonesian woman. And it wasn't about terrorism, it wasn't about the economy, it wasn't about human rights. It was about climate change. And she asked whether I was optimistic about what we can achieve here in Paris and what young people like her could do to help. I want our actions to show her that we're listening. I want our actions to be big enough to draw on the talents of all our people?men and women, rich and poor?I want to show her passionate, idealistic young generation that we care about their future. For I believe, in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that there is such a thing as being too late. And when it comes to climate change, that hour is almost upon us. But if we act here, if we act now, if we place our own short-term interests behind the air that our young people will breathe and the food that they will eat and the water that they will drink and the hopes and dreams that sustain their lives, then we won't be too late for them. And, my fellow leaders, accepting this challenge will not reward us with moments of victory that are clear or quick. Our progress will be measured differently: in the suffering that is averted and a planet that's preserved. And that's what's always made this so hard. Our generation may not even live to see the full realization of what we do here. But the knowledge that the next generation will be better off for what we do here, can we imagine a more worthy reward than that? Passing that on to our children and our grandchildren, so that when they look back and they see what we did here in Paris, they can take pride in our achievement. Let that be the common purpose here in Paris: a world that is worthy of our children; a world that is marked not by conflict, but by cooperation, and not by human suffering, but by human progress; a world that's safer and more prosperous and more secure and more free than the one that we inherited. Let's get to work. Thank you very much. NOTE: The President spoke at 12:47 p.m. in La Seine Plenary Hall at the Parc des Expositions.

Washington: Office of the MP Albio Sires has issued the following news release: The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 Legally binding agreements to reduce global carbon emissions have always been difficult to achieve. Although issues like air pollution or sea level rise are acknowledged and dealt with on an individual basis, implementing strategies to curb them is often challenging. However, COP21 has proven that global attitudes about investment in climate change research and alternative energy development are shifting. Both the private and public sectors are showing willingness and an urgency to tackle these issues through investing in innovative technology. In addition to the collective pledge of $100 billion by 2020 by participating parties to help developing nations mitigate climate change, major financial initiatives were undertaken by developed nations and the private sector to invest in clean energy. Mission Innovation, for instance, is an agreement amongst 20 governments to double their investments in clean energy research and development (R&D) over the next five years. The coalition includes the five most populated countries (China, India, the United States, Indonesia, and Brazil) that together emit 75 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions from electricity. This equates to around $20 billion pledged by these countries to be invested in wind, solar, geothermal, and hydrogen energy R&D. As Mission Innovation exemplifies the steps be taken by international governments to address investments in clean energy development, the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, formed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates, represents the steps taken by private investors to invest in similar progress. The Coalition\' s goal is to speed up the development of technologies to improve reliable, affordable, non-carbon producing energy. To do this, investors from around the world have come together to make significant financial commitments to a public research pipeline linked to substantial private investment The Agreement reached at COP21 is certainly promising and the emergence of an international commitment from both the public and private sectors to invest in affordable clean energy is equally encouraging. Technological innovation is paramount to combatting the issue of climate change, and the multi-billion dollar pledges made at COP21 represent a global readiness to work together in taking a positive step forward. As we begin the New Year, I look forward to watching these partnerships cultivate the clean energy technologies of the future. \~ In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact:\~ HYPERLINK mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com editorial@plusmediasolutions.com \</doc>

LE BOURGET, France  President Barack Obama said Tuesday that parts of the global warming deal being negotiated in Paris should be legally binding on the countries that sign on, setting up a potential fight with Republicans at home. Obama's stand won praise at the U.N. climate conference from those who want a strong agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of coal, oil and gas. But it could rile conservatives in Washington, especially if he tries to put the deal into effect without seeking congressional approval. Obama's administration has pledged during the international talks to reduce U.S. emissions by up to 28 percent by 2025. But inscribing the emissions target in the Paris deal would probably require the president to submit the pact to the GOP-controlled Congress, where it would be unlikely to win ratification. Many Republicans doubt global warming is real or fear that stringent pollution controls could kill jobs. So the administration is looking to keep the targets out while including binding procedures on when and how countries should periodically review and raise their targets. "Although the targets themselves may not have the force of treaties, the process, the procedures that ensure transparency and periodic reviews, that needs to be legally binding," Obama said in Paris, "and that's going to be critical." Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and a fierce critic of Obama's policies, fired back immediately. "The U.S. Senate will not be ignored. If the president wishes to sign the American people up to a legally binding agreement, the deal must go through the Senate," he said in a statement. "There is no way around it." The White House previously said parts of the deal should be legally binding, but this is the first time Obama has said it himself and spelled out which ones. Obama's comments brought relief to the French hosts of the conference, who were worried about whether the U.S. wanted a binding deal at all after Secretary of State John Kerry told The Financial Times that the agreement was "definitely not going to be a treaty" and that there was "not going to be legally binding reduction targets." "The fact that the United States of America could commit to a binding agreement, whilst before there was a doubt because of Congress, is really extraordinary news that comes at a good time," French Environment Minister Segolene Royal said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other top Republicans have warned other countries not to trust any deal Obama may strike. Other GOP politicians moved to block Obama's plan to force steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. On Tuesday, the House passed two resolutions disapproving Obama's rules to reduce carbon emissions from power plants despite a promised presidential veto. At a news conference, House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked whether Congress was out of step with public opinion on climate change. "I don't think we're out of step with public opinion wanting jobs, wanting economic growth, weighing the costs and the benefits," Ryan said. "I think when you weigh the costs and the benefits against these so-called legally binding obligations, they don't add up. I think it's very clear people want jobs." At the Paris talks, the European Union has called for a legally binding agreement with emissions targets, but observers said it is likely to drop that demand over the next two weeks of negotiations to make sure the U.S. can join the deal. "I think at end of the day everyone knows that for the U.S. to be part of this, it can't have the emissions target itself legally embedded in the treaty," said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists. Earlier in the day, the president met with leaders of small island nations who fear their countries will be swallowed up by rising seas. Obama, who was born in Hawaii, said he understood the beauty and fragility of island life and called their populations "among the most vulnerable to the ravages of climate change." African leaders also stressed the need to do something about the Lake Chad region, where the Islamic extremist group Boko Haram has been carrying out bloody attacks. The lake, surrounded by Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria, has shrunk as much as 90 percent since 1960, changing the lives of farmers, fishermen and herders. Some say the increasing desperation is driving people into the extremists' ranks. The talks, which run through Dec. 11, are aimed at a broader, tougher replacement to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. That treaty required only rich countries to cut their emissions, while this time the goal is for everyone to pitch in. After protesters clashed with police earlier this week, Paris police on Tuesday extended a ban on public demonstrations around the climate conference until it is over. One of the smartest ways to fight global warming is putting a price on carbon dioxide pollution, such as a tax on carbon dioxide emissions or putting a price on carbon and trading carbon pollution according to leaders at the climate summit. \</doc>

Dec 27, 2015( Environmental and Urban Economics: HYPERLINK http://greeneconomics.blogspot.com http://greeneconomics.blogspot.com COP 21 Carbon Mitigation Conference? The NY Times posited that it will save the world. Is this true? How would researchers test for its causal effects? In this blog post, I will sketch some performance metrics.<nl/>In previous posts, I have pessimistically argued that the free riding problem[1] is here to stay and that this treaty will not achieve its lofty goals. I would like to be wrong about this but I believe that global greenhouse gas emissions will just keep rising and may even accelerate as India and Africa grow. A young political scientists should conduct the following research project; for each nation what promises did it make at the conference and now does it quickly implement its promises? If "no", why is the clock ticking? Which domestic interest groups are blocking the righteous new regulations? Or have other priorities emerged? If the government does enact the regulation, would the government have enacted this same regulation in the absence of the COP 21 ? Did the COP 21 spur any new carbon abatement activity? If the government enacts the regulation, what benchmarks will be used to judge whether it is effective? A before/after comparison in the nation's per-capita carbon emissions isn't sufficient because this doesn't allow one to infer the counter-factual. Since we don't have twins for nations, how do observe what the nation's carbon performance would have been in the absence of the COP 21 induced new regulatory rules? An optimist might counter; "Matt, you are not looking in the right places for progress here. The right metric is to examine the acceleration of the pace and diffusion of green technology." Okay, so in this case; researchers who study patent data can look at patenting in green tech and R...nvestments by country by year. Will they accelerate because of the COP21 ? In this age of Big Data, what are the right metrics for judging whether this conference was a "game changer"? At the end of the day, will the COP 21 achieve a game change by shifting expectations and signalling to the world that the "green economy" is coming and this field of dreams creates a self fulfilling prophesy? Or, did progressives need a week of feeling strong and hopeful before returning to the real world challenge of a world in which billions of people need energy services to live their version of the American Dream and the suburbanized United States is unwilling to vote for pricing carbon because our lifestyle would become more costly to continue?<nl/> [ 1]: HYPERLINK http://greeneconomics.blogspot.com/2015/12/no-more-free-riders-lessons-from-paris.html http://greeneconomics.blogspot.com/2015/12/no-more-free-riders-lessons-from-paris.html \</doc>

Dec 16, 2015( ReleaseWire: HYPERLINK http://www.releasewire.com http://www.releasewire.com COP 21 and future of youth driven climate action. Special recognition from Bill Clinton and the Turner family on how IDEAS is equipped to lead the charge.<nl/>Orlando, FL -- (ReleaseWire[1]) -- 12/16/2015 -- After one of the most difficult deliberations and agreements in United Nations history, the twenty one year saga of debates on climate change have finally come to a close in Paris, France with the establishment of a universal document outlining a goal to hold the World to - stop global climate change by keeping temperatures below 2C and strive to reach 1.5C. <nl/> <nl/>Some have called the historic COP21 Agreement, and its goal of curtailing emissions "an achievement bigger than the industrial revolution" or "the final nail in the coffin of the Fossil Fuel Era", while others have called it "empty promises with no plan of action".<nl/><nl/>Mixed reactions are to be expected considering the document was a true process of compromise, that on paper at least, culminated with an unprecedented consensus of over 195 nations that climate change is happening and that it is human caused. Previous sessions over the last twenty one years since the Rio Convention created the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), have had little success grappling with such issues of how the developed World would be able to help the developing World fight and pay for climate change resilience and mitigation. Yet, with the strike of a gavel on December 12th, 2015, the Paris Climate Agreements became history. <nl/><nl/>The COP21 Agreement is a giant step in the right direction on a long road to solving climate change. Environmental, social and economic development will fail if citizens, businesses, and particularly NGOs do not play a significant role in driving human ingenuity, developing action, and holding their leaders responsible with measurable results. <nl/><nl/>This need for action harks back to Former President Bill Clinton's 2013 Commencement Speech at the University of Central Florida where he said "No matter how smart we are, how righteous we are, how close to the truth we are, we all do better when we work together, when we share prosperity, when we share responsibilities, when we share membership in the community... Look at IDEAS -- they had no money, they didn't know what was going to happen  now The White House recognizes them as change agents and today that group is called IDEAS For Us." <nl/><nl/>The former 42nd President of the United States inadvertently spoke to the role of youth have to play in this process by referring to the successes of the UN Accredited NGO, IDEAS For Us. This global organization with a presence in over 20 countries seeks to develop, fund, and measure solutions to the World's most pressing environmental and social problems. IDEAS For Us has a long history of working hand in hand with the United Nations, White House, U.S. State Department, and various other institutions to advance sustainability goals worldwide. They've also joined the Sustainable Energy For All practitioners network and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) to share cross-cutting sustainable solutions that can replicate to communities around the World.<nl/><nl/>Millennials have a considerable role to play in this sustainable transition, particularly because they represent the largest generation in human history. <nl/><nl/>John Rutherford Seydel, the grandson of Ted Turner and youth environmental advocate says "The COP21 agreements creates the mechanism, the architecture, and the responsibility for developed and developing countries alike to continually tackle this problem in an effective way. But let us not forget that the problem is not solved because of this agreement, better yet the solution has just begun. With the help of organizations like IDEAS For Us, we will help delay or avoid some of the worst consequences of climate change by mobilizing our youth, and communities to pave the way for even more progress, in successive stages, over the coming years." <nl/><nl/>Earlier in 2015, IDEAS For Us was invited by the United Nations to work hand in hand to aid in developing the sustainable development goals being reviewed at COP 21 . Recently, in August 2015, Chris Castro, President of IDEAS For Us, presented at the United Nations for over 2 hours on the importance of NGO lead action. He stated, "These agreements will hold no weight without local action and accountability. The Paris Climate Agreement marks the beginning of a long journey ahead to improve the lives and wellbeing of everyone, end the fossil fuel era, and empower local governments, academia, civil society, NGO's, community groups, and the private sector to accelerate local solutions to these challenges."<nl/><nl/>Despite the need for action, making lasting change at the community level - let alone the global level - is difficult. Funding stands at the largest barrier for projects, considering it is always in short supply and usually lacks the oversight to ensure a project's development, measurement, and success. As a result, IDEAS For Us is in the midst of a capital campaign, raising funding to develop more ideas into solutions, measure the results, and then scale those solutions across their Network. IDEAS For Us recently funded five international projects in the 4th quarter of 2015 as cool as Ugandan aquaculture in Lake Victoria, reforestation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and sustainability education in Liberia. <nl/><nl/>About IDEAS For Us<nl/>IDEAS For Us aims to ride the momentum COP21 has created, the right timing for large scale action on climate change is now. The hope is that with community, business, and governmental support, IDEAS For Us will be able to develop more ideas into solutions, measure the results, and then scale for capacity and impact across their grassroots, youthful network. "This is the first step in a long journey, but it's a great journey ahead", assured Castro.<nl/>For more information on this press release visit: HYPERLINK http://www.releasewire.com/press-releases/ideas-pledges-local-action-in-light-of-cop21-agreement-650025.htm http://www.releasewire.com/press-releases/ideas-pledges-local-action-in-light-of- HYPERLINK http://www.releasewire.com/press-releases/ideas-pledges-local-action-in-light-of-cop21-agreement-650025.htm cop21 -agreement-650025.htm http://www.ideasforus.org http://www.ideasforus.org [4]<nl/> [ 1]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.releasewire.com/?utm_source=nt..._medium=feed..._campaign=distribution [ 2]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.releasewire.com/press-releases/ideas-pledges-local-action-in-light-of-cop21-agreement-650025.htm?utm_source=nt..._medium=feed..._campaign=distribution http://www.releasewire.com/press-releases/ideas-pledges-local-action-in-light-of- HYPERLINK http://www.releasewire.com/press-releases/ideas-pledges-local-action-in-light-of-cop21-agreement-650025.htm?utm_source=nt..._medium=feed..._campaign=distribution cop21 -agreement-650025.htm?utm_source=nt..._medium=feed..._campaign=distribution [ 3]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.releasewire.com/press-releases/contact/650025?utm_source=nt..._medium=feed..._campaign=distribution http://www.releasewire.com/press-releases/contact/650025?utm_source=nt..._medium=feed..._campaign=distribution [ 4]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.ideasforus.org http://www.ideasforus.org \</doc>

The following information was released by International Strategy for Disaster Reduction: Delegates at the COP21 global climate summit have thrown the spotlight on resilience, a central issue in international efforts to reduce the risk of disasters and face up to growing environmental challenges. Resilience is a key word in this COP 21 , Ms. Sgolne Royal, Frances Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy told a special conference session. Resilience was invented by psychologists and was defined as an individual's ability to properly adapt to stress and adversity. Stress and adversity can come from family or relationship problems, health problems, or workplace and financial worries, among others and it is no wonder why we use it now for climate change, as millions of people suffer every year from the negative impacts of floods, storms and cyclones, she said. This is the first time that such human dimension is integrated in an international climate conference and it is our moral responsibility to find the solutions to stop the suffering of millions of people who are affected by climate change, she added. The theme of resilience is at the core of the Lima to Paris Action Agenda (LPAA), launched in 2014 the previous climate change conference in Peru with the aim of strengthening climate action beyond COP21 . A daylong resilience event on Wednesday brought together a host of high-level participants from a range of fields, including governments, the UN, researchers, the private sector and civil society to present solutions and announce individual and cooperative commitments to tackle climate change impacts. A report issued last week by UNISDR and the Belgian-based Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED), The Human Cost of Weather Related Disasters, shows that over the last twenty years, 90% of major disasters have been caused by 6,457 recorded floods, storms, heatwaves, droughts and other weather-related events. The report also demonstrated that since the COP1 climate summit in 1995, 606,000 lives have been lost and 4.1 billion people have been injured, left homeless or in need of emergency assistance as a result of weather-related disasters. Current trends indicate that extreme weather is increasing in frequency and intensity as the climate changes, increasing the pressure on people around the world. COP21 caps a year of international meetings with an interlocking sustainability agenda. The first was in March, yielding the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, a 15-year agreement that seeks to curb the impact of natural and man-made hazards and thereby reduce disaster-related deaths, the number of people affected, and economic damage. After an international agreement on development financing in July, governments in September adopted the Sustainable Development Goals, which have the same timeline as the Sendai Framework. The year 2015 has been an extraordinary one for new instruments, new vision, new actions with resilience at the core of the solutions for a safer planet, said Ms. Margareta Wahlstrm, Head of the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction. We have heard today what can be achieved through multi-stakeholder approaches partnering with the private sector, science and the civil society. Change is already happening and there are already many good examples of how individual and collaborative leadership can accelerate transformation and increase engagement over time, she told participants. Resilience is centered on a culture of inclusiveness, cooperation, accountability and prevention she concluded. The Sendai Framework, the Sustainable Development Goals and the new climate agreement are three instruments that enable us to pursue integrated approaches that draw from diverse disciplines and fields. We have all the instruments to succeed and to meet the 2030 goals, she added. The LPAA announced a number of initiatives and current projects to bolster resilience and better protect those most vulnerable to climate change. The US$80 million Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) initiative launched this week by France and other donor countries will equip more than 80 developing countries by 2020. The European Commission announced a contribution of 125 million euros to help communities cope with what it expected to be the strongest El Nio on record, while the UNs Food and Agriculture Organization is to roll out new initiatives to assist affected farmers. The UN also unveiled the Anticipate, Absorb, Reshape (A2R) initiative, which will give more social protection to vulnerable people and assist countries to better anticipate hazards, absorb shocks such as extreme weather, and reshape their development to reduce climate risks. \</doc>

\~As world leaders convene at the United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ) in Paris to negotiate an agreement on climate, MSLGROUP will host an event at the Paris Institute of Political Studies (Sciences Po) on December 5 to put the spotlight on Millennial change-makers who will inherit much of the responsibility for transforming how the world consumes, works and innovates. Sciences Po is the world-famous political science university based in the heart of Paris. The event will bring together inspiring Millennials with a robust roster of top corporate leaders and sustainability experts like the Danone Ecosystem/Social Innovation Fund and B-Lab. Together, they will explore how the Millennial generation can lead the response to climate change. MSLGROUP units Salterbaxter MSLGROUP and Publicis Consultants MSLGROUP have been part of a global collaboration for the event. As Millennials face this climate crisis, according to MSLGROUP's recent reportA Chance for Change: The Tipping Point for Sustainable Business,\~their reactions range from fear, frustration and a sense of powerlessness to one of personal responsibility and hope. In response, Millennials want to see more collaboration between business and government to address climate change. #MakeItWork A unique film has been made about the negotiations and will be screened at the Chance for Change event. Sponsored by MSLGROUP, this film is the culmination of the Make it Work worldwide initiative. The COP21 : Make it Work project, led by Sciences Po, brought together 200 students from around the world in May to take part in a public simulation of the COP process. The simulation led to five key recommendations on the negotiation which have been presented to the COP21 officials in order that the process might have a better chance of success. The project was inspired by the fact that for 20 years, international climate negotiations have stalled on action to address the urgency of climate change stemming from a complexity of intersecting issues and the institutionalization of a certain format of the negotiations over the years. The film is directed by David Bornstein and produced by Les Films de l'Air. Event Information Organizations interested in sending Millennial or other delegates to the event can reach out HYPERLINK mailto:tojbayly@salterbaxter.comto tojbayly@salterbaxter.comto To view the event live on December\~5\~or on replay on the Internet, click HYPERLINK http://blog.mslgroup.com/chance-for-change/ http://blog.mslgroup.com/chance-for-change/ .

The following information was released by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP): More than half a billion children live in areas with extremely high flood occurrence and 160 million in high drought severity zones, leaving them highly exposed to the impacts of climate change, UNICEF said in a report released ahead of the 21st United Nations climate change conference , known as COP21 . Further Resources UNICEF "The sheer numbers underline the urgency of acting now," said UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake. "Today's children are the least responsible for climate change, but they, and their children, are the ones who will live with its consequences. And, as is so often the case, disadvantaged communities face the gravest threat." Climate change means more droughts, floods, heatwaves and other severe weather conditions. These events can cause death and devastation, and can also contribute to the increased spread of major killers of children, such as malnutrition, malaria and diarrhoea. This can create a vicious circle: A child deprived of adequate water and sanitation before a crisis will be more affected by a flood, drought, or severe storm, less likely to recover quickly, and at even greater risk when faced with a subsequent crisis. The vast majority of the children living in areas at extremely high risk of floods are in Asia, and the majority of those in areas at risk of drought are in Africa. World leaders gathering in Paris for COP21 held from November 30 to December 11 will seek to reach agreement on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, which most experts say is critical to limiting potentially catastrophic rises in temperature. "We know what has to be done to prevent the devastation climate change can inflict. Failing to act would be unconscionable," said Lake. "We owe it to our children and to the planet to make the right decisions at COP21 ." Download broadcast quality photos and video. About UNICEF UNICEF promotes the rights and wellbeing of every child, in everything we do. Together with our partners, we work in 190 countries and territories to translate that commitment into practical action, focusing special effort on reaching the most vulnerable and excluded children, to the benefit of all children, everywhere. \</doc>

(RTTNews) - The United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said government representatives made history, following the adoption of the new Paris Agreement on climate change. "The Paris Agreement is a monumental triumph for people and our planet," said Mr. Ban in a tweet, immediately following its adoption. "It sets the stage for progress in ending poverty, strengthening peace and ensuring a life of dignity and opportunity for all." Gaveling the Agreement with a green hammer, the French Foreign Minister and President of COP21 , Laurent Fabius, announced the historic news - a moment greeted with loud applause and cheers, as the room stood up. Many delegates hugged, while others had tears in their eyes. For the first time today, 195 Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) - pledged to curb emissions, strengthen resilience and joined to take common climate action. This followed two weeks of tireless negotiations at the United Nations climate change conference or COP21 . COP21 cover all the crucial areas identified as essential for a landmark conclusion: mitigation - reducing emissions fast enough to achieve the temperature goal; a transparency system and global stock-take - accounting for climate action; adaptation - strengthening ability of countries to deal with climate impacts; loss and damage - strengthening ability to recover from climate impacts; and support - including finance, for nations to build clean, resilient futures. "All countries have agreed to hold global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius. And recognizing the risk of grave consequences, you have further agreed to pursue efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5 degrees," Ban Ki-moon said. In addition, a review mechanism has been established whereby every five years, beginning in 2018, Parties will regularly review what is needed in line with science. According to the International Energy Agency, the full implementation of climate pledges will require the energy sector to invest $13.5 trillion in energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies from 2015 to 2030, representing almost 40% of total energy sector investment. The International Energy Agency noted that around $8.3 trillion is needed to improve energy efficiency in the transport, buildings and industry sectors, while much of the remaining investment is to decarbonise the power sector. More than 60% of total investment in power generation capacity is projected to be for renewable capacity, at $4.0 trillion, with one-third of this being for wind power, almost 30% for solar power (mainly solar photovoltaics) and around one-quarter for hydropower. While OECD countries absorb 60% of energy efficiency investment ($5 trillion), non-OECD countries absorb a greater share of the investment in low-carbon technologies ($2.7 trillion).

The World Council of Churches issued the following news release: A statement calling for a binding agreement on climate crisis, and a call for two degrees rise in temperature, the internationally-agreed target for limiting global warming, was presented to the French president Francois Hollande by representatives of the Conference of Religious Leaders of France (CRCF) on 1 July at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France. In their meeting with the French president and other government officials, including the ecology minister and the interior minister, the CRCF representatives discussed moral aspects of climate change and preparations for the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ), which will be held in the French capital this December. The two demands made in the statement echo the ACT Alliance's climate change advocacy campaign ACT Now for Climate Justice ( HYPERLINK http://actclimate.org/ ) - an initiative strongly supported by the World Council of Churches (WCC) and its programme for climate justice. In the text of the statement, the group stressed conviction that the climate crisis is a spiritual and moral challenge. "It is first and foremost our relationship with nature and with creation as a gift of God that is at stake," reads the statement. Signed by representatives from the Bishops' Conference of France (CEF), the Protestant Federation of France (FPF), the Assembly of Orthodox Bishops of France (AEOF), the Buddhist Union of France (UBF), the French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM), the chief Rabbi of France and the president of the Jewish Consistory Council of France, the document highlights a strong concern for the future generations. "Our spiritual and moral conscience is challenged. We are challenged to act for justice, to work for peace, and to prepare urgently a safe and viable future for our children, to leave behind the era of energy that pollutes, and to rethink our economic models of production and unlimited consumption," reads the statement. The delegation included Martin Kopp, a young leader of the Lutheran World Federation, and Laura Morosini from the Christians United for the Earth. The two delegates have played a key role in setting up the Fast for the Climate initiative in France. The meeting of French religious leaders with President Hollande was followed by a strong social media action coordinated by the Fast for the Climate campaign, in which climate justice activists called for " COP 21 to enable a just transition to a safe climate future". The statement's demands commitment by world leaders "to a timely end to the era of fossil fuels and sets out the bringing together of objectives for reducing global greenhouse gas emissions so that the average temperature rise be kept to well below 2degreeC, and which includes rules that ensure transparency, responsibility and a process of regular review of the objectives; the protection of the most vulnerable populations from the impact of change by helping them to adapt to this impact and by taking into account the loss and damage they suffer; the promotion of both responsible ecological development and the fight against poverty by guaranteeing adequate financing, technological transfer and reinforcing knowledge and expertise." The CRCF was created on 23 November 2010. It brings together six groups of religious leaders from Buddhist organizations, churches (Roman Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant), as well as organizations representing Islam and Judaism. For Rev. Francois Clavairoly President of the Protestant Federation of France, and one of the religious leaders who helped to write the text, the work on climate justice is helping to increase mutual collaboration both between Christian churches and between faith leaders in the country. "Until about eighteen months ago religions in France had not federated their knowledge about climate change. We are grateful that preparations for COP21 have raised awareness of the climate crisis, and also given us a lot of theological and spiritual work," said Clavaiorly. "The Fast for the Climate campaign helps build a grass roots movement, involving all in the walk of responsibility towards a safe climate future."

Regulatory News: On the occasion of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) at Paris-Le Bourget, the France-China Committee1 awarded last Friday December 4th, its 2015 Innovation Awards focused on "Climate Solutions" and awarded Air Liquide (Paris:AI) the Innovative Product Award for its Heat Oxy-Combustion technology. Developed by Air Liquide R&D teams, this breakthrough innovation enables to reduce the environmental impact of the glass melting process. Energy efficiency and emission reduction are critical for the glass industry which needs a significant amount of energy to achieve the extremely high temperatures necessary for glass melting. Oxy-combustion is based on the enrichment of air with pure oxygen. It is widely used for the glass and metal industries to improve the combustion process, reduce air pollutant emissions and save fuel. The Heat Oxy-Combustion technology is an innovative technology that makes oxy-combustion even more efficient. It is based on the following principle: extract heat from the combustion fumes and use it to heat oxygen and fuel hence maximizing the oxy-combustion performance by 10%. Compared to air combustion, this technology provides up to 50% energy savings and up to 50% CO2 emission reduction. So far, this technology has been implemented in several glass factories in Europe, owned by major glass players. It is of particular interest to the Chinese market which represents about 50% of the worldwide glass production. To develop this unique patented technology, Air Liquide's R&D teams have designed safe and reliable equipment, fully integrated with glass melting furnaces. The Group has substantial R&D resources and strong experience in glass making thanks to its extensive network of field experts and dedicated testing platforms in France, the United States and China. For more than 20 years, they have been mastering oxy-combustion technologies including patented burners and furnace heat modeling. Fran\'e7ois Darchis, member of the Air Liquide Executive Committee supervising Innovation and the Industrial Merchant Business Line, commented:"We are honored to receive this prize which demonstrates the unique expertise of Air Liquide in the field of oxy-combustion and its capacity to provide innovative technologies to address the industry's environmental challenges. This recognition by the France-China Committee recognizes Air Liquide leadership in innovation."

Dec 17, 2015( Zacks Investment Research: HYPERLINK http://www.zacks.com COP 21 meet - which was the 21st annual conference of parties - to chalk out an elaborate and comprehensive plan to lower carbon emissions and moderate the warming of the planet. In any case, efforts to check global warming have been constant across countries.<nl/> \~<nl/>Not only developed economies, but the emerging ones too are pushing themselves to attain this goal. However, following two weeks of sharp diplomacy, 196 countries agreed upon a historic agreement on climate change last Saturday.<nl/>\~<nl/>Per the agreement, developed economies will provide a minimum of $100 billion to developing nations a year to finance the needed reforms they can't pay for to restrain greenhouse gas emission. Needless to say, clean energy stocks and ETFs as well as fossil-fuel free investments will enjoy a huge benefit in the coming days (read: Fight Global Warming with These ETFs[1]).<nl/>\~<nl/>Is There Any Loophole in COP 21 Treaty?<nl/>\~<nl/>Two key pollution causing sectors, international shipping and aviation were excluded from the COP 21 treaty. International shipping emits 2.4% of global greenhouse gas emissions, almost the same that the whole of Germany does. Total aviation gives up about 2% of global GHGs, and international flights make up about 65% of that number, per the source[2].<nl/>\~<nl/>These emissions do not come under the territory of any specific country and thus is out of the COP21 treaty. In fact greenhouse emissions are estimated to rise exponentially by 2050. However, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has indicated to that it will plan a global market-based measure to lower carbon emissions.<nl/>\~<nl/>The agency has vowed to perk up fuel efficiency by 1.5% each year until 2020 and 'to halve 2005-level emissions by 2050', per citylab.com. International Maritime Organization also 'has set an energy efficiency requirement for ships built in 2025, but not an overall carbon emissions target.'<nl/>\~<nl/>Needless to say, technological advancements are being tested rigorously in the aviation and shipping industry for decarbonization, but it has a long way to go. As of now, these two sectors are not as vulnerable as the fossil-fuel related sectors from Paris climate summit. Investors can safely play or dump airline and shipping stocks and ETFs on their inherent sector strength or weakness. Below we highlight two sector ETFs in detail (read: Why Fossil Fuel Free ETFs are a Great Investment Now[3]).<nl/>\~<nl/>Airline - U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS[4]) <nl/>\~<nl/>This fund provides exposure to the global airline industry, including airline operators and manufacturers from all over the world, by tracking the U.S. Global Jets Index. In total, the product holds 34 securities with double-digit allocation going to Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Continental.<nl/>\~<nl/>Other firms hold less than 4.44% share. The ETF has a certain tilt toward large cap stocks at 62% while small and mid caps account for 24% and 14% share, respectively, in the basket. The fund has gathered $48.4 million in its asset base while sees moderate trading volume of nearly 40,000 shares a day. It charges investors 60 bps in annual fees. The fund added 13.2% in the last six months (as of December 15, 2015) (read: Highflier Airlines Earnings: Time for JETS ETF[5]).<nl/>\~<nl/>Guggenheim Shipping ETF (SEA[6])<nl/><nl/>The $30.2-million fund tracks the Dow Jones Global Shipping Index and holds 26 securities in its basket. The index reflects high dividend-paying companies in the global shipping industry. As far as the sector breakdown goes, the fund is concentrated on the industrial sector with about 58.8% exposure while the rest is attributed to the energy sector.<nl/><nl/>In terms of geographic distribution, the U.S. takes the top spot with more than 36% of focus, followed by the Denmark (19.1%), Japan (13.5%) and Greece (9.5%). The product charges 65 bps in annual fees for this diversified exposure. However, the fund was off about 31% in the last six months (as of December 15, 2015).<nl/>\~<nl/>Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Washington: American Petroleum Institute has issued the following news release: While API reviews the agreement reached at the COP21 climate negotiations, the trade association is urging world leaders to recognize the proven results of America\' s market-driven model for addressing climate challenges, according to API President and CEO Jack Gerard.  America\' s private sector has already taken the lead on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, even as we increase economic activity and domestic energy production to keep energy reliable and affordable for consumers, Gerard said.  Our success is driven, not by government mandate or legislative fiat, but through innovation, investment and entrepreneurial spirit.  The United States has become the world leader in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. And EPA data show that methane emissions are also plummeting, with the largest reductions coming from hydraulically fractured natural gas wells.  Our nation\' s 21st century energy renaissance, which has made domestically produced natural gas cheap and abundant, has helped us achieve substantial and sustained emissions reductions without command-and-control style regulatory intervention. Where other nations have pledges, we have progress and results.  We will closely scrutinize the COP 21 API is the only national trade association representing all facets of the oil and natural gas industry, which supports 9.8 million U.S. jobs and 8 percent of the U.S. economy. API\' s more than 650 members include large integrated companies, as well as exploration and production, refining, marketing, pipeline, and marine businesses, and service and supply firms. They provide most of the nation\' s energy and are backed by a growing grassroots movement of more than 30 million Americans. \~ In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: HYPERLINK editorial@plusmediasolutions.com \</doc>

Dec 07, 2015( Somewhat Reasonable: HYPERLINK / Delivered by Newstex) The main boulevard between buildings at COP-21 in Paris.[This is the third in a series of reports from the United Nations COP21 climate conference filed in Paris by Heartland Institute senior fellow for environment policy James Taylor.] PARIS - Halfway through the United Nations COP21 climate conference in Paris, the UN on Friday released a 'draft agreement' that illustrates the futility and irrelevance of the UN conference. The draft agreement is merely confirmation that the developing nations which emit the majority of global carbon dioxide emissions refuse to cut emissions and want massive wealth transfers from developed nations, while leaders of developed nations realize they are powerless to meet the extortionist demands of developing nations. The reason the UN released merely a draft agreement rather than a final agreement is because there has been no agreement on any of the most important issues under discussion. Developing nations insist on (1) ever-increasing amounts of monetary payments from developed nations, (2) steep reductions in emissions from developed nations, (3) international authority to enforce the developed nations' monetary payments and steep emissions cuts, and (4) no requirement for developing nations to reduce their own emissions. Even climate activist politicians such as U.S. President Barack Obama realize their citizens will never tolerate or approve such one-sided restrictions and obligations. With such a wide gulf between the demands of developing nations and the capacity of developed nations policymakers to cave in to such demands, the just-released draft agreement is merely political window dressing for leaders of all nations - developing and developed alike - to save face and tell the citizens of their nations they have struck an agreement. Canadian Green Party leader Elizabeth May explained the divide in a Friday Associated Press story[1], observing the draft agreement is 'just a package of things on which people don't yet agree.' Wealthy developing nation China emits more carbon dioxide than any other nation in the world[2], and twice as many emissions as the nation with the second-most emissions, the United States. Wealthy developing nation India ranks third in carbon dioxide emissions. Cumulatively, the Western-style democracies targeted by the developing nations - the United States, the European Union, Canada, and Japan - emit less than one-third of global carbon dioxide emissions. Developing nations have made it clear they will not soften any of their demands. Accordingly, any meaningful final deal requires the United States and other Western democracies to burden their citizens with monumental wealth transfers, severe energy restrictions, and the surrender of national sovereignty to international enforcement bodies. Even climate alarmists like U.S. president Barack Obama realize they cannot obtain domestic authority to commit their nations to such demands. As a result, the chances of a meaningful climate agreement emerging from Paris are dim. What is dim news for UN climate conference participants is bright news for billions of people around the world. The best and latest scientific evidence[3] indicates humans are not creating a climate crisis. The lack of substantial new restrictions on affordable energy will allow economies to prosper and people to keep more of their earnings to spend on better nutrition, housing, education, health care, and consumer goods that allow people to live longer, more productive, and more enjoyable lives. The United Nations COP21 climate conference may be doomed to failure, but that failure is a victory for the people of the world.

Hundreds of Southern California residents from North Hollywood to Long Beach joined the movement to push for comprehensive global and local legislations to regulate practices affecting the environment such as fracking and gas emissions. Residents gathered at the Los Angeles City Hall to support the Global Climate March movement in conjunction with the COP21 United Nations climate change conference in Paris. The Global Climate March movement was led by the worldwide organization 350, which focuses on advocating for climate justice and protection of the environment for a better future. According to 350, there were 175 countries in participation and 2,300 marches taking place to influence leaders at COP21 . While 350 is a global movement, Angelenos had their own demands for the Eric Garcetti and Jerry Brown administrations, including a decreased dependency on natural gas, and an increase in renewable energy alternatives and water conservation in the midst of California's drought. Gov. Jerry Brown is currently in Paris at COP21 alongside 190 world leaders advocating for climate change action and presenting California as a prime example of gas emission reduction. According to the California Environmental Protection Agency, emissions have dropped 7 percent since 2004. "As far as policy is concerned, I'm not very happy about what they have been doing," said Iris Lovelace, environmental activist and Signal Hill resident. "They say they're doing one thing but then you see someone like Garcetti who went from 20 percent to 40 percent natural gas demand. Instead of decreasing, he wants to increase it and that's his version of changing to clean energy." Locally, Lovelace is also part of various organizations such as Stop Fracking Long Beach to raise awareness about the environmental impacts of fracking on their communities and push for legislation. "If you know Signal Hill, you know there are oil wells all over the place," Lovelace said. "Stop Fracking Long Beach is doing a good job trying to bring it to the attention of the community and we're having lobby meetings with city council members to educate them because its like they've never heard of fracking until we walk in the door." Before the march, leaders from organizations such as California Against Fracking and SoCal 350 coalition took the stage to rally Angelinos to join the cause against fossil fuels and advocate for renewable energy. COP21 conference will continue until Dec. 11 as leaders attempt to reach an agreement to keep global warming under 2 degrees Celsius. \</doc>

France: Suez Environnement has issued the follwoing news release: \~ \~ H\'e9l\'e8ne Valade, SUEZ Sustainable Development Director, answers our questions on the COP 21 and the Group's commitment. From 30 November until 11 December 2015, SUEZ - as an official partner of the COP 21 \- will present its solutions to a specialised audience in Le Bourget as well as to the general public at Le Grand Palais in Paris. What are the actions and goals?The COP 21 is the 21st "Conference of the Parties" on climate change. Organised by the UN. This year, the event is bringing together 196 signatories in Paris, from 195 countries and the European Union. The ultimate aim is to limit global temperature increase by 2100 to 2\'b0C compared to 1900. This objective can only be achieved by establishing common rules to all countries \- quantified greenhouse gas reduction commitments with funding mechanisms to help developing countries to enter the energy transition.For SUEZ, the fight against climate disruption is a top priority. It is the very essence of our work. In 2008, the Group had already set itself targets to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and to preserve water resources. Today, SUEZ continues to develop initiatives as a non-State actor. For instance the group set up the Business Alliance For Water, which brings together 25 companies to discuss the water issue, a topic judged to be as important as carbon. Today, SUEZ is making 12 new commitments for climate. These commitments aim to: \~\~\~ continue the efforts to reduce the Group\' s carbon footprint; \~\~\~ promote the circular economy model that structurally reduces greenhouse gas emissions and protects natural resources; \~\~\~ adapt to the consequences of global warming on water.SUEZ has chosen to be present at a partnership-based stand \- the Vivapolis stand, which unites 11 exhibitors involved in sustainable cities development. Bringing together companies such as Dassault Systems, Vinci and HSBC, as well as young innovative companies, the space is built around a shared vision: everyone must act for the climate. Through interactive workshops, SUEZ will introduce you to its solutions to promote a more circular economy and a sustainable resource management. You can take part in a sorting game, discover how a carbon sink works, and take a guided tour of a waste recovery facility using virtual reality glasses.\~ \~ In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: HYPERLINK mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com editorial@plusmediasolutions.com \</doc>

The following information was released by the International City/County Management Association (ICMA): ICMA partnered with the China Urban Sustainability Coalition and ICMA's China Center, along with 20 other organizations, to develop the resource 10 Key Principles of Low Carbon Urbanization, which was released to coincide with the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 21 ) last week. The report serves as a guide for sound practices in planning and development and concludes that: Raising land use efficiency is the key to achieving low carbon urban form. Non-motorized transport (walking and biking) must be integrated into public transportion network. Measures such as mixed land use, raising the operational efficiency and service level of public transport, and strengthening parking demand management can reduce motor vehicle use, thereby reducing urban carbon emissions. When developing low-carbon industry and commerce, cities should not only pay attention to the upgrading of technological equipment, but also emphasize the process management of energy and resource utilization efficiency. Cities should focus on public participation, low carbon community development, and multi-stakeholder governance. Additional climate change resources can be found in the sustainability topic area on the ICMA Knowledge Network. \</doc>

As the festive season begins, some farmers say that consumers should be asking about the origins of their food, and thinking about who produces it, especially in light of the historic accord reached at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 21 ) on Dec. 12 in Paris. "Consumers need to think: what is behind my cup of coffee, behind my cup of chocolate ... and is the price I'm paying giving enough to the producer," said Luis Martinez, a representative of the Latin American and Caribbean smallholder farmers group CLAC who spoke on the sidelines of the conference hosted by France. "There has to be an awareness process," he added. "Consumers have a lot to say because the choices they make influence society, and when they buy a product, they give value to it." Martinez and a diverse group of farmers' associations attended COP 21 to make sure that policy makers listened to the voices of farmers, particularly those most affected by climate change. They appealed for action to help agricultural producers adapt to the effects of climate change and for support in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the sector. Delegates told stories of farmers abandoning their lands and moving to urban areas because they are unable to survive otherwise. They described extreme weather conditions that have caused damage to their crops, and they called attention to the spreading of diseases such as "coffee rust" that has diminished productivity in several Latin American countries. Farmers attending the conference also acknowledged that their sector is part of the global climate-change problem, but many emphasized that a distinction had to be made between huge agricultural concerns and smallholder farming. Agribusiness in general has been criticized for a range of unsustainable practices including monoculture plantations, deforestation, land grabbing for biofuel production, and the widespread use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and hormones. U.N. figures show that agriculture is directly responsible for 13.5 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions (through methane from animal digestion and nitrous oxide from cultivation, including the use of synthetic fertilizers), and indirectly for another 17 per cent of emissions through deforestation or the clearing of land to feed and graze animals. The sector thus cannot be ignored, and the Paris Agreement recognizes the "particular vulnerabilities of food production systems" to the adverse impacts of climate change. It mentions the "fundamental priority of safeguarding food security and ending hunger" and indicates that the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions should occur in a way that does not "threaten food production." The accord's main aim is to keep the average global temperature rise this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius and to drive efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But it has generated both widespread praise and criticism, with world leaders calling the accord "historic" and "robust" while some civil society groups say it doesn't go far enough even if it's a step in the right direction. Kumi Naidoo, Greenpeace International's Executive Director, said, "The Paris Agreement is only one step on a long road, and there are parts of it that frustrate and disappoint me, but it is progress. This deal alone won't dig us out the hole we're in, but it makes the sides less steep." For the World Farmers' Organisation (WFO) - an international body of agricultural producers - the agreement shows that farmers were heard, even if "everybody cannot be fully satisfied", said Dr. Marco Manzano de Marinis, WFO's Secretary General. "We would have loved to have agriculture more mentioned and more directly involved in the different articles of the document adopted," he told IPS. "However, food security and food production are there." He said it was essential that governments had considered the importance of producing food alongside the need to combat climate change. "Without food, there is no social stability," he said, mentioning recent upheavals such as the Arab Spring that have been linked to food insecurity. Like other groups, the WFO is now examining a range of future strategies, but some producers have already changed their practices. Jonjon Sarmiento, a Filipino farmer and representative of the Asian Farmers Association, told IPS that the agricultural sector should "work harder" on developing ecological and sustainable methods. "We have two choices: we can continue with unsustainable chemical farming, or go to agro-ecological farming," he said, referring to practices that focus on sustainability, productivity and stability, and may include organic and diversified farming that he and associates have employed. Organisations such as the international NGO ActionAid have highlighted what they say are the benefits of "agroecology", stressing that the various techniques involved can help to build up healthy soils and help crops to cope with unpredictable weather such as too much rainfall. The WFO's Marzano de Marinis says that such techniques must take into account that farming is not just a "humanitarian" activity, but that "food production is a profession like others, it's employment", and has to be recognized as such. "Before agroecology, we still have to recognize a proper position for farmers," he said. "Farmers cannot just be treated as food dispensers to solve problems here and there on the planet. They have to have equitable treatment in international agreements such as COP 21 ." "There has to be a dialogue between farmers, consumers, policy makers and all stakeholders," he said. (End) \</doc>

Dec 14, 2015( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex) The United States lauded Saturday dozens of international negotiators who hammered out a global climate agreement to limit industrial releases of greenhouse gasses contributing to the gradual warming of the atmosphere. COP21 United Nations Climate Change Conference [1] in Le Bourge, France, near Paris, offered "the best chance we have to save the one planet we have." "I believe this moment can be a turning point for the world," Obama said, according to the Associated Press[2]. "We've shown that the world has both the will and the ability to take on this challenge," he said. The agreement mandates pollution cuts aimed at keeping world temperatures from rising more than 2 percent and sets up a panel to review each country's adherence to that goal. The limit is seen as essential to avoiding some of the most dire impacts of rising global temperatures, such as melting polar ice caps, rising seas; inundation of entire islands and extinction of animal species. The COP21 agreement does not take effect until at least 55 countries responsible for at least 55 percent of world pollution agree, the AP said. China is blamed for 24 percent of greenhouse gas releases, the U.S. for 14 percent. "Today, the American people can be proud because this historic agreement is a tribute to American leadership," Obama said. "Over the past seven years, we've transformed the United States into the global leader in fighting climate change," he said. But for all of Obama's optimism, the pact faces a tenuous reception in the United States[3], as the president's Republican Party opposition quickly lined up to oppose the deal. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky accused Obama is "making promises he can't keep, writing checks he can't cash, and stepping over the middle class to take credit for an £greement' that is subject to being shredded in 13 months," when the president leaves office. Republican Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma said Americans can expect the government to cite the agreement as an excuse for placing emission limits on every sector of the U.S. economy. Imhofe also took issue with provisions establishing a global fund to extend help to poor nations severely impacted by rising sea levels.

ADDIS-ABABA, Ethiopia, March 23 -- The United Nations Economic and Social Council's Economic Commission for Africa issued the following news release: The Economic Commission for Africa will hold a high-level dialogue on: "After Paris: Implications for Green Growth in Africa" on 2 April 2016 in Addis-Ababa (Ethiopia), on the margins of the African Development Week 2016. This event aims to evaluate the impact of the Paris agreement ( COP 21 ) on the African development agenda and consider financing options for innovative and green investments. Panel members will discuss opportunities to step up ambitions for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, to preserve Africa from global warming as much as possible. This event is aimed at decision makers, planners, academics as well as civil society and private sector representatives. Organized in late 2015, the Paris Conference was an opportunity for global decision makers to acknowledge the reality of climate change and its impact on developing countries. Following this event, 195 countries had agreed on the need to keep global warming at 2 Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures as well as on the actions and investments needed for a sustainable, low carbon future. Global temperatures have increased by 1Celsius above preindustrial temperatures, with a significant impact on African countries, which are already witnessing an increase in disasters related to climate change. Despite their difficulties, African countries have they have expressed their willingness to aim for greener development model and are currently looking for the means to make this investment a reality.

The United Nations Regional Information Center for Western Europe issued the following information: Janos Pasztor, the UN Assistant-Secretary-General on Climate Change, says that recent positive developments on national contributions and financing give reasons to be optimistic on the conclusion of a climate deal at the upcoming UN Climate Conference in Paris. Assistant Secretary-General Pasztor told a press conference in Brussels that, today, 40 days before the start of the conference, the COP21 , 151 countries, representing approximately 90% of global CO2 emissions, had delivered their national contributions to reducing the emissions. Some countries, mostly in the developing world, are still finalizing their national contributions with the help of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the UN Development Programme (UNDP). However, Mr. Pasztor admits that the total declared cuts in emissions are not enough to keep global warming under the 2 degrees Celsius objective, although a worst case scenario of a predicted and dramatic 4 to 4.5 degrees, if nothing would be done, will be avoided. "The fact that each country has declared its intentions in a national plan of emission cuts, is significant, not least because these obligations can be reinforced after the Paris Conference," he explained. COP 21 is not only about the national contributions, which are not a part of the negotiations. The question of financing the fight against the consequences of climate change, is also crucial. Mr. Pasztor, who recently participated in meetings on this issue, on the margins of the World Bank/IMF annual meeting in Lima, says there have been "interesting developments" in this field. Last year, $62 billion of the $100 billion committed to yearly in financing to adapt to climate change was secured. "These are not only promises, but the concrete mobilization of finance", he said. Multinational development banks have announced that they will double or even triple their contributions. "I am confident that at the end of the year we will have more than $ 62 billion. This is a strong signal for developing countries, and not least, small-island developing states and makes a big difference," he noted. The private sector is also engaged and has contributed one third of the financing. Since the Summit on Business and Climate in Paris last spring, "there has been a real change towards a low carbon economy. Not only have companies that were present at the Summit committed themselves concretely, but since then others are on board, as well." Mr. Pasztor welcomed the success of green bonds, which are a new financing instrument. "There is increasing investment in low carbon, and even disinvestment in the high carbon economy, t he added. He underlines that it is important the COP21 send a "strong signal to the markets." The insurance sector has also worked on new products, which take more notice of the risks of climate change. "Certainly the rhythm of change must be faster, but the private sector is going in the right direction," he says. "The stars are aligned for a good agreement in Paris." A new, more concise, negotiation text has been agreed upon and will be discussed one more time in Bonn, next week. This will be the last round of negotiations. France has, however, called another more informal meeting 8-10 November in Paris, a T Pre-COP t, which will give the negotiators another chance of reaching a consensus in December. Once all the contributions have been announced, it remains to define the rules of the game, not least on evaluation and surveillance of the implementations of national plans, which is important for any up-dating of objectives in the years to come. " COP21 must give a strong signal in the long term and it must be based on solidarity between states," says Pasztor. "Letdz?s not forget that the objective of limiting the rise of temperatures to 2 degrees or less, has not yet been attained."

The following information was released by the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.): Rebecca Barnes Reflection written by Gary Payton What next? Adventa time of reflection and waiting, and a time of anticipation for the Prince of Peace to enter our lives anew. What an Advent Season it has been! On Monday, November 30, the day after the first Sunday in Advent, 150 presidents and prime ministers assembled in Paris to launch the Conference of the Parties, 21st Session ( COP21 ). By December 6, the second Sunday of Advent, negotiators from 190 countries had narrowed the language for a climate change agreement. Then, on the night of December 12, hours before the third Sunday of Advent, the Paris Agreement was gaveled into approval by French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius. Around the world, people of faith knew that we humans had taken a major step in caring for Gods creation. People from disparate nations, with different languages and cultures, shaped an historic agreement intended to slow the onrush of human-caused climate change, assist developing nations in adapting to impacts, and accelerate the transition to low carbon economies. Now, in the final days of Advent, in a time of expectation, it is appropriate to ask what next? How will the spirit of the Paris Agreement find ways of being lived out in the life of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)? Might we as individuals and children of God find new ways to live more lightly on the Earth? Will we examine our patterns of consumption, our frequency and manner of transportation particularly transportation requiring the burning of fossil fuels? - Might the content and the publicity around COP21 create new energy within our Earth Care Congregations? Might the aspirations of the agreement inspire members elsewhere for their own congregation to become an Earth Care congregation? - Will the agreement make us more sensitive to the issues of eco-justice, particularly climate justice of the poor, for women, for indigenous peoples? - Will the powerful presence of youth and young adults in Paris serve as an inspiration for more engagement by Presbyterian youth and young adults in creation care? - As individuals or congregations or the denomination, will we be more bold in engaging elected officials on issues of the environment? Will we tell our members of Congress to support the Green Climate Fund, the mechanism in the Paris Agreement to assist developing countries to adapt to climate change impacts. - Will we find new ways to join hands with other people of faith in protecting Creation? - And, how will the spirit of the Paris Agreement guide the discernment and actions on the environment at the 222nd General Assembly in Portland, Oregon (June 18-25)? The Paris Agreement represents a milestone in decades of work by government officials, scientists, people of faith, and environmental activists. It adds momentum to the collective efforts to address the causes and impacts of climate change. Now, we ask whats next? Together, we will answer in small and in large ways. Me? My next small step is to offset the carbon emissions of my flight to and from France through a contribution to Climate Stewards, and then to keep telling the story. Whats yours?

The European Union's European Parliament issued the following news release: The EU and its member states must call for a 40% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and scale up climate finance commitments at the COP21 UN climate talks in Paris, Parliament said on Wednesday. MEPs also say a share of revenues from the EU's carbon market allowances should be earmarked for climate finance, and the aviation and shipping sectors should initiate measures to curb their emissions by the end of 2016. 'We are facing the fight of the century. If we do not succeed in preventing global warming from exceeding 2 degrees C by the end of the century we will see many more droughts, floods, melting glaciers and the disappearance of more and more farm land. Climate change will also be a factor in increasing the migration problem,' said Gilles Pargneaux (S&D, FR), who drew up the resolution, which was adopted by 434 votes to 96, with 52 abstentions. 'The financial issue is and will be the cornerstone of an agreement in Paris. This is why we are calling for a clear roadmap from the member states so that we know how to finance the green fund from 2020. Fixing a carbon price at global level would also help to ensure that the least-polluting technologies are the most attractive to investors,' added Mr Pargneaux. In the resolution, which constitutes the mandate for Parliament's delegation to COP 21 , the UN climate change conference in Paris in December, MEPs call on the EU to demand: - a reduction of at least 40% of greenhouse-gas emissions compared to 1990 levels, - a 40% energy-efficiency target - a 30% target for renewable energy by 2030 The resolution calls for a general reinvigoration of the EU's climate policy in line with the upper limit of the EU's commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 80-95% below 1990 levels by 2050. MEPs say the 2015 Protocol should: - be legally binding - seek to phase out global carbon emissions by 2050 or shortly thereafter in a bid to keep global warming below 2 degrees C in a cost-effective way - If necessary, work will have to start in 2016 to devise additional reduction measures - include five-year commitment periods in order to avoid locking into low levels of ambition MEPs are concerned that the early analysis of tabled contributions in terms of emission reductions would result in the global average temperature rising by between 2.7degreeC and 3.5degreeC. They call for the Parties to agree in Paris to revise them before 2020 in order to bring them into line with the latest scientific assessments and a safe 2degreeC-compatible global carbon budget. Climate finance Parliament calls on the EU and its member states to agree on a roadmap to scale up finance towards their fair share of the overall target of $100 billion a year by 2020. It proposes earmarking some of the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) allowances as sources of climate finance, as well as revenues from EU and international taxes on aviation and shipping emissions. Transport Parliament points out that transport is the second-largest sector generating greenhouse gas emissions and calls on the parties to COP21 to work through the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on measures to cut emissions before the end of 2016.

After a five year absence, the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition's Treehuggers' Ball is returning to the V-Club Friday for the 19th edition of the benefit concert. "It began in the '80s and the last time we had one was 2010," said Natalie Thompson, OVEC project coordinator. "Our board of directors decided to bring it back as a fundraiser. It's a fun time for people to get together to enjoy music, and to give us an opportunity to discuss our work, and to join together as a community." The concert will feature Of The Dell, Moonshine Crossing, The Shadowshaker Band, Karen Scalf and Big Rock and the Candy Ass Mountain Boys, who have played at every Treehuggers' Ball. "Even though they're fighting for environmental and social justice for all of Appalachia, they are based out of Huntington," said Dave Lavender, BRATCAMP bassist. "It's important to bring it back this year because they are doubling down on Huntington and all of the good energy. They've made a real commitment to stay here and fight for what they believe in. All of that work can be stressful so it's good." The concert coincidentally comes during the week of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP21 , an international summit in Paris, France of world leaders including President Barack Obama. While COP21 focuses on the international level, the Treehuggers' Ball focuses on concerns concerning the Appalachian region. "There's lots of things happening," Thompson said. "We have potential fracking in Wayne and Cabell County on the Rogersville Shale. We also have concerns with our water supply, and the quality of the water in the Ohio River." The concert also comes following the purchase of the New Creek Wind Project in Grant County, West Virginia by Enbridge, for 200 million dollars. "This is a great time to let Marshall students and community members know that while the talks in Paris may seem far away, there is real and current ramifications at home," Lavender said. "We have world renowned people in OVEC fighting for a more progressive, a more diverse and stronger West Virginia." "Throughout history music has helped fuel the revolution," Lavender said. "Whether it be Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and Ritchie Havens in the 1960s, or more recently some of the protests against Wall Street, there's a history of music and fighting for environmental and social justice." The 19th Treehuggers' Ball occurs Friday at the V-Club. Nathan Thomas be contacted at mailto:Thomas521@live.Marshall.edu Thomas521@live.Marshall.edu \</doc>

As I reaffirm this claim though, I cannot help but hear those haunting high school words echoing from my past . Show your work. Very well then. COP 21 was amazing. It served as a turning point in global action, a moment when governments came together promising to do more and emit less. COP 21 amplified our climate change dialogue and acknowledged the urgency of our challenges. Our world will be a better place because of it. But with what exactly did COP 21 leave us? Ultimately, we are left with a document[2]\~and these key words: 'The Conference of the Parties  [emphasizes] with serious concern the urgent need to address the significant gap between the aggregate effect of Parties' mitigation pledges in terms of global annual emissions of greenhouse gases by 2020 and aggregate emission pathways consistent with holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 \'b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 \'b0C above pre-industrial levels.'

That's why, in 2013, we became the internet and technology partner of Solar Impulse, a project aiming at flying around the world on a plane using only solar power, in order to raise awareness for what's possible with clean technology and renewable energy. <nl/>On the first day of their round-the-world journey, we jointly launched the #FutureIsClean initiative[3]: a platform to encourage the world to support the adoption of necessary clean technological solutions ahead of the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 )[4].<nl/> Play Video[5] Since Solar Impulse took off from Abu Dhabi in March 2015, it has completed 8 out of 12 legs, completing nearly half of the journey. The most recent leg took 117 hours and 52 minutes, breaking the world record for the longest solo flight. Despite the achievement, the plane's batteries sustained some damage, postponing the second half of their round-the-world solar flight until April 2016. The plane will remain in Hawaii where it landed last.

The following information was released by the office of the Governor of California: With the clock ticking for national governments to reach a deal to reduce harmful emissions ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. will welcome the United Nations top climate change official, Christiana Figueres, to Los Angeles tomorrow. They will join leading climate scientists to discuss the impacts of a changing climate and the need for swift, decisive action at every level. When: Tomorrow, Monday, June 15, 2015. At the conclusion of the meeting, a news conference will be held at approximately 10:30 a.m. Reporters who have RSVP'd must check in at 10:00 a.m. at the North entrance. NOTE: This event is open to credentialed media only. Reporters interested in attending must RSVP to Andrew Santana at HYPERLINK mailto:andrew.santana@gov.ca.gov andrew.santana@gov.ca.gov Christiana Figueres has been involved in climate change negotiations for two decades and was appointed Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in 2010 and reappointed for a second three-year term in July 2013. The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP21 , will be held from November 30 to December 11, 2015 in Paris, France and is one of the largest climate conferences ever organized. The aim of the conference is to reach, for the first time, a universal, legally binding agreement that will enable the world to combat climate change effectively and boost the transition towards resilient, low-carbon societies and economies. While many national governments have failed to act on climate change, Governor Brown is seeking to further collaboration amongst states and provinces at the subnational level ahead of the conference to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Last month the Governor convened international leaders from 11 other states and provinces, collectively representing more than $4.5 trillion in GDP and 100 million people, to sign a first-of-its-kind agreement to limit the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius the warming threshold at which scientists say there will likely be catastrophic climate disruptions. This builds on other international climate change pacts between California and leaders from Mexico,China, North America, Japan, Israel and Peru and the Governors efforts to help forge and highlight scientific consensus around climate change. Earlier this year, Governor Brown issued an executive order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in California 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 the most ambitious target in North America and announced in his inaugural address new 15 year targets to: increase from one-third to 50 percent our electricity derived from renewable sources; reduce petroleum use in cars and trucks by up to 50 percent; and double the efficiency savings from existing buildings. Next month, Governor Brown will join other international leaders, including former U.S. Vice President and Nobel laureate Al Gore and former president of Mexico Felipe Caldern, to deliver keynote remarks at the Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto, Canada. ### \</doc>

Washington: American Association for the Advancement of Science has issued the following news release: Conference of Parties ( COP ) 21 COP21 will be held at Le Bourget from 30th November to 11th December 2015. At the time of the conference, Le Bourget shall be known as the blue-zone area in Paris for UN delegates and public bodies' attendees. The Sustainable Innovation Forum 2015 in partnership with UNEP, will convene more than 500 attendees at an expanded two day session (7th to 8th of December), to further increase the facilitation of partnerships and to bring greater scale to business innovation on climate change. Pre-Paris meet During the Responsible Business Forum in Singapore (RBF Singapore; Marina Bay Sands & Gardens by the Bay) earlier this month from the 3rd to 4th Nov. 2015, international delegates of which 80% of the companies were global corporations attended the event. Mr Tony Boatman, Director of Innovation at Global Initiatives, mentioned a few take home-messages at RBF Singapore, 'The biggest emitters have signed up to cut down their emissions by 2030. We recognize the complexity, and we are not comparing apples to apples. Countries that are responsible for two-thirds of carbon emission have signed up for COP21 , with the aim of 40-percent reduction to 1999 emissions-level.' 'What we do know that the commitments will be made in Paris will not be enough, it will not be enough to cap the emissions at 2 degrees,' said Boatman. COP21 will not be enough and there are a lot more to be done. Outside governmental corporations should be taken into consideration in the protocol for the reduction in emissions. To save Planet Earth before it is too late The COP21 universal agreement will include actions for sustainability in businesses, supply chains, logistics, agricultures and global consumer networks. The opportunities for sustainable and responsible finance to be shared for business behaviors to go beyond short-term financial gain in ventures and investments framework. Most importantly, for public and private companies to recognize business opportunities to go green and sustainable. There shall be an increase use of biofuels in commercial and private transports, e.g. aircrafts, road vehicles, etc. This further illustrates the need for further advancement in biofuels research development. At RBF Singapore opening plenary address, Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan, Singapore's Ministry for Foreign Affairs said, 'This is not a natural disaster it is a deliberate man-made disaster, it is vandalism on nature.' And an encouraging news at RBF Singapore is that the blueprint for Singapore to be sustainable is already available. 'If you truly believe in democracy that we breathe the same air, drink the same water, eat the same food, then you need to believe in sustainability in the long-term.' Dr. Balakrishnan will be attending COP21 in December 2015. Products have to be made from sustainable materials in order to be placed on the shelves for purchase, and transparency must be valid in the supply chain and product distributions. These are some of the practical considerations for long-term survival. Dr. Balakrishnan emphasized that one of the duties for Singaporeans is to prepare and build up resilience against the deleterious consequences of climate change. Public awareness on climate change and sustainability can be raised by giving incentives to individuals who makes an effort to transform the country to a better place and a green-er nation. 'Sustainability efforts cannot be unilateral,' as mentioned by Dr. Balakrishnan at RBF Singapore 2015. Who should cut the 'Cake'? Brought forward by industrial revolution, developed nations enjoy access to advanced technology, better accessibilities to remote regions in their respective cities and towns, better food packages that are bound to the regulations of Good Manufacturing Practices, etc. However, it is not practical and maybe ridiculous, to ask big emitters to slash carbon emissions and greenhouse gases to absolute zero while developing countries are still removing trees in the forest. In June 2015 at The Hertie School of Governance in Berlin Germany, Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC secretariat shared her perspectives on the upcoming COP21 and the World's response to climate change. 'Developing countries that were left behind during the industrial revolution, and now to be left behind the energy revolution? That would be unfair.' Figueres recognizes the challenges in developing countries, and it is a huge challenge for developing countries to continue their economic growth without greenhouse emissions. 'No country has done it before, and we are asking developing countries to do the same when they have other development urgencies on their agenda.' Rather than to place an expectation on the pace for developing countries to lower carbon emissions and greenhouse gases, and to balance the ecosystem, countries can choose which pace may suit them better in conjunction to their economic growth; GDP. 'Every country is going to contribute, different ways and paces but every country has to contribute.' Figueres placed a metaphoric illustration on climate change and sustainability policies; countries are as of similar to cars driving along the motorway and in accordance to their preferred paces they shall take the respective lanes. The pace may differ, but ultimately they are heading towards the same direction and to the same destination; to make the world a better place to live in where clean drinking water is available and the ecosystem is balanced. What's the difference between COP21 and other COPs or other Climate Change protocols; e.g. Kyoto protocol? COP21 is a legally binding agreement for all countries. 'It is not for self-interest, rather it is for climate change, for a positive agenda,' said Figueres. And it is time for policy to be guided by science. 'At COP21 , there will be a gap between what we are doing and what we should be doing.' Figueres then further emphasized that the gap between doing and should be doing will be drawn closer in progression of time. COP21 is a facilitated system and, to encourage countries and people to do more to save the environment before it is way too late. The agreement will include the evaluation of the engagement on climate change and sustainability issues for each country. There shall be no backsliding with each step has to be more ambitious, and ultimately to reach the common goal; to lower carbon emissions and to reduce global warming. It is to prevent the repeat of history, e.g. COP15 and Kyoto Protocol. But not all provisions are equally binding in the same ways. Some provisions are international, for instance, obligations for carbon planning. Carbon managements shall be under domestic legislations because trajectories of carbon are likely to differ from country to country, and may be estimated using different methodology and recorded using different documentations. 'We are able to do more together than by an individual alone,' said Figueres. Moving towards zero emissions in transport and logistics There were mixed reviews on the possibilities to achieve zero emissions in transport and logistics. At the panel session RBF Singapore 2015, most delegates agreed there is a possibility to achieve zero emissions. Delegates include: Stephan Schablinski (Director for Sustainable Supply Chain Solutions, DHL); moderator of the panel session, Sophie Punte (Executive Director, Smart Freight Centre), Rachid Yazami (Professor for School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technology University), Justin Gadbois (Head of Sustainability, Maersk), Mark Cameron (Regional Director, South Malaysia & Singapore, Scania), and Oliver Risse (Managing Partner, OneNorth Ventures, Floatility) Most of the panelists agreed it is possible to reduce emissions to zero, and if not, perhaps 90% reduction in emissions. Sophie Punte thinks that though there may be many good inventions such as 3-D printing to solve some existing problems, there is still a lack of efficiency to transport one product from a place of origin to another. For instance, the transport of freshly pressed orange juice from Florida to the Philippines. 'We need to take steps to move towards zero emissions,' said Mark Cameron. 'What we are seeing today is the exciting steps being taken, continued in the field of biofuels, battery technology, the heart of organization of vehicles, and all of these are taking one step towards zero emissions in Europe.' 'It is possible to achieve zero emissions because we have no choice,' said Prof. Rachid Yazami the inventor of lithium battery and who is currently a professor at NTU in Singapore. However, Yazami highlighted that there are some hurdles to achieve the goal, and he gave the use of electric cars in mega cities as an example. The challenges according to Prof. Yazami: the costings of electric cars in comparison to regular-diesel or petrol cars; on whether it is convenient and practical to drive an electric car in mega cities; the mileage that an electric car can cover with the batteries installed; fire hazard safety; materials have to be recycled and environmental friendly; Oliver Risse is totally convinced that zero emission is possible, 'It is just the matter of time.' Risse also suggests that solutions are all in the mind, and it is not just about having new devices or technology. The solutions are within or should start from consumers' purchasing behaviours, e.g. in Europe, there are strong connections from the residents to buy daily products from their local or regional markets. When there is no plan B Is COP21 going to stunt developing countries' growth? Who is going to have the hardest time? 'It will be the developing countries that will have the hardest time. We are asking developing countries to continue their growth without greenhouse emissions. A huge challenge for developing countries, as no country has set an example before.' A quote by Figueres which is stated in the earlier text of this article. Developed countries will have to provide the necessary aids to developing countries to prevent further disruptions on biodiversity, ecosystem and on climate. COP21 universal agreement may be a demanding request on developing countries. However, Figueres addressed the concern that the purpose of the agreement for developing countries is to protect the growth that the countries have had, and to spur further growth. 'By allowing these countries to grow with technology, finance, and to enable them to jump over or leap-frog the kind of development we have over last decades, and without greenhouse emission.' 'There's no plan B, because we have no plan B. It is difficult, but there's no other option,' said Figueres. 'Devil is in the detail, but there's a lot work to be done. As the agreement is good for the national and global economy.' Figueres remains optimistic about COP21 agreement and she reckons policy-makers are on the right track towards a universal agreement. The COP21 conference is expected to attract close to 50,000 participants including 25,000 official delegates from government, intergovernmental organisations, UN agencies, NGOs and civil society. The first COP took place in Berlin in 1995 and significant meetings since then have included COP3 where the Kyoto Protocol was adopted, COP11 where the Montreal Action Plan was produced, COP15 in Copenhagen where an agreement to success Kyoto Protocol was unfortunately not realised and COP17 in Durban where the Green Climate Fund was created. Immediate action, and already taking place, for an agreement to lower CO2 emissions, better carbon management plans and coalition China's air pollution costs around 5 to 10% of their GDP. According to some estimates, the removal of air pollution in China adds on 5% GDP COP21 agreement has to look into long-term plans: GDP and CO2 emissions CO2 emission has increased and ecology balance was lost during the industrial revolution, and it has to be restored, COP21 meet will not be enough for the reduction in global warming by 2&deg;C and 5% reduction in greenhouse gases In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: HYPERLINK editorial@plusmediasolutions.com \</doc>

On the margins of the United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ) today, UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon paid tribute to the one hundred and thirty victims of the attacks which shook Paris almost one month ago. Alongside the mayor of the city, Anne Hidalgo, Mr. Ban placed a bouquet of flowers in front of the Bataclan concert hall, and bowed his head. Tens of bystanders applauded the gesture, chanting "merci merci, Monsieur Ban Ki-moon." Next, the UN chief visited the "La Bonne Bi\'e8re" restaurant, the first to be hit on 13 November and where five people lost their lives. "Today, I too am Parisian," said the Secretary-General sitting inside the caf\'e9, with Mayor Hidalgo and other top UN officials. "I am very moved. To the families and loved ones of the five people who were killed here, and to all the victims of the barbaric attacks on 13 November, I present my sincere condolences." Drinking a coffee, he said Paris is a symbol of culture and of the "art of living," and noted that the reopening of the caf\'e9 ten days ago is also symbol of resistance to terror. "In this regard, the Government of France's decision to maintain the UN climate change conference shows its determination to uphold the values of the United Nations: liberty, peace, equality and justice," he said. Earlier today Mr. Ban continued his work related to the UN climate change conference ( COP21 ), meeting with African environmental ministers. He reiterated his belief that "Africa has an enormous stake in the conference's success." "Your personal engagement and ownership are essential to securing the ambitious agreement that Africa's people and the entire world need," he told them. "Already, your leadership has helped make 2015 a year of opportunity." Meanwhile, this morning on the banks of the Seine, Mr. Ban visited the Tara, a scientific exploration research vessel which travels the world sampling water and collecting plankton, one of the planet's major oxygen producers. "For 10 years, Tara has sailed the oceans, monitoring the marine the changes in the ocean, particularly degradation of marine environment. They have been measuring and providing data to our scientific community to that we can better address climate change," Mr. Ban told reporters. On the Tara, the UN chief also spoke with a dozen children, who have family members working on the vessel. "It is important that we must preserve our oceans healthy so that we can have a healthy and prosperous planet. Our planet is 70 per cent oceans. It is the basis of our life," Mr. Ban stressed. The Tara has been in Paris since November at the invitation of Mayor Hidalgo to raise awareness about COP21 , and will remain on the Parisian banks through 18 December. As the second and last week of the United Nations conference begins tomorrow, the UN chief also highlighted today that he is "optimistic and confident" that the world will have a universal and ambitious agreement, while urging Member States to look beyond their national boundaries. \</doc>

The following information was released by the European Parliament: The environment committee said on Wednesday that Parliament's delegation to the COP 21 climate talks in Paris must call for a 40% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, a 40% energy-efficiency target and a binding 30% target for renewable energy. In a resolution adopted by 55 votes to 5, with 8 abstentions, the committee also says a share of the EU's carbon market allowances should be earmarked for climate finance and the aviation and shipping sectors should initiate measures to curb their emissions by the end of 2016. "The stakes are huge. We must limit the global rise in temperature to 2 degrees C if we are to curb climate change and the resulting catastrophic droughts, floods and food crises. These natural disasters are behind an exponential growth of climate refugees who could number as many as 200 million in the coming years even more than the number of war refugees," said Gilles Pargneaux (SandD, FR), who drew up the resolution, after the vote. In its resolution, which constitutes the mandate for the EP delegation to the COP 21 meeting in December, the committee proposes a reduction of at least 40% of greenhouse-gas emissions in the EU by 2030, and a phasing-out of global carbon emissions by 2050 or shortly thereafter. "In this fight Europe must be the engine and the model. This is why we support a binding target of 40% energy efficiency and a binding renewable energy target of 30% of total energy consumption by 2030," said Mr Pargneaux. The resolution calls for "a general reinvigoration of the EU's climate policy" in line with the upper limit of the EU's commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 80-95% below 1990 levels by 2050. MEPs also want EU member states to consider further commitments, over and above the agreed 2030 target. The committee says the 2015 Protocol must be legally binding and seek to phase out global carbon emissions by 2050 or shortly thereafter in a bid to keep global warming below 2 degrees C in a cost-effective way. If this looks too ambitious, work will have to start in 2016 to devise additional reduction measures, it says. It recommends that the parties to the COP 21 conference back five-year commitment periods in order to "avoid locking into low levels of ambition". Climate finance The committee wants climate finance to be included in any agreement reached in Paris in a way that reflects changing environmental and economic realities. It calls on the EU and its member states to agree on a roadmap to scale up finance towards their fair share of the overall target of $100 billion a year by 2020. It proposes earmarking some of the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) allowances as sources of climate finance, as well as revenues from EU and international taxes on aviation and shipping emissions. MEPs also ask the Commission to promote links between the EU's ETS and other emission trading systems with the aim of creating international carbon market mechanisms. Transport The committee points out that transport is the second-largest sector generating greenhouse gas emissions and calls on the parties to COP21 to work through the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on measures to cut emissions before the end of 2016. Second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol Next steps The full House will vote on the resolution on 14 October. \</doc>

Global Environment Facility has issued the following news release: The Vienna Energy Forum 2015 brought leaders together this week for a timely debate on the topic of sustainable energy for inclusive development. The critical importance of adopting a new set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and of reaching a successful climate agreement at COP 21 , both taking place later this year, was strongly emphasized. In her keynote address, GEF CEO Naoko Ishii highlighted that both processes seek to answer the same question: how we can achieve prosperity today without undermining our future opportunities?  The planetary boundary framework led by Johan Rockstrom tells us that to avoid abrupt changes on a planetary scale that will undermine our ambitions for sustainable development in the future, we must stay within safe planetary boundaries, be it a stable climate system, safeguarding the integrity of biodiversity, the global water cycle, or the health of soils, she said. She also highlighted the New Climate Economy Report led by former Mexican President, Felipe Calderon that came out last year, and noted its emphasis on the importance of having credible policies, financing, and leadership.

Washington: mrookings Institution has issued the following news release: Expectations are exceedingly high for the upcoming Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) climate conference as major world leaders (unlike at past COPs) have signaled strong support to finalize a legally binding international climate agreement limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Another major difference this year: Africa will likely be a key player. The challenges and priorities for the continent at COP21 will go beyond strategies to limit greenhouse gas emissions, like adaptation mechanisms to reduce vulnerabilities and financing measures to ensure sustainable growth. At the conference, Africa will have a united stand on the best course of action to address climate change in Africa. Amadou Sy discusses the continent\' s position and expectations in his policy brief  Financing Adaptation and Mitigation in the World\' s Most Vulnerable Region, part of the recent Brookings publication,  COP21 at Paris: What to Expect. Some key observations from the report are: - Africa is on the frontlines of the repercussions from changing climate. Increased threat of droughts and floods hamper the agricultural sector. With about 30-40 percent of Africa\' s GDP and about three quarters of Africans relying on agriculture, shocks to agricultural production can have severe impediment on human development. As elaborated by John McArthur in his brief on the relationship between agriculture and climate change, agriculture is the sector that contributes to and is most susceptible to changes in climate patterns. Estimates indeed suggest that global warming, even if limited to below 2 C will reduce total crop production by as much as 10 percent. - Africa currently accounts for the smallest share of global greenhouse gas emissions, but mitigation steps are necessary to avoid a high carbon lock-in. Africa contributes only 3.8 percent to the global greenhouse emissions, compared to the largest emitters like China, United States, European Union, which ac&shy;count for 23, 19, and 13 percent of global emissions respectively. However, Sy argues that this trend might change as Africa seeks to move to a stronger growth trajectory with rapid urbanization, which will increase Africa\' s emission of greenhouse gases unless adequate investment in renewable technologies is undertaken at an early stage. For instance, under the International Energy Agency baseline scenario for 2040, power generation in sub-Saharan Africa would quadruple, and the region\' s share of global carbon dioxide emissions would increase a whole percentage point if the energy mix is not altered. - Though Africa will bear the grunt of global warming, it often has limited bargaining power in international negotiations. In Paris, African leaders and negotiators seek to achieve an inclusive, ambitious, and equitable COP21 agreement that would lead to lower carbon emissions. Sy maintains that the unified Common African Position (CAP) developed by the Af&shy;rican Group of Negotiators and endorsed by the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment strengthens their bargaining power, much like it did for the Sustainable Development Goals. The CAP seeks firm commitments from devel&shy;oped economies of the magnitude $100 billion by 2020 to support mechanisms that will adequately finance climate adaptation, and not just climate mitigation. - Among the issues to be agreed upon in Paris, the need for financing both climate adaptation and mitigation will probably be the most important concern for African negotia&shy;tors, says Sy. The COP21 seeks to agree on a new multilateral instrument that will apply to all countries, set out a transparent and verifiable monitoring mechanism, and provide ad&shy;equate means of implementation in terms of finance, technology, and capacity building. In Africa, many national governments are initiating governance systems for climate change adaptation such as di&shy;saster risk management, public health initiatives, adjustments in technologies, and infrastructure and ecosystem-based ap&shy;proaches. However, according to estimates by a 2013 United Nations Environment Program study (assuming the targeted 2 C temperature increase scenario), meeting adaptation costs in Africa by the 2020s will require a steep increase in annual funding for adaptation in Africa by about 10-20 percent annually. Even if domestic resources are mobilized, the international cooperation would be required to help meet Africa\' s climate funding gap. To solve this problem, Sy says, would require that the current governance of the  global commons be addressed. - The contentious issue of loss and damage (L&D) could likely be a stumbling block next week. According to Sy, Africa, together with other developing countries, is at high risk of L&D associated with climate change impacts, including extreme weather shocks and slow onset events (sea level rises, desertification). World Bank estimates suggest that losses to insurers due to weather shocks have quadrupled to $200 billion a year since the 1980s. Developed economies have expressed concerns about an  unending string of liability and thus negotiations on the issue are likely to be tricky at best. In the end, Sy argues that the Paris summit is a chance to build an understanding of the threats and risks from unmanaged climate change and also the opportunities that lay in the low-carbon transition including the path it paves to fight global poverty. In short, the negotiations next week can be an important turning point to strengthen global action, but the task for Africa is clear admittedly less than straightforward to lead in implementing sustainable climate-resilient and low carbon development. International cooperation and financial support for innovative financial solutions like carbon finance would be crucial in achieving this ambitious endeavor.

The European Commission issued the following news release: The European Commission today presented its position and objectives ahead of the United Nations climate change conference in Paris on 30 November - 11 December. Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Climate Action and Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete will participate in the conference, along with other world leaders. The European Commission today underlined the crucial importance of reaching a fair, ambitious and legally binding global climate deal at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris from 30 November-11 December. The European Union will be working to achieve a comprehensive, durable and dynamic agreement that will accelerate the global shift to low-carbon, climate-resilient economies. This will not only help curb climate change and increase societies' efforts to adapt to its impacts, but also underpin long-term economic growth and sustainable development in the EU and globally. Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Climate Action and Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete will both participate in the conference, along with other world leaders. President Juncker said: "The EU wants an ambitious and binding global deal in Paris. We were the first to table our climate pledge in March and it is still the most ambitious contribution. Our goal of holding global temperature rise below 2degreeC by the end of the century is still within reach. We are witnessing a global movement like never before. I hope this will translate into action during the negotiations next week. If the world delivers in Paris, the humanity will have an international regime to efficiently combat climate change." Commissioner Arias Canete said: "This is it. Paris is a historic opportunity that we cannot miss. Now we must translate the momentum we have seen on the road to Paris into an ambitious, operational, legally binding agreement. More than 170 countries, covering over 95% of global emissions, have already unveiled their climate pledges ahead of the conference. This is a real game changer. It is also a clear evidence of governments' shared sense of urgency and political determination to make Paris the beginning of a new chapter in climate action. But there is no room for complacency - the credibility of the deal will depend on these key elements: a long-term goal, regular reviews to increase ambition over time and strong transparency and accountability rules." EU position The increase in the global average temperature needs to be held below 2degreeC above the pre-industrial levels in order to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. For the EU, the new agreement must send a clear signal of governments' resolve to reduce emissions sufficiently to keep temperature increase below the agreed limit by the end of the century. The EU's vision of a credible agreement includes: 1. A global vision for a long term goal as a signal for stakeholders, including businesses, investors and the public, of the resolve to shift to low-carbon economies; 2. A mechanism to regularly review and raise the collective ambition; 3. A robust transparency and accountability system to ensure that Parties and stakeholders can trust that what is promised will be delivered. Climate finance The EU remains committed to delivering its share towards achieving the developed countries' joint goal of mobilising USD 100 billion per year by 2020 for climate action in developing countries. A recent report by the OECD and Climate Policy Initiative showed that USD 62 billion was mobilised in 2014, putting developed countries well on track to the USD 100 billion goal. The EU has been the major contributor to this funding. On 10 November, EU finance ministers confirmed (IP/15/6045) that the EU and its Member States provided EUR 14.5 billion in public climate finance (grants and loans) in 2014. This figure constitutes a significant increase compared to previous years. At least EUR 14 billion, an average of EUR 2 billion per year of public grants from the EU budget, will support activities in developing countries between 2014 and 2020. Adaptation The EU regards ambitious action to prepare for and respond to the effects of climate change to be a central part of a balanced agreement. Both emissions reductions and adaptation will be essential to manage and reduce the risk of adverse impacts of climate change, including addressing the risk of loss and damageassociated with the impacts of climate change. Events during COP21 The EU strongly supports the Lima Paris Action Agenda - an initiative of the Peruvian and French COP Presidencies aimed at catalysing multi-stakeholder action. A programme of events has been organised around the themes of the Action Agenda that offer non-state actors such as businesses, cities and organisations, the possibility to make announcements or highlight inspiring examples on topics. The themes include, for example, the role of forests, transport, buildings and renewable energy in the fight against climate change. More than 100 side events will be held at the EU Pavilion at COP21 , mirroring these daily themes. EU representation The Luxembourg Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the European Commission will be jointly responsible for negotiating on behalf of the EU in Paris.

The ENRLC is curating the event with the Vermont Chapter of the Sierra Club. Among the leaders and environmental advocates slated to attend Climate Talk VT are national Sierra Club President Aaron Mair and Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin. Many participants, including a VLS student delegation, also attended the UN climate change talks Conference of the Parties ( COP ) 21  in Paris last December. 'VLS's engagement at COP21 embodies our motto, law for the community and the world,' said Professor Tracy Bach, who heads the VLS delegation. 'The students on our delegation learned by doing: They reported about the Paris Agreement negotiations via our blog, supported a least developed country delegation via our service learning partnership, and now bring back their international experiences to share with the Vermont community.' 'I was so proud to represent Vermont at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris where an unprecedented 196 nations came to an agreement to limit global carbon emissions,' Shumlin said. 'States and regions are the first defense against climate change, and Vermont is implementing the policies that will make a difference in this fight.' By design, Climate Talk VT will be an informal conversation about the Paris Agreement among notable climate champions, focusing on the steps we can take to turn these global ambitions into action here in Vermont. The public will have the opportunity to submit questions to guide this important discussion. 'The Vermont Chapter of the Sierra Club is pleased to sponsor this important Earth Day event with Vermont Law School,' said Mark Nelson, chair of the Vermont Chapter of the Sierra Club. 'This is an opportunity for Vermonters to learn more about the UN climate talks and hear discussions about what actions can be taken in Vermont to help the U.S. meet its ambitious pledges.' Climate Talk VT coincides with an Earth Day Paris Agreement signing ceremony with world leaders at the UN headquarters in New York City.

Jan 08, 2016( Rep. Albio Sires: http://sires.house.gov http://sires.house.gov / Delivered by Newstex) This week marked the beginning of the New Year. While in Washington, I attended a Foreign Affairs Committee markup, met with the Costa Rican Ambassador to the United States, and sent a letter to President Obama regarding Iran's recent missile tests. Foreign Affairs[1] Gun Violence[2] Climate Change[3] Foreign Affairs This week, the House Foreign Affairs Committee began its work for the second session of the 114th Congress. I attended a markup of three bills and look forward to working with my colleagues to craft meaningful legislation. Costa Rican Ambassador, Roman Macaya, visited my office to continue discussing relationships in the Western Hemisphere. He provided me with information on recent developments in the ongoing efforts to help Cuban migrants stranded in Central America. I joined with various colleagues and sent a letter to President Barack Obama urging him to sanction Iran for recent violations of international law. In October and November 2015, Iran test fired medium-range ballistic missiles, destabilizing the already delicate relationships in the region. Furthermore, during military exercises, a rocket fired by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a branch of Iran's Armed Forces, came within 1,500 feet of the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman. These actions, preceding the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), pose a threat to our national security and demand a U.S. response. Gun Violence In the last decade, over 100,000 people have been killed in the United States as a result of gun violence. This week, President Obama introduced executive actions to combat this continued gun violence in our nation. These actions will facilitate the reporting of mental illnesses into the background check system and expand the use of background checks by those who sell guns in stores, on the Internet, or at gun shows. They will also make the background check system more effective, increase mental health treatment across the nation, and will support new research into gun safety measures. While I support the Second Amendment, I am frustrated that both the House and the Senate failed to consider gun safety measures thus far this Congress. It is our responsibility to pass long-term reforms that are aimed at reducing gun violence, which is why I have cosponsored key measures that will help to accomplish this goal and keep Americans safe. To read more about my stance on gun violence, visit my Gun Violence Prevention Page[4]. Climate Change On December 12th, the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) came to a close in Paris, France with an agreement among the 195 nations that participated. The Paris Agreement is a pact to reduce global carbon emissions, with a goal of zero net emissions, by the second half of the century. Participants also agreed to work to keep global warming to under 2 degrees Celsius. The COP21 also resulted in the private sector joining with the public sector to capitalize on newly funded research into clean energy and improve reliable, affordable, non-carbon producing energy through technological innovations. This marks a global readiness to invest in climate change research and the development of alternative energy sources that will help combat climate change. I am encouraged by the results of COP21 and look forward to working with my colleagues to facilitate the implementation of the Paris Agreement.

Oxford: The Department of Oxfam International has issued the following news release: Oxfam will support the Voice2Paris global storytelling contest launched in August by the United National Development Programme (UNDP) by providing three additional fellowships for participating journalists to cover the UN Conference on Climate Change , COP21 , in Paris in December. Oxfam\' s contribution to the contest aims at encouraging journalists\' participation in climate change reporting and raising public awareness of climate actions.  The contest is a fantastic opportunity to create awareness of the harmful impacts of climate change on communities, and of potential opportunities in climate-vulnerable developing countries. This is also a great opportunity for young journalists to strengthen their perception of climate change and to frame it not merely as an environmental issue but also as an issue of social justice and poverty alleviation said Wang Binbin, Manager of the Climate Change and Poverty Team, Oxfam Hong Kong. The storytelling contest targets writers 35 years and under from developing countries who want to contribute - locally and internationally - towards greater public awareness of climate change. The authors of the top five prize-winning stories will be invited to attend and cover the COP21 UN climate summit in Paris. UNDP will support the top two winners and Oxfam, as a special partner in the contest, will cover travel costs and per diem for writers of the next three best stories worldwide.  We welcome the partnership with Oxfam, as it gives UNDP concrete support to expand the voices of vulnerable countries, helps depict the reality of climate change globally, and gives a new generation of journalists a chance to get heard during COP21  said Jo Scheuer, Director, Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction at UNDP\' s Bureau for Policy and Programme Support.

Paul Tonko - Video: HYPERLINK http://www.youtube.com/reppaultonko I rise today to express my support and optimism for the U.N. Climate Change Conference, or COP 21 , which will be held in Paris next month. In advance of the negotiations, 146 parties submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, laying out the actions they intend to take to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These pledges cover 86% of global emissions. We have seen major commitments from the U.S., the E.U., China, and other major developing nations. We have also seen incredible support from the private sector. Many companies, including dozens of Fortune 500 companies, have made commitments through the American Business Act on Climate Pledge. Many businesses recognize that acting on climate change is not only the morally right thing to do, but the economically right thing, too. An agreement in Paris would be an incredible first step that could be built upon with even more ambitious goals in the coming years. Because the bottom line is climate change is too big to tackle alone. We need global cooperation from governments and businesses. And the U.S. must be a leader, demanding bold action to take on the very real threats we face. An agreement in Paris is good for our national security, our economy, and our environment. I wish good luck to our negotiating team, and I yield back the balance of my time. \</doc>

Dec 23, 2015( Dissident Voice: HYPERLINK http://www.dissidentvoice.org http://www.dissidentvoice.org COP21 captured the attention of the world for two weeks as over 190 countries agreed to agree for the first time since Dr. James Hansen testified before a Senate committee in 1988, introducing the world to the dangers of greenhouse gases. COP21 , with its profuse sweat under bright lights and sleepless nights, resulted in an agreement praised by mainstream media all across the world but universally panned by climate change advocacy groups. Still, at the end of the day COP21 may not make much difference. After all, renewable energy is not waiting for COP21 to nudge people to go green. Renewables have already, for some time now, been on a tear, bustling ahead as if COP21 never counts. Some of the world's foremost climate scientists and climate change experts such as Dr. James Hansen labeled COP21 £ fraud' with 'no action, just promises.' Others with similar credentials claim 'the deal is certain to result in 3\\x8CC by 2050, or sooner.' Thereby, missing, by a wide margin, the COP21 goal of keeping temperatures under 2\\x8CC. Meanwhile, silently but assuredly, renewable energy is literally on fire all across the planet, sans COP21 . The year 2013 is more likely the 'watershed year for tackling climate change' because of renewables rather than because of COP21 in 2015. Renewable installations crossed over those of fossil fuels for the first time ever in 2013, as the world added 143 gigawatts of renewable electricity capacity versus 141 gigawatts of fossil fuel electricity generation. Renewables have never looked back. In the United States, for example, approximately 22,700 megawatts of solar powers 4.6 million homes and 66,000 megawatts of wind energy 18 million homes. When blended, U.S. renewables provide 90,000 megawatts for nearly 23 million households. Therefore, if solar and wind renewables continue to grow at the 2013 rate, renewables alone will cover the planet's roughly 1.5 billion households within roughly 40 years, meeting the criteria set at COP21 of greenhouse emissions neutrality in the second half of the century with or without COP21 . But, with COP21 psychologically pushing ahead renewable growth, accelerating the build-out, it is probable that renewables will vastly exceed any goals of COP21 well before 2050. Thus, in the real world, renewables offset COP21 's toothless agreement. As, for example, language dealing with mitigation or cutting greenhouse gases is extremely vague in the agreement with phrases like 'efforts to be made to hold temperatures to 1.5 C.' What does that mean in the real world? And, what efforts? Or, as for another example, Article 4 of the COP21 agreement addresses timelines, 'global peaking of greenhouse emissions, as soon as possible.' What does that mean? 'As soon as possible' could be 2100 or 2125 or 2300. There is no mention of enforcement. And, of course, there's the infamous COP21 'shall or should standoff' just prior to the closing ceremony when Secretary of State Kerry threatened 'to walk' unless Article 4.4 dealing with developed countries obligations to reduce emissions changed the wording from 'shall' to 'should.' Thus, unbeknownst to many in the public arena, Secretary Kerry avoided a showdown with the U.S. Senate over ratification since one word 'shall' created a legal obligation, maybe a treaty, whereas 'should' does not. As events were likely mapped out beforehand, there would be no COP21 agreement unless it was purposely loose, and that's how it ended, thumbing their collective noses at the U.S. Senate. Meanwhile, the world marketplace is already gaga over solar. For example, even though Dubai's electricity is currently powered by burning natural gas, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, the Emir of Dubai has stated that all rooftops in Dubai will have solar panels by 2030; fascinatingly, the UAE has one-tenth of the world's oil reserves. Saudi Arabia is preparing to build a commercial-scale solar-panel factory near Riyadh. Not only that but next year Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil company, and Saudi Electricity Company plan to jointly break ground on 10 solar projects throughout Saudi Arabia. The Saudis intend to build 41 gigawatts of solar capacity by 2032, thereby slightly edging out Germany, Europe's renewable energy heavyweight. Thereby, leaders from the Middle East make America's Republican anti-anthropogenic global warming crowd in Congress, as well as almost all the Republican presidential candidates, look like babbling idiots with feet stuck in 20th century concrete drill pads. Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai gets it. The Saudi royal family gets it. America's top Republican presidential candidates don't! What's wrong with this picture? America's Republican anti-anthropogenic crowd, like Ted Cruz and most of the candidates for the presidency, bring to the table a denseness, a thickness that subtly exposes a guttural imprint reminiscent of America's frontier movement of the 19th century, the great westward trek across the continent which established a culture of rugged individualism and self-reliance whilst politically ignorant of the larger outside world, in other words 'Cowboy Politics.' Today, the Republican anti-anthropogenic global warming crowd embody that legacy of America's drive westward, as it brutally slayed indigenous people and slaughtered massive herds of buffalo to cleanse the frontier, making it as white and clean as possible. Well, today there's a new opportunity for these frontier-oriented mental cases to cleanse America by shedding fossil fuel subsidies. Even though G20 countries, since 2009, promised to cut fossil fuel subsidies each year, 'in most cases there has been little progress, with some countries actually increasing their fossil fuel subsidies over the past six years. The United States, for instance, has increased its fossil fuel subsidies 35% since 2009.'1[1] Fortunately for the world at large, renewables are not waiting for COP21 to figure out how to proceed with authority, with legal credibility, and with teeth that bite. After all, as it stands, COP21 is like the volunteer Army. Also, fortunately for the health of the planet, renewables could care less about Cowboy politicians that suck up to special interests. Renewables have an unbelievably powerful momentum that will whiten the world, turning it as clean as a whistle no matter Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's irresponsible statement that climate initiatives are 'subject to being shredded in 13 months,' if the GOP wins the White House. Sorrowfully, on the heels of COP21 , the world is introduced to America's, um-m, where do these people come from? The good news: Renewables could care less.'Here's How Much the World's Biggest Economies Spend on Fossil Fuel Subsidies', Climate Progress, November 12, 2015.

The following information was released by the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM): On 8 December, the UNFCCC-designated Gender Day at COP 21 , in coordination with the Government of Morocco and in the presence of Sgolne Royal, Minister for Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy of France, UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka participated at the opening session of Gender Day at the Morocco Pavilion, entitled Women: Active and Engaged in the Fight against Climate Change. One of the missing links in a robust energy agenda today is the role of women, said Ms. Mlambo-Ngcuka during the event. That is why the UN WomenUNEP joint programme on Womens Sustainable Energy, Entrepreneurship and Access, officially launched at the event, will ensure that we empower and strengthen women so they can play a role at the policy level, the delivery level but also in managing the efficient use of energy at the household level. UN Womens newly launched flagship Programme on Sustainable Energy, Entrepreneurship and Access will begin in Morocco, Indonesia, India, Myanmar, Senegal and Bolivia. The emphasis of the Programme is to remove the barriers that women entrepreneurs face in different countries. UN Women and UNEP will work with Governments of these six countries to systematically and sustainably remove them. We hope that by the time we get to Morocco for COP 22, we will have exciting case studies to demonstrate what women can do in order to become deliverers of energy in different countries, in different parts of the world were the need is greatest, said Ms. Mlambo-Ngcuka. UN Women Executive Director and Hakima El Haite, Minister Delegate in Charge of Environment of Morocco, also signed the Cooperation Framework Integrating Gender Equality into the Environment and Sustainable Development Sectors in Morocco. The opening session was followed by a High-Level Panel on Sustainable Energy Access with the participation of Isabella Lvin, Minister of International Development Cooperation for Sweden; Ligia Noroha, Director of the Division of Technology, Industry and Economics for UNEP; Ahmed Baroudi, General Director, Energy Investment Company of Morocco; and Naoko Ishii, GEF CEO and Chairperson. At a lunchtime event, Parties and other participants interacted with experts on the recommendations from a recent Expert Group Meeting and exchanged views on how these can support and enhance implementation of policies and action at the regional, national and local levels. Ms. Mlambo-Ngcuka also met with UNFCCCs Momentum for Change, Women for Results awardees, recognized for activities that demonstrate the critical leadership and participation of women in addressing climate change. Their activities show measurable results, which can be potentially be replicated and scaled up at the local, national and international levels On 7 December, Ms. Mlambo-Ngcuka attended the COP21 Womens Caucus. Together with the Government of Morocco, UN Women is showcasing relevant material on the theme of womens leadership at the One UN Exhibit. \</doc>

Lawrence: The University of Kansas has issued the following news release: The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference , known as COP21 , currently is meeting in Paris until Dec. 11. According to Shannon O\' Lear, professor of geography, atmospheric science & environmental studies, and Ryan Chilcoat, student with the KU Environmental Studies Program, the goal is to produce a legally binding agreement among more than 190 countries to keep global temperatures from exceeding 2 Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.  COP21 is distinguished from previous conferences by taking a bottom-up approach, allowing countries to submit individual pledges, said Chilcoat.  Before the Paris climate talks began, more than 150 countries offered national plans towards reducing greenhouse emissions or ramping up renewable energy use. O\' Lear, who researches environmental geopolitics, critical geopolitics, linkages between climate science and  slow violence, and academic and military perspectives on environmental security, said the talks suggest a strong degree of political will to address the increasingly dire situation of a changing climate.  Topics of concern at the Paris climate talks will include threats to coastal areas  with a significant portion of major urban centers around the world in close proximity to an ocean  flows of people leaving their homes and home states when they become uninhabitable due to flooding, drought or degraded capacity to support human well-being, options for shifting away from fossil-fuel based energy and consumption patterns, possible security connotations of hydrometeorological disasters and threats to military, urban, energy, and food infrastructures and systems, and justice issues pertaining to the uneven distribution of risk caused by the degradation of our life support system, she said. According to the KU researcher, the Paris talks\' success can be measured by how effectively it addresses key issues.  To what extent are new investments being promoted as opposed to established government subsidies to the fossil fuel industry? O\' Lear asked.  If nuclear energy is going to be promoted, how much support might be garnered for liquid fluoride thorium reactors, which are far less hazardous than uranium technology? To what degree are scientific solutions such as geoengineering  which is mostly understood through computer simulations  promoted as being more \' certain\' than motivating necessary political and social changes? To what degree are methane emissions, which are 80 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, included in national plans and calculations for reducing the warming capacity of the atmosphere? O\' Lear said COP21 provides some reasons for optimism  there is now a greater moral imperative, more public outcry, and more political will than ever before.  However, the conference is not a solution, she said.  With such a large and diverse group of interests and concerns, the Paris climate talks cannot realistically resolve the issue of climate change, but with attention and financial backing focused less on business-as-usual and more on innovative approaches to these challenges, it may yet be a sign of progress.

The Ocean Conservancy issued the following statement: To ensure world leaders have access to the best available information at this year's Conference of Parties in Paris, more than 20 international marine scientists worked together to synthesize the best available research on our changing ocean. Their paper, published in July in Science magazine, considers two potential scenarios: serious emissions cuts, and business as usual. They concluded that we need to immediately reduce CO2 emissions in order to prevent massive changes to the ocean. The longer we wait to act, the more difficult and costly it will be manage ocean acidification. Following is a quote from Sarah Cooley, PhD, Ocean Conservancy's Science Outreach Manager, and co-author of the Science paper. "The ocean provides food, oxygen, and jobs for people around the world. It also helps to regulate our climate. Studies show that the ocean has absorbed half of all the carbon emitted since the Industrial Revolution. But it is reaching a saturation point. Seawater along our shores is becoming increasingly acidic, making it hard for some marine animals to build their shells. That impacts everything from whales to seabirds to shellfish farmers. Here in the United States, we are seeing leaders from states on both coasts and the federal government stepping up to meet this challenge. New monitoring programs and efforts to cut emissions will slow the progress of ocean acidification and help the most vulnerable communities prepare. But local action is not enough - to truly address acidification, we need global action. We are pleased to see so many nations committing to emissions reductions ahead of COP21 , and hope to see the momentum continue as world leaders gather in Paris." Background: Monitoring and managing ocean acidification is an area that has bridged partisan divides. From the Pacific Northwest to Florida, Maine to Maryland, states on both U.S. coasts are working to tackle ocean acidification, and help impacted rural, coastal businesses and communities adapt in the face of a changing ocean. The U.S. is not alone in working to address the problem. Over one hundred nations have submitted plans to reduce carbon emissions ahead of the United Nations Conference of the Parties ( COP 21 ) meeting. Ocean acidification occurs when carbon absorbed from the atmosphere changes ocean chemistry, creating more corrosive waters that make it difficult for corals, plankton and shellfish to build their shells. Scientists warn that the ocean is at a tipping point--immediate action is needed to prevent massive and mostly irreversible changes to the food web that will ripple all the way up to coastal communities and businesses. That is why the eyes of the world will be on COP21 . Our vision is a healthy ocean that sustains life on our planet. We envision a world where we all work together to keep the ocean and our coastal communities healthy and prosperous.

The tens of thousands of diplomats, world leaders, activists and journalists attending landmark climate change negotiations in Paris over the next two weeks now have three new dedicated emojis to use on Twitter. SPECIAL SERIES Paris Climate Talks provides in-depth coverage of the 21st U.N. summit to forge a new global agreement to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Visit the special report. The social media website yesterday afternoon unveiled the new icons, which are activated by hashtags, to mark the beginning of the two-week-long Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP 21 , in the French capital. The summit aims to hash out a global deal to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius over preindustrial levels. The emojis -- which feature an Eiffel Tower overlaid on a green leaf, a green Eiffel Tower and a heart-shaped Earth icon -- will appear when users tweet using the hashtags # COP21 , #GoCOP21, #ActionDay and #ClimateChange. The # COP21 hashtag has nearly 380,000 tweets. According to the United Nations, 192,000 of those tweets occurred today, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the "most influential participant." Calif. Gov. Brown, Tom Steyer lead business delegation to Paris California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) and billionaire Tom Steyer will head to Paris next week and will take a massive business delegation along with them. The group includes Calpine CEO Thad Hill, Kaiser Permanente Chairman Bernard Tyson, NRG Energy CEO David Crane, PG&E Corp. Chairman Anthony Earley and other health care, energy and financial services industry officials. "We welcome California businesses as key allies in our efforts to halt dangerous climate change," Brown said in a statement. Some nations defy U.N., won't submit targets While 183 nations have now submitted climate targets to the United Nations, a handful are still lagging behind -- and some remain defiantly opposed to doing so. In an interview yesterday with Climate Home, Nicaraguan lead envoy Paul Oquist said his country has no intention of offering an intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) for slashing emissions. Venezuela, which like Nicaragua is a member of the Bolivarian Alliance, or ALBA, also has not submitted an INDC. Asked earlier this year by ClimateWire when Venezuela would put forward its targets, Venezuelan envoy Claudia Salerno said, "In our own nationally determined time." The move is a dig at the United States, in particular, which has championed the burgeoning system. Speaking today to reporters, Liz Gallagher, a climate analyst with London-based think tank E3G, said she expects to see some drama this week from ALBA countries. "The ALBA countries have always played a slightly disruptive game at the negotiations," she said. "I suspect we'll see a few surprises. We know that some of them haven't or won't put down an INDC, which is obviously a great shame." Coal plans could stymie warming target If all the planned coal-fired power plants around the world are built, attempts to limit warming to 2 C will fail, according to a new analysis presented today during the climate talks in Paris. Construction of the 2,440 planned coal plants by 2030 would boost greenhouse gas emissions four times above the 2-degree target, researchers from Climate Action Tracker said, according to a report from BBC News. The research looks at planned and existing coal-fired power plants in eight countries, including India, China and Indonesia, as well as the European Union. U.S. will struggle to hit renewable targets -- analysis Coal plants aren't the only things that could hinder efforts to halt climate change. According to a new analysis from Bloomberg New Energy Finance, some nations or blocs face an uphill battle in their efforts to achieve renewable energy growth targets that they submitted ahead of the summit. The analysis found Australia, Brazil, Japan and the European Union are well-positioned to reach their targets. Others, like the United States and India, will struggle to meet their targets, according to the analysis reported by Bloomberg. France drops billions on renewable projects in Africa France will spend billions of euros on environmental and renewable energy projects in its former African colonies over the next five years, President Fran\'e7ois Hollande said today. Hollande said the French government would double current investments in renewable energy generation -- wind farms, solar power and hydroelectric dams -- across Africa to \€ 2 billion ($2.12 billion) by 2020, according to Reuters. One project will plant pockets of trees to revive soil in West Africa. Another will aim to protect Lake Chad from pollution. \</doc>

Even this amount, if possible to attain, would still result in significant damage to the global environment, especially to agriculture in developing countries.<nl/> This years conference In Paris France is being attended by many of the world's top leaders, including US President Barack Obama and Chinese president Xi Jinping. XI's<nl/>participation comes at a time when some of the worst air pollution levels ever recorded are chocking cities like Beijing[3]. Much more than speeches and photo ops are needed, however, to slow down the increasing\~effects of global warming and climate change; that many climatists are now attributing to be largely caused by over use of fossil fuels.<nl/> HYPERLINK http://i0.wp.com/www.greenprophet.com/wp-content/uploads/air-pollution-in-Beijing.jpg<nl/> http://i0.wp.com/www.greenprophet.com/wp-content/uploads/air-pollution-in-Beijing.jpg<nl/> <nl/> In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Christina Figueres, Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change[4], said: ' A climate change treaty is in our shared interest.There is a good mood among countries to fight climate change. We need a legally binding treaty for all\~countries to adhere to; especially the large industrialized countries'. Ms. Figueres added that green technology projects must be accelerated; particualarly those\~involving solar and wind energy.<nl/> Despite all the good intentions being expressed by the various high profile delegates attending this year's conference, will an agreed upon climate change treaty be a situation<nl/>of 'too little, too late' to deal with what is beginning to look like an irreversable reality? China, one of the worst pollutors on the planet, already has air pollution levels so high in\~Beijing that they are considered to be 'extremely hazardous'[5].<nl/> Even in the USA, severe dust storms, normally attributed to other parts of world like the Middle East, are already occuring in states like Arizona as shown in this video[6]<nl/> Reaching the agreed annual world temperature increase of 2 degrees Celsius is still not a very desirable level, taking the aforementioned 'heat dome' phenomenom into account.<nl/>Large areas of countries like India, Kuwait and Iraq are already unlivable during the summer months. Weaning large industrial countries off dependence on fossel fuels will take<nl/>years; and require heavy investments in infrastructure changes to renewable energy. Taking the example of the Arab Gulf region into account, do we have the time<nl/>to reverse the ravages of climate change?

On the morning of November 13, senior Danny Timpona woke up ready to purchase his flight to the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. "I was convinced that the timing was finally right. I was going to participate in the largest act of civil disobedience for the climate ever," said Timpona. "All I had to do was confirm the itinerary with my parents and send a few emails and I was all set." But on this same day, with just over two weeks left until the 21st Conference of the Parties ( COP21 Now, in the wake of 130 deaths, the world anxiously carries on towards COP21 as the unpredictability of future attacks by ISIS hang in suspense. As two of the most pressing issues of our generation collide in Paris with impressive force, the global community understands climate change through a new lens. While he watched the tragedy in Paris unfold on the news, Timpona determined it was in his best interest not to attend COP21 . But Timpona remains hopeful that as world leaders tentatively prepare to gather under a newfound spotlight on the terror-struck city, environmentalists and politicians alike will understand the importance of international cooperation in COP21 to secure matters of climate change and global security. This year, one change is that major participating nations have submitted carbon reduction plans ahead of the conference, rather than negotiating them on site per usual. Taken together, the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions pledges from 200 countries are the biggest cut in emissions ever achieved. Unfortunately, the fact of the matter is that these pledges are still not enough. Without the pledges,\~global temperatures\~are predicated to rise by more than eight degrees Fahrenheit by 2100. The INDC pledges\~lower this jump to just over six degrees Fahrenheit. In 2010, the goal was to limit the temperature increase to just 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. "Even if all the pledges are fully implemented, we're still going to end up halfway where we need to be," said John Knox, Wake Forest law professor and UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights and the Environment, in his November 19 moderated discussion on COP21 in Broyhill Auditorium. "There's a pretty clear consensus: we have a challenge in getting countries to do what they say they need to do, but also in convincing them to do more," Knox said. With politics revving up in the U.S. as the country prepares for the 2016 elections, stances on climate change have fallen across party lines. As Republican candidates stand firm that taking on climate change will ruin the economy, environmentalists fear that any progress made through COP21 will be reversed by a Republican-elected government. "Unfortunately, 'going green' often gets caught in the crosshairs between red and blue states," said Wake Forest director of sustainability Dedee Johnston. "When sustainability becomes a political issue, it unhinges our progress and gets mired down in rhetoric that's based in pundancy, not policy." A current of optimism rang through the green community when Pope Francis claimed stake in the climate change conversation in his encyclical in June. It was hoped that the encyclical's political undertones would help sway Catholic Republicans into climate change action. But it seems that most Republicans hope Pope Francis leaves his liberal-leaning views at the Vatican. According to the Public Religion Research Institute, 60 percent of white U.S. Catholics deny that climate disruption is human-caused, and at least four of them are among the 2016 Republican Presidential candidates. With a myriad of political, religious, economic and social factors already at play in the climate conversation in Paris, terrorism adds a dimension that can overshadow the rest. Cultivate Consciousness, Wake Forest's student-led environmental activism group on campus, had centered its plans this semester on COP21 . In light of the recent attacks, they've shifted their focus significantly. Now the activist group is planning an event exploring the link between climate change and terrorism, surrounding their discussion on national security. One group member, Wesley Skidmore, was brave enough to acknowledge the elephant in the room at the Broyhill climate forum. "Do you worry about the possible threat of terrorism at COP21 ?" Confident that the French government will be able to provide security to world leaders, Knox discounted any doubt about attending the talks in a few weeks. Instead, Knox refocused his attention back to the future of climate change progress. "Paris is not the endpoint in any sense; this is a road you're going to be on for your whole lifetime," said Knox to Wake Forest students. "There isn't going to be a point where you'll say, 'We're done with that issue.' Continuing to work on actually making sure countries do what they say and making stronger commitments in the future are both steps that we'll be continuing to take in the future." \</doc>

Ada Throckmorton Deputy Desk Editor By: Ada Throckmorton | Deputy Desk Editor As of noon on Wednesday, 51 Stanford students signed a pledge written by Fossil Free Stanford pledging to participate in civil disobedience due to the University's continued investment in oil and gas industries. The threat comes in advance of the U.N.'s upcoming climate negotiations in Paris at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP-21 ). According to the Fossil Free Stanford press release, if Stanford's Board of Trustees does not divest from fossil fuels before COP-21 in December, the signatories of the pledge "will take nonviolent direct action in order to demonstrate the urgency with which Stanford must divest if it is to make a maximal impact." Fossil Free Stanford, which began working on the University's divestment from coal three years ago, presented their case to "divest the rest" in front of the Special Committee on Investment Responsibility of the Stanford Board of Trustees on Monday, Oct. 5. \~ In the written text of the letter read aloud to the SCIR, Fossil Free Stanford recognizes the contributions that the University has made overall to fighting climate change - including faculty research and investment into a new energy generation strategy - but argues that more must be done. "[Stanford's] actions regularly do change the world," the letter reads. "Following Stanford's coal divestment announcement, a wave of divestments cited Stanford's logic and action... On the floor of the California Senate last month, President Pro Tempore Kevin De Leon cited Stanford's divestment as he argued for his bill, now law, encouraging divestment of CalPERS, the fifth largest mutual fund on the planet." Although it is currently unclear what Fossil Free's intended act of civil disobedience would consist of, the group's website indicates that the details of the action will be shared with participants in the coming weeks if no change is made by the SCIR. Members of Fossil Free Stanford assert that Stanford has a responsibility to act before the COP-21 . "Because of the urgency of producing an international agreement in Paris, it is the responsibility of leading U.S. institutions to equip the U.S. negotiators with clear evidence that the country's civil society is ready to close the door on the future of fossil fuels," said Josh Lappen '17, the faculty liaison of the organization.

"Signing the pledge was an easy decision because we're already doing the things that the pledge asked of us," said Dean Scarborough, Avery Dennison's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We unequivocally support an agreement coming out of Paris that takes a strong step toward a low-carbon future. We are cutting our own carbon emissions and taking additional measures to tackle climate change." The full text of Avery Dennison's pledge reads as follows: We applaud the growing number of countries that have already set ambitious targets for climate action. In this context, we support the conclusion of a climate change agreement in Paris that takes a strong step forward toward a low-carbon, sustainable future. We recognize that delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms, while accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy will produce multiple benefits with regard to sustainable economic growth, public health, resilience to natural disasters and the health of the global environment. We put forth our pledges as follows: Building on a 2009 pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, indexed to net sales, by 15% from 2005 to 2015, Avery Dennison pledges to:   Reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions from our operations by at least 3% annually, and by at least 26% overall, between 2015 and 2025. Eliminate deforestation from the production of agricultural commodities by 2020, in alignment with the 2014 New York Declaration on Forests.   Purchase 100% of our paper from certified sources by 2025. Purchase at least 70% of our paper from FSC-certified sources by 2025. Develop long-term business plans that align with the deep decarbonization necessary to keep global average temperatures from rising more than 2\'b0C. Scarborough will speak in Paris next week as part of the Sustainable Innovation Forum, which will run concurrently with the COP21 climate talks. Avery Dennison supports an agreement that will cut emissions enough to keep the average global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists say is necessary to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Scarborough said his company supports strong and immediate efforts to curb emissions for reasons both ethical and commercial. "Climate change is an imminent global threat that demands urgent action from all segments of society-including business- while we still have time to act," he said. "It poses risks to people, communities, ecosystems and, obviously, our business. Responding to climate change by reducing emissions is, above all, a moral imperative. It's consistent with our company's ethics and guiding principles. And if we want to stay in business for the long term, then addressing the risks posed by climate change is simply sound strategy."

PARIS, Calif., Dec. 5 -- The California Department of Insurance issued the following press release: California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones will join global leaders addressing the threat of climate change at the 21st United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) in Paris. As the regulator of the sixth largest insurance market in the world and largest in the United States, Jones has been a national and international leader with regard to how insurers address climate risk in their business operations, reserving and underwriting. Jones strongly supports reducing carbon emissions and reliance on carbon based fuels and increasing investment, including insurers' investment, in alternative green energy sources. "I am pleased to join Governor Jerry Brown and other California leaders in the public and private sector at the UN Climate Summit in Paris," said Commissioner Jones. "Governor Brown's leadership on climate change is making a tremendous difference in California and across the world." Commissioner Jones will participate in a number of prominent meetings in the COP 21 "Blue Zone," where official negotiations among national leaders are being held. Commissioner Jones has been selected as one of 24 world leaders to participate in a private roundtable with high-level participants including asset owners, asset managers and policymakers to discuss carbon related risks, financial regulation and climate safe energy alternatives. The Commissioner will participate in Climate Action Day, an event aimed at showcasing the most emblematic commitments and initiatives of state and non-state actors in the Lima-Paris Action agenda and shedding light on those engaged in climate action. Jones will also join decision-makers from across the globe at the Sustainable Innovation Forum, the largest business-focused climate event held during the annual conference. Commissioner Jones will also have bilateral meetings with insurance regulators from other nations regarding the establishment of an international consortium of insurance regulators sponsored by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) that will further collaboration between insurance regulators from around the world in addressing climate risk and the insurance sector. The Commissioner's itinerary for COP21 : Saturday, December 5, 2015 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Climate Action Day Commissioner Jones will attend this event showcasing the most emblematic commitments and initiatives of state and non-state actors in the Lima-Paris Action agenda and shedding light on those engaged in climate action. At the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP20) to the UNFCCC in December 2014 in Lima, the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC and the Presidency of the COP21 were encouraged to convene a high-level event to enhance implementation of climate action. Monday, December 7, 2015 The Role of the Financial System in the Transition to a Low-carbon Economy Jones will attend the session focused on decarbonizing financial markets and portfolios. Investors and financial regulators have started to acknowledge their role in this arena. 2 Investing Initiative, Carbon Tracker Initiative and the UNEP Inquiry are three organizations working with investors and policymakers on the integration of climate considerations in investment decisions to ensure the reallocation of capital to a low carbon economy. Discussions will focus on theories and actions, offer insight on the European and global context and analyze the current policy momentum. 6th Annual Sustainable Innovation Forum 2015 The Commissioner will join global stakeholders and decision-makers with delegates from 43 countries at the 6th Annual Sustainable Innovation Forum. Building on year-round work from Climate Action and UNEP, the two-day forum will convene cross-sector participants from business, government, finance, the UN, NGOs and civil society to create an unparalleled opportunity to bolster business innovation and bring scale to the emerging green economy. Tuesday, December 8, 2015 Carbon Tracker Roundtable Discussion on Strategic Risk Disclosures for Fossil Fuel Companies Commissioner Jones has been selected as one of 24 world leaders to participate in a private roundtable with high-level participants including asset owners, asset managers and policy-makers to discuss the extent to which company business plans diverge from climate safe energy pathways and to agree on future actions. Organized in partnership with the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), the discussion will focus on the disclosure of fossil fuel companies' long-term exposure to energy transition risk and how investors can best engage on this topic. On December 7, Carbon Tracker will launch a set of recommended strategic risk engagement principles for fossil fuel companies at the Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) Leaders Luncheon on Climate. This document is designed to complement the work of organizations including PRI and SSE and will allow investors in fossil fuel companies to gain insight into business risks in the context of the transition to a low carbon economy. Shifting Billions Toward Green Investments The Commissioner will attend this meeting of investors and policymakers, which will include a discussion of investment solutions to a greener economy, carbon impacts in investment decisions and asset management, and emerging new solutions.

Albany: Cornell University, The State of New York has issued the following news release: Six panelists, including Cornell faculty members, who attended the 21st United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) in Paris last fall recalled the historic proceedings for a spirited audience that spilled into the hallway of the Tompkins County Public Library\' s BorgWarner Room Feb. 3. The panel,  COP21 : Reflections on the Historic Climate Agreement, was co-sponsored by Cornell\' s Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future, local government agencies and community groups. Todd Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering, moderated the discussion. Topics discussed ranged from methane emissions to agriculture to civil disobedience, but panelists agreed that the COP21 made history by producing a 195-nation commitment to combat climate change that, while not nearly strong enough, they said, was a remarkable achievement nonetheless. \' It cannot be a bridge fuel\' Panelist Robert Howarth, Cornell\' s David R. Atkinson Professor of Ecology and Environmental Biology, attended methane, anti-fracking and ocean meetings at COP21 . He said 195 nations agreed to keep Earth\' s temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius but noted that the Earth is on target to warm 1.5 degrees Celsius in about 12 years. Howarth said the United States and other nations need to focus more on methane, a shorter-lived, more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.  No matter what we do for carbon dioxide over the coming years and decades, the planet will continue to warm by 1.5 degrees [Celsius] in 12 years and by 2 degrees [Celsius] in 35 years, unless we cut methane emission, said Howarth, who said we need to reduce methane within the next three years. The natural gas industry is the largest source of methane emissions in the U.S. by far, and shale-gas development (fracking) has at least doubled these gas-industry methane emissions.  This completely undercuts the idea that natural gas is a bridge fuel, Howarth said.  It cannot be a bridge fuel if we\' re to meet the COP21 targets. &hellip; We\' ve got to get rid of natural gas. Parsing the language Picking up on the COP21 talks, Karen Pinkus, professor of Italian and comparative literature, observed how language was used in Paris. Pinkus observed meetings where negotiators parsed syllables, comma placements and precise terminology. As an example, she said an African coalition argued for the treaty to mention electricity rights. Negotiators had excised the term -  electricity rights - from the final COP21 document, which made no mention of agriculture or food security, critical issues for developing nations. Pinkus also observed that climate change discussions have all but disappeared from U.S. media since the December convention.  This is something to be very cautious about, because if there is any momentum to come out of Paris &hellip; we can\' t really afford to brush it aside, she said. \' This time it was different\' Johannes Lehmann, professor of soil and crop sciences, said COP21  was an awesome assembly of people, and a quite frustrating beast as well. Lehmann had attended previous climate meetings but said,  This time it was different. The meeting\' s youth movement encouraged Lehmann.  It was teeming with young people, and they were excited about it, he said.  To nurture this new generation of climate scientists, activists and concerned citizens is really important. Laying the foundation Allison Chatrchyan, director of the Cornell Institute for Climate Change and Agriculture, set up an exhibit in Paris to showcase the university\' s research and work on climate change, and she organized a panel on climate change and global food security and nutrition issues. While some people believe the COP21 treaty did not go far enough, she said she agrees with climate scientist Christopher Field, of the Carnegie Institution\' s Department of Global Ecology, who said the Paris agreement is going to save the world.  We didn\' t solve the problem, but we laid the foundation, Chatrchyan said, noting the conference provided a more flexible approach to get agreement among all countries of the world:  But it is up to us - in our own countries and communities - to make sure that we\' re living up to our commitments. \' We\' re out of time\' Sandra Steingraber, distinguished scholar in residence in environmental studies and science at Ithaca College, spoke about business looking for strong signals from political leaders to signal that investment dollars will flow into a new green economy.  So for the treaty itself, I think it\' s a pretty sound document, it has good bones, the science is sound and there are pledges in place from almost every nation, Steingraber said.  I see this as a great race. I agree with [climate author] Bill McKibben, who said, \' It\' s a great treaty - for 1995.\' But the problem is what\' s missing is what we can\' t add anymore, which is time. We\' re out of time. So all of this remarkable transformation has to happen rapidly. \' Appeal to the better angels\' Colleen Boland \' 01, founding member of advocacy group We Are Seneca Lake, said she and others gathered outside the official summit to  appeal to the better angels of those who are inside negotiating on behalf of the citizenry of the entire planet.

There is a lot of debate around climate finance and public contribution, but the phrase '[US$]100 billion can unlock the trillions' has become something that is widely accepted. It sounds like in the negotiations, private sector investment is getting more attention.'<nl/> Now is the time for us to support the COP21 French Presidency to ensure that Paris is the moment when business, government, and civil society align to tackle the climate challenge.<nl/> What's Important Now<nl/>Business needs a\~clear, long-term goal well before the end of the century. It matters more that we get to zero as quickly as possible than what we call it[5]. Business hears the voice of vulnerable populations. A\~five-year ambition mechanism that begins around 2020 is the only path to bringing 1.5\'b0C into reach. Heads of government need to understand that the cost of\~mobilizing the US$100 billion is far outweighed by the benefits of the trillions of dollars that will be unlocked and they need to mandate their ministers to secure an ambitious agreement. Business trusts the COP Presidency\~to secure an ambitious agreement. Other parties need to trust them as well.

BOSTON, March 3 -- The city of Boston issued the following press release: Mayor Martin J. Walsh today joined the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) Steering Committee, the governing body that provides strategic direction for the network of cities on the front line of preparing for and helping prevent climate change. He will serve on the steering committee as the representative for all North American C40 cities. "Boston has made significant progress on climate action," said Mayor Walsh. "I'm proud and determined to build on and expand that legacy in this new leadership role." Boston joined C40 in 2014 and has accomplished much in two years - from the release of the updated Greenovate Climate Action, which sets a clear road map to achieve Boston's greenhouse gas reduction goals of 25 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050, to receiving an international award for community engagement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) in Paris. Read more about Boston's C40 "Smart Cities and Smart Community Engagement" award and why Boston was chosen as the recipient, read hereand here. As a member of the C40 Steering Committee, Mayor Walsh and the City of Boston will represent C40 in regional forums as well as on the global stage, helping to make the case for urgent and ambitious climate action as cities take on an increasingly important role in delivering global climate goals. "Mayor Martin J. Walsh of Boston has been officially elected as the new North American Steering Committee member. Mayor Walsh will work alongside our existing Steering Committee member Mayor Garcetti of Los Angeles to represent the 14 North American members," said C40 Chair and Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes. "The Steering Committee is confident and looks forward to Mayor Walsh's leadership in C40's efforts to steer this organization and actively represent North America and C40 as a whole in the global climate change arena."

Nov 27, 2015( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com As the world's focus turns to the UNFCCC Conference of Parties next week and the need for a crucial international binding agreement on climate change, we're looking ahead to the developments in sustainability reporting which will enable businesses across the world to take action. <nl/> Events such as the recent UN Sustainable Development Summit in New York, and the upcoming\~ COP 21 in Paris[2]\~put corporate responsibility and transparency in firm focus. KPMG has just released their biennial report on\~Corporate Responsibility Reporting[3]\~ahead of COP 21 , with some persuasive findings. The report focuses on the quality of carbon reporting among the world's largest 250 companies, and the bottom line is this: businesses are disclosing information, but consistency and comparability of this information is lacking.<nl/> The future of reporting The growing trend for companies to include more corporate responsibility information in annual financial reports is driven by two factors, according to KPMG: the demand from shareholders to enable a deeper understanding of a company's risks and opportunities, and the requirements issued by stock exchanges and governments for companies to report on corporate responsibility data. The report states that as carbon reporting requirements increase, stakeholders, including investors and regulators will demand more transparency on corporate carbon performance. Or as Wim Bartels, partner with KPMG in the Netherlands and Global Head of Sustainability Reporting and Assurance, put it: 'All stakeholders should be able to access good quality, comparable information on a company's carbon performance quickly and easily from the company's annual financial or corporate responsibility reports.'<nl/> This is just the beginning. As the architect of the world's non-financial information, GRI is using its expertise, its partnerships and its trusted reputation to transform the way businesses, governments and other stakeholders use this information to make better decisions. The world needs real-time, high quality and comparable data to empower sustainable decisions in every organization. Moving beyond the sustainability report itself and liberating this information is one of GRI's\~four strategic priorities[4]\~announced earlier this year.<nl/> Globally accepted sustainability reporting standards A key finding from the KPMG report is the need for better quality reporting which adheres to a standard. According to the report 'CR information continues to often be\~given limited space in annual reports, in the absence of the consistent application of relevant CR principles such as the materiality of issues included.'<nl/> This finding reinforces a strategic priority of the\~Global Sustainability Standards Board[5]\~(GSSB), responsible for the development and approval of GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards): the need for a common global language through which environmental, social and economic impacts of organizations can be communicated and understood.\~The timely transition to reporting standards[6]\~provides this common language, with thousands of organizations across the world already using the GRI G4 Guidelines which will form the basis of GRI Standards. <nl/> GRI Standards and the information from the sustainability reporting process are designed to be used by businesses in all sorts of new and exciting ways. Eric Hespenheide, Chair of the GSSB commented: 'The transition to GRI Standards is designed to enhance the global comparability, usability and quality of sustainability information. GRI Standards will provide tremendous benefits to businesses, governments and stakeholders and can be specifically tailored to an organization's needs, including its use in their business plans and strategies as well as allowing for flexibility in reporting options and formats.'<nl/> #ClimateAction: the greatest challenge of our time As the world's leaders gather in Paris next week, GRI will be focused on ensuring businesses take a holistic view of climate change and understand the connections with other sustainability challenges.<nl/> GRI is holding two events at COP 21 :\~Climate risk, data and decision making for business and governments\~(a closed event), and\~Spotlight on Climate Change, Human Rights and Sustainable development - role of Business[7].\~Teresa Fogelberg, GRI's Deputy Chief Executive, will also speak at the\~6th Annual Sustainable Innovation Forum (SIF15)[8], hosted by UNEP Climate Action.\~<nl/> GRI is committed to supporting organizations to move beyond reports and is harnessing data and technology to ensure better quality information is used to inform all types of decision making. Businesses are taking action. But a transformational effort is required by all actors to unlock the real value of this information.<nl/> Follow all our coverage of the COP 21 developments on\~Twitter[9],\~Facebook[10]\~and\~LinkedIn[11], as well as our\~news pages[12].\~<nl/><nl/>Tweet me: <nl/> KEYWORDS: Environment and Climate Change, Business ...ade, COP21 , climate change, KPMG, GSSB, corporate responsibility reporting, climate action, Global Sustainability Standards Board (GSSB)<nl/> [ 1]: HYPERLINK http://3blmedia.com/CSR-Profiles/Global-Reporting-Initiative http://3blmedia.com/CSR-Profiles/Global-Reporting-Initiative [ 2]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.cop21paris.org http://www.cop21paris.org HYPERLINK https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/pdf/2015/11/kpmg-international-survey-of-corporate-responsibility-reporting-2015.pdf https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/pdf/2015/11/kpmg-international-survey-of-corporate-responsibility-reporting-2015.pdf [ 4]: \~ https://www.globalreporting.org/information/news-and-press-center/Documents/GRI-Five-year-focus-2015.pdf https://www.globalreporting.org/information/news-and-press-center/Documents/GRI-Five-year-focus-2015.pdf [ 5]: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.globalreporting.org/information/about-gri/governance-bodies/Global-Sustainability-Standard-Board/Pages/default.aspx https://www.globalreporting.org/information/about-gri/governance-bodies/Global-Sustainability-Standard-Board/Pages/default.aspx [ 6]: \~ https://www.globalreporting.org/information/news-and-press-center/Pages/GSSB-TO-ISSUE-GRI-SUSTAINABILITY-REPORTING-STANDARDS-IN-2016.aspx https://www.globalreporting.org/information/news-and-press-center/Pages/GSSB-TO-ISSUE-GRI-SUSTAINABILITY-REPORTING-STANDARDS-IN-2016.aspx [ 7]: \~ http://ec.europa.eu/clima/events/0107/calendar_en.htm#schedule http://ec.europa.eu/clima/events/0107/calendar_en.htm#schedule [ 8]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.cop21paris.org/agenda http://www.cop21paris.org/agenda HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/GRI_Secretariat https://twitter.com/GRI_Secretariat HYPERLINK https://www.facebook.com/GlobalReporting https://www.facebook.com/GlobalReporting / [ 11]: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.linkedin.com/company/global-reporting-initiative-gri https://www.linkedin.com/company/global-reporting-initiative-gri [ 12]: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.globalreporting.org/information/news-and-press-center/Pages/default.aspx https://www.globalreporting.org/information/news-and-press-center/Pages/default.aspx \</doc>

Dec 10, 2015( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com He called it a 'full-court press.'<nl/> He's right. This year, business leaders from every industry are here advocating for an ambitious Paris Agreement. Even as COP21 has gathered an unprecedented number of heads of state, it's fair to say it has also gathered an unprecedented number of heads of business. These leaders are already experiencing the effects of climate change on their companies, and they are here to share their commitments and let governments know that they plan to partner with policymakers in implementing the final Paris Agreement.<nl/> 'At Kellogg, we have seen firsthand how extreme weather can impact the people who grow and supply our ingredients,' Kellogg Company Chairman and CEO John Bryant wrote in a guest editorial[2] for the We Mean Business Bottom Line. At a New York Times dinner Tuesday night, Bryant announced[3] that, by 2050, Kellogg would cut its emissions by 65 percent and help reduce those of its suppliers by 50 percent.<nl/> At the same event, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry who announced yesterday that the United States will provide US$800 million in climate aid to the world's poorest countries (subscription required)[4] noted the importance of the business community. 'We are not going to solve this at government level,' Kerry said to an audience of largely businesspeople. 'You are going to make the difference.'<nl/> One of the reasons we are so optimistic about an ambitious climate agreement this year[5] is because of the strong role of business, which has come to Paris with a set of clear, concrete policy asks designed to maximize ambition, secure a diplomatic agreement, and send the signal that will catalyze private-sector investments in a thriving, clean economy.<nl/> As we enter the last few days of negotiations, the BSR climate delegation at COP21 is working hard on three main priorities of business for the final agreement: a long-term goal that sends the policy certainty that business needs, a review mechanism starting in 2020 to ensure that goals are increased every five years to give business the confidence to invest, and a strong financial element that leverages the trillions needed.<nl/> We urge business leaders to send this message to their government officials in their national capitals. Together, we can support a successful Paris Agreement.<nl/> What's Important Now<nl/> Business is asking the French Presidency for its continued leadership of COP21 . In particular, business would like the French officials to\~stay strong in seeking an ambitious climate agreement,\~which will send a catalytic signal to the real economy. Business also urges the French COP21 leadership to fulfill its promise to\~'leave nothing behind' including the\~long-term goal\~and the\~five-year ambition mechanism, starting from 2020 onward.<nl/> As the French COP21 Presidency pushes for ambition, business urges all to be 'willing to do so.' For business, this means offering ambition through climate commitments, innovation, and the mobilization of private-sector finance. And for other governments this means being willing to find common ground on the remaining crux issues the long-term goal, the five-year review mechanism starting from 2020 onward, and climate finance.<nl/> To ensure an effective outcome in Paris, we all need to do three things.

As the end of the UN Conference on Climate Change ( COP21 ) nears, experts and scholars in the energy, architecture and meteorology fields from both sides of the Taiwan Strait attend the Delta21 Forum organized by Delta Electronics on December 10 at the Grand Palais. They discussed the enormous potential of green buildings in regards to energy conservation and lower carbon emissions from the policy support, energy-efficient technology and architectural design perspective. Over the past 10 years, Delta has worked with partners to construct 21 green buildings, accumulating valuable experience and defining the philosophy of "Building Harmony with Nature". The concrete achievements during the COP21 conference period included proposing solutions that will help traditional high energy consumption cities transform into sustainable cities. Delta also hopes to utilize COP21 's international influence to remind organizations around the world to focus upon the potential value of conserving energy via green buildings as we all work together to create a smart green life. During the forum, Mr. Bruce Cheng, Delta's founder and honorary chairman, shared his experience on cost-effective designs for natural ventilation and lighting that can effectively conserve energy, optimize comfort and realize the concept of "Building Harmony with Nature". He pointed out that a UN report indicates the potential to reduce the carbon emissions of buildings reaches up to 90%. Since 2005, Delta's factories, offices and donated buildings around the world adopt green building practices, with a current total of 21 green buildings. Delta has also sponsored the "Delta Cup International Solar Building Design Competition" for ten consecutive years and has promoted the implementation of winning designs from this initiative. Delta hopes that these international contestants will accumulate knowledge and skills related to green buildings and become future urban planners and architects capable of ultimately benefiting a growing number of people with higher energy conservation and healthier living and working conditions. Mr. Ding-huan Shi, president of the China Renewable Energy Society (CRES), the organizing entity of the "Delta Cup International Solar Building Design Competition", and the director of the China National Engineering Research Center for Human Settlements, Mr. Ji-shou Zhong, also participated at the forum. Ding-huan Shi emphasized that in the past ten years, the Delta Cup competition has gradually become a multifaceted platform to lead the development of China's green building and energy industries, implement winning designs, nurture innovative talent and spread the low-carbon concept. Delta utilized a first-prize winning proposal to construct the "Delta Sunshine Elementary School at Yangjia Town" and the "Delta Sunshine Junior High School in Longmen Township" in disaster areas affected by the earthquakes in Sichuan. "The 24 Corridors Under the Riyue Mountain", a project recognized and supported by the Qinghai Government, also combines multiple award-winning proposals into a showcase construction project to house farmers. Mr. Zhong highlighted that industries, governments and academia across the Taiwan Strait must work closely in order to facilitate more progressive ideas that enhance innovation in green building technologies. The architect who designed the first net-zero energy campus in Taiwan, the Namasia Ming Chuan Elementary School, Mr. Ying Chao Guo, and the architect who designed the world's largest festive lantern, Delta's Ring of Celestial Bliss, Mr. Jih Pan, also shared their design expertise. Ying Chao Guo stated that, "We are rebuilding not just the past, but the future." In addition to serving an educational function, the reconstructed school also follows the "Building Harmony with Nature" philosophy while respecting the indigenous culture. The structure serves multiple complementary functions. According to Jih Pan, architecture is an external factor at any time and place, which is why architects must take special care to maintain a harmonious relationship "between nature and humans". He hopes that, "Architects will remain committed to the respect for nature and humanity so that buildings can contribute towards turning the dream of sustainability into a reality." The goal of COP21 While introducing Delta's experience in lowering the electricity intensity of its worldwide factories by 50% from 2010-2014, the chairman of Delta Electronics, Mr. Yancey Hai, provided the example of the renovation of its 16-year-old Taipei headquarters with smart green building solutions. The building received a diamond-level EEWH certification (existing buildings) from Taiwan. This building achieved energy savings of up to 58% through the use of Delta's HVAC (heating, ventilating and air conditioning) automation, power regeneration units for elevators, LED lighting, renewable energy solutions and energy management software. Not only has this green building set the record for the most significant carbon emissions reduction among Taiwanese office buildings, it has also brought significant reductions in electricity costs. Mr. Hai stressed the business potential of smart green buildings. As a global leading provider of power and thermal management solutions, Delta is dedicated to facilitating the creation of sustainable cities to counter the impact of buildings on the environment. As the week-long "Solutions COP21 " exhibition ends today, this forum is the conclusion of the company's Delta 21 Green Buildings Exhibition, that proposes the concept of "Building Harmony with Nature". Delta's exhibition utilized immersive projections and interactive designs to showcase the 21 green structures Delta has constructed over the past 10 years, including Delta's own operation facilities in Taiwan, mainland China, India, and the US, as well as the 12 green buildings donated in Taiwan and mainland China. The exhibition organizer stated that Delta has actively exercised its responsibility as a global corporate citizen, working with all organizations to promote energy conservation and lower carbon emissions. Delta has committed to contribute in the global effort to slow down global warming within 2 degree celcius\~through solutions that are also economically valid.

The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry issued the following news release: FICCI has joined the Green Infrastructure Investment Coalition launched at the ongoing COP 21 in Paris, which aims to bring together investors, governments and development banks to help increase the flow of institutional investor capital to green infrastructure investments around the world. Shifting infrastructure to being low-carbon and climate-resilient (for example, clean energy; low carbon transport, green buildings) will require more investment upfront. The Green Infrastructure Investment Coalition aims to address the investment challenge of building green infrastructure as it cannot be met with public sector funds and bank finance alone. A key task for the Coalition will be to look for ways to bridge risk gaps to ensure investment profiles can meet the needs of institutional investors. Apart from FICCI, around 11 other organisations from across the world have confirmed their participation in the Green Infrastructure Investment Coalition, including: the Institutional Investor Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), Legal & General Investment Management, AB (global investment-manager with USD464 billion under management); Pax World Management; The Regions20 Coalition; The European Investment Bank; IDBI; India's Export Import Bank; the National Institute of Public Finance & Policy; Deutsche Bank; and Investor Group on Climate Change. The Coalition will help its members to better understand the pipeline of green infrastructure investments; examine barriers to capital flows and propose solutions; shape the capital market instruments needed to ensure capital flows; and also support investors to review asset allocation strategies to make sure they will be able to take advantage of the huge deal flow on the horizon. The Coalition will hold roundtables to find out about and discuss government green investment plans, including specific pipelines being developed by individual agencies such as State energy and rail companies. Major Coalition activities will include mapping of information such as infrastructure deals by governments to identify deal attributes and participating investors; constituting a Climate Finance Aggregation Platform to tap low-cost capital from bond markets; developing Green Bond Markets in countries such as India, Mexico, Turkey, Canada, California and Brazil; and launching of a "Guide for Scaling-up Green Bond Markets for Sustainable Development" for governments. The Coalition will also help countries to develop green investment plans needed to meet their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). FICCI had undertaken few initiatives in the realm of sustainable financing in the run up to COP 21 , such as the "UNEP Conference on Delivering a Sustainable Financial System in India" and a "Conference on Green bonds". By joining the Green Infrastructure Investment Coalition, FICCI has strengthened its support towards the need for bolstering sustainable financing in the country.

The Green Party issued the following news release: The Green Party of the United States has joined Green Parties from other countries represented in G7 in a statement challenging G7 heads of state to take decisive action against climate change when they meet in Schloss Elmau, Germany, on June 4. The statement is appended below, signed by leaders of Green Parties from the G7 countries. U.S. Greens are promoting the goal of 100% renewal energy by 2030. Green candidates have advocated the "Green New Deal," a plan to boost financial security for working people and create millions of new jobs by converting to a green-energy economy ( HYPERLINK http://www.gp.org/GreenNewDeal http://www.gp.org/GreenNewDeal The G7 countries are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The European Union is also represented in the G7. The meeting takes place in advance of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ), November 30 to December 11, 2015 in Paris, France. GREEN LEADERS CALL UPON G7 TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE As G7 leaders meet in Schloss Elmau in Germany this weekend, we, the representatives of Green Parties from participating countries, call upon the global leaders to urgently address the climate challenge with more ambition than they have shown so far, especially in view of the upcoming Paris Climate Summit. In particular, we express five demands that address various dimensions of the global political turnaround that is necessary if the international community wants to avoid catastrophic and unmanageable climate change: We want G7 leaders to shoulder their fair share of the necessary 100 billion US dollars to be used for climate financing from 2020 on. We challenge G7 leaders to build on existing initiatives in order to create an international carbon pricing system that incorporates the true cost of carbon fuel extraction and consumption. We call upon G7 leaders to finally start acting together in order to make good on the G20 pledge from 2009 that agreed to phase out fossil subsidies. Lastly we call upon G7 leaders to acknowledge the carbon bubble risk inherent in fossil fuel investments, and to move forward in support of the global carbon divestment movement. Greens will mobilize internationally and coordinate with multiple allies in order to push the realisation of the above-mentioned goals.

Oct 30, 2015( Foreign Policy Blogs Network: HYPERLINK http://foreignpolicyblogs.com http://foreignpolicyblogs.com HYPERLINK http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/wp-content/uploads/15922212411_db0c89e6bd_k.jpg<nl/>Gearing http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/wp-content/uploads/15922212411_db0c89e6bd_k.jpg<nl/>Gearing up for the COP 21 Well, unbelievable as it may seem, a group of corporations[1], apparently at President Barack Obama's behest, have taken upon themselves to be part of the solution to a problem they are widely seen as being very much a part of. By signing on to the American Business Act of Climate pledge, they are agreeing to variety of green measures designed to slow climate change. Just in time for the Conference of Parties ( COP21 ) in Paris next month.<nl/> In the U.S., any discussion involving climate change tends to deteriorate into an argument between two factions those who feel that climate change is a very real threat to the planet, and those who say it is nothing but a scare tactic. History shows that the former are labeled tree huggers and bleeding heart liberals, and the latter tend to be what's generically called Big Business. However, both sides do agree on one thing climate change conferences are, more often than not, a colossal waste of time.<nl/> With the announcement of the commitment of American business to fight climate change, the COP21 may just prove to be something more than an exercise in futility if the participants are serious about this undertaking. So far, governments, keen to avoid a repeat of the disastrous Copenhagen conference, have largely toed the line of pledging to decrease\~CO2 emissions. Even China and Russia pitched in. On the private sector side however, Exxon Mobil and Chevron , two of the most controversial corporations, were conspicuously absent from the list of companies pledging to act. In fact, 63% of all carbon emissions between 1850 and 2010 were produced by just\~90 companies[2] involved in\~fossil fuels and cement Exxon\~has single-handedly emitted 3.2% of historical carbon emissions.<nl/> Exxon has stated, in effect, that technology alone can handle the problem. A curious statement from a company that historically has denied that there was a problem of any sort, and worked hard to prove it. Evidently Exxon Mobil has\~known about the dangers of carbon emissions[3] from the product they were producing since 1977, but has done nothing about it except to deny, and work in conjunction with tobacco industry warriors in an attempt to cast doubt on the issue. Exxon's reason for not signing the pledge? According to their CEO, they are not going to take the pledge because they don't want to 'fake it'. He may have a point. If this is to be nothing more than image building, why do it? However, as John Kerry pointed out, the onus rests on the oil and gas sector to encourage governments to adopt carbon limits and voluntarily curb emissions. But why would he single out specifically the O...ector, when agriculture is just as polluting? Simple, because most economic activity depends on the way electricity is produced. It's pointless to buy a Tesla if the electricity powering it comes from coal burning.<nl/> Consider aluminum production. Ubiquitous aluminum from beverage containers to the vehicles we drive, it is a large part of our everyday life. Regarded as more eco-friendly[4]\~than steel, the problem arises when we note\~that production requires substantially more electricity. However, depending on where in the world it is being produced, this can\~be\~a non-issue. According to a recent AluWatch[5] study, producing one ton of aluminum emits 16,5 tons of greenhouse gases. However, those numbers are set to drop if the private and public sector join hands to invest in building renewable energy sources. China, the world's number one producer of aluminum relies almost entirely on coal[6] to fire up its smelters, while Norway, Iceland and Russia use hydroelectricity, a much greener way of generating power.<nl/> Energy companies would do well to study the supply chain behind aluminum production, and develop a similar strategy in concert with government working to find a means to shift a good portion of production of oil to the much\~cleaner natural gas[7] or by 'going green[8]', meaning investing in solar, wind or biomass. Should Obama's newfound corporate friends start a trend, legislators and consumers could very well compel other companies to follow suit. Something for COP21 attendees to consider.<nl/> Is the pledge the beginning of something of substance? It is far too early to say, but in order to force industry to toe the line it may be necessary to hit them where it hurts - their bottom lines. Carbon taxes and measurable yardsticks with punitive penalties for failure to meet targets should stay on the table. Admittedly, it is difficult to impose anything resembling a punitive financial penalty on a corporation that can easily buy its way out of any problem. Obama's pledge falls short of this by allowing participants to set their\~own benchmarks on their own timetable[9]. It is simply a promise to do better in the future. But it is a start.<nl/> Or rather, another start - we have witnessed a multitude of efforts in the past - and we would like to think that COP21 will deliver the best possible agreement.<nl/> [ 1]: HYPERLINK https://whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/10/19/fact-sheet-white-house-announces-commitments-american-business-act https://whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/10/19/fact-sheet-white-house-announces-commitments-american-business-act HYPERLINK http://qz.com/150268/a-map-of-the-90-corporations-responsible-for-63-of-carbon-emissions-since-1854/ http://qz.com/150268/a-map-of-the-90-corporations-responsible-for-63-of-carbon-emissions-since-1854/ [ 3]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-exxon-knew-about-climate-change http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-exxon-knew-about-climate-change [ 4]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.matalco.com/about_aluminum.htm http://www.matalco.com/about_aluminum.htm [ 5]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.aluwatch.org http://www.aluwatch.org HYPERLINK http://oilprice.com/Finance/investing-and-trading-reports/Why-Aluminum-Should-Be-On-The-Agenda-In-Paris-Climate-Talks.html http://oilprice.com/Finance/investing-and-trading-reports/Why-Aluminum-Should-Be-On-The-Agenda-In-Paris-Climate-Talks.html HYPERLINK http://www.economist.com/node/21525418 http://www.economist.com/node/21525418 [ 8]: \~ HYPERLINK http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/The-Greenest-Oil-Companies-In-The-World.html http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/The-Greenest-Oil-Companies-In-The-World.html [ 9]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/oct/20/climate-change-white-house-paris-cop21-big-business-intel-johnson-hersheys http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/oct/20/climate-change-white-house-paris- HYPERLINK http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/oct/20/climate-change-white-house-paris-cop21-big-business-intel-johnson-hersheys cop21 -big-business-intel-johnson-hersheys \</doc>

Dec 22, 2015( National Law Review: HYPERLINK http://www.natlawreview.com http://www.natlawreview.com The adoption of the legally-binding Paris Agreement reflects many of the key positions of the Africa Group negotiating at COP 21 on behalf of African countries. That said, African opinions diverge on the Paris Agreement, even within governments, with some observers jubilant[5] while others believe the treaty is too weak[6].<nl/><nl/>As a preliminary matter, it goes without saying that the very achievement of a legally binding treaty is, in itself, momentous, as are the decisions to limit the increase in global warming to a 2\'b0 C increase above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit such an increase to 1.5\'b0 C. The latter target is of particular importance to African countries, given the continent's unique vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. African commentators have expressed concern not at the goals themselves, but about the compliance mechanism for achieving them: countries are not legally bound to achieve the emissions cuts that they outlined in the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) they submitted prior to the COP 21 . (Parties are, however, bound to ratchet up their subsequent Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) every five years.) Article 15 of the Paris Agreement does establish a compliance mechanism, but one that is non-punitive and instead relies on transparency. The decision accompanying the Paris Agreement acknowledges that there is a significant gap between the aggregate expected effect of the INDCs which could limit average global temperature increases to roughly 2.7\'b0 C[7] and the treaty's stated 2\'b0 C limit. Many are concerned that, while the aspiration of limiting warming to 1.5\'b0 C is laudable, the rest of the treaty is insufficient to reach a limit in warming of 2\'b0 C, much less 1.5\'b0 C.<nl/><nl/>Adaptation is also more strongly embedded in the Paris Agreement relative to prior treaties another important achievement for African countries, for which adaptation is a climate change response priority. Article 7 of the Paris Agreement establishes a 'global goal on adaptation[8],' which had previously been proposed and pushed forward by the African Group. The global goal on adaptation aims to strengthen adaptive capacity and climate resilience through international cooperation and the mobilization of support, and should catalyze larger funding flows to adaptation efforts in Africa and elsewhere. The Paris Agreement is relatively vague on this issue for instance, it does not mention agriculture, which the African group had been\~advocating[9] and it does not contain qualitative or quantitative climate finance targets; however, the treaty's associated decision at least sets in motion the process by which such specificity may be determined and achieved.<nl/><nl/>Speaking of finance, developing countries managed to set the much-heralded $100 billion annual commitment from developed countries for climate finance as a floor\~to be ramped up after 2025. This was a key demand from developing country parties, including all African countries, and many of the mitigation and adaptation plans set out in African INDCs are contingent on the level of funding received from developed country parties. However, African commentators have\~noted\~the uncertainty surrounding who will provide these funds, and how. Article 9 of the Paris Agreement refers to the 'mobilization' of climate finance from £ wide variety of sources, instruments and channels,' which means that a significant portion of climate finance may come from the private sector (although Article 9 notes the 'significant role of public funds' in mobilizing climate finance. Some[10]\~African commentators have also deplored the fact that there is no additional financing for 'Loss and Damage' that vulnerable countries will incur due to unavoidable climate change, while\~others[11]\~celebrate that a stand-alone article is devoted to the topic something championed by the Africa Group even if it explicitly rejects notions of liability or compensation.<nl/><nl/>Moreover, new funding mechanisms targeting Africa were also announced in anticipation of the conference or at sideline events. For instance, at the Climate Change and African Solutions summit on December 1, France's President Hollande committed EUR 2 billion to fund renewable energy projects in Africa before 2020. In late November, the World Bank announced its $16 billion\~Africa Climate Business Plan[12]\~to help enhance adaptation measures across Africa. And during the conference, North American and European governments also\~earmarked[13]\~$150 million of funding to support the African Risk Capacity Centre, a specialized African Union agency that focuses on developing insurance models for African countries to manage the risk from natural disasters such as drought.<nl/><nl/>Aside from climate finance, another notable outcome of the Paris Agreement is Article 5's recognition of carbon sinks, especially forests; the treaty encourages parties to support conservation, including the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation mechanism. This provision is important for Africa, given that the continent's forests are major carbon sinks especially the Congo Basin, which has one of the largest forest reserves in the world.<nl/><nl/>Finally, one of the significant successes of developing country negotiating blocs, including the Africa Group, is the preservation of the 'common but differentiated responsibilities' (CBDR) concept. CBDR is explicitly mentioned a few times in the final treaty text, but the notion is also embedded deep in the text. In nearly every aspect, whether it is mitigation, finance, NDCs, or transparency, the treaty distinguishes between developed and developing country responsibilities, with 'least developed countries' and small island developing states often recognized as categories of their own.<nl/><nl/>Regardless of one's position on the outcome of negotiations for African countries, it is well understood that the agreement is 'just' a beginning: the Paris Agreement sets in motion an evolving process, the implementation and revision of which will depend crucially on the political will of the parties to the agreement and a range of other actors. If the Africa Group continues to lead on the parameters of climate action, it will help shape the legacy of the Paris Agreement.<nl/> \£9 2015 Covington ...rling LLP<nl/> [ 1]: HYPERLINK http://www.natlawreview.com/author/adele-faure http://www.natlawreview.com/author/adele-faure [ 2]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.natlawreview.com/organization/covington-burling-llp http://www.natlawreview.com/organization/covington-burling-llp [ 3]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.covafrica.com http://www.covafrica.com HYPERLINK http://www.natlawreview.com/article/africa-s-long-road-to-paris-re-united-nations-framework-convention-climate-change http://www.natlawreview.com/article/africa-s-long-road-to-paris-re-united-nations-framework-convention-climate-change HYPERLINK http://allafrica.com/stories/201512160275.html http://allafrica.com/stories/201512160275.html [ 6]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.zbc.co.zw/news-categories/environment-a-tourism/63571-cop21-climate-agreement-too-weak http://www.zbc.co.zw/news-categories/environment-a-tourism/63571- HYPERLINK cop21 -climate-agreement-too-weak HYPERLINK http://newsroom.unfccc.int/unfccc-newsroom/indc-synthesis-report-press-release/ http://newsroom.unfccc.int/unfccc-newsroom/indc-synthesis-report-press-release/ [ 8]: \~ HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/files/documentation/submissions_from_parties/adp/application/pdf/adp_african_group_workstream_1_adaptation_20131008.pdf https://unfccc.int/files/documentation/submissions_from_parties/adp/application/pdf/adp_african_group_workstream_1_adaptation_20131008.pdf [ 9]: \~ http://www.english.rfi.fr/africa/20151207-Agriculture-neglected-Cop21-negotiation-text-AU-expert http://www.english.rfi.fr/africa/20151207-Agriculture-neglected- HYPERLINK Cop21 -negotiation-text-AU-expert HYPERLINK http://www.senenews.com/2015/12/13/decryptage-du-jour-cop-21-lafrique-quel-bilan_145300.html http://www.senenews.com/2015/12/13/decryptage-du-jour- HYPERLINK cop-21 -lafrique-quel-bilan_145300.html HYPERLINK http://allafrica.com/stories/201512161522.html http://allafrica.com/stories/201512161522.html [ 12]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2015/11/24/world-bank-group-unveils-16-billion-africa-climate-business-plan-to-tackle-urgent-climate-challenges http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2015/11/24/world-bank-group-unveils-16-billion-africa-climate-business-plan-to-tackle-urgent-climate-challenges [ 13]: \~ http://allafrica.com/stories/201512141887.html http://allafrica.com/stories/201512141887.html \</doc>

COP 21 -- The Long Term Infrastructure Investors Association (LTIIA) announced today that it has launched a pilot program to provide research, investment and implementation support to volunteering countries on the investment portion of their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), as well as a structured support system for investment implementation for qualifying countries. Deborah Zurkow, LTIIA Board Member and Head of Infrastructure Debt at Allianz Global Investors made the announcement during the summit. Six initial participating countries, including Senegal as a pilot partner, will engage with private sector investors under the auspices of the LTIIA, with a view to securing new domestic investments related to low carbon and climate change resilient transition. The Association's interactive consultative process will be led by a task force comprised of LTIIA members, who will begin work sessions at COP 21 until the COP 22 to be held in Morocco. The consultation includes joint assessment of the country's investment program attractiveness to long term investors and sharing of relevant best practices, as well as elaboration of recommendations / action plans to enable funding priority and/or pilot projects with the support of the private sector. The Association also announced the publication of its\~Environmental, Social and Governance Handbook for Long Term Investors in Infrastructure.\~Compiled with LTIIA members' contributions and in partnership with UN-PRI, the handbook includes practical summaries of best practices, relevant standards and tools regarding the ESG aspects of long-term investing in infrastructure and also focuses on carbon-related issues covering (i) the integration of risks related to adaptation and mitigation of climate change in investors' due diligence and (ii) the systematic establishment of carbon footprint assessments once investment has been made using a state-of-the art and transparent methodology. This work, undertaken over the past 12 months, underlines the financial community's increasing awareness of the climate change challenges and provides a roadmap for full integration and mainstreaming of these aspects into the investment process. "Experience has shown that a pragmatic approach, focusing on strengthening public sector capacity in a concrete sector can unlock significant amounts of private capital," said LTIIA Chairman and Meridiam CEO Thierry D\'e9au. "Addressing the climate change challenge requires mobilizing significant investments to reduce the carbon intensity of our economies and enable adaptation to climate change. The investment component of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions is critical to ensure their actual implementation. The COP21 in Paris is a unique opportunity to mobilize long-term funding for building a more sustainable world," he added. About the Long Term Infrastructure Investors Association (LTIIA)The LTIIA gathers investors that collectively manage in excess of 5 trillion dollars of assets and that include some of the most active investors globally in the field of long term investment in infrastructure. The Association was founded in Paris in 2014 as a concrete answer to the G20 call for further involvement of institutional investors in the field of infrastructure and held its second annual meeting in Washington DC in September 2015. The Association's three key priorities at the core of its action: (i) ongoing engagement with public stakeholders to support attractive investment frameworks, (ii) definition and sharing of best practices in relation to Environmental, Social and Governance issues and (iii) development of financial performance benchmarks (see HYPERLINK http://www.ltiia.orgfor http://www.ltiia.orgfor To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: HYPERLINK http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cop-21-long-term-infrastructure-investors-association-ltiia-announces-indcs-investment-implementation-task-force-300187706.html http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ HYPERLINK cop-21 -long-term-infrastructure-investors-association-ltiia-announces-indcs-investment-implementation-task-force-300187706.html SOURCE Long Term Infrastructure Investors Association CONTACT: Amy Sloane-Pinel, (336) 944-4342, HYPERLINK mailto:a.sloanepinel@meridiam.com a.sloanepinel@meridiam.com \</doc>

Washington, DC: U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Work has issued the following press release: \~ U.S. Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, released a statement on the pending climate deal being developed at the 21st session of the Conference of Parties ( COP21 ) pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris, France.  EPA and CEQ traveled 3,800 miles to present their roles in the implementation of the president\' s Climate Action Plan and corresponding international commitment yet refused to travel two miles to testify with the State Department before elected representatives of the American people, Inhofe said.  In refusing to testify before a joint subcommittee hearing on the international negotiations and the president\' s Climate Action Plan, EPA asserted \' the agency does not have a witness that can speak to the issues of the hearing.\' Following EPA and CEQ\' s refusal to testify, I requested the agency provide a list of officials who had participated in previous negotiating meetings and who would be attending the COP 21 in Paris. These simple oversight requests went unanswered.\~ It is hard to understand how EPA and CEQ have the expertise to explain their involvement with the president\' s international climate agenda to the United Nations and broader international community when just two months ago, they lacked the ability to do so before Congress.\~ I plan to invite administration officials, once again, to provide testimony before the Senate EPW committee so they can explain their actions to Congress and the American people. Background: On Oct. 13, EPA sent a letter to Inhofe saying a representative from EPA would not be attending the hearing. On Oct. 15, Inhofe sent letters to the State Department, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), requesting participation in a full committee hearing on Oct. 20 to conduct oversight of the Obama administration\' s ongoing international climate negotiations and to examine the role that domestic environmental policies play to the final agreement.\~ However, EPA and CEQ declined to participate.\~ SFRC Democrats objected to a joint hearing, which led to Inhofe\' s decision to proceed as a full EPW committee hearing. Once this change was made, the State Department informed the committee\' s majority office that it could no longer confirm the participation of Todd Stern, special envoy for Climate Change at the State Department, unless EPA or CEQ would also be in attendance as witnesses. EPA and CEQ, to date, have claimed to not have witnesses available who can testify to the subject matter. On Oct. 16, Inhofe sent letters to EPA, White House CEQ, and the State Department requesting a list of respective staff who plan to attend COP21 and a list of staff who have attended international meetings in the past related to the UNFCCC. \~ Chronological Background: On Dec. 9, Inhofe delivered a speech on the Senate floor reiterating that  a legally binding agreement must come before the Senate for consideration. There is no way around it. On Dec. 7, the Heartland Institute, joined by scientists and policy experts, held a conference during COP21 called the Day of Examining the Data in order to demonstrate the opposition to Obama\' s climate plans as well as to expose the true cost of his agenda. U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, participated in the counter conference via video. To view Inhofe\' s remarks, click here and scroll to time stamp 4:32.34. \~ On Dec. 1, Inhofe unveiled a White Paper put together by Senate EPW Committee Majority staff to provide the first comprehensive account of the Senate\' s legislative and oversight efforts during the 114th Congress to set the record straight on the Obama administration\' s misguided climate agenda in the context of historical international agreements and negotiations leading up to the 21st session of the Conference of Parties ( COP21 ) pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris, France from Nov. 30 to Dec. 11, 2015. On Nov. 30, Inhofe had an op-ed published with CNN called,  Beware of Empty Climate Promises. On Nov. 19, Inhofe and Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), introduced a bipartisan resolution expressing the sense of the Senate with regard to any agreement reached at the 21st session of the Conference of Parties pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held this December. The purpose of the resolution is to further inform the international community of the U.S. Senate\' s respective role. On Nov. 19, Inhofe and Barrasso and their colleagues sent a letter to the president encouraging U.S. negotiators to be forthcoming to foreign counterparts of Congress\' s role over the Green Climate Fund and any binding agreement. On Nov. 18, Hofstra University Professor of Law, Julian Ku, testified that the president could not legally bind the United States to make emission reduction targets through a sole executive agreement and that any attempt to suggest otherwise could result in  misleading foreign governments or  violat[ing] the Constitution. \~ Oren Cass, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute highlighted how the UN negotiations ultimately are an attempt to redistribute developed countries cash in the form of  climate finance, which the U.S. congress can  strongly resist. Mr. Stephen Eule, vice president of Climate and Technology at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Institute for 21st Century Energy, revealed that other countries\' INDCs are nothing more than business as usual since developing countries have a much greater interest in  pursing economic growth and poverty eradication than  reducing GHG emissions. On Nov. 17, the U.S. Senate voted to disapprove of President Obama\' s signature legacy regulation on global warming in S.J.Res. 23 and S.J.Res. 24. S.J.Res. 23 was introduced by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), and S.J.Res. 24 was introduced by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). On Nov. 12, Inhofe responded to Sec. John Kerry\' s comments that COP21  will not deliver a \' treaty\' that legally requires countries to cut their carbon emissions.\' \~ In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact:\~ HYPERLINK mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com editorial@plusmediasolutions.com \</doc>

Three and a half thousand miles from Morningside Heights, Columbia professors are on the front lines of the international discussion about climate change policy. Over two dozen Columbia graduate students and professors will attend the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, which started this Monday and will last until Dec. 11. At the conference-known as COP21 -world leaders from almost every nation will gather and attempt to come to a binding agreement to reduce carbon emissions. There, many Columbia faculty members will share their thoughts and research on climate change and proposed policies to address it, in the hopes of achieving a transnational agreement that will keep global warming less than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Michael Gerrard, the head of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said that Columbia research and work may help shape the outcome of the conference. In particular, he said that Columbia has the only "fleshed out" proposal regarding a facility to accommodate migration caused by climate change. Similarly, Gerrard and other Columbia faculty have worked with the Legal Response Initiative, which helps advise developing nations on the legal aspects of potential agreements. "The Sabin Center has become the North American hub," Gerrard said. "It's pro bono assistance to the least developed countries." Other faculty, including former head of the Earth Institute Jeffrey Sachs, will also be at the conference to work with and present their ideas to diplomats and world leaders. Many of these faculty have expressed a cautious optimism toward COP21 . While they believe that the nations will reach an agreement, they are skeptical about the results of such an agreement. For John Mutter, a geophysicist in the department of earth and environmental sciences and the department of international and public affairs, there many promising signs that COP21 is not its predecessor, the Copenhagen Climate Summit. COP15 was widely condemned for its lack of legally binding language and its failure to secure unanimous agreement. Mutter believes that one of the key differences between COP21 and COP15 is cultural, emphasized by Pope Francis' encyclical letter on climate change. "I think the fact that Pope Francis has said the things he has is pretty significant," Mutter said. "I think a lot of people will pay attention to that, and they'll think they're somehow duty-bound to do something." Other professors named additional differences, like China's changed leadership and the perception that climate change cannot be solved unilaterally, as factors that could make COP21 more successful at achieving its goals than COP15. Although Gerrard said that he expects an agreement, he believes that the long-term, delayed nature of global warming could be daunting for reaching consensus and making progress. "One of the devilishly difficult problems is that things that you do-even if they're very expensive-won't yield tangible results on the climate for decades to come," he said. Other potential caveats are the legality of the agreement and how such a deal could be enforced. "I don't think there can be anything legally binding on a multinational basis," Mutter said. "People will sign these things just because they feel like they have to, and then because there's no punishment-if you violate them, there's no incentive to comply." Scott Barrett, a conference attendee, professor of natural resource economics, and vice dean of the School of International and Public Affairs has done research on the subject of the review process for pledges that nations make to reduce carbon emissions. In a recently submitted paper, Barrett reported the results of his model of the role of international peer pressure on a small scale. "What this research shows is that the review process has an effect on what people say, but not what they do," Barrett said. "The idea was that peer pressure was going to cause more and more. Based on this research I've done, it won't, and it certainly won't do enough." In spite of these qualms, Barrett doesn't believe that it's all "smoke and mirrors." "I think there's real sincerity," he said. "There's no debate at this level about the seriousness of the problem."

\~In time for the kick-off of the UN conference on climate change ,Ecoppiahas inked a deal to retrofit a 40 MW PV solar site jointly owned by EDF RE and Arava Power with its autonomous and waterless robotic cleaning solution.\~ The agreement is significant because it lends increasing commercial clout to a technology that is disrupting the solar energy business. Dirt and dust cover (soiling, in industry speak) on solar panels are a significant challenge and can decrease energy output by up to 40%. Existing solutions - oftentimes labourers with water and brushes - can damage panels, use huge amounts of water and be cost-inefficient. Ecoppia provides a solution in the form of autonomous, waterless robots that are managed through the cloud and clean panels every night after production stops. "It's the next step for the solar industry," says Eran Meller, CEO of Ecoppia. "We're seeing significant value creation in all the projects we're currently involved in, both here in the Middle East and in India. For many of the big industry players, a solution that can clean panels nightly, can respond instantly to weather and is waterless - we feel solutions like ours have the potential to become the industry standard." The site is among the largest solar parks in the Middle East and is located in Southern Israel's Arava Valley - next to the Jordanian border and 20 and 60 miles from Egypt and Saudi Arabia, respectively. The cleaning technology is so promising that Meller has been asked by Israel to attend COP21 as part of a special delegation of green technology companies from Israel. "It's very exciting to see the progress Ecoppia is making in terms of winning large clients - it's because of promising technology like theirs that we believe Israel has a bright future in the International Solar Industry and why Ecoppia was chosen to take part in a side event on "Israeli Innovation in response to climate change". This special event which the Government of Israel has organized together with Israel Green Energy Association, is part of the COP21 ,"\~said Ron Adam, the permanent representative of Israel to IRENA (The International Renewable Energy Agency).

As the clock ticks towards the United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ) in Paris in December, African experts, policy-makers and civil society groups plan to come to the negotiation table prepared for a legal approach to avoid mistakes made during formulation of the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol\~is an international\~treaty which extends the 1992\~U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change\~(UNFCCC) that commits countries to reduce\~greenhouse gas\~emissions, based on the premise that global warming\~exists and that man-made\~CO2 emissions\~have caused it. "The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is a legal instrument, and therefore we need legal experts to argue the case for Africa, using available evidence instead of having only scientists and politicians at the negotiation table," according to Dr Oliver C. Ruppel, a professor of law at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. "It is a court case for Africa, and Africa must argue it out, and not keep looking for scientific evidence," Ruppel told an Africa Climate Talks (ACT!) forum on 'Democratising Global Climate Change Governance and Building an African Consensus toward COP 21 and Beyond' last week in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The forum, which was organised by the Climate for Development in Africa (ClimDev-Africa) Programme, was part of the preparatory process for Africa's contribution to COP 21 in Paris. Africa has always based its climate argument on geopolitics and science. However, in Paris, experts say that Africa will have to include a good number of lawyers who will table existing evidence of what climate change has caused, what Africans have done about it, and what they can do given appropriate financial and technological support. "We must stop complaining and look at how much we have done ourselves with and without support, look at our success stories and build a case of what Africa can do instead of shouting for resources," said John Salehe of the Africa Wildlife Foundation. "We need to show evidence of what we can do, then approach the negotiations positively," added Ruppel. Dr Mohammed Gharib Bilal, Vice-President of Tanzania, observed that Africa has suffered under the Kyoto Protocol because there were unforeseen gaps. "Since we are negotiating a new agreement, nobody in Africa will benefit if we make the same mistakes that were made in the Kyoto Protocol negotiations," he told the forum. According to experts, the Kyoto Protocol was formulated in a way that was designed to address mitigation of climate change, rather than adaptation to its impacts. "The agreement also failed to recognise some countries which have since emerged as major greenhouse gas emitters, a fact that has complicated implementation of the agreement's mechanisms," observed Mithika Mwenda, executive secretary of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA). He also noted that the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the protocol was based on markets, and therefore failed completely to address climate change in countries with negligible emissions. Such gaps must be sealed in Paris and a new agreement reached or else the world's sustainable development path will be jeopardised, warned Bilal. Nevertheless, the Tanzanian Vice-President recognised that sometimes Africa expects too much from the developed countries. "We need to change and change has to start from within," he said." The vision has to be crafted from within and we have to go to Paris to champion a narrative and cause that is consistent with our own development aspirations." So far, in response to changing climatic conditions, African countries have proactively put in place climate change policies with tools geared towards mitigating and adapting to their impacts. Some have invested heavily in clean energy, some have adopted climate-smart farming techniques, and others have invested in tree growing. "Africa has lots of capacities but they differ," said John Kioli, chairman of the Kenya Climate Change Working Group. "We need to take stock of what we have, and negotiate for enhancement of what we do not have." ACT! seeks to crystallise a conceptual framework umbrella for Africa's role in the global governance of climate change, and to position climate change as both a constraint on Africa's development potential as well as an opportunity for structural transformation of African economies. The objective is to mobilise the engagement of Africans from all spheres of life in the run-up to the Paris negotiations, increase public awareness of climate change and the roles people can play in the global governance of climate change, and elicit critical reflection on the UNFCCC process among Africans.

Connecticut: University of Connecticut has issued the following news release: \~ Ecology and evolutionary biology major Rob Turnbull \' 16 (CLAS) and marine sciences and maritime studies major Ron Tardiff \' 16 (CLAS) recently traveled with a group of UConn students and professors to Paris for the United Nations Conference of Parties ( COP21 ) climate change summit. The event brought together diplomats, business executives, government leaders, and other delegates from all across the globe to discuss universal legislation on how to address climate change. Here, Turnbull and Tardiff draw on their experiences from the trip to discuss why finding climate change solutions will take insight from an array of disciplines and perspectives. \~ Climate Change: The Ultimate Interdisciplinary Issue Rob Turnbull \' 16 (CLAS), ecology and evolutionary biology major Climate change is the ultimate interdisciplinary issue, and today I learned exactly how many disciplines I understand thoroughly: almost one. Coming from a strict biological science background (I study ecology and evolutionary biology at UConn), I have long considered myself a very literate person in terms of the effects, causes, and opinions surrounding climate science. After a few discussions over breakfast and UConn\' s daily group discussion in the lounge of our hotel, I came to understand that even though I thought I completely got the  science of global warming, I could really only claim to understand the general biological effects of global warming on organisms. Though not entirely foreign to me, the physics and chemistry were far more complex than I anticipated. It took nearly an hour listening to and talking with associate professor of geography Anji Seth, a UConn climatologist, to get a firmer grasp of how solar radiation, heat, the Earth\' s elliptical orbit, albedo, and a slurry of other factors all interact to create our observed climate trends. I entered into an even more foreign discussion with my fellow UConn @ COP21 -ers on the economics of dealing with global warming. While I certainly learned plenty from my peers, my ignorance about these topics highlights a major challenge in dealing with such a broad-reaching issue as climate change: the isolation of many professional disciplines. I wasn\' t the only COP21 -er who had a fish-out-of-water moment today. Among such a diverse group of UConn students \- including scientists, political scientists, economists, and social scientists \- whenever anyone began to talk in depth about their respective field, the others often found themselves having such a conversation for the first time. While it is excellent, in my opinion, for different people to develop different types of expertise, especially given the complexity of global warming, this diversity only becomes a good thing if accompanied by strong communication and collaboration. Otherwise, issues aren\' t resolved in a holistic sense, and accessory problems will persist. While the scientist can unveil the trends to back up climate theories, that scientist needs the economist and the politician to draft viable policy, and the artist to help spread the word. A discussion led by associate professor of geography Anji Seth in the hotel lobby in Paris. (Courtesy of UConn@ COP21 ) A discussion led by associate professor of geography Anji Seth in the hotel lobby in Paris. (Courtesy of UConn@ COP21 ) With this in mind, I was pleasantly surprised to find among the many booths and exhibits at the COP21 This collaboration and others at the COP21 summit have shown me that climate change is the ultimate interdisciplinary issue and can only be resolved through multidisciplinary collaboration on a global scale. UConn and the Climate Conference: Looking Ahead Ron Tardiff \' 16 (CLAS), marine sciences and maritime studies major The 21st Conference of Parties ( COP21 ) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change began in Paris, France on Nov. 30, and at the same time, a group of 18 UConn students, faculty, and staff traveled to Paris for five days to participate in a number of events surrounding the conference. The 12 students selected represented a diverse group of majors, most of which fall within the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, from marine sciences to human rights. For me, the conference was educational and sobering, but also inspired my fellow students and me to take action here at home. Every day in Paris began with a group dialogue focused on the science or politics of climate change and solutions globally and at UConn. The diverse perspectives contributed by our multidisciplinary group of people definitely enhanced our conversations. The group visited the COP21 site in Le Bourget, Paris, and toured the public area of COP21 , the Climate Generations Space. We also attended a networking night at the Kedge Business School co-sponsored by UConn and Second Nature, called  Higher Education Leads on Climate. On Friday, most of the group attended the Solutions COP21 exhibition, while I attended Oceans Day back at COP21 . Oceans Day drew high-level attention to how the ocean and climate are inextricably linked. Among the many esteemed attendees were Prince Albert II of Monaco; Laurent Fabius, Foreign Minister of France and President of COP21 ; and Irina Bokova, the Director General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. As an American, one of the most sobering aspects of the conference and the international climate conversation in general is the skepticism towards U.S. commitment. Historically, particularly on climate change, the United States has failed to be a leader; if anything, we\' ve often stymied the conversation. When I was at Oceans Day, I was asked by a French attendee whether I thought the U.S. would  follow through this time. My only honest answer was that I believe our negotiators are working in good faith, but that the political climate \- pun intended \- at home is pretty unpredictable. What is most interesting to me is that 190 countries convened to address an issue that an unfortunately large number of Americans refute entirely. This demonstrates how critical climate change education is. That is one of the many reasons our group will be advocating for a  sustainability category to be included in General Education Requirements here at UConn. Tackling global climate change epitomizes the types of challenges for which a liberal arts education aims to prepare students. The process of burning fossil fuels and forests and how that affects the climate is a fundamentally scientific issue. Why we continue these destructive processes, how these processes affect human civilization, and what we should do to improve our resilience and adaptation to climate change are intersectional issues spanning fields from science to the social sciences to humanities. Now that we\' re home, our group of  COP21ers will be launching initiatives to improve our University\' s carbon footprint, spearheading climate change conversation at UConn, and creating works of art, writing, or media to highlight the impacts of climate change. And we\' ll be advocating for a greater role of sustainability education in the curriculum at UConn. We\' ll be using the new perspectives we gained from meeting so many people from around the world to help UConn be a leader in this quintessentially global issue. \~ In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: HYPERLINK editorial@plusmediasolutions.com \~\~ \</doc>

Nov 26, 2015( The Third Pole: HYPERLINK http://www.thethirdpole.net http://www.thethirdpole.net United Nations Climate Change Conference  the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 21 ) - will be the expansion of drylands. A recent study published by Lanzhou University in China[1] indicates that climate change will lead to ever-expanding drylands area. If global emissions continue to rise, the study estimated that dryland areas will cover 56% of the world's land surface by 2100.<nl/> A key challenge in this scenario will be adaptation, and therefore the success stories coming out of the deserts of the Indian state of Rajasthan are that much more important. The Thar desert[2] cover 60% of the area of the state (it spills over also into the Punjab and Sindh provinces of Pakistan) and the state faces water scarcity for 9 to 11 months in a year and frequent droughts (1 in 2.5 years). It is in this bleak landscape that women farmers are adopting new farming methods that have helped them deal with the impacts of climate change in the drylands and move out of poverty.<nl/><nl/>Play Video[3]<nl/> These efforts are part of the CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems, where work is underway in three states of India (Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka) to empower farmers and local institutions to build resilient and sustainable farming systems that cope with the vagaries of current and future climate. Women leaders like Mani Devi and Rameshwari [4]from the Derasar village in Rajasthan have pioneered the use of innovations such as the use of improved crop varieties - including pearl millet and other crops suited to the region, the planting of fruit trees to provide nutrition and income, constructing embankments to capture rainfall and prevent runoff and soil erosion, and the planting of grasses and fodder trees to provide fodder for cattle.<nl/><nl/>Play Video[5]<nl/> The planting of new crops is not enough though. The success of the programme hinges on the new institutional arrangements that have been implemented to enable communities to better manage common property resources such as common grazing lands. They have also formed women's self-help groups to weigh and market livestock for higher income. To make this happen, these women farmers worked with a local community organisation, the Gramin Vikas Vigyan Samiti[6] (the village development knowledge committee) and received scientific expertise from the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics[7] (ICRISAT). Funding was provided by the CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems[8].<nl/> 'The strategy takes women's needs into account by working directly with them.

I was honored to join Jean-Louis and Corinne Lepage to speak at the Conference on Youth (COY) that preceded the climate talks to present the Declaration of Rights of Humankind[3] and its importance to youth and future generations. FRENCH VERSION[4]<nl/> COP21 - The birth of humanity<nl/> The memory of the media will keep this joyful scene at Le Bourget when the announcement of the agreement at the COP21 was made. Since then, objections, criticism and analysis of its shortcomings abound. They were inevitable and many are warranted.<nl/> But the most important when it comes to the future of humanity could not be rational. The collective emotion, even fleeting, gave the world images of what has inspired us to come together. In this digital era, we will see these images again and again, so as no to forget that what unites us is ultimately more powerful then what divides us.<nl/> To meet this challenge, a snap of fingers will not be sufficient. It will take decades of effort by activists, governments, scientists, associations, artists and others. But most of all, it will be for each new generation to discover the world in which it lives.<nl/> This moment of unanimity gave existence to humanity, beyond nations, beliefs or interests. We felt for a few minutes how this little flame, nascent, fragile, still wavering, was for us and our children so infinitely precious.<nl/> The emotion of this final between negotiators exhausted and radiant is already listed heritage.\~<nl/> Jean-Louis Servan-Schreiber<nl/> [ 1]: HYPERLINK https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Servan-Schreiber https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Servan-Schreiber [ 2]: \~ HYPERLINK http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09r01.pdf http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/ HYPERLINK cop21 /eng/l09r01.pdf [ 3]: \~ HYPERLINK http://droitshumanite.fr/DU/?lang=en http://droitshumanite.fr/DU/?lang=en HYPERLINK http://adamkoniuszewski.com/2015/12/20/cop21-la-naissance-de-lhumanite/ http://adamkoniuszewski.com/2015/12/20/ HYPERLINK cop21 -la-naissance-de-lhumanite/ \</doc>

Albina, who's from the South Pacific nation of the Marshall Islands, doesn't want her homeland to disappear and her people to become refugees. Deepak in Nepal wants to make sure there's enough food and clean water for everyone. And Julie from France hopes polar bears will stick around for many generations to come. It's easy to think of climate change in broad, far-reaching terms. But these people around the world know it could not only affect the Earth as a whole but have very real consequences for their own communities, whether they're in the South Pacific or central Europe. Island nations could be submerged. A third of species may be at risk for extinction. And all kinds of weather could get more severe. That could all happen if the Earth's temperature increases by just 2 degrees Celsius. So people like Albina, Deepak and Julie want to make sure world leaders attending the U.N. COP21 climate summit in Paris are listening. We asked you to share your biggest worries about climate change for COP21 participants. Among your chief concerns: rising sea levels and increasingly severe storms that could flood coastal and low-lying areas; droughts that could threaten the availability and prices of food and water; and threats to animal populations, endangered species and biodiversity. Watch the video above to see some of the biggest issues you want COP21 leaders to address, and add your own thoughts here. \</doc>

France: Engie has issued the following news release: Group Head of Environmental and Social Responsibility Anne Chassagnette addressed the French National Assembly on March 30, 2016 as part of a roundtable session focusing on the post- COP21 period. ENGIE was invited to contribute as a private-sector stakeholder and comment on proposals for the initiatives that France could support during the year. We highlight the flagship positions adopted by the Group.As a leader in the energy transition, ENGIE has made the fight against global warming one of its priorities for action."ENGIE is delighted at this recognition of the role played by public-sector stakeholders at COP21 , and more specifically (&hellip;) the role played by companies, investors and private citizens (&hellip;). ENGIE is well aware of the role it has to play in combating climate change and has set itself a series of ambitious targets. We are now working to go even further and achieve a 10% reduction in CO2 emissions per kWh generated by 2020(&hellip;). We have also exceeded the goal we set ourselves by increasing our power generation capacity from renewables by 60% between 2009 and 2015, against our original target of 50%," said Anne Chassagnette during her presentation to the National Assembly. ENGIE monitored the COP21 climate negotiations very closely, and has warmly welcomed the directions set in the Paris Agreement, especially the inclusion of a strong generalized carbon price signal as an encouragement to companies to invest in low-carbon technologies. Anne Chassagnette reminded her audience of the strong climate commitments made by ENGIE, which include: The 2015 decision by the Group to halt all new coal-based projects The development of new offers tailored to the issues faced by individual regions The development of new gas solutions, such as biogas and the road and sea transportation of Green Natural Gas (GNG). Aware of its responsibility and the major role it plays in the transition to a low-carbon economy, the Group has identified the actions needed to make the climate agreement targets a reality: Continuing to consolidate the key topics identified at COP21 and keep up the impetus on commitments (working alongside the World Bank, supporting European reforms, etc.) Strengthening initiatives to redirect funding towards investment that will deliver carbon reductions (Green Fund and access methods) Continuing to promote dialog between companies and governments, as is already the case with the Business Dialogue, in order to facilitate the introduction of a framework to encourage the rollout of low-carbon solutions. Encouraging access to energy in developing countries - especially those in Africa - through the development of renewables.

The Church of England issued the following news release: The Church of England's lead bishop on the environment - Rt Rev Nicholas Holtam, the Bishop of Salisbury - has welcomed today's agreement at the UN Climate Change Summit in Paris. After two weeks of talks, participants have committed to hold the increase in global temperatures to 'well below' 2-degrees above pre-industrial levels, alongside clear rules on transparency and reviews of carbon emissions every five years. Speaking about the COP21 agreement, Bishop Nick Holtam, said: "It is good to have an ambitious agreement about the aspiration. What matters now is that governments actually deliver a low carbon future - the transparency of accountability and process of review will be what ensures that happens. This looks like real progress - there is now a much more positive spirit about what now needs to happen than after Copenhagen six years ago, but we are still at an early stage on the journey." In the run up to the talks, the Church of England organised the Pilgrimage2Paris, with pilgrims walking 200 miles from London to Paris to call on COP21 to reach a fair, ambitious and binding climate deal. This culminated with Bishop Nick Holtam meeting President Hollande to present climate justice petitions signed by almost two million people ahead of the final agreement at the United Nations Climate Change talks in Paris - COP21 . "It was a privilege to meet President Hollande on behalf of the 1.8 million people from faith communities who had signed petitions calling for climate justice. Supporting our politicians and diplomats to make difficult decisions has been an important part of the COP21 process, and we will continue to pray for them."

The following information was released by the United Nations: Just days away from the kick-off of the 21st United Nations climate change conference widely known as COP21 the UN is reminding its main actors that this conference must be a turning point for climate action. Beginning on Monday in France's capital, Paris, world leaders will be negotiating a new climate change agreement that aims to keep global average temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) beyond which climate experts say there will be irreversible impacts. The two-week conference, the 21st Meeting of the States Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), also aims to send a loud and clear signal to citizens, markets and the private sector that the transformation of the global economy is inevitable, beneficial, and already under way. To find out more about COP21 and the UN's expectations, the UN News Centre met with Janos Pasztor, the UN Assistant Secretary-General on Climate Change. Since January, Mr. Pasztor's work has focused on supporting efforts towards a new climate agreement and mobilizing global climate action on the ground. Climate change affects us all, but our actions affect climate change. UN News Centre: What is the importance of the upcoming 21st United Nations climate change conference COP21 ? Janos Pazstor: There are at least two major points. First of all, if we have a good agreement it will allow us to move towards a low-carbon, low-emission future, where there are lots of opportunities for new technology developments and new ways of organizing ourselves. That is an opportunity we must take. Secondly, climate change is already happening. The impacts are already visible. If we take action now, we can address climate change as we move toward a low-emission economy and build a sustainable future. The more we delay, the more we will pay. UN News Centre: Why do we need to keep the global average temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius? Janos Pazstor: If we allow warming to go beyond that, scientists tell us there are likely to be potential irreversible impacts on people, on natural ecosystems, and therefore, on the economies of the world. Now the 2 degrees is not a very hard level. Many are saying that it actually has to be much less than 2 degrees for the small island developing countries whose land might become completely inundating with a sea level rise. Already 2 degrees is way too much. So, it must be remembered that when we talk of 2 degrees, it is the maximum. It must be kept as much as possible below that. 10 Things You Need to Know About COP21 . Credit: United Nations UN News Centre: What is the best outcome possible from COP21 ? Janos Pazstor: We are expecting a package of outcomes and it will have four elements they're interrelated but they're different. The first one will be the national plans for climate change of each country, for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Those are plans that are developed "bottom up" by the countries this is what they can do. The third part is climate finance. All of this will require financing, public and private finance, and there will be some parts of this package of finance that will go into the agreement. And the fourth is the action agenda a collection of actions on the ground to do either mitigation or adaption, and it's to demonstrate that it's already possible, it's already happening and to showcase what are the good partnerships between private sector, public sector and civil society to actually do the work on the ground. UN News Centre: What are the main challenges ahead? Janos Pazstor: The main challenge ahead is to negotiate the agreement. That's the bottom line. And we have very little time. In fact, the last negotiation week finished recently in Bonn [Germany]. What we now have left in terms of formal negotiation time is only that period during the actual Conference of the Parties [COP] in Paris, the first two weeks of December. UN News Centre: Can you give us an overview of key issues that are left to be negotiated what different countries are claiming? Janos Pazstor: There are quite a few of those and the most important one seems to be related to what is referred to as the differentiation the differentiation between the developed and developing countries. Some countries would like no formal differentiation and they would like all rules to apply to everybody, every country, with maybe a certain flexibility to reflect the capacities of different countries. Interview with Janos Pasztor, UN Assistant Secretary-General on Climate Change. Credit: United Nations Other countries would like to maintain the existing grouping of countries in the Convention to developed and developing countries, and then have rules that refer to these different groups. So that's quite important because it has implications, not just on the conceptual issue of having divisions like that, but in terms of financing. But there are other challenges such as climate finance. Developed countries have committed to providing $100 billion dollars per year by 2020 to developing countries. The $100 billion doesn't have to be on the table in Paris, but what does need to be on the table is a politically credible mobilization trajectory towards this $100 billion. Some progress was made in October, but there is still work to do and there are still announcements that hopefully will be made by some countries. So these are just two examples of difficult issues that still need to be resolved but there are others as well. UN News Centre: You mentioned the last round of negotiations in Bonn. What came out of those discussions? Janos Pazstor: What we have is a document that has grown in size. While the actual size doesn't matter what matters is the content clearly the longer the text, the more time it takes to negotiate and that's our biggest challenge. The text is some 55 pages long and it will take some time to go through the different elements. What we ended up with at the Bonn negotiation is that countries added into the original draft which was much shorter specific things that they wanted to see in the final text and there wasn't enough time to negotiate all that in Bonn. So we still have lots of options in there and those will still need to be negotiated both in informal discussions and during COP21 . COP21 in light of the new 2030 Development Agenda, and how predominantly does climate change figure in it? Janos Pazstor: The new Sustainable Development Agendaor Agenda 2030 is extremely important for the implementation of the climate agreement. First, we have a goal Goal 13 which focuses on climate change. But what the other goals are even more important. There are 12 goals [out of 17] that have very specific climate related targets on energy, on forests, on food security, on education these are all things that will feed into successfully implementing the climate agreement. The main challenge ahead is to negotiate the agreement. But what is really important is that if we don't achieve the 2 degree objective, then none of the Sustainable Development Goals can be achieved. And in order to achieve the less than 2 degree objective, we need to do all the things that are in the Sustainable Development Goals. That's the challenge but that is the beauty: these two different processes that are negotiated through separate processes are now coming together at the level of implementation. And this is where the UN system has a very important role also, because we are there to support Member States to help them to address these issues in a coherent and integrated way. UN News Centre: Just days ahead of COP21 , what is your message to world leaders? Janos Pazstor: World leaders have a very important role in guiding their ministers and negotiators on the broad economic implications of climate change and actions about climate change. So their role for the negotiations is very important. If they don't give clear guidance to the negotiators then they don't know what to agree upon. So that is why the UN Secretary-General has been much engaged with Heads of States and Governments so that they own this process and clearly guide their ministers and their negotiators. UN News Centre: What do you want to convey to the public? Janos Pazstor: Climate change affects us all, but our actions affect climate change all of us. We are all responsible for what we do in our daily lives how we vote, how we engage, how we run our companies, how we run our civil society organizations. We all need to be conscious of this, and we all need to do our part. \</doc>

World leaders convened this week for the COP21 climate change summit, which aims to create a universal, binding agreement among the constituent nations to address global warming. Attendees included U.S. President Barack Obama, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chinese President Xi Jinping - and USC alumna Harleen Marwah. From Nov. 30 to Dec. 9, Marwah is set to lead a series of discussions titled "Desserts for the Decades" at COP21 , the United Nation's 21st Conference of Parties. COP21 , which is taking place in Paris this year, aims to build a "Paris Climate Alliance" designed to keep the average global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius. "[Desserts for the Decades] aims to be a space where we can foster the collaborative spirit needed to reach a successful agreement out of these meetings," she said. "The conversation structure offers an opportunity for people across generations, cultures and interests to come together and realize their common ground." Marwah, a Washington D.C. native who graduated from USC in 2015, is the youth liaison for the Sea Trust Institute at COP21 . Marwah's work focuses on engaging younger generations in issues such as agriculture and food safety, indigenous people, climate change and intergenerational equity. For Marwah, climate change is more than a changing scientific environment - it's a far-reaching issue that will permeate all aspects of life. "The impact of climate change will extend into issues of political stability, growing poverty, access to clean water, food safety and more," she said. From Marwah's perspective, any significant change must come from a local effort. Due to a lack of physical boundaries when it comes to climate change, she believes that any resolution must be dynamic and accessible across cultures and communities. Marwah's journey at COP began when she was still an undergraduate student working toward attaining both a bachelor of science in health promotion and disease prevention and master of science in global medicine. She attended COP20 in Peru with SustainUS, a youth-led organization which advocates for justice and sustainability. Marwah is trying to make the most of every moment at COP21 . "Hearing from 147 world leaders at the conference's opening, including Secretary General Ban-Ki-Moon and U.S. President Barack Obama was undoubtedly a phenomenal and inspiring experience," Marwah said. "There is an unbelievable energy pulsing through the COP21 - people from across the globe communicating and collaborating to quite literally do their part in saving the world." Marwah credited USC for playing a role in who she is today. "My USC education inspired me to 'think globally and act locally,'" she said. "So my advice to USC students is to cherish every moment and seize every opportunity. You have countless resources at your fingertips and should definitely make an effort to utilize as many as you can." Marwah said her journey in climate change advocacy began at USC one afternoon when her WRIT 340 class was canceled. "Instead of going home to binge-watch Netflix, I was persuaded to attend a guest lecture," she said. "At the lecture, I learned about the public health relationship with climate change. The next week, I was applying to go to Peru for the UN COP20. You never know what you might become passionate about. I encourage you to engage in these opportunities while you can. Your time at USC truly does fly by." \</doc>

subscriber-premium"> In late 2015, a number of the United Nations' most prominent environmental and government leaders came together for the 21st United Nations Conference of the Parties on Climate Change (otherwise known as COP21 ). This event focused on addressing the problems surrounding climate change through research, studies and discussions. Theprimary goal of COP21 was to keep global warming under an increase of 2 degrees Celsius (35.6 degrees Fahrenheit). When it comes to talking about global warming and how to best address it, it makes sense to look at the prime offenders. From there, progress can be made to alter negative outcomes. While COP21 put plans in place to tackle some of the major threats to our environment, it failed on at least one important front. On the positive side, the conference addressed the problem of carbon dioxide as well as five other greenhouse gasses. This chief greenhouse gas is produced by human activities. Carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of fossil fuelscause destruction to the ozone layer and play a major role in trapping heat in our atmosphere. Although it's been the subject of much criticism, we can take encouragement from the fact that the196 participating countries made promises to limit future greenhouse gas emissions. Logical steps for this include curbing reliance on fossil fuels by tightening regulations and investing in research on renewable energy sources. However, with regard to addressing the next most prominent greenhouse gas, COP21 fell very short. Methane is also a major perpetrator of environmental damage. Next to fossil fuel production, animal agriculture is thesecond largest emitter of methane gas. Livestock animals such as cows, sheep and goats have digestive systems that undergo enteric fermentation -the result of this process is the release of copious amounts of methane gas and a significant contribution to climate change. As in the case of carbon dioxide, one would expect to see COP21 address the sources of the problem. Disappointingly, the connection among animal agribusiness, methane and climate change wasmentioned only once at the conference. The lack of discussion about the effects of animal agriculture on our environment is worrisome. If the world's leaders and climate experts won't speak to this problem, who will? In the European Union, approximately 8.3 billion animals are consumed each year for food, while in the U.S.,that number rises to 10 billion animals. This is a startling comparison to the approximate 320 million people in our country. Greenhouse gases aside, producing meat requires massive amounts of our other valuable resources. To generate about two pounds of beef,free-range cattle individually consume at least 265 pounds of forage and 31,700 gallons of water are required. This doesn't even take into account the fossil fuels to maintain the factory farms and machinery to process the animals, excessive amounts of land and forests cleared for growing feed or the vehicle emissions from the transport of these billions of animals to the millions of people all across the U.S. Thankfully, steps can be taken to help improve this. With additional education on both the environmental impact of our consumption and thehealth benefits of a more vegetarian or a reduced-meat diet, we have the ability to contribute to less suffering for so many animals. Last year, as a result of increased education,400 million fewer animals were killed for food. Although the topic of animal agriculture might not have come up enough in Paris, we can make the choice to raise awareness and bring positive environmental change with how we pick our plate every day.

Terrebonne: Electric Energy Quebec has issued the following release news: The Renewables Academy AG (RENAC) starts the capacity building programme "Green Banking" to enhance investment opportunities in the renewable energy and energy efficiency markets in India, Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia The Renewables Academy AG (RENAC), based in Berlin (Germany), in cooperation with the Association of Development Financing Institutions in Asia & Pacific (ADFIAP) have started the three-year programme "Green Banking - Capacity Building for Development and Commercial Banks on Climate Finance". "Green Banking" aims at increasing the availability of financing instruments for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in the five partner countries. The project is part of the International Climate Initiative (ICI) with the support of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB). Through the "Green Banking" trainings, professionals from private and public institutions involved or interested in financing green energy projects will gain specific knowledge in technologies, financial schemes, risk evaluation, mitigation measures and access to international Climate Funds. The agreement signed in Paris during the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) is proof of the key role renewable energy and energy efficiency play in the international climate change mitigation efforts. While the green markets keep gaining momentum, India, Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia enjoy the necessary natural resources for the widespread implementation of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. Local professionals with the appropriate know-how will be able to profit from new business opportunities in a growing industry, which additionally presents manifold benefits (reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, energy security and job creation, among many others). "Green Banking" will start with a Capacity Needs Assessment in all partner countries in order to develop the most appropriate tailor-made contents for each region. Further activities will include Business-to-Business (B2B) meetings in Germany, a Train-the-Trainer seminar at RENAC's Training Centre in Berlin to build up local trainers, trainings in the partner countries, internet-based trainings, and the launching of the new degree "Green Finance Specialist" RENAC, based in Berlin, Germany, is a leading international provider for training and capacity building in renewable energy and energy efficiency.

The following information was released by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce: Stephen Eule, vice president for climate and technology at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Institute for 21st Century Energy, today issued the following statement regarding the climate change agreement reached today in Paris: "The Paris climate conference delivered more of the samelots of promises and lots of issues still left unresolved. While we are reviewing the final agreement, it's clear that implementation still faces the same obstacles that we've been warning about for years. None of the commitments made, including those by the U.S., are binding, and many aren't even complete. Moreover, Congress must appropriate any funds that the Obama administration has pledged. "The White House's overall domestic strategy of making energy more expensive and less abundant to satisfy international constituencies, many of whom compete against the United States, should worry the business community, American workers, and consumers. We will continue our efforts to understand how this deal affects the U.S. jobs and growth." Please visit the Energy Institute's COP 21 page for information and analysis from the business community's perspective on the climate negotiations. The mission of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Institute for 21st Century Energy is to unify policymakers, regulators, business leaders, and the American public behind a common sense energy strategy to help keep America secure, prosperous, and clean. Through policy development, education, and advocacy, the Institute is building support for meaningful action at the local, state, national, and international levels.

Albany: Anglican Communion has issued the following news release: The United Nations climate change conference - Cop21 - begins next week in Paris, and there will be a large Anglican and ecumenical presence at the two-week event to lobby for a fair deal for the world\' s poorest people - those most affected by catastrophic changes in the world\' s climate. Security concerns following the terrorist attacks in the French capital earlier this month have meant that a planned march through the city by up to 200,000 people has been cancelled. But a number of events will still take place, including the handing over of a one-million-strong petition and an ecumenical service at Notre Dame Cathedral. The Anglican presence will be headed by two primates: Archbishop Thabo Makgoba from the Anglican Church of Southern Africa; and Archbishop Fred Hiltz, Archbishop of the Anglican Church of Canada. Two of the  resident Anglican bishops in Europe - the Church of England\' s David Hamid and the Episcopal Church\' s Pierre Whalon will also be there; as well as the C of E\' s lead bishop for the environment, Bishop of Salisbury Nicholas Holtam; and the Bishop of Dudley, Graham Usher; as well as the Episcopal Church\' s Bishop of California, Marc Andrus. The Church of England, working with Cafod, Tearfund and Christian Aid, has organised a Pilgrimage to Paris walk from London. Pilgrims taking part are praying for the talks and drawing attention to the urgent need for an international agreement for tackling climate change. Similar pilgrimages are taking place throughout Europe. And the British and Irish churches\' aid agency Christian Aid is organising a cycle-ride to Paris. Christians around the world are encouraged to play their part by praying for the talks and by or taking part in local marches for climate justice. The environmental co-ordinator for the Anglican Church of Southern Africa, the Revd Dr Rachel Mash, has outlined some of the resources available in a comment piece published today by ACNS. The Anglican Communion News Service will report on the talks and the Anglican participation in them over the next few weeks here at anglicannews.org.

Dec 02, 2015( APO (African Press Organization): HYPERLINK http://appablog.wordpress.com COP 21 in Paris. Speaking at the high level opening, President Yayi Boni of Benin, was resolute that the Africa is not at the negotiating table with a begging bowl.<nl/> <nl/>He told the audience at the Africa high level event marking the launch of the Africa Pavilion that 'Africa did not come here ( COP21 ) to beg for money or assistance but to bring about commitment of all concerned to Africa's adaptation needs'<nl/><nl/>'The adaptation and mitigation needs of the continent are not aid' President Boni said, but an equity issue because climate change is a global phenomenon not caused by Africa. 'The time to act is now' he said 'the house is burning.'<nl/><nl/>In Africa, climate change constitutes a major threat to the continent's development, and has major implications and impacts on African economies. Climate extremes such as drought, flooding, heat waves and tropical cyclones are intensifying in frequency and intensity. Rising sea levels will threaten Africa's large coastal population with agriculture, tourism, cities, water levels, health, energy and fisheries all likely to be impacted by the adverse impacts of climate change. COP 21 marks a decisive stage in negotiations of the future international agreement on climate change.<nl/><nl/>The high level panel at the official opening constituted the African Heads of State and Government, African Parliamentarians and the principals of the four pan-African institutions namely: the African Union Commission, (AUC); the African Development Bank, (AfDB); the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency (NPCA); and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA).<nl/><nl/>'Africa's message for this Summit is clear: we need a legally binding agreement with a global governance framework, applicable to all parties that balances the issues of adaptation, mitigation, provide adequate finance as well as technology development and transfer. The new Agreement must commit to reduction of greenhouse emissions to achieve well below 2 degree Celsius, ensure the principle of common but differentiated responsibility, social justice, equity and African must speak with one unified voice', African Union Commission Chairperson, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urged the high level dignitaries.<nl/><nl/>The Chairperson also noted the fact that Africa's commitment to define African development path for the next 50 years in Agenda 2063: The Africa we Want as a sustainable and low carbon path. 'Through Agenda 2063 we want to ensure not only that we mitigate and adapt to climate change, but also do so in a manner that build African capacities, researches, institutions and most importantly - whether it is in agriculture and agro-processing or in renewable energy - to ensure that these initiatives contribute towards development on the continent, creating the much needed livelihoods and jobs for our young people and women', she emphasized. (The complete speech of the Chairperson is available on HYPERLINK http://www.au.int www.au.int .<nl/><nl/>Mr. Adesina Akinwumi, President of the African Development Bankstressed that ' COP21 can only be considered successful if it meets the needs of our continent. Africa is the continent suffering the most from the scotching heat from rising temperatures and droughts have become more frequent and with greater intensity than ever before. Africa needs more money for adaptation. The continent has been short changed by climate change. But we must ensure that it is not short changed by climate finance. AfDB will triple its climate finance to $5 billion a year by 2020.'<nl/><nl/>While the CEO of the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency (NPCA), Dr. Ibrahim Assane Mayaki, commended the collaborative approach of the four institutions for providing leadership in setting up the Africa Pavilion. The institutions should continue to work together in promoting Africa's socio-economic development.<nl/><nl/>He emphasized that 'Africa must continue to advocate for an agreement that reaffirms the obligations of developed country Parties for the provision of climate finance which is additional, predictable and sustainable, with the agreement providing for a continuous assessment of scale of funding needed compared to climate finance available, particularly from public sources, and include a clear burden-sharing process for calculating the contributions to be made by developed country parties'.<nl/><nl/>In Africa, renewable energy systems offer an unprecedented opportunity to accelerate the transition to modern energy services and to increase energy access. This has a ripple effect on job creation, women empowerment and economic development.<nl/><nl/>This was reinforced by Mr. Carlos Lopes, the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) who said Africa is well endowed with all forms of renewable energy resources  hydropower, solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and even marine energy. 'Yet, today we are in a situation where the total installed electricity capacity in Africa is only about 160 gigawatts. By comparison, this is just over half of Japan's installed capacity. If we take out North Africa and South Africa, the installed capacity in the rest of Africa is less than that of South Africa. Given the abundant renewable energy resources of Africa, the energy mix of the continent is still dominated by fossil fuels (gas, coal and oil), with renewables making only 22% of the installed capacity, dominated by hydropower.'<nl/><nl/>During the event, the African Renewable Energy Initiative, a transformative, Africa-owned and Africa-led inclusive effort to accelerate and scale up the harnessing of the continent's huge renewable energy potential was presented by Dr. Khaled Al Fahmy, Minister of Environment of Egypt and President of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN).<nl/><nl/>Under the mandate of the African Union, and endorsed by the Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC), the Initiative is set to achieve at least10 GWof new and additional renewable energy generation capacity by 2020, and mobilize the African potential to generate at least300 GWby 2030.<nl/> \</doc>

Apr 28, 2016( Xconomy: http://www.xconomy.com http://www.xconomy.com COP21 . The Breakthrough Energy Coalition[2], announced on the eve of COP21 , will funnel investment into the cleantech economy and shares the Element 8 dual mission of accelerating the transition to a cleaner, more sustainable world, while seeking a profit on those investments. The coalition is a $1 billion fund backed by leading philanthropists, entrepreneurs and CEOs of top US and global companies, with the goal of expanding clean energy investment and deployment. It was joined by the announcement of the Mission Innovation initiative[3], in which the U.S. was joined by 17 other countries-including China with a commitment to double government spending on clean energy research in the next five years. Also announced in concert with the event was the partnership between the Compact of Mayors[4], a global coalition of nearly 400 mayors committed to reduce local greenhouse gas emissions, and the Covenant of Mayors[5], an initiative of several thousand local governments in the European Union committed to addressing climate change in their territories. The Breakthrough Energy Coalition and increased support from federal and local governments are key steps in addressing climate change and reflect what we've seen in nearly a decade of angel investing in cleantech companies. Perhaps most encouraging in the U.S. was a series of environment and climate-related bills that passed in a bitterly divided Congress in the wake of COP21 : the extension of tax credits for the wind and solar industry; the reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund supporting conservation efforts; and even a reform of the Toxic Substance Control Act (albeit still in bicameral negotiations to iron out the differences in legislation passed by the two chambers). The tax credit extensions, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance[6], will support the addition of 20 gigawatts of solar power (which is more than every panel ever installed in the U.S.), while the wind credit will help contribute another 19 gigawatts of new generating capacity over five years. 'Combined, the extensions will spur more than $73 billion of investment and supply enough electricity to power 8 million U.S. homes,' wrote Tom Randall of Bloomberg BusinessWeek. The deal reached in Paris, and last Friday's signing, represent major strides in pledged emissions reductions globally. But the responsibility now lies with each and every country, state, and city, along with every company, university, research lab, and individual to act in order to make good on those pledges. Even if all of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (climate reduction targets set by individual nations) were enforced and commitment levels reached, it wouldn't be enough to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. This emphasizes the importance of the deals made along the sidelines of COP21 and domestic efforts such as the measures passed through Congress: climate change needs to be attacked from all angles. These sideline deals also have a tangential, but from our perspective equally important impact: They are key steps towards correcting the existing structural incentives that subsidize unsustainable practices. Current structures in fact artificially hold back novel technologies in energy, waste, water, and agriculture. Incentives lead to innovation, which leads to job creation and subsequently growth. Signs post- COP21 point to the dawn of an era with corrected and renewed incentives, sparking sustainable growth. If we have a complaint about COP21 , it is that its singular focus on energy left a great number of other issues unaddressed. For instance, in part because of climate change, we face a looming water crisis globally, and by extension a looming food crisis. At Element 8 we believe that cleantech investments should transcend energy technology. In fact, we renamed our organization from Northwest Energy Angels to reflect the importance of sustainability beyond energy. Since inception, we've poured more than $20 million into 57 companies that are at the forefront of developing a broad range of technologies, products, and business models to help meet the sustainability challenges we face. From drought-resistant agricultural technologies, to water purification and treatment methods, to low-carbon chemicals and polymers, to less resource-intensive batteries, non-toxic chemicals and products, we peek around corners at solutions that do far more than simply mitigate temperature increases. They hold the promise to increase the health of the planet, and all of us who live on it. So, several months after nearly 200 fellow countries stepped up to the plate, we are watching private investors following suit and local and regional governments across the globe making their contributions. This momentum is noteworthy we would even be so bold as to say exciting but all parties must keep their noses to the grindstone to effect the groundbreaking changes necessary to pivot the global trajectory.

University students across the nation are attempting to create a national movement for climate health through Climate Reality's Know Tomorrow Campaign. Colorado State University\~is a critical school for President Barack Obama to hear from before\~heading to Paris to discuss climate change at the\~2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference \~in December, according to the Climate Reality Project. One of the main goals\~of this campaign is to increase visibility of the issue and make student voices heard, especially in preparation of the world's first substantive climate agreement in history, which will take place at the conference. "Know Tomorrow could empower students to stand up and speak out against the profound injustice that is climate change while also supporting students in further developing leadership skills that allow them to effectively communicate with their community and organize them around important issues," said Marissa Bramlett, a Climate Reality Project participant and activist at CSU. Countries are required to come to the table in Paris with plans of how they will domestically cut greenhouse gas emissions, according to Bramlett. The United States' goal is to cut 32 percent of its emissions, mostly through coal, by 2030 through the Clean Power Act. Many fossil fuel companies have attempted to gut the Clean Power Act and even halt negotiations in Paris, inspiring\~students across the nation and at CSU to take action, according to Bramlett. "If COP21 CSU could become a leader in the movement, according to Jacob Kimiecik, president of the Student Sustainability Center. "Because (CSU has)\~had so much success recently in the realm of sustainability," Kimiecik said. "CSU students could provide a powerful voice urging climate action on the national stage." The group has many volunteer opportunities available and hopes to see significant student involvement. "We need everyone\~at CSU to get involved," Bramlett said.\~ Collegian Reporter Maddie Stachniak can be reached online at HYPERLINK mailto:news@collegian.com news@collegian.com \</doc>

The following information was released by the Socialist International: Meeting of the Council of the Socialist International Luanda, 27-28 November 2015 Declaration on climate change and COP 21 COP21 Summit at the Council meeting of the Socialist International in Luanda, delegates recognised the growing acknowledgement of climate change as the single greatest threat to the future of humanity, and the need for urgent and meaningful action from all the nations of the world. The Paris Summit may well be the last opportunity to avert a global catastrophe and the Council outlined the vision of the Socialist International for a universal binding agreement, common commitments, differentiated demands and precise objectives, calling for: More ambitious emissions targets to restrict global temperature rise to 2C; An outcome centred on climate justice; Financing for the Green Climate Fund to 2020 and beyond; Extra assistance for adaptation measures in countries already suffering the effects of climate change; An end to fossil fuel subsidies; Concerted action to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation; Initiatives in favour of more efficient agriculture and responsible consumption; The introduction of a global carbon tax; A climate agreement in harmony with the Global Goals; Robust measurement, reporting and verification of progress towards emissions reduction targets. The Socialist International, its member parties and Council delegates to take concrete actions to reduce their own environmental impact. Representatives of SI member parties to take the lead in Paris. 1. Current commitments are not enough The UN has received emissions targets in the form of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) from countries responsible for more than 90 per cent of global emissions, which indicates a willingness from the majority of nations and governments to work towards a global agreement in Paris. However, the pledges made are only enough to limit the global rise in temperature to 2.7 to 3C, a level far in excess of the goal of 2C set out in the Copenhagen agreement. Ambition needs to be raised, and any agreement in Paris needs at a minimum to include mechanisms for the upward revision of emissions targets if we are to have any chance of meeting the 2C target for global temperature rise. This means the establishment of a five-yearly cycle under which countries have an obligation to ratchet up their commitments, making progressively tighter emissions reductions. Countries need to supplement their commitments by developing and adopting Deep Decarbonization Pathways (DDP) in order to guarantee a zero carbon future for the planet. 2. Climate justice and common but differentiated responsibilities The principle of climate justice originates within our movement and has always been at the heart of our climate policy. The SI continues to support the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, in recognition of the duty of developed countries to do more and go further in their commitments as a result of their historical responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions. 3. Financing and the Green Climate Fund One potential obstacle to ambitions targets is the issue of finance. The Green Climate Fund (GCF), which sets aside finances for climate change mitigation and adaptation, is therefore a crucial plank of any climate agreement. Though important steps have been taken to secure initial funding for the GCF, the total pledged is nowhere near enough and the agreements reached in Lima at COP20 do not set out a clear time frame for the scaling up of funds. The gap between the amount currently pledged and the $100 billion per year promised after 2020 needs to be bridged. The lack of a clear pathway has been interpreted by some developing country partners as a sign of a lack of commitment to the GCF by Annex I parties. Without significant progress, the negotiations in Paris will take place in an atmosphere of mistrust from those countries that will be depending on the fund in the years to come. An agreement on where the funding will come from post-2020 is therefore indispensable for an agreement with the necessary level of ambition. 4. Extra help for adaptation where it is already needed It is important to recognise that the effects of climate change are already being felt in many countries, and disproportionately so in the world's least developed economies. It is therefore necessary to ensure that adequate funding is given not only to climate mitigation, but also adaptation. The regrettable need to invest in costly measures to mitigate against the effects of climate change in vulnerable areas should serve as a wake-up call that failure to act now, while there remains a chance to avert extreme climate change, will prove much more costly in the long-term. 5. End fossil fuel subsidies If goals to reduce carbon emissions are to be met, it is imperative that our dependence on fossil fuels is ended. For this to be achieved, it will be necessary to begin the process of systematically abolishing all fossil fuel subsidies, which encourage over consumption of energy and are a great obstacle to progress. This needs to be a carefully managed process, implemented in such as way as not to harm development. The objective should be to replace fossil fuel subsidies with clean energy subsidies, through investments in the green economy that will provide long-term benefits both economically and environmentally. 6. Reduce emissions from forestry (REDD+) The agreement reached at COP21 must bring about reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors, including deforestation and forest degradation, which account for nearly 20 per cent of the global total. We reiterate our support for the REDD+ mechanism, which aims to create a financial value for the carbon stored in forests, and offer incentives for developing countries to reduce emissions from forested lands through investment in low-carbon paths to achieve more sustainable development. REDD+ further includes the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks. 7. Reduce emissions from agriculture Reducing emissions from agriculture has a significant environmental benefit, as the sector is directly responsible for more than 10 per cent of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions reduction measures can also improve efficiency, which reduces costs and saves money. Work also needs to be done on public awareness of the importance of emissions from the production of the food we eat, in order that consumers are able to make better and more environmentally sound choices. 8. A global carbon tax A global tax on carbon would encourage governments, businesses and citizens to reduce their reliance on carbon emitting resources. The proceeds of such a tax could be used to enormous benefit, for reducing the cost of energy from alternative sources, financing climate change mitigation and adaptation measure and promoting sustainable development as a route to ending poverty. Creating a relationship between the carbon cost of the food we eat and its monetary cost would also be an effective tool to encourage the switch to a more environmentally sustainable diet. 9. An outcome that reflects the Global Goals Our vision of a sustainable future equally includes the pursuit of the Global Goals, which were agreed at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit in New York in September. Achievement of goals on eradicating poverty, reducing inequality, achieving gender equality and building a more secure world go hand in hand with a willingness to tackle climate change, which can exacerbate many of the difficulties faced in the developing world. 10. Measurement, reporting and verification Previous attempts to reach an agreement have met difficulties in part because of a lack of confidence that countries are sincere in their commitments to reduce emissions. For this reason a robust system of measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) is needed, Where developing economy nations lack the capability to effectively and accurately measure their emissions, technological and logistical resources and expertise should be shared to enable MRV. 11. Individual responsibility The SI Council feels that the fight to prevent irreversible climate change is important from a personal as well as a political and governmental perspective. For this reason, SI member parties resolve to take concrete actions to reduce their impact on the environment and encourage their members to do the same. In this way, our movement can lead by example in its actions as well as its policies. In line with this commitment the Socialist International will seek to reduce the environmental impact of its own meetings, exploring ways to reduce the use of printed materials through electronic distribution of documents. 12. Taking the lead at COP21 Without strong commitments in Paris, the future of the planet looks bleak. We believe that by following the above framework, COP21 can be the moment when the world unites to move towards a sustainable world society. The Council therefore particularly calls on SI member parties who are in government to work tirelessly at the summit for an outcome built on social democratic ideals. \</doc>

The following information was released by the United Nations: Indigenous peoples own, occupy or manage up to 65 per cent of the Earth's land surface, yet they have largely been excluded from national plans prepared for next month's United Nations climate change conference in Paris, according to the UN Development Programme (UNDP), which is working to address the issue. Together with the International Indigenous Peoples' Forum on Climate Change, UNDP is bringing indigenous leaders and high-level government officials together, often for the first time, to ensure that the priorities of indigenous peoples, whose lands are often seized for intensive greenhouse gas-emitting development, are embedded in national proposals for the conference, widely known as COP21 . It highlighted research showing that secure rights to indigenous and community-held land protect against deforestation, which with other land uses represents 11 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions blamed for climate change. It noted that a review by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) of 119 national plans to combat the problem submitted as of last month makes no mention of indigenous peoples. Forests owned and controlled by indigenous peoples and local communities contain about 37.7 billion tons of carbon, 29 times more than the annual emissions of the world' passenger vehicles, according to estimates by the World Resources Institute and Rights and Resources Initiative. But more than 80 per cent of all lands utilized or occupied by indigenous peoples lack legal protection, and are highly vulnerable to being seized by private companies, individuals, and governments themselves, in a non-stop drive toward carbon-intensive investments in agriculture, logging, mining, oil and gas, dams and roads, and tourism. "The same development that fuels climate change, continues to rob indigenous peoples of their human rights," Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, said, stressing the need to protect those right and the traditional knowledge that has kept ecosystems healthy. \</doc>

World Bank issued the following news release: Film4Climate, an initiative of Connect4Climate, the climate change communications program supported by the Italian Ministry for Environment, Land and Sea, the German Federal Ministry for Development and the World Bank Group in collaboration with more than 300 global partners, announced at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change ( COP 21 ) this week the Film4Climate International Charter establishing universal guidelines for greening film production. The announcement was part of the Climate Change Communication flagship event on December 9 organized by the UNFCCC, UNEP, the World Bank Group's Connect4Climate program, Good, Earth Day Network, Bianca Jagger Human Rights Foundation, Rovio and others. During the event it was emphasized that the visual communications industry has a strong record of advocating for social change and effectively portraying such trends to mass audiences. The industry now has the possibility to set an example once again by both adapting production methods and reviewing approaches to content. The Charter has been in the making for a number of months and the emerging document is the result of lengthy discussions among film executives, film makers and film administrators at workshops and presentations around the world including sessions at the Guadalajara, Palm Springs, Berlin, Chicago, IDFA, Valladolid, Ventana Sur and Venice Film Festivals over the past two years, culminating in an international conference on November 25th in Paris organized by EcoProd, the environmental arm of the Ile de France Film Commission; CESAR, the Social, Economic and Environmental Council for the Ile de France and Connect4Climate. At that meeting film industry representatives from North and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa put the finishing touches to a draft document. The Charter aims to set out codes of awareness and practical conditions that film producers can consider when planning and undertaking productions. "The document responds to a general feeling among the participants that it is something the industry can and should do universally to answer the challenges of climate change, while at the same time recognizing the importance of flexibility when t comes to specifics, specifics especially with regards to the vast differences in scale of production and regional or local customs and requirements" noted Donald Ranvaud, creative producer of Connect4Climate. The aim is for the Charter to form the base for action in conjunction with COP 21 decisions where working groups will determine the details of how best to implement widespread 'green' production guidelines internationally, and also propagate further integration of sustainable lifestyle decisions into content and storylines. The text is as follows: FILM4CLIMATE INTERNATIONAL CHARTER Presented in Paris COP21 , December 9, 2015 This Charter commits to eliminate the environmental and community negative impacts of visual media productions, and to strongly advocate for the adoption of industry-wide incentives that will encourage sustainable practices including, but not limited to the conservation of natural resources, the reduction of carbon emissions, the recycling of sets and location waste, and the promotion of environmental literacy. Partners will include Filmmakers, Film Commissions, National Institutes, Film and Television Schools, Production and Distribution Companies, Exhibitors, Union and Trade Organizations. - Partners will follow these environmental actions available to the visual media in all stages of production, from development through exhibition. Partners accept the challenge: - To demonstrate respect for the earth by limiting land modification and habitat degradation, avoiding contamination, and guarding against the introduction of invasive species; - To utilize environmental experts to assist production whenever possible, and to train - Eco Supervisors and department heads to facilitate comprehensive sustainability measures; - To respect scientific knowledge and information in both production and storytelling content, and to incorporate climate messaging and education whenever possible; - To use "Best Practice" guidelines to guide achievable goals during production as outlined by industry leaders, including EcoProd, PGA Green, Albert and Edison Green. These include policies for responsible purchasing that promotes "fair trade" and "green" products; - To explore new technologies and innovative ways to reduce the carbon footprint of productions including LED lighting, cameras with advanced sensors for low lighting, rechargeable batteries, alternative fuels, solar and other sources of renewable energy; - To use practical software or carbon calculators to analyze, calculate and reduce the carbon footprints of film productions; - To create and make available Sustainability Reports for each production to be shared with cast, crew and financiers, and to promote education and public awareness of eco efforts; - To employ carbon offsets, or compensate and make positive environmental contributions to communities negatively impacted by production. NOTE: Film4Climate, an initiative of the World Bank Group, will act as convener to all parties to ensure maximum dialogue takes place and to assist in the understanding and implementation of the above actions. It encourages all Filmmakers, Film Commissions, National Institutes, Film and Television Schools, Production and Distribution Companies, Exhibitors, Union and Trade organizations to register and participate. Film4Climate is a global initiative of Connect4Climate and its partners, committed to developing a concrete plan to mitigate the environmental impact of film production as well as raising awareness and encouraging action on climate change through all visual communications. Connect4Climate is a global partnership program launched by the World Bank Group and the Italian Ministry of Environment to communicate climate change, promote solutions and empower people to act.

The European Union's European Economic and Social Committee issued the following news release: On the eve of COP 21 , the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) together with the Committee of the Regions (CoR) have urged negotiators in Paris not to fail, sending a clear message: Real action on climate and towards low-carbon transition is taking place outside of the political decision-making process, and it is now time for the contribution of civil-society actors as well as local and regional authorities to be framed in a multi-level governance system. The two Committees organised a joint conference on 19 November in Brussels to ensure that their potential to help combat climate change is recognised in the COP21 international climate talks in Paris which will start end of November. In his opening speech, EESC President Georges Dassis reminded national leaders who will attend the COP21 conference that Europeans and citizens around the world expect "a binding, ambitious and universal agreement and also a structured way of involving civil society, which is indispensable for its success." He called on the negotiators not to lose the contact with ordinary people: "State leaders must not forget that it is the citizens who will drive the change". Karl-Heinz Lambertz, Vice-President of the CoR, said: "We, regions and cities, are often more ambitious than states on climate policy. We know the development opportunities and the weaknesses in our cities and regions. We are now ready to go further on climate action. But we need adequate support. We need a climate governance system that works and that brings into accord all levels of government and an agreement that explicitly refers to local governments." The two EU bodies have closely aligned their positions on many of the major issues that will be decided by national leaders at the summit, which should culminate in a long-term global agreement on how to prevent runaway climate change. Transition towards a low-carbon economy and society is already happening at grassroots' level with many communities leading the way, in particular thanks to partnerships between sub-national governments and civil society organisations. National governments sometimes fail to recognise and empower bottom-up initiatives, but the success of international climate action will depend on harnessing the ideas, knowledge and energy of businesspeople, consumers, trade unions, NGOs, communities and local and regional authorities. Both the CoR and the EESC are intensifying their efforts to ensure that an agreement in Paris explicitly recognises the role of citizens and of local and regional authorities in tackling climate change, empowering them and giving them more possibilities to translate global climate policy-making into further concrete, meaningful, transformative actions.

Dec 08, 2015( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com COP21 , when the rubber really hits the road. As the government ministers hammer out the final text, business has an important role to play in ensuring the climate talks end with an ambitious Paris Agreement that guarantees a transition to a thriving, clean economy.<nl/> For those in the business community, there are three things you can do right now to influence the negotiations:<nl/>Make it clear to the government officials in your nation's capital that business wants an ambitious Paris Agreement. As a business leader, the most powerful thing you can do is speak to your own government not just at COP, but at your national capital. Sending this message to your own domestic government will contradict the notion that a Paris Agreement will undermine competitiveness. If their own companies are saying a Paris Agreement would boost competitiveness, that provides governments with confidence to make the deal. Let government know that your company plans to implement the Paris Agreement. Governments are more likely to reach an agreement in Paris if they know business will help drive emissions reductions, enhance adaptive capacity, and facilitate equitable access to sustainable development. Make clear how your business plans to mobilize finance through corporate procurement and investments and direct research and development, and by providing access to goods and services consistent with a low-carbon economy. Continue to act on climate. We Mean Business[2] provides a forum for action on issues ranging from deforestation to renewable energy to carbon pricing to short-lived climate pollutants. By taking ambitious actions to address global warming, your company will not only be more competitive and climate-friendly, it will increase your credibility in advocating for an enabling policy framework.<nl/>Read our analysis of week one and priorities for week two in our latest blog[3].<nl/> What's Important Now<nl/>We need developed countries to honor their promises, particularly on climate finance. Words matter, but numbers matter more. In the absence of agreed-upon language on the long-term goal, it's important to pay attention to numbers and dates, like zero emissions well before the end of the century. In order to\~cut greenhouse gas emissions and make the transition to a thriving, clean global economy,\~business needs the clarity of a long-term goal to know where we are going and by when. Business needs governments to\~strengthen\~their\~commitments every five years, starting in 2020.\~This will ensure that governments keep\~pace with private-sector innovation, stimulate increased private-sector ambition, and\~progressively realize the transformation of the global economy. A clear trajectory will allow business and investors to unlock trillions of\~dollars\~of new investments and the innovative technologies that will enhance\~competitiveness and drive equitable access to sustainable development. The Paris Agreement is\~more than a diplomatic settlement\~among nations. It\~is a stimulus to the real economy,\~with the potential to generate trillions\~of dollars of investments in clean energy, food security, enhanced mobility, and livelihood\~creation.\~We urge ministers arriving in Paris to find the common ground to conclude the\~agreement with the promise that business and investors will be implementation\~partners.<nl/>BSR's Climate Insights<nl/>Midsession COP21 Report: What Happened in Week 1, Expectations for Week 2, and How Business Can Act: Read more[4] For Ambitious Climate Action Before 2020, Business Should Focus on 'Workstream 2': Read more[5] Climate Change and Agriculture: Connecting Global Warming to Business Resilience: Read more[6] Addressing Climate Change Through Technology: Read more[7] Working with Tech Leaders to Power the Internet with 100 Percent Renewable Energy: Read more[8]<nl/>What We're Reading<nl/> Read the latest We Mean Business blogs:<nl/>Morocco and California Showing the Way on Global Low-Carbon Future: Read more[9] The Pathways to Carbon Pricing: Read more[10] The We Mean Business 'Business Brief': Read more[11]<nl/>And some recent media coverage related to business at COP21 :<nl/>Progressive Paris Agreement Will Unlock Green Funds, Says We Mean Business Coalition | The Hindu | December 7, 2015: Read more[12] CNN's Maggie Lake Discusses the Variety of Businesses Involved at COP21 with Nigel Topping, CEO of We Mean Business | CNN | December 7, 2015: Read more[13] (video) Financial Industry Faces Daunting Transformation for Climate Deal to Succeed | InsideClimate News | December 4, 2015: Read more[14] Coalition of Business Leaders Challenges 2C Climate Change Target | The Guardian | December 6, 2015: Read more[15] COP21 : Business Seeks Global Carbon Pricing at Climate Summit | The Financial Times | December 6, 2015: Read more[16] (subscription required)<nl/>Events<nl/>December 8, 11:45 a.m.-12:40 p.m., at the Stade de France BSR President and CEO Aron Cramer will speak during the 'Innovation for Business Advantage' session at the UNEP-Climate Action's Sustainable Innovation Forum.

The following information was released by the United Nations: Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon gave a favourable report card today to the early stages of the United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ) in Paris, while at the same time urging both developed and developing countries to do more to reach universal agreement to mitigate the threat. "I was very encouraged by what I saw and I heard during the opening days of COP21 ," he told a news conference at UN Headquarters in New York. "World leaders did precisely what they were meant to do: give strong impetus to the negotiations. Almost all countries have submitted climate action plans, known as INDCs [Intended Nationally Determined Contributions]," he said. "Major economies have made significant commitments to cut emissions. Many developed countries have made new financial commitments to help poor and vulnerable countries adapt to climate impacts. Philanthropists and entrepreneurs are making exciting new commitments and investments," he continued, citing the Breakthrough Energy Coalition announced by Bill Gates. Mr. Ban, who warned some 150 world leaders on the opening day on Monday that they must move much farther and faster to limit the global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius, is returning to the French capital tonight for COP21Action Day to showcase the huge number of climate partnerships and initiatives involving cities, the private sector, and civil society. Even the sought-after 2-degree rise will have serious consequences for food and water security, economic stability and international peace as climate change unleashes more devastating floods, disastrous droughts and violent cyclones and storms, and rising seas inundate low-lying island States and shorelines where many major cities are located. "In the global economy, the transition to a low-emissions future is well under way," Mr. Ban said today, yet, he stressed that in the negotiating room, "there is still a lot of work to do. Key issues remain unresolved, and there is not much time left." "I continue to press developed countries to recognize their responsibility to take the lead, while urging developing countries to do more in line with their growing capabilities. The world has gone too long without a universal climate agreement that includes all countries as part of the solution. We cannot delay any longer," he said. "There is no perfect agreement. But our goal is clear: an agreement that truly addresses climate change, and puts the world on track for long-term prosperity, stability and peace. That is what the days ahead in Paris can and must deliver," noted the UN chief. Turning to the issue of terrorism and the refugee crisis, which has seen hundreds of thousands of Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans flee to Europe, Mr. Ban said the conflict in Syria was a principal cause, citing plans to launch an initiative in early January involving both intra-Syrian political talks and a nationwide ceasefire. "Closed doors and discrimination are worsening the plight of forcibly displaced people across the world," he said, adding: "I am especially concerned about misplaced suspicions about migrants and refugees, and widespread anti-Muslim discrimination and bigotry." "The world must also be united against terrorism. No grievances or cause can justify the atrocious violence we have seen in recent weeks. The world's response needs to be robust, and always within the rule of law and with respect for human rights. We cannot be ruled by fear," the Secretary-General stressed. \</doc>

Joule reported that Tom Jensen, Executive Vice President Head of Corporate Development, will participate in the COP21 summit, an annual conference that this year expects to bring 50,000 participants from more than 190 countries together to discuss solutions to climate change. At the event, kicking off in Paris this week, Jensen will be discussing the potential of carbon neutral fuels to supply the world's mobility and transportation needs. According to a media release, Joule will be presenting at the Enterprises pour l'Environnement (EpE) conference where Jensen will focus on the future of low carbon fuels and their ability to enable low carbon mobility, in addition to discussing the near term dissemination of Joule's diversified technology solutions. Jensen will also be speaking at Low Carbon Technology Partnership Initiative's (LCTPi) Low Carbon Transport Fuels event to discuss the viability of Joule's technology and low carbon fuel alternative to mitigate climate change and global warming, with a particular focus on how to achieve a carbon compliant transportation sector. At the LCTPi event, Jensen will be joined by executives from WBCSD, Audi, Granbio, POET and Pannonia. The session will take place at 9:30 a.m. CET on Saturday, December 5 at Le Bourget. "As the world's most influential leaders and innovators come together for this pivotal COP21 event, we look forward to participating in the transition from conversation about climate change to developing technologies, partnerships and policies that will enable changes to improve our planet," said Jensen. "The entire Joule team remains highly dedicated to achieving a carbon compliant transportation sector and we are optimistic that our diversified technology platform will help demonstrate at COP21 the feasibility of financially viable low carbon fuels." COP21 , organized by the United Nations Environment Programme, will convene cross-sector participants from business, government, finance, UN, NGO and civil society from all over the world in an effort to achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2 degrees C. Joule develops technology platforms for the production of sustainable, drop in, low carbon transportation fuels.

\~For negotiators at theParis climate conference( COP21 ) to successfully advance global efforts to reduce carbon emissions, nations must embrace a prominent role for nuclear energy. Experience the interactive Multimedia News Release here: HYPERLINK http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7694251-nuclear-energy-cop21-climate-goals/ http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7694251-nuclear-energy- HYPERLINK cop21 -climate-goals/ The Obama administration highlighted the crucial role of nuclear energy when it convened aWhite House Summit on Nuclear Energyearlier this month. "As America leads the global transition to a low-carbon economy, the continued development of new and advanced nuclear technologies along with support for currently operating nuclear power plants is an important component of our clean energy strategy," a White Housefact sheetdeveloped for the summit states. Manyenvironmentalists are also giving nuclear energy a second look, as they seek practical solutions to constrain carbon emissions. Nuclear energy facilities provide63 percent of America's zero-carbon electricity. Globally, nuclear power plants provide one-third of all zero-carbon electricity. One of nuclear energy's major advantages relative to other low-carbon energy sources is its unique ability to produce large-scale electricity around-the-clock in extreme weather conditions. Nuclear energy facilities don't rely on the wind blowing, the sun shining, or just-in-time deliveries of fuel by truck, barge, rail or pipeline. In 2014, the U.S. nuclear energy industry's average capacity factor-a common measure of efficiency and reliability-was 92 percent. "Nuclear energy can produce a steady supply of baseload electricity with no greenhouse gas emissions thereby allowing the world to meet increased electricity demand, achieve economic development goals and carbon reductions," says Marvin Fertel, NEI president and CEO. "It's a positive sign that more than 200 reactors are under construction or in licensing and advanced planning stages worldwide." The United States has five reactors under construction, which are essential for it to meet itsnational carbon reduction plansubmitted to COP21 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. "Keeping existing nuclear plants operating and building new reactors are indispensable components to meeting the targets set at the COP21 conference," Fertel says.

The following information was released by the International Olympic Committee (IOC): IOC President Thomas Bach highlighted that the Olympic Games can be a catalyst for the sustainable development of cities. Addressing 1000 mayors from around the globe attending the 21st United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 21 ) in Paris, he highlighted the sustainability reforms of Olympic Agenda 2020 and stressed that the experience of past Olympic host cities demonstrate that it is possible to deliver successful Games while minimising environmental impact. The IOC President told the conference that for the Olympic Games 2024 the host city will have to implement a carbon management and reduction plan. The plan comes in top of sustainable work already done by previous host cities. "The Olympic Games London 2012 saved an equivalent of 400,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, mainly in construction and operational activities," he said. "Sustainability standards used by London have quickly become the international norm for global events and are used by future host cities like Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo." President Bach was speaking at the Climate Summit for Local Leaders. He pointed out that with the reforms of Olympic Agenda 2020, Candidate Cities can now focus on how the Olympic Games can best fit into their long-term plans for the sustainable development of their city or region. Before speaking at the Climate Summit, President Bach met the President of the French Republic, Fran ois Hollande. He also met the Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, and the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change, Michael Bloomberg, the co-hosts of the Summit. During the Summit, President Bach took the opportunity to talk to the Mayor of Rio de Janeiro, Eduardo Paes and Eric Garcetti, Mayor of Los Angeles. He met the mayors \</doc>

WASHINGTON - U.S. Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, released a statement on the pending climate deal being developed at the 21st session of the Conference of Parties ( COP21 ) pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris, France. "EPA and CEQ traveled 3,800 miles to present their roles in the implementation of the president's Climate Action Plan and corresponding international commitment yet refused to travel two miles to testify with the State Department before elected representatives of the American people," Inhofe said. "In refusing to testify before a joint subcommittee hearing on the international negotiations and the president's Climate Action Plan, EPA asserted 'the agency does not have a witness that can speak to the issues of the hearing.' Following EPA and CEQ's refusal to testify, I requested the agency provide a list of officials who had participated in previous negotiating meetings and who would be attending the COP 21 in Paris. These simple oversight requests went unanswered. It is hard to understand how EPA and CEQ have the expertise to explain their involvement with the president's international climate agenda to the United Nations and broader international community when just two months ago, they lacked the ability to do so before Congress. I plan to invite administration officials, once again, to provide testimony before the Senate EPW committee so they can explain their actions to Congress and the American people." Tuesday, Dec. 8, GinaMcCarthy, administrator for EPA and Janet McCabe, acting assistant administrator, answer questions during their presentation entitled, "EPA US Climate Change Actions: EPA's Role in Delivering on President Obama's Climate Action Plan" from the U.S. Pavilion at COP21 . COP21 . Thursday, Dec. 10, Obama administration officials spoke on a panel entitled, "U.S. Climate Policy: Implementing the President Climate Action Plan" from the U.S. Pavilion at COP21 . On Oct. 13, EPA sent a letter to Inhofe saying a representative from EPA would not be attending the hearing. On Oct. 15, Inhofe sent letters to the State Department, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), requesting participation in a full committee hearing on Oct. 20 to conduct oversight of the Obama administration's ongoing international climate negotiations and to examine the role that domestic environmental policies play to the final agreement. However, EPA and CEQ declined to participate. SFRC Democrats objected to a joint hearing, which led to Inhofe's decision to proceed as a full EPW committee hearing. Once this change was made, the State Department informed the committee's majority office that it could no longer confirm the participation of Todd Stern, special envoy for Climate Change at the State Department, unless EPA or CEQ would also be in attendance as witnesses. EPA and CEQ, to date, have claimed to not have witnesses available who can testify to the subject matter. On Oct. 16, Inhofe sent letters to EPA, White House CEQ, and the State Department requesting a list of respective staff who plan to attend COP21 and a list of staff who have attended international meetings in the past related to the UNFCCC. On Dec. 9, Inhofe delivered a speech on the Senate floor reiterating that "a legally binding agreement must come before the Senate for consideration. There is no way around it." On Dec. 7, the Heartland Institute, joined by scientists and policy experts, held a conference during COP21 called the Day of Examining the Data in order to demonstrate the opposition to Obama's climate plans as well as to expose the true cost of his agenda. U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, participated in the counter conference via video. To view Inhofe's remarks, go to: HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZKIUP9EGp8andfeature=youtu.be https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZKIUP9EGp8andfeature=youtu.be and scroll to time stamp 4:32.34. On Dec. 1, Inhofe unveiled a White Paper put together by Senate EPW Committee Majority staff to provide the first comprehensive account of the Senate's legislative and oversight efforts during the 114th Congress to set the record straight on the Obama administration's misguided climate agenda in the context of historical international agreements and negotiations leading up to the 21st session of the Conference of Parties ( COP21 ) pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris, France from Nov. 30 to Dec. 11, 2015. On Nov. 30, Inhofe had an op-ed published with CNN called, "Beware of Empty Climate Promises." On Nov. 19, Inhofe and Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), introduced a bipartisan resolution expressing the sense of the Senate with regard to any agreement reached at the 21st session of the Conference of Parties pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held this December. The purpose of the resolution is to further inform the international community of the U.S. Senate's respective role. On Nov. 19, Inhofe and Barrasso and their colleagues sent a letter to the president encouraging U.S. negotiators to be forthcoming to foreign counterparts of Congress's role over the Green Climate Fund and any binding agreement. On Nov. 18, Hofstra University Professor of Law, Julian Ku, testified that the president could not legally bind the United States to make emission reduction targets through a sole executive agreement and that any attempt to suggest otherwise could result in "misleading foreign governments" or "violat[ing] the Constitution." Oren Cass, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute highlighted how the UN negotiations ultimately are an attempt to redistribute developed countries cash in the form of "climate finance," which the U.S. congress can "strongly resist." Mr. Stephen Eule, vice president of Climate and Technology at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Institute for 21st Century Energy, revealed that other countries' INDCs are nothing more than business as usual since developing countries have a much greater interest in "pursing economic growth and poverty eradication than ... reducing GHG emissions." On Nov. 17, the U.S. Senate voted to disapprove of President Obama's signature legacy regulation on global warming in S.J.Res. 23 and S.J.Res. 24. S.J.Res. 23 was introduced by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), and S.J.Res. 24 was introduced by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). On Nov. 12, Inhofe responded to Sec. John Kerry's comments that COP21 "will not deliver a 'treaty' that legally requires countries to cut their carbon emissions.'

BRUSSELS, Belgium, Dec. 7 -- The European Parliament issued the following press release: Officials from nearly 200 countries have been meeting in Paris since late November to negotiate a new climate change agreement for after 2020. This week a delegation of 15 MEPs also takes part in the COP21 conference. Members are participating in background talks with NGOs and delegations from across the world, while the EU commissioner for climate action Miguel Arias Canete will brief them on the progress of the talks on a daily basis. Live updates from Paris are available on our Storify page. As world leaders gather in Paris to hammer out a global agreement to fight climate change, a delegation of 15 MEPs heads to the COP21 talks this week to help obtain a successful result. The MEPs present include Irish EPP member Sean Kelly and UK ECR member Ian Duncan. The Parliament says that the agreement reached must be legally binding and ambitious from the outset, with five-year commitment periods. In a resolution voted on in October MEPs also proposed that a share of revenues from the EU carbon market allowances should be earmarked for climate finance, and that aviation and shipping sectors should initiate measures to curb their emissions. Live updates with quotes, photos and videos from Paris can be found on our Storify page. More photos from the delegation's activities at COP21 are also available on Parliament's Flickr and Instagram pages, with daily updates on Facebook too.

Dec 04, 2015( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com But the effects of global warming including intense storms, floods, droughts, and extreme temperatures affect us all right now. For business, these impacts include disrupted supply chains, reduced availability of natural resources, damaged infrastructure and utilities, and increased market volatility. Some\~estimate[2]\~that if we continue on our current path of greenhouse gas emissions, climate change will cost as much as US$4 trillion by 2030.<nl/> To survive and grow, business must invest in climate resilience, which was the theme of the Lima-Paris Action Agenda on Wednesday.<nl/> But what does resilience mean to the private sector? For business, the path to climate resilience consists of two important steps:<nl/>Deepen understanding of climate vulnerability: While business leaders traditionally consider climate vulnerability through the lens of risk to operations, facilities, raw materials, or financial loss genuine resilience requires an understanding of how climate vulnerability is connected to the financial, political, legal, cultural, and social landscapes that the business operates within. Enhance adaptive capacity: BSR has identified seven assets physical, natural, governance, technological, knowledge, social, and financial that business leaders can use to strengthen their companies' resilience in the face of climate change, and to enhance the ability of communities to rebound and prosper in a climate-constrained world.<nl/>The innovative power of the private sector is critical for building a resilient business and a resilient world. And now that resilience has entered the conversation at COP21 ,\~let's use this as our moment to ensure that climate resilience receives the same political parity as mitigation[3]. The Paris Agreement can treat both with the same urgency, for example, by establishing collective mitigation and adaptation goals.<nl/> What's Important Now<nl/> While the business and investor community is hopeful that COP21 will deliver a transformative agreement, many are growing anxious over the slow pace of the negotiations and governments' ability to deliver the ambitious agreement the private sector needs to shift to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy.<nl/> Only faster progress at COP21 will produce the ambitious, catalytic agreement business needs. The agreement must send strong signals to the private sector, including a clear and actionable long-term goal, continuous improvement of government commitments every five years, and a strong transparency system to help businesses see the regulatory risks and opportunities available to them worldwide.

Baton Rouge: US Chamber of Commerce, The state of Louisiana has issued the following news release: \~ Stephen Eule, vice president for climate and technology at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\' s Institute for 21st Century Energy, today issued the following statement regarding the climate change agreement reached today in Paris:  The Paris climate conference delivered more of the same lots of promises and lots of issues still left unresolved.\~ While we are reviewing the final agreement, it\' s clear that implementation still faces the same obstacles that we\' ve been warning about for years.\~ None of the commitments made, including those by the U.S., are binding, and many aren\' t even complete. Moreover, Congress must appropriate any funds that the Obama administration has pledged.  The White House\' s overall domestic strategy of making energy more expensive and less abundant to satisfy international constituencies, many of whom compete against the United States, should worry the business community, American workers, and consumers. We will continue our efforts to understand how this deal affects the U.S. jobs and growth. Please visit the Energy Institute\' s COP 21 The mission of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Institute for 21st Century Energy is to unify policymakers, regulators, business leaders, and the American public behind a common sense energy strategy to help keep America secure, prosperous, and clean. Through policy development, education, and advocacy, the Institute is building support for meaningful action at the local, state, national, and international levels. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world\' s largest business federation representing the interests of more than 3 million businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, as well as state and local chambers and industry associations. \~ In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: HYPERLINK editorial@plusmediasolutions.com \</doc>

Dec 02, 2015( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com This question occurred to me during my panel discussion at World Resources Institute's 'Built to Last: A Functional Agreement to Meet Global Needs[2]' session yesterday, when a woman from the\~Citizens' Climate Lobby[3]\~asked what I thought would happen if a price on carbon was not included in the final agreement.<nl/> On Day 2 of COP21 , it struck me that a lot of people share this woman's fear: 'What if my all climate-related issues are not covered in the agreement? Will Paris be a failure?'<nl/> The answer is no. We should not hinge our vision of success in Paris on getting everything we can into the agreement. Plenty of important activity is already happening outside COP. In the private sector, 67 companies are aligning with the UN Global Compact's business leadership criteria on carbon pricing, meaning they are setting an internal carbon price and publicly advocating for carbon pricing. Additionally, almost\~40 countries and more than 20 cities, states, and provinces use carbon-pricing mechanisms or are planning to implement them[4].<nl/> Indeed, Paris is already likely to achieve a great deal. We are on the brink of agreeing to a long-term goal to stabilize the global climate, providing policy certainty to business. Governments are likely to agree to renew commitments every five years, ensuring ambition is progressively increased. And for the first time, we have climate-action plans covering the whole spectrum of major economies and a total of 184 countries. This,\~coupled with commitments from 469 companies and investors[5], will make climate action inevitable, irresistible, and irreversible.<nl/> But Paris is just a starting point 'not a finish line,' as Chinese President Xi said on Monday. One of the major themes at COP this year is connecting the global climate agreement to the real economy. To do that, we need to stop thinking about Paris as the end of the road and focus instead on how we carry this momentum through Paris and beyond.<nl/> What's Important Now<nl/> With 184 intended nationally determined contributions, or INDCs, covering more than 95 percent of emissions, projected warming should decrease to 2.7\'b0C. This bold climate action offers an historic economic opportunity to accelerate the transition to a thriving, clean economy.\~But to achieve our goal of holding warming below 2\'b0C,\~governments must return every five years to strengthen these commitments and a successful Paris Agreement will establish these rounds of commitments every five years. This will allow policy to 'ratchet up[6]' ambition and align with the pace of private-sector innovation.<nl/> For each round, governments should:<nl/>Take stock of their collective progress toward the long-term goals in the Paris Agreement to inform the preparation of their new commitments. Discuss their proposed commitments to ensure that all are doing their fair share. Inscribe their new commitments under the Paris Agreement.<nl/>We hope to see a successful Paris Agreement and a meeting scheduled for another round of commitments in 2020.<nl/> BSR's Climate Insights<nl/> Here's our latest dispatch from COP21 :<nl/>Ratcheting Up the Ambition:\~Read more[7]<nl/>And with our event (10 a.m.-1 p.m.) today on the role of the agriculture industry, here are some blogs on how food and agriculture is addressing its climate impacts:<nl/>Walking the Walk: How Food and Agriculture Businesses Can Take Action on Climate:\~Read more[8] How General Mills Worked with BSR to Set Ambitious, Science-Based Climate Targets:\~Read more[9] Translating Climate Science to Build a Resilient Agriculture Sector:\~Read more[10]<nl/>What We're Reading<nl/>The Business Brief: Shaping a Catalytic Paris Agreement | We Mean Business | November 2015:\~Read more[11] Highlights: World Leaders Open Paris Climate Change Talks | Reuters | November 30, 2015:\~Read more[12] Climate Warriors |\~Vogue\~| November 30, 2015:\~Read more[13] In Paris, Managing Humanity's Relationship with Earth's Climate Becomes Normal |\~New York Times\~Dot Earth | November 30, 2015:\~Read more[14] Business Backs Low-Carbon USA | December 1, 2015:\~Read more[15] A Path for Climate Change, Beyond Paris |\~New York Times\~| December 1, 2015:\~Read more[16]<nl/>Events<nl/> With so many events and activities taking place in Paris throughout COP21 , here's a short list of events BSR is hosting and where we will have speakers:<nl/>December 2, 10 a.m.-1 p.m., at Galerie des Solutions at Le Bourget BSR and Field to Market will host 'From Field to Market: Leadership and Collaboration in U.S. and Global Agriculture,' an event sponsored by PepsiCo.

The following information was released by the California Department of Insurance: California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones will join global leaders addressing the threat of climate change at the 21st United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) in Paris. As the regulator of the sixth largest insurance market in the world and largest in the United States, Jones has been a national and international leader with regard to how insurers address climate risk in their business operations, reserving and underwriting. Jones strongly supports reducing carbon emissions and reliance on carbon based fuels and increasing investment, including insurers' investment, in alternative green energy sources. "I am pleased to join Governor Jerry Brown and other California leaders in the public and private sector at the UN Climate Summit in Paris," said Commissioner Jones. "Governor Brown's leadership on climate change is making a tremendous difference in California and across the world." Commissioner Jones will participate in a number of prominent meetings in the COP 21 "Blue Zone," where official negotiations among national leaders are being held. Commissioner Jones has been selected as one of 24 world leaders to participate in a private roundtable with high-level participants including asset owners, asset managers and policymakers to discuss carbon related risks, financial regulation and climate safe energy alternatives. The Commissioner will participate in Climate Action Day, an event aimed at showcasing the most emblematic commitments and initiatives of state and non-state actors in the Lima-Paris Action agenda and shedding light on those engaged in climate action. Jones will also join decision-makers from across the globe at the Sustainable Innovation Forum, the largest business-focused climate event held during the annual conference. Commissioner Jones will also have bilateral meetings with insurance regulators from other nations regarding the establishment of an international consortium of insurance regulators sponsored by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) that will further collaboration between insurance regulators from around the world in addressing climate risk and the insurance sector. The Commissioner's itinerary for COP21 : Saturday, December 5, 2015 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Climate Action Day Commissioner Jones will attend this event showcasing the most emblematic commitments and initiatives of state and non-state actors in the Lima-Paris Action agenda and shedding light on those engaged in climate action. At the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP20) to the UNFCCC in December 2014 in Lima, the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC and the Presidency of the COP21 were encouraged to convene a high-level event to enhance implementation of climate action. Monday, December 7, 2015 The Role of the Financial System in the Transition to a Low-carbon Economy Jones will attend the session focused on decarbonizing financial markets and portfolios. Investors and financial regulators have started to acknowledge their role in this arena. 2 Investing Initiative, Carbon Tracker Initiative and the UNEP Inquiry are three organizations working with investors and policymakers on the integration of climate considerations in investment decisions to ensure the reallocation of capital to a low carbon economy. Discussions will focus on theories and actions, offer insight on the European and global context and analyze the current policy momentum. 6th Annual Sustainable Innovation Forum 2015 The Commissioner will join global stakeholders and decision-makers with delegates from 43 countries at the 6th Annual Sustainable Innovation Forum. Building on year-round work from Climate Action and UNEP, the two-day forum will convene cross-sector participants from business, government, finance, the UN, NGOs and civil society to create an unparalleled opportunity to bolster business innovation and bring scale to the emerging green economy. Tuesday, December 8, 2015 Carbon Tracker Roundtable Discussion on Strategic Risk Disclosures for Fossil Fuel Companies Commissioner Jones has been selected as one of 24 world leaders to participate in a private roundtable with high-level participants including asset owners, asset managers and policy-makers to discuss the extent to which company business plans diverge from climate safe energy pathways and to agree on future actions. Organized in partnership with the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), the discussion will focus on the disclosure of fossil fuel companies' long-term exposure to energy transition risk and how investors can best engage on this topic. On December 7, Carbon Tracker will launch a set of recommended strategic risk engagement principles for fossil fuel companies at the Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) Leaders Luncheon on Climate. This document is designed to complement the work of organizations including PRI and SSE and will allow investors in fossil fuel companies to gain insight into business risks in the context of the transition to a low carbon economy. Shifting Billions Toward Green Investments The Commissioner will attend this meeting of investors and policymakers, which will include a discussion of investment solutions to a greener economy, carbon impacts in investment decisions and asset management, and emerging new solutions. # # # Media Notes: Commissioner Jones believes that climate change poses an existential threat. Since the start of his first term in 2011, Jones has required insurance companies to report on how they are addressing climate risk in their business operations, reserving and underwriting. Commissioner Jones leads a multi-state group of insurance regulators in requiring insurers to answer the Climate Risk Disclosure Survey, surveying more than 1,000 insurance companies annually and capturing approximately 77 percent of the entire U.S insurance market, enabling regulators, insurance companies and interested members of the public the ability to identify climate risk trends, vulnerabilities and best practices by the insurance industry. Survey results can be found on the California Department of Insurance's website. ### The California Department of Insurance, established in 1868, is the largest consumer protection agency in California. Insurers collect $259 billion in premiums annually in California. In 2014 the California Department of Insurance received more than 175,000 calls from consumers and helped recover over $63 million in claims and premiums.

The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association issued the following news release: The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) today issued its position on how to address the challenges of climate change ahead of the COP21 climate conference, which will be starting in Paris next week. ACEA welcomes COP21 as a historic opportunity to establish a policy framework that allows Europe to drive down greenhouse gas emissions, while generating jobs and economic growth. ACEA reaffirms the automobile industry's commitment to further reducing CO2 emissions from both vehicles and production processes. "At the same time, it is obvious that a more 'comprehensive' approach is necessary to address all the aspects that affect emissions during the use phase of a vehicle," Erik Jonnaert, ACEA Secretary General explained. Such an approach seeks to reduce CO2 emissions more effectively by drawing on a full spectrum of solutions, whether this relates to the vehicle itself, alternative powertrains, faster fleet renewal, intelligent transport systems (ITS), improving infrastructure, decarbonising fuels, or altering driver behaviour. The need for a comprehensive approach to further reduce CO2 emissions from road transport should be reflected in the EU's implementation of the COP21 agreement. ACEA expresses the hope that the outcome of the climate negotiations forms the basis of a new long-term and predictable policy framework. Policy makers should also ensure that the COP21 talks result in equivalent conditions for all major emitting economies and industrial sectors around the world, recommends ACEA. Jonnaert: "Only a level playing field between countries, as well as industrial sectors, will allow the EU automotive industry to make the long-term investments that are necessary to tackle the climate change challenge."

Analysis: Elon Musk's snarky response to a Koch-brothers plan to kill electric cars Tesla chief executive Elon Musk is rolling his eyes over a secret new project by conservatives that's reportedly aimed at undermining the electric car market. His tweet comes in response to a Huffington Post report suggesting that the billionaire Koch brothers want to kickstart a major lobbying effort to promote fossil fuels and criticize subsidies for electric vehicles. The lobbying group, which hasn't been announced, would likely spend $10 million a year, the report said. The Obama administration has committed billions of dollars in grants toward electric car technology. Consumers can also receive a tax credit worth up to $7,500 if they buy an eligible electric car. These credits are designed to encourage adoption of the technology - and that threatens the Koch brothers' financial stake in oil and gas, according to the Huffington Post. Which just led Musk - who has bet big on electric cars in the Tesla Model S, Model X and the soon-to-be-announced Model 3 - to argue that the petroleum industry has also been a big beneficiary of government subsidies. Musk tweeted, "Worth noting that all gasoline cars are heavily subsidized via oil company tax credits & unpaid public health cost" When billionaires go to war, the rest of us grab the popcorn. \</doc>

Dec 14, 2015( DipNote Blog: http://blogs.state.gov http://blogs.state.gov / Delivered by Newstex) As the UN climate negotiations, also known as COP21 , wind down in Paris, it's an opportune time to highlight the Locally Employed Staff (LES) from U.S. embassies around the world who were instrumental in supporting the frenzy of activities on the ground here. For the past two weeks at the U.S. Center, the U.S. public outreach space at COP21 , we've been proud to host several LES who helped fulfill the U.S. Center's mission of bringing COP21 to the world. Staffers came from far and wide: Brasilia, Beijing, Dublin, Dhaka, Paris, Reykjavik, Brussels, and Mumbai. The LES at the U.S. Center played an invaluable role in informing audiences in their home countries about the importance of COP21 . By live-tweeting U.S. Center sessions and posting photos and videos of activities around the event, with text translated into local languages, LES helped audiences from around the world access climate information and learn more about U.S. climate action. Meet a few of our LES colleagues and read what they had to say about COP21 : Sirat Mahadi, U.S. Embassy, Dhaka, Bangladesh: Sirat Mahadi, local staff member from U.S. Embassy Dhaka, Bangladesh, poses at a photo booth area in the US Center at COP21 . [State Photo] 'Coming to the COP was a great experience; it was so great to work with this team. It's my first time in Paris and my first TDY [overseas travel assignment]. I didn't expect the COP to be this big. 'Climate change is a huge issue in Bangladesh because it's a low-lying country. We have floods almost every year, as well as typhoons. So the COP summit is really important for us. 'I got to attend Secretary Kerry's speech this week. It was inspiring to hear how the Obama Administration is taking real action not just plans and how other countries are also collaborating. Everyone is taking climate change more seriously than ever, and it's clear we have to act now.' Asgrimur Sigurdsson, U.S. Embassy Reykjavik, Iceland: Asgrimur Sigurdsson from U.S. Embassy Reykjavik, Iceland stands in front of the U.S. Center'sNOAA's ScienceSphere at COP21 in Paris, France [State Photo]. 'I wasn't sure what to expect in coming here, but I've been impressed with how big the COP is. In Iceland, climate change is something everyone is increasingly aware of. Glaciers are receding at a well-documented pace, and we need to do something sooner rather than later. So the COP is receiving a lot of publicity back home. 'My favorite thing at the COP was an event at the U.S. Center about the Arctic it's something I want people to know more about.' (See video from the event here[1].) Diarmaid Keene, U.S. Embassy Dublin, Ireland: 'I thoroughly enjoyed working at the US Center at COP21 . The sheer scale of the event was staggering, it wasinteresting to be a part of something so global and at the same time so important to the future of the planet.' 'I enjoyed getting to know people from different USG agencies. In my role with the Embassy in Ireland I would never cross paths with people from NOAA, EPA, USAID. Making new contacts with all these people was hugely beneficial. 'Climate change is a topic Irish people are becoming increasing concerned about and as COP progressed more and more Irish were engaging online. 'Every day was different and exciting, and each talk on stage explored the different prospects we face as climate change becomes a reality. Learning from the speakers what they are confronting or finding was an eye opener.' Laurens Vermeire, U.S. Embassy Brussels, Belgium: Laurens Vermeire, local staff from U.S. Embassy Brussels, attends his second COP event, serving at the U.S. Center at this year's COP21 in Paris [State Photo]. 'This is my second COP I was also in Copenhagen in 2009. And in the 6 years since, we've made a lot of progress. Countries submitting their plans to cut carbon pollution ahead of the conference itself was a stroke of genius.' 'In coming here, I expected long days and a lot of hurrying up and waiting. There's lots of talking and thinking going on, along with a lot of press engagement by the State Department. But it's all been worth it. Chen Er from Embassy Beijing and Aditi Tandon from Consulate Mumbai pose in front of U.S. Center at COP21 [State Photo].

The following information was released by the city of Boston: Mayor Martin J. Walsh today joined the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) Steering Committee, the governing body that provides strategic direction for the network of cities on the front line of preparing for and helping prevent climate change. He will serve on the steering committee as the representative for all North American C40 cities. "Boston has made significant progress on climate action," said Mayor Walsh. "I'm proud and determined to build on and expand that legacy in this new leadership role." Boston joined C40 in 2014 and has accomplished much in two years - from the release of the updated Greenovate Climate Action, which sets a clear road map to achieve Boston's greenhouse gas reduction goals of 25 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050, to receiving an international award for community engagement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) in Paris. Read more about Boston's C40 "Smart Cities and Smart Community Engagement" award and why Boston was chosen as the recipient, read hereand here. As a member of the C40 Steering Committee, Mayor Walsh and the City of Boston will represent C40 in regional forums as well as on the global stage, helping to make the case for urgent and ambitious climate action as cities take on an increasingly important role in delivering global climate goals. "Mayor Martin J. Walsh of Boston has been officially elected as the new North American Steering Committee member. Mayor Walsh will work alongside our existing Steering Committee member Mayor Garcetti of Los Angeles to represent the 14 North American members," said C40 Chair and Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes. "The Steering Committee is confident and looks forward to Mayor Walsh's leadership in C40's efforts to steer this organization and actively represent North America and C40 as a whole in the global climate change arena." About the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40): The C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, now in its 10th year, connects more than 80 of the world's greatest cities, representing 600+ million people and one-quarter of the global economy. Created and led by cities, C40 is focused on tackling climate change and driving urban action that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, while increasing the health, wellbeing and economic opportunities of urban citizens. \</doc>

Yet, I'm beginning to think the big Paris climate change conference known as # COP21 may actually accomplish some real change.<nl/> Oddly enough, my optimism is rooted in something I would have seen a few years ago as a fatal flaw: that the results will be based in voluntary, not mandatory, compliance.<nl/> Why? Because:<nl/> We can't GET mandatory compliance. In the US, that would require a yes vote in each house of Congress, or\~even worse, the 2/3 Senate support required to adopt a treaty. But even as far back as Kyoto, US electoral politics had become a toxic swamp of attack-dog partisanship. No climate change bill with teeth is going to pass Congress any time soon. And without US (or China's) participation, any\~agreement would be useless. The US and China have already agreed to take climate seriously, and have negotiated their own agreement. Weaker than I'd like, but a heck of a good start, and one that seems to have helped apply the brakes on China's mad rush to coal (the worst scenario\~for averting climate disaster). The business community has woken up. Often a force for conservatism, the business world now understands the catastrophic consequences of failure to make meaningful progress on climate change[1] and the profits to be made in doing the right thing. If the government won't act, they will force action through other channels. The emergence of environmental activism among evangelical Christians[2] and even a subset of Tea Party activists who care deeply about the environment [3]is also very encouraging. The growing use of carbon markets[4] provides additional\~financial incentives for cutting carbon. New technology makes it easier to\~do more with less, use.\~our resources far more effectively, and solve engineering problems with biological thinking (for example, letting bridge engineers study spiderwebs). We understand now, for instance, just how much energy and carbon we can save by going for deep conservation. Early discussions about whether the world should agree on a 1.5 degree Celsius vs. 2 degree C cap in global temperatures compared to what existed before the Industrial Revolution means we've finally gotten past the question that's been holding us back for so long: why do we need to contain\~rising temperatures\~in the first place?\~For the first time, the world is pretty much in agreement that it has to be done. Not just scientists, this time, but governments, too. Climate deniers (other than in the US Republican Party leadership, apparently) are now as marginalized as environmental activists were 20 or 30 years ago.<nl/> I could keep going, but you get the message we can do this!<nl/> You just finished reading Cautiously Optimistic about # COP21 [5]!

The office of Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., issued the following news release: U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, released the following statement from Paris after visiting the negotiations at Le Bourget, France as part of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP21 . Representatives from 195 countries have gathered in Paris to produce a new international agreement on climate change to keep the global average temperature increase to below 2degreeC. "One thing that has been clear from these negotiations in France is that governments alone can't solve climate change," said Senator Coons. "If we want to truly address one of the greatest challenges our world faces today, which threatens human health, the environment, and international security, the United States and nations around the world must work together with the private sector and NGOs to set responsible policies while supporting the development of new technologies and innovations. "If the United States is going to lead this effort, we have to be at the forefront of setting ambitious policies and supporting the impressive innovations in energy efficiency and clean energy technology that both our public and private sectors are capable of producing. "To do that, it is critical for Congress to enact responsible and forward-looking energy policies, but shifting to an energy-efficient and low-carbon economy will also require action and investment from businesses across the United States. Many American businesses, including several in Delaware like DuPont, Bloom Energy, and White Optics, are already leading the way and proving that we can create new jobs and spur economic growth while reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the same time. "In the Senate, I've been working to support bipartisan legislation that helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and facilitates clean energy growth - from working to level the energy playing field through the MLP Parity Act to advocating for increased funding for research and development in innovative energy technologies through the energy title of America COMPETES. "I'm heartened by the progress being made here in Paris and am optimistic that the outcome of the negotiations will prove the international community is ready to meet the challenge of climate change head on and do what is necessary to keep the future of our children and our planet safe. We cannot afford to delay action any longer."

Washington: National Wildlife Federation has issued the following news release: As we have updated over the past 2 weeks, the National Wildlife Federation had a team in Paris for COP21 United Nations Climate Change Conference . This year\' s COP was a big one because it created an agreement that ramps up governments\' ambitions to limit global carbon emissions. The National Wildlife Federation\' s international team focused on a key piece of the negotiations \- the  land sector \- which plays a large role in emissions from deforestation and agriculture, carbon sequestration (forests are able to store carbon pollution), and wildlife habitat. Beyond our work to highlight the land sector\' s importance in the agreement, we participated in a number of side events that surrounded the COP. NWF held two main events along with several co-sponsors to showcase zero-deforestation agriculture and make clear the importance of the land sector. The events discussed how progress has been made and how private and public sector initiatives can work together to decrease deforestation. Zero-deforestation Commodity Supply Chains: Linking Corporate Actions with REDD+ During the first week of the COP, the National Wildlife Federation held our first side event with co-sponsors Environmental Defense Fund, the Governors\' Climate & Forests Task Force, and the United Nations Office for REDD+ Coordination in Indonesia (UNORCID). This event took place in the Climate Generations Area which is a specific space at the COP venue open to badged delegates and the general public. Our panel, co-moderated by Helen Crowley of Kering Group and our own David Burns, was made up of representatives from the private sector, including Walmart Brazil, Kering Group (the parent company for a range of brands, such as Gucci, Puma, Volcom, etc.), and the Consumer Goods Forum (a group of 400+ companies), as well as a state government representative from Brazil and a United Nations Environment Programme Goodwill Ambassador. This combination of private and public sector actors examined the successes of voluntary private sector actions for eliminating deforestation in agricultural supply chains, such as certification, roundtables, and moratoria on sourcing products from recently deforested areas, concentrating on major commodities such as soy, palm oil, and cattle. They then discussed the ways in which private sector activities can create synergies with government actions such as law enforcement and forest conservation under programs like Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). Deforestation-free Agriculture: Converting Pledges into Action NWF\' s second side event took place Tuesday, Dec. 8 in the  blue zone of the COP where attendees must be badged by the United Nations. The co-hosts \- NWF, SNV Netherlands Development Organization, and the Rainforest Alliance (RA) \- each had a speaker on the panel alongside representatives from Walmart Brazil and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of The Netherlands. \~ The focus of this discussion was the prospect for deforestation-free agriculture. Food, feed, and fiber production need to increase to meet population growth and improve diets, yet without expanding into forests and other native ecosystems. As agriculture moves into these areas, deforestation harms wildlife and habitat. So, how do we proceed? This discussion, like the prior side event, examined the role of certification and moratoria in decreasing deforestation. Speakers noted that  first-mover companies (those that are the first to take these initiatives) need to incentivize others. A zero-deforestation impact is only achievable through working with all companies and smallholders. The event also examined the lessons learned from  landscape-level approaches which involve having a well-planned mosaic of production and conservation areas across a large area of land to provide social protections while conserving important ecosystem services. In this case, one example of a  landscape-level approach is combining shrimp farming and mangrove conservation. Speakers supported the need for government action to provide enforcement at the sub-national level (i.e. state or provincial level) to increase the chance of success for these voluntary private sector actions. Dr. Nathalie Walker, the National Wildlife Federation\' s Senior Manager of Tropical Forests and Agriculture, presented how the Brazilian Soy Moratorium dramatically decreased deforestation in the Amazon driven by the expansion of soy farming. A voluntary initiative implemented by the private sector since 2006, the Moratorium has been five times more effective at stopping deforestation for soy than government policy alone. NWF supported continuation of the moratorium last year, when soy traders threatened to end it. Dr. Walker received several questions from the Dutch government and civil society members in the room about how private sector action can support government policies in this endeavor. This topic is a central component of NWF\' s international work, and the active discussion between panelists and the audience continued well after the end of the formal event. These panels were two of many during COP 21 that demonstrate the key role the land sector needs to play in a world shaped by climate change \- preferably as part of the solution and not a continued source of climate pollution and habitat loss.

The International Chamber of Shipping issued the following news release: In advance of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in December, the global shipping industry, as represented by the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), has launched some key messages to government negotiators, explaining the impressive progress the industry is making to reduce its carbon footprint. A new ICS fact sheet 'Delivering CO2 Emission Reductions: Shipping is Part of the Solution' can be downloaded at http://www.ics-shipping.org/docs/shipsandco2-cop21 www.ics-shipping.org/docs/shipsandco2- HYPERLINK cop21 . According to ICS, the global industry is already delivering carbon neutral growth having reduced total CO2 emissions by more than 10% since 2007, despite an increase in maritime trade. CO2 emissions from international shipping now represent just 2.2% of the world's total CO2 emissions compared to 2.8% in 2007 (UN IMO Green House Gas Study, 2014). "These are genuine reductions through fuel efficiency, without the need for complex virtual measures such as carbon offsets," said ICS Secretary General, Peter Hinchliffe. "With bigger ships, better engines and smarter speed management, the industry is confident of a 50% CO2 reduction by 2050 when the entire world fleet will comprise super fuel-efficient ships, many using clean fuels such as LNG." But in the run-up to the Paris Conference, the shipping industry recognises that governments expect more. Shipping's global regulator, the UN International Maritime Organization (IMO) has already set a mandatory target whereby all ships built from 2025 (including those in developing nations) must be 30% more efficient than ships built in the 2000s. This applies to over 95% of the world merchant fleet, under new regulations which came into force worldwide in 2013. ICS says that IMO is the only place that can ensure that the entire world fleet will continue to deliver further CO2 reductions, regardless of a ship's flag, whilst respecting the United Nations Framework - Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) principle of "Common But Differentiated Responsibility." ICS stresses that the 10% CO2 reduction achieved since 2007 is across the shipping sector globally, not just ships registered in richer countries which are the only nations required to make commitments for land-based CO2 reductions under the current Kyoto Protocol on climate change. "The entire world fleet is about 20% more efficient than in 2005. With the support of the shipping industry, IMO has already achieved a great deal and is the only forum that can deliver further significant CO2 reductions from international shipping," said Peter Hinchliffe.

By Tenzin Lhadon The 30 November to 11 December 2015 UN Climate Change Conference in Paris ( COP21 ) placed special interest to receive the much awaited cooperation and effort from China. In particular, the focus was on whether China identifies itself as a global player, aligning with other developed nations, or among the developing nations, despite being the second largest economy. China and COP21 China is recognised as the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter and therefore, its position at the international climate change negotiations \- as one of the leading and most influential actors in addressing global climate change \- is not just crucial but sets the tone for the success of global efforts towards combating climate change in the future. Chinese President Xi Jinping's speech at the opening ceremony of the COP21 and Beijing's commitments and assurances on reducing its greenhouse gas emissions have been highly appreciated. There have been several debates and questions on whether or not China is to be regarded a developed country, because, it is the world's largest exporter, with a GDP growth rate of 50 per cent, making its economy worth $26.98 trillion \- bigger than that of the US', which stands at $22.3 trillion. A recent New York Times commentary illustrated how Beijing likes the Renminbi to be treated at par with other leading currencies, as well as for recognising China as one of the world's leading economic powers. However, contradictorily, at the COP21 , China shied away from identifying itself as a developed nation, apprehensive of the fact that it might have to face more regulation and responsibilities if categorised as a developed country. In fact, Beijing spoke on behalf of developing countries at the conference, calling on all the developed nations to reaffirm their promises to assist financially and otherwise, to help develop the poorer countries in their growth and sustainable development. China and G77 In 1964 China joined the G77 group that mostly comprises of poorer countries affected by global climate change, and where developed nations were deemed responsible for providing annual financial assistance worth $100 billion. China asserted its position as a global player at the COP21 because it not only provides Beijing with a perfect platform to raise a justified voice and act as a spokesperson for the G77 nations but also helps project itself as a benign global power. Although many observers in China felt the international climate change agreement could help with the restructuring of the economy, Chinese citizens and Beijing feel that they have a lesser say in international proposals that which are dominated by the US and EU. Many observers in China also feel the need to find a better way to communicate the country's position and improve its international standing. Despite the recent economic slowdown, Beijing's economic prowess and its participation and agreement on climate change issues have a bearing on China's global stature. China's Special Representative on Climate Change Xie Zhenhua lauded the adoption of the historic climate change agreement at COP21 , and while simultaneously reiterating China's status as a developing country, stated that it will take actions according to its national capacity and development stage. Climate Diplomacy There is a general perception that countries in the northern hemisphere are developed and that those in the southern hemisphere, are not. In the global configuration of developed and developing countries, this 'North-South divide', and the problematic nature of this division \- i.e. based on economic capabilities \- always featured in international climate change negotiations. Ideally, developed nations should shoulder more responsibility towards reducing global carbon emissions and consumption of the world's resources, as well as contribute more towards the progress of developing countries with a particular focus on those most-affected by climate change. The Beijing Review underscored the Chinese foreign ministry's call for fairness in dividing responsibilities between developed and developing countries, calling the Paris climate change agreement a "a new beginning in international cooperation." "In broad terms, richer countries wanted to build new and less restrictive processes, while developing country blocs wanted to focus on 'fairness' and historical emissions, and to protect the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities," said Yu Jie, communications strategist with China Dialogue, and former director, Climate Policy, The Nature Conservancy. However, China's proclaimed status of a developing nation has becoming increasingly disputable given how it is the world's largest CO2 emitter and an economic giant itself. In fact, the Beijing Review continues to project how China can play major role in G77/China, Brazil, South Africa, India, China (BASIC) and Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDC), to bridge differences between these groups as well as between parties in a broader manner. Reflecting on China's significant role in the international climate debate, it is apt to conclude that Beijing's encouraging stance at the COP21 is not only momentous but essential to the country's task to behave like a global player. Although it is an positive effort by China, several questions still remain on its achievements towards improving the global climate situation and the amount of efforts invested towards addressing the matter.

Boston: Massachusetts Institute of Technology , The State of Massachusetts has issued the following news release: The MIT Energy Initiative is sharing reports from the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, where MIT faculty and students are participating as observers to climate negotiations and hosting several programs, which will be covered over the coming week. As delegates work to cut global greenhouse gas emissions at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) talks in Paris, a vibrant hub of activity next door in the conference\' s "Climate Generations" area attracts people from around the world. Environmental and energy non-governmental organizations and agencies engage visitors in their work through visualizations and demonstrations, while numerous conference sessions range in topics from ocean sustainability to green growth in Africa. In one of the conference rooms on Friday, Dec. 4, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon instructs delegates on how to begin their climate negotiations. Only the Secretary-General isn\' t himself today: His part is being played by MIT Professor John Sterman. And the  delegates are actually visitors to COP21 , some here on behalf of organizations, others as interested citizens. All have gathered to play "World Climate," a live-action role-playing simulation developed by Sterman and MIT alumnus Andrew Jones of the not-for-profit Climate Interactive. "World Climate" helps policymakers, business leaders, and citizens understand first-hand the complexities of the climate and global negotiations  and what\' s needed to limit anthropogenic climate change. The "World Climate" Project was launched in August 2015 at the White House and has since been used in more than 45 countries, from Argentina to Zimbabwe  with more than 10,000 participants to date. The simulation held here at the Paris climate talks brings diverse perspectives together.  The participants came from a wide range of countries and ethnicities, and about half were women, which was great to see, Sterman says. Sterman and Jones, with MIT researcher and Climate Interactive program director Travis Franck, University of Massachusetts professor Juliette Rooney-Varga, and Climate Interactive\' s Ellie Johnston begin the role-play for the large group that has assembled. Sterman asks,  Who here is from the European Union? Hands go up.  Great! Today, you represent China. Now, who here is from China? Today, you are the United States. Taking roles completely different from their own backgrounds helps participants experience challenges they might not otherwise consider. Others such as Thango, a young woman from South Africa well versed in the issues facing her country and continent, play more familiar roles. She joins the group representing the developing nations. For Thango, it\' s an opportunity to share with fellow delegates the struggle of the developing nations to develop sustainably even as they stand to suffer the most from climate change. Discussions quickly become heated, with delegates taking their new national identities seriously. At the end of the first round of negotiations, a representative of each delegation addresses the plenary assembly. In their roles as national leaders  Barack Obama of the U.S., Vladimir Putin of Russia, Narendra Modi of India, Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande of France, and Xi Jinping of China  participants explain their emissions pledges and financial commitment or demands. Then Sterman and Franck plug the delegates\' pledges into the C-ROADS climate policy simulation developed by Sterman and Climate Interactive. C-ROADS is a peer-reviewed model that matches the dynamics of the models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, but runs in about one second on an ordinary laptop. The model and materials to facilitate the entire "World Challenge" exercise are freely available through Climate Interactive\' s website. As Sterman enters the pledges, the delegates see global emissions flatten, but when the last pledge is recorded, the model shows that the world will still warm by 3.5 degrees Celsius (6.3 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, leading to ocean acidification and other harms, including about a meter of sea level rise. Sterman and the team drape the participants with a billowing cloth to show how many parts of the world will be inundated despite the emissions reductions they have pledged.  The first round\' s pledges produced results extremely close to the initial pledges here in Paris  nowhere near enough to curb climate change, Sterman says.  When the delegates in the workshop saw this, some were shocked, because they thought their pledges would get the job done. Sterman and team give the participants another chance to reach stronger agreements. Raymond Song, a high school student from China representing the U.S. in the game, channels President Barack Obama with an impassioned plea for the other developed nations to step up  and pledges that the U.S. will do more. Intense negotiations ensue, with India agreeing to emissions cuts in exchange for financial assistance from developed nations and China pledging future emissions cuts, leading to a much more promising outcome.  The model provides people with immediate feedback on the consequences of their proposals, Sterman says.  They saw how much their countries will suffer without deeper emissions cuts, and that motivated them to reach a much better agreement, limiting warming to just about 2 C (3.6 F), the limit the nations of the world have declared must not be exceeded. The passionate dialogue generated by the mock-debate is an example of why MIT representatives are here in Paris: to help make climate issues more accessible and understandable; to convey the monumental importance of taking strong collective action to combat global climate change; and to share climate research with scientific peers and journalists. For participants in the "World Climate" role-play, the simulation has been an eye-opening experience:  I really liked the game. It made me understand how negotiations work, [and] the importance of talking about the impact of climate change on [people\' s] lives, says Thango. She plans to use the game to educate girls she works with in South Africa on how countries can use the negotiations to collectively meet global emissions reductions goals.

To coincide with COP21 - UN Conference on Climate Change in Paris, the World Affairs Council - Washington, DC (WAC-DC) will host 150 Washington-Metro area high school students and teachers for a 'Youth Forum on Climate Change' on Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at the Thurgood Marshall Center in Washington, DC. During an intensive day-long Forum, students will interact with environmental experts, scientists, and policy-shapers to understand the complex decision-making, within the international community, to achieve a universal agreement on climate change priorities. Participants will learn about issues surrounding climate change and the impact they have on the global community and have an opportunity to hear from specialists and youth leaders - including stories from the National Geographic Society - Global Events Producer Wesley Della Volla; who has just returned fromthe Conference on Youth, that took place in Paris before COP21 and drew thousands of young worldwide delegates. "Climate change is one of the important issues facing the world today. By leveraging our storytelling platforms and science and exploration programs, National Geographic and WAC-DC can play a vital role in engaging multiple audiences in insightful initiatives that will help change the world for the better," said Mr. Della Volla. Dr. Karl Hausker, Senior Fellow at the World Resources Institute will participate in a panel discussion on how youth leaders can impact climate policy. He stated: "Climate change is a global issue and it's important to understand that changes we make locally have the ability to impact the international community." Additional panel participants include Blake Lynch with Climate Reality Project; Brad Schallert with The World Wildlife Fund; Dr. Astrid Caldas with Climate & Energy Program-Union of Concerned Scientists; Megan Rosenberger with Barrels by the Bay; and Emma Berg, an undergraduate student at Georgetown University's Office of Sustainability.

Moreover,\~she appears blissfully unaware of what the\~New York Times\~once called[5]\~the magazine industry's 'dirty little secret' - that millions of copies are\~destroyed[6]\~each and every month, unsold and unread.

The Council of the European Union issued the following news release: Recalling its conclusions of July 2015 which invited the High Representative and the Commission to report back in early 2016 on the outcome of the COP21 and its implications for climate diplomacy, the Council adopted the following conclusions. The Council welcomes the Paris Climate Agreement as a landmark achievement for combating climate change, and for multilateralism. The Paris Agreement represents an ambitious, balanced, equitable and legally binding agreement. The adoption of the agreement and the cumulative announcement by the end of COP21 of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) by 187 Parties marked a decisive turning point towards comprehensive and collective global action, and, when implemented, will definitively and irreversibly accelerate the transition to a climate resilient, climate neutral global economy. The Council congratulates the Parties to the Convention, the United Nations and the Peruvian and French COP Presidencies for their tireless effort and successful work leading to the achievement of the Paris Agreement and expresses its support to the upcoming Moroccan COP22 Presidency. - Read the full text of the Council conclusions on European climate diplomacy after COP21 HYPERLINK http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/fac/2016/02/st06061_en16_pdf/ http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/fac/2016/02/st06061_en16_pdf/ Copyright Targeted News Services 30FurigayJane-5427064 30FurigayJane \</doc>

cop21 _2x.png<nl/> News broke that a 'historic' deal had been stuck in Paris by the largest gathering of states in human history at the COP21 United Nations conference meant to address climate change. Yet despite the self-congratulation, adulation from the lame-stream press, and over-glorified silliness, activists and scientists were adamant that the whole affair was simply a gigantic ruse, with Friends of the Earth International (FEI) calling the agreement £ sham'[1].<nl/> 'Rich countries have moved the goal posts so far that we are left with a sham of a deal in Paris. Through piecemeal pledges and bullying tactics, rich countries have pushed through a very bad deal,' said Sara Shaw, Friends of the Earth International climate justice and energy coordinator. Dipti Bhatnagar, Friends of the Earth International climate justice and energy coordinator, said 'Vulnerable and affected people deserve better than this failed agreement; they are the ones who feel the worst impacts of our politicians' failure to take tough enough action.'<nl/> At the core of the deal currently being touted as a success are the following policy goals:<nl/> Limit global temperature rise to 2C (3.6F), if not 1.5C Limit greenhouse gas emissions beginning somewhere between 2050 and 2100 Review of each state's contribution every five years Rich countries will finance adaptation to climate change and transfer to a renewable energy grid in poorer ones<nl/> Yet as Amy Goodman of Democracy Now! reported all week from the City of Love[2], the agreement has always been lacking several key elements. It fails to protect women and indigenous peoples and does not include a mechanism allowing for states to claim damages from the large polluter nations and corporations that have already affected millions of lives with climate change. Consider what Dr. Bill Nye told The Huffington Post at the beginning of the month about how climate change had caused the war in Syria:<nl/><nl/>Play Video[3]<nl/> The news is filled weekly with stories of natural disasters, exacerbated by climate change, that cause cataclysmic events throughout the world. And when one considers that it has recently been revealed that the Exxon oil company knew in the 1970s that climate change existed and was caused by the burning of fossil fuels[4], one can easily see a clear-cut case of industrial malfeasance that resulted in catastrophic consequences for the population, not unlike the case of tobacco companies, especially since both the petroleum and tobacco companies intentionally misled the public about the harmful affects of their products. This would create the opportunity for governments throughout the world to file massive class-action lawsuits against the oil companies and even perhaps the nation states that aided and abetted this cover-up. Furthermore, as reported on Democracy Now! when Goodman interviewed Dr. Kevin Anderson[5], things are far worse than the public believes.<nl/><nl/>Well, those of us who look at the running between the science and then translating that into what that means for policymakers, what we are afraid of doing is putting forward analysis that questions the sort of economic paradigm, the economic way that we run society today. So, we think actually, we don't question that. So what we do is we fine-tune our analysis so it fits within a sort of a the political and economic framing of society, the current political and economic framing. So we don't really say that actually, our science now asks fundamental questions about this idea of economic growth in the short term, and we're very reluctant to say that. In fact, the funding bodies often are reluctant to fund research that raises those questions. So the whole setup, not just the scientists, the research community around it that funds the research, the journalists, events like this, we're all being we're all deliberately being slightly sort of self-delusional. We all know the situation is much more severe than we're prepared to voice openly. And we all know this. So it is a this is a collective sort of fa\'e7ade, a mask that we have. [Emphasis added]<nl/><nl/>How bad is it? Consider this recent article in Science Daily[6]. A rise of 6C in ocean temperatures, something that could happen by the end of the century, would cause phytoplankton to stop photosynthesizing. These phytoplankton are responsible for 2/3 of the planet's oxygen, which would cause the planet's air to have a massive drop in oxygen content, resulting in a massive die-off of animals and humans, something not dreamed of seriously perhaps since John of Patmos delivered his Book of Revelations.<nl/> Now consider also recent developments regarding the Trans-Pacific Partnership[7]. The deal, revealed recently to massive outrage, would severely impact the ability to file class-action lawsuits against corporations and entities over consumer safety issues. Poorer nations, especially those island nations in the Pacific Ocean that face massive land loss within the next fifty years, should be able to sue for damages. Yet instead, the COP21 agreement foists onto these nations proposals for a neoliberal loan package that will entail greater hegemony for capital, parasitical debt resulting in cuts to vital social services, and no protection for those most impacted by climate change and who find themselves on the front lines of the battle. It as if an arsonist were to light your house on fire and then offer to sell you a garden hose to put the blaze out with a caveat that you become their indentured servant for an unspecified amount of time!<nl/> To quote the Bard at this point seems almost cliche. Yet I cannot help but recall the words of Cassius:<nl/> Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world<nl/>Like a Colossus, and we petty men<nl/>Walk under his huge legs and peep about<nl/>To find ourselves dishonorable graves.<nl/>Men at some time are masters of their fates:<nl/>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,<nl/>But in ourselves<nl/> HYPERLINK

A famous saying goes: To whom much is given, much is expected. This is the message that the African Development Bank (AfDB) is carrying and delivering for, and on behalf of Africa at the global conference on climate change, COP21 , which opened Monday, 30th November. "All fingers are not equal. Those who pollute more should do more in saving our planet," said AfDB President, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, who is leading his bank's team at the climate change conference in Paris. Adesina, a former Minister of Agriculture in Nigeria, knows what climate change has done and what its implications are for Africa's agricultural development if nothing is done to halt global warming. "The danger that Africa will not be able to feed itself is a real one. And if we don't have resources to adapt to climate change, Africa will not be able to unlock potential in agriculture," said Adesina, highlighting the implications of climate change variability on Africa's agricultural transformation agenda. He says the bank's message at the COP 21 was clear: a new climate deal that does not work for Africa is no deal at all. According to Dr. Adesina, the major and historic polluters must take a fair share of responsibility not only to cut their emissions but also help the suffering adapt to climate impacts. The AfDB's stance resonates with a long standing position of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN)which has been pushing for a common but differentiated principle demanding historic emitters to cut emissions to keep warming below 1.5 degrees celsius and provide funding for adaptation for vulnerable countries, most of which are in Africa. With impacts ranging from droughts and floods affecting agricultural production and water availability in the southern and Sahel regions of Africa, to shrinking rivers, a classic example being Lake Chad, African countries are hoping for a climate deal that would address these challenges both in the short and long term. "Adaptation as you know is key for Africa but this time we are demanding a high level of adaptation equal to mitigation because we know that the two are closely linked," Chair of the African Group of Negotiators Nagmeldin Elhassan told a high level panel discussion at the on-going climate talks in Paris. Nagmeldin said African heads of state are expecting nothing short of a fair and just deal for the continent, a victim of circumstances it never caused. He said adaptation would be a key issue at the COP 21 negotiating table for Africa as over the years, the African Group of Negotiators has been seeking for parity between mitigation, adaptation and provisions for enhancing means of implementation, noting the increased burden for adaptation in developing countries. "When we speak adaptation, we link it to means of implementation as a way of getting developed countries involved to provide support," the AGN chair said. And the African Union Commissioner for Rural Economy and Agriculture, Rhoda Peace Tumutsime puts it categorically that, "Unless we get a good deal here, that will help with the right technology, we will not be able to modernize and transform agriculture." The question of means of implementation is a critical component of this year's COP. According the African Climate Policy Centre (ACPC) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa-(UNECA), climate change could stimulate developing economies into adapting sustainable development paths, through entrepreneurial opportunities, and spaces for policy makers to address equity concerns in gender and youth policies. Dr. Carlos Lopez of UNECA argues Africa's possible positive outcome from danger. "Despite all the negative news that is reported about Africa, there are opportunities that we can take advantage of. It is very important to get the perceptions right about Africa's challenges and available opportunities. In all the bad news are potential areas for growth," he said. Dr Lopez said Africa has a massive advantage to develop differently by embracing the opportunities that climate change offers to develop sustainably. "It is also important for us to realize that we are not going to make it using the same carbon intensive model...let's take for example, under the 2063 agenda we have to create 122 million jobs. Following the carbon path, we will only create 54 million jobs, but what about the deficit?" he asked. Citing various examples of opportunities among which is renewable energy owing to Africa's natural potential of solar, the UNECA Chief is more than convinced that the continent should be part of the solution and "achieve industrialization which is cleaner, greener, without following the carbon model." However, the question of resources still remains. Will the climate deal offer Africa this opportunity? The next week or so will decide what and which way forward. (End) \</doc>

The following information was released by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA): At the United Nations' Conference of the Parties ( COP ) 21 in Paris, 196 countries agreed to approve a plan to combat global climate change that included a call for more vegan eating. But the meals served at the conference were far from green, prompting PETA'whose motto reads, in part, that animals are not ours to eat'to send a letter to the U.N. today calling on officials not to repeat this year's mistake and to ensure that next year's COP 22 in Morocco sets an example by serving only vegan meals. The U.N. itself has acknowledged that a global shift toward vegan eating is imperative both for slowing climate change and for eradicating global hunger, writes PETA President Ingrid Newkirk. COP leaders must surely set an example, eating as if they mean business, enjoying only planet-friendly vegan foods during COP events. For more information, please visit PETA.org or click here. PETA's letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres follows. December 14, 2015 Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Dear Mr. Secretary-General and Ms. Figueres, We send our best wishes concerning the adoption of the agreement to curb global greenhouse-gas emissions and congratulate you on including conscientious consumption as a necessary part of the strategy to reduce carbon emissions and protect our planet. It's of concern, therefore, that the meals at COP21 were far from green. A Financial Times editorial called the lack of even vegetarian food disconcerting for committed environmentalists, and a reporter for The Huffington Post wrote of being unable to find adequate wholesome meat-free options during the summit. As you must know, the meat industry is responsible for 85 percent of soil erosion in the U.S., and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considers the farming of animals to be the number one source of national water pollutison. In the U.S., more than 50 percent of all water use is dedicated to the raising of animals for food. More than one-third of fossil fuels and raw materials also go toward the farming of animals. The U.N. itself has acknowledged that a global shift toward vegan eating is imperative both for slowing climate change and eradicating global hunger. On a global scale, the farming of animals for food releases a substantial percentage of the world's greenhouse-gas emissions. The Worldwatch Institute also points out that [r]oughly 2 of every 5 tons of grain produced in the world is fed to livestock, poultry, or fish; decreasing consumption of these products, especially of beef, could free up massive quantities of grain and reduce pressure on land. You have recognized the negative impact that the farming of animals has on the planet, but COP leaders must surely set an example, eating as if they mean business, enjoying only planet-friendly vegan foods during COP events. It's imperative that COP22 not repeat the mistake of COP21 by ignoring the largest contributing factor to global climate change. May we hear from you that you're committed to making COP22 a completely vegan event in 2016? We're available to provide vegan meal planning assistance. I look forward to your reply. Very truly yours, Ingrid E. Newkirk President PETA \</doc>

U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman has requested the U.S. International Trade Commission assess the economic impact of eliminating nearly 400 tariff lines, nearly all of which have been proposed by the other World Trade Organization countries participating in the Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA). But Geneva sources characterized the product list attached to Froman's Aug. 20 letter to ITC Chairman Meredith Broadbent as representing a very broad and inaccurate picture of the state-of-play of the EGA negotiations in some respects. This is primarily because the list does not make use of "ex-outs," which narrow the scope of a product definition by limiting it to sub-categories within a tariff line, one source said. The source added that some EGA members have amended their proposals in ways that do not seem to be reflected in the list submitted to the ITC. Another Geneva source said that while the vast majority of the listed products have been nominated by the other 16 EGA members, USTR is also requesting information on goods that have not been nominated. However, this source declined to say which products those were. A USTR spokesman told Inside U.S. Trade that a product's inclusion on the list is "in no way indicative of our support for it." This is the second EGA investigation USTR has requested from the ITC, something Froman acknowledged in his letter. That first investigation covered environmental goods that had been proposed in prior negotiations at the World Trade Organization and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and have since been proposed by many of the EGA members (Inside U.S. Trade, April 11, 2014). "As you may recall, the product coverage submitted for preparation of those reports was provisional, given the absences of a universally accepted definition of an 'environmental good.' During the course of these negotiations and our preparatory consultations, a range of additional potential products have to come our attention," Froman wrote in the letter. The report Froman has requested would examine the economic impact of these tariff cuts on U.S. industries that make similar products, as well as consumers, the letter says. Because the environmental goods initiative is to be an open plurilateral, any duty reductions will be automatically extended to all WTO members on a most favored nation basis. The report will be based on 2014 trade data and will be classified for 10 years. The USTR letter includes products like agricultural biofuels such as methanol, which Geneva sources have identified as being controversial for a number of reasons. Some members have questioned whether it has "environmental credibility," or actually contributes to environmental protection. Some members have also argued the EGA is supposed to focus on industrial products and not agricultural ones, although they have not agreed on a rule stipulating this. Finally, biofuels are also subsidized in some countries and other EGA members may object to lowering tariffs on these goods if those subsidies are not addressed, according to one informed source. Other problematic products -- like nuclear power and hybrid vehicles -- were included with USTR's 2014 request on the EGA. Froman requested that the report be completed no later than Dec. 4, which also happens to be during the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as COP 21 , set for Nov. 30-Dec. 11 in Paris. EGA members have long said they hope to have some kind of outcome in the talks in time for either COP21 or the 10th WTO Ministerial, which is slated for Dec. 15-18 in Nairobi, Kenya. Members are planning to further refine what kind of outcome they will aim for during several upcoming EGA rounds, which are set for Sept. 16-22, Oct. 29-Nov. 4, and Nov. 30-Dec. 4, according to one Geneva source. But another source indicated that the agenda for the September round is still being worked on, and the primary issue being discussed will be the product coverage of the EGA. Australia, the chair of the EGA, earlier this month divided a consolidated list of roughly 650 goods nominated by members into two parts, with one list consisting of products that are broadly supported by the members and another that have not received a lot of support. That first list contains around 460 products and will be the focus of the September round, according to one Geneva source. \</doc>

The United Nations Human Rights Committee issued the following news release: The United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment, John Knox, today reminded all parties attending the Paris Climate Conference that "States' human rights obligations also encompass climate change," and urged them to adopt a rights perspective in tackling environmental issues. "Every State in the climate negotiations belongs to at least one human rights treaty, and they must ensure that all of their actions comply with their human rights obligations. That includes their actions relating to climate change," Mr. Knox said in Paris, where he is taking part in the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties - COP 21 . "I call on Governments to honour their human rights obligations as they negotiate the climate agreement," the expert stated. "Even including a reference to human rights in the agreement itself would be of great symbolic and practical importance." "It is now beyond debate that climate change threatens the enjoyment of a vast range of human rights. Moreover, it is inherently discriminatory, harming most those who have contributed least to the problem." "An increase of even 2 degrees would have devastating effects on the human rights of the most vulnerable," he said. "The Climate Vulnerable Forum countries' proposed target of 1.5 degrees would better accord with human rights principles." The Special Rapporteur also noted that States must also take human rights law into account in their actions to adapt to climate change and to undertake response measures. "Governments do not check their human rights obligations at the door when they respond to climate change," he said. "They must respect the rights of their people to receive information about proposed climate actions and to have their voices heard in the decision-making processes." Mr. Knox recalled that the Governments on the Human Rights Council have unanimously agreed that human rights obligations and principles can strengthen climate policy-making by promoting coherence, legitimacy and sustainable outcomes. "The Paris Agreement is vital to the protection of human rights of present and future generations, in every country of the world. The Agreement should recognize that fact," the Special Rapporteur concluded. Mr. Knox delivers a keynote speech Friday 11 at the inaugural conference of the Climate Law and Governance Day, at the Sorbonne. () Paris Climate Conference - COP21 : HYPERLINK http://www.cop21paris.org http://www.cop21paris.org The UN Human Rights Council appointed Professor John Knox in 2012 to serve as Independent Expert, and reappointed him in 2015 as Special Rapporteur, on the issue of human rights obligations related to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment. The Council requested Mr. Knox, a professor of international law at Wake Forest University in the United States, to clarify the application of human rights norms to environmental protection, and to identify best practices in the use of human rights obligations in environmental policy-making.

Remarks at COP21 Remarks John Kerry Secretary of State Le Bourget Paris, France December 10, 2015 ________________________________ QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, (inaudible) the update on the COP, the climate change talks? SECRETARY KERRY: Well, we're working away. Today's obviously getting down to the critical stage, and we had a very constructive meeting. We feel very good about the conversation we've just had. We need to work on language, and that what most of today and tonight will be. QUESTION: Secretary, any update on the Syria situation, on your talks with Foreign Minister Lavrov? SECRETARY KERRY: Yes. Foreign Minister Lavrov and I talked yesterday at length. I talked to Foreign Minister al-Jubeir, with Foreign Minister al-Attiyah. We are planning towards the potential of a meeting in New York. Not locked in yet, but the meeting in Saudi Arabia appears to be very constructive at this point, and we need to wait for the results of that conference. But I think everybody is moving in the direction that they want to rapidly try to get to a political process and get it underway under the UN auspices. So we've made progress, but we have some tough issues still to get over. QUESTION: And is Turkey one of those -- the relationship between Turkey and Russia, is that one of the biggest obstacles? SECRETARY KERRY: No, it's actually not. Both countries are constructively trying to move towards the political process. There are obviously tensions and there are differences, but with respect to the political process, they're both committed to trying to make that move forward. Thank you. \</doc>

The following information was released by the European Parliament: Officials from nearly 200 countries have been meeting in Paris since late November to negotiate a new climate change agreement for after 2020. This week a delegation of 15 MEPs also takes part in the COP21 conference. Members are participating in background talks with NGOs and delegations from across the world, while the EU commissioner for climate action Miguel Arias Caete will brief them on the progress of the talks on a daily basis. Live updates from Paris are available on our Storify page. As world leaders gather in Paris to hammer out a global agreement to fight climate change, a delegation of 15 MEPs heads to the COP21 talks this week to help obtain a successful result. The MEPs present include Irish EPP member Sean Kelly and UK ECR member Ian Duncan. The Parliament says that the agreement reached must be legally binding and ambitious from the outset, with five-year commitment periods. In a resolution voted on in October MEPs also proposed that a share of revenues from the EU carbon market allowances should be earmarked for climate finance, and that aviation and shipping sectors should initiate measures to curb their emissions. \</doc>

Dec 11, 2015( AutoblogGreen: HYPERLINK http://www.autobloggreen.com http://www.autobloggreen.com COP21 .Renault is looking for the proverbial home court advantage to spur electric-vehicle sales at the United Nations' COP21 United Nations Climate Change Summit in Paris. The French automaker has deployed a fleet of 200 EVs to shuttle delegates during the confab, which started November 30 and ends today. In fact, the Renault-Nissan Alliance has invested more than $4 billion in electric-vehicle technology and is looking for the green-minded event to improve the automakers' return on investment.<nl/>As part of the conference, Renault is publicizing recent patents that have led to shorter charging times and longer single-charge range figures for models such as the Renault Zoe. Renault also says its Zoe sales have surpassed 30,000 units in Europe while its Kangoo Z.E. sales have topped 20,000 units. Renault is also touting its position as the electric-vehicle expert for the Formula E electric-vehicle racing circuit. See more information from Renault here[1].<nl/>The Alliance said in September that it had moved more than 265,000 electric vehicles globally[2], or more than General Motors and Mitsubishi (the two next-largest plug-in vehicle sellers) combined, and accounts for about one in four EVs since the Nissan Leaf started sales a few years back. That said, companies such as Volkswagen and BMW had been making inroads into the Alliance's EV leadership this year, and the 2015 market share of the Alliance had been trending more towards about 18 percent through the first eight months of the year. You know, a new Nissan Leaf would probably help turn that around...<nl/> This article originally appeared on Autoblog at HYPERLINK http://www.autoblog.com/2015/12/11/renault-going-with-with-evs-at-cop21/<nl/> http://www.autoblog.com/2015/12/11/renault-going-with-with-evs-at- HYPERLINK cop21 /<nl/> [ 1]: http://%E2%80%8Bhttp://media.renault.com/global/en-gb/RenaultGroup/Media/Topic.aspx?mediaid=73754...iakitid=73753...eid=-1...d=txtlnkusaolp00000603 [ 2]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.autoblog.com/2015/09/04/renault-nissan-has-sold-more-evs-worldwide-than-its-next-two-com/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 http://www.autoblog.com/2015/09/04/renault-nissan-has-sold-more-evs-worldwide-than-its-next-two-com/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603 \</doc>

These two events seem to have spurred exceptional interest in the atom, even when the summit or the upcoming U.N. climate change conference are not explicitly mentioned. From The Los Angeles Times[1]: Nuclear energy's importance in reducing emissions is beyond dispute. In January, the International Energy Agency called nuclear power £ critical element in limiting greenhouse gas emissions.' It calculated that global nuclear generation capacity must more than double by 2050 (to about 750 gigawatts) if there is any hope of limiting temperature increases to the 2 degrees that is widely agreed as acceptable.This story[2] from Power covers the Washington summit: Even some former nuclear opponents are getting behind the energy source now. Ken Caldeira, climate scientist working for the Carnegie Institution for Science, Department of Global Ecology at Stanford University, noted that he was arrested while demonstrating against nuclear power near the front gates of the Shoreham facility which was never placed into commercial operation in the early 1980s. After studying climate science in graduate school, Caldeira changed his tune. 'The environmental community should be embracing nuclear power as one of the very few technologies that can provide high-density power in an environmentally acceptable way,' Caldeira said.Another story[3], this one tied to COP21 , tries a local angle to make a more general point: America's contributions toward combating climate change will fall short of what's expected from this country - and seem double-faced - if the U.S. is also shutting down nuclear-generating capacity, which is its largest source of carbon-free energy.This is from the Asbury Park (N.J.) Press. It makes the point that New Jersey generates most of its electricity from nuclear and yet Oyster Creek plant is closing in 2019. That's what the 'double-faced' comment refers to.<nl/>We know that COP21 might be delayed due to the terrible events in Paris last Friday. COP21 remains important, but it's not the most important thing occupying our minds right now. <nl/>Even so, the conference will happen and it will likely issue the first viable global climate change solution since the Kyoto Protocol. Nuclear energy, it is safe to say, will enjoy more attention than it has received in these quarters for some time. If we have to wait for it a bit longer, we'll wait.<nl/> [ 1]: HYPERLINK http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-bryce-nuclear-power-20151113-story.html http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-bryce-nuclear-power-20151113-story.html [ 2]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.powermag.com/experts-nuclear-power-must-be-expanded-to-limit-climate-change http://www.powermag.com/experts-nuclear-power-must-be-expanded-to-limit-climate-change / [ 3]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.app.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/11/mcgovern-nuclear-plants-help-combat-climate-change/75565866/ http://www.app.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/11/11/mcgovern-nuclear-plants-help-combat-climate-change/75565866/ \</doc>

There is "high potential" for inter-Korea cooperation on climate change within the provisions of the recent climate change accord reached in Paris, a South Korean official said Tuesday. The government source, who spoke to News 1 on the condition of anonymity, said North Korean delegates who attended the United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP 21 , showed a great deal of interest in climate change issues. "We ought to know in the environmental sector, if the two Koreas undertake initiatives together, there is definitely potential for cooperation," the source said. The landmark Paris Agreement reached Saturday was adopted by 195 countries and is to take effect in 2020. North Korea's delegation consisted of eight members, including Foreign Minister Ri Su Yong, and the South Korean official said Ri showed considerable interest at the Paris meetings. Ri reportedly said, "North Korea would actively participate to preserve the environment," and that "Workers' Party Secretary Kim Jong Un has declared a war against deforestation," during the meetings. The South Korean official said North Korea's forestry sector could provide opportunities for inter-Korea cooperation, and that Seoul needs to find models of working together with North Korea. The official added it is likely Pyongyang could take advantage of the Green Climate Fund or the Global Environment Facility for aid. In July, North Korea requested the help of South Korean forestry experts in diagnosing a disease spreading across pine trees in the Mount Kumgang Tourist Region, and Seoul agreed to send eight specialists. The Paris accord requires action from all countries, rich or poor. North Korea is one of the world's most impoverished countries and has sought U.N. aid in combating disease and food shortages. South Korean newspaper Hankook Ilbo reported Tuesday North Korea's isolated economy continues to fall behind South Korea's industrialized system, and recent statistics from Seoul's National Statistical Office indicated North Korea's economy is 1/44, or 2.3 percent, of the South's Gross National Income. \</doc>

Tokyo: Honda Worldwide has issued the following news release: Honda Motor Co., Ltd. today announced plans to participate in the LA GALERIE by WE (December 2 -9, 2015), an exhibition of low carbon solutions to take place during COP21 (The 21st session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC) which began in Paris, France on November 30, 2015. Honda will exhibit its energy management technologies that will help realize a society where people  generate and  use hydrogen as a main source of energy and  get connected for energy. At COP21 , the international society will strive to agree on a new framework to address climate change, which will be implemented from the year 2020. The LA GALERIE by WE is an exhibition of solutions for CO2 emissions reduction and energy conservation as means for addressing the issues of climate change facing all countries. LA GALERIE by WE is the only exhibition to be staged during the COP21 , and this is the first time for an exhibition to take place together with a COP. Honda has been striving to reduce CO2 through electrification of mobility products and by making progress in the development of energy management technologies that utilize renewable energy including hydrogen. With the hope that such CO2 reduction efforts of Honda will be useful in solving issues for international society, Honda is participating in this exhibition during COP21 . At its exhibition booth, Honda will introduce case studies of its CO2 reduction and energy conservation efforts inside and outside Japan. This will include demonstration testing of electric vehicle charging technologies, which Honda began in October 2015, jointly with the government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands where rising sea levels associated with global warming has been a major issue. Through the introduction of these case studies, Honda will propose a solution to global environmental issues. Moreover, Honda will exhibit various products equipped with Honda technologies to  generate and  use hydrogen as a main energy and  get connected for energy. The exhibit will include Honda\' s original Smart Hydrogen Station (SHS) equipped with the Power Creator, a high-differential-pressure electrolyzer, that  generates hydrogen from renewable energy; an FCV that  uses energy; and the Power Exporter 9000, the external power output, and Honda Power Manager, a V2H compatible DC normal charger, that supplies energy from FCVs and EVs to homes and other facilities to let the community  get connected. With this exhibit, Honda will present the unique form of a  smart community that only Honda can propose. Beyond creating mobility products, Honda has been proactively making progress in developing technologies for the generation and effective utilization of energy used by mobility products. With this approach, Honda will continue its challenges toward the realization of the joy and freedom of mobility and a sustainable society where people can enjoy life.

"If you look at the submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs, the national commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 2030) by over 150 countries, most have announced mitigation-centric targets, whereas climate change is also about adaptation. India is among the few that has given a comprehensive INDC," Ashok Lavasa, a key official of India's Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and part of its COP21 team at Paris, told IPS. A new report by Delhi-based non-profit Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) bears out India's demand at COP 21 for resources to adapt. The CSE report finds in 2013, five states were impacted and 0.35 million hectares of standing crops affected which in 2014 increased to six states being affected, and 5.5 million hectares of crops, just a month away from being harvested, were damaged. In 2015, as many as 15 states were hit and 18.23 million hectares or one-third of cropped area was damaged. The losses to farmers were in excess of 4 billion dollars. Around 62 per cent of India's people depend on agriculture. Six out of ten farmers depend on rain for irrigation and at high risk to the vagaries of changing weather patterns. Mankombu Sambasivan Swaminathan, a prominent 88-year-old geneticist known as the father of India's Green Revolution of the 1960s, said the impact of weather events on agriculture was indicated by the fact that India recently imported 10 million tonnes of pulses. "Fifty years ago when India started the green revolution, it was importing 10 million tonnes of wheat. We seem to be back to the same situation because of climate change," he said. According to a new United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) report, The Human Cost of Weather-Related Disasters 1995-2015, says in the last 20 years there have been 6,457 floods, storms, heat waves, droughts and other climatic events. Asia bore the brunt of these mainly due to its large and varied landmass, including multiple river basins, flood plains and other zones at high risk from natural hazards, plus high population densities in disaster-prone regions. Over this period, 805 million Indians have been affected out of 4.1 billion people globally. Overall, annual economic losses from disasters globally are estimated by UNISDR at between 250 billion and 300 billion dollars. Underscoring the need for resources by developing countries to adapt to climate change, Lavasa said, "India being a developing economy, there are lots of demands on its resources. To bring people above the poverty line India has to provide vast numbers of rural employment, education for all, provide basic healthcare and safe housing, provide for the huge road connectivity deficit that still cut off rural areas. Add to these energy access that a third of India's mostly rural population is deprived of. All these require huge resources." According to UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, India has 194 million or a quarter of the undernourished population in the world. India has to tackle this huge problem of food security even while 25 per cent of its total land area is undergoing desertification and 32 per cent facing degradation owing to droughts and soil erosion that are impacts of climate variability. India today has a total of around 100 million hectares officially classified as degraded land. India's experience with adverse consequences of climate change goes beyond the vulnerable farm sector. "India has more than 7,000 kilometres of coastline with as much as 15 per cent of its total 2.28 billion population. These are regions where the poorest people reside and face the fury of cyclones and tsunamis. India also has more than 1,200 islands that are equally vulnerable like small island nations," Lavasa said, adding that 12 or one-third of Indian states are in the Himalayan range affected by glacier melts, which are also affecting India's major water sources. "So the argument which has been made by India for the COP21 climate deal is that because of its diverse and acute vulnerability, India is keen to act, but it has always said that because these problems have been created historically by the action of many other countries and now there is a realization that it is a global problem. Therefore not only has there to be a global resolve to solve the problem but there have to be global resource to solve it," Lavasa told IPS. "(The climate deal discussions) cannot leave countries to themselves and say you (developing countries) do things according to your capabilities and we (developed economies) will do things according to our capabilities and that's the end of the story," Lavasa added. "The negotiators at the climate talks in Paris, need to be mindful of the impact of changing climate on agriculture, and the devastating consequences it has on farmers as well as the food security prospects of the world," said CSE's Chandra Bhushan. The CSE report is also a peek into the future-what we should expect as our planet continues to heat up due to the incessant increase in greenhouse gas emissions," Bhusan added. (End) \</doc>

The following information was released by the Asian Development Bank (ADB): Opening remarks at the ADB COP21 side event: Promoting Investment in Innovative Low-Carbon Technology held 8 December 2015 in the Japanese Pavillion, Le Bourget, Paris, France. Introduction Distinguished participants, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. On behalf of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), I would like to welcome you all to this side event of the 21st Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ). I would like to start by thanking our co-organizer for this side event, the Ministry of the Environment, Japan. Collaboration between ADB and the Government of Japan regarding climate change Collaboration between ADB and the Government of Japan on climate change has a long history starting in 19911. COP21 meeting. Climate actions and importance of climate technologies The actions toward tackling of climate change are at a critical stage. The impacts and consequences of climate change pose the greatest threat to human society and they are expected to become more intense in the coming years, if the increase of global mean temperature is not kept below 2 degrees Celsius. Crucial to meeting this target is the new international agreement by all nations at the ongoing COP21 . ADB's contribution ADB is strongly committed to climate action, and is working with development partners and engaging the private sector to support developing member countries (DMCs) transition to low-carbon and climate-resilient economies. ADB has consistently delivered more than $3 billion annually for climate change mitigation and adaptation. In 2014, ADB invested $766 million in private sector climate mitigation projects. ADB will double its annual climate financing to $6 billion by 2020, up from the current $3 billion. $4 billion is for mitigation and $2 billion is for adaptation. ADB's spending on tackling climate change will rise to around 30% of its overall financing by the end of this decade. Objectives of the Japan Fund for the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JFJCM) The Japan Fund for the Joint Crediting Mechanism or JFJCM is new collaboration with the Government of Japan to promote the transfer of the low carbon technology. ADB established the JFJCM in 2014 with contribution from the Ministry of Environment, Japan. The fund aims to address the barriers to adoption of advanced low-carbon technologies such as high up-front costs and perceived risk that the technology will not perform to expectations. The fund will provide grants for the incremental cost of adoption or the cost of deploying advanced low carbon technologies from the cost of "business as usual" technology. Areas for financing include technologies for smart grid, waste to energy, advanced renewable energy systems, and energy efficient infrastructure. The CO2 emission reduction by these mitigation technologies in the projects will be certified by the Joint Crediting Mechanism and will be contributed to host country's and Japan's CO2 emission reduction targets. A total of $31.6 million has been contributed to the JFJCM. Two JFJCM supported projects are being implemented and processed. The first project for a grant of $ 5 million to a solar power project in Maldives and the other is a grant of $10 million for an energy distribution project in Mongolia. Several such projects are being developed in Viet Nam, Cambodia, and Myanmar on the energy, and water sector. For this side event, ADB aims to share the experience of the JFJCM on the transfer of the low carbon technology. We will also discuss the expectation of the JCM and the JFJCM with MOEJ and developing member countries. I wish you all a productive discussion. Thank you. \</doc>

The World Council of Churches issued the following news release: "In COP21 we decide whether the glass is half full or half empty, but the glass must be transparent", tweeted climate activist Yeb Sano at the end of a day full of activities engaging leadership and staff members of the World Council of Churches (WCC), the Lutheran World Federation (LWF) and ACT Alliance, at the Ecumenical Centre, in Geneva, Switzerland. Sano and his partners on the Peoples' Pilgrimage were welcomed at the main door of the centre by Dr Isabel Apawo Phiri, associate general secretary at the WCC, Rev. Dr Martin Junge, general secretary of the LWF, and Pauliina Parhiala, ACT Alliance's director and chief operating officer. The pilgrims, who began walking from Rome to Paris 36 days ago, want to deliver a strong message of climate justice to the leaders gathered for the COP21 . At her welcoming speech to the pilgrims, Phiri pointed out that the People's Pilgrimage is also a clear expression of the Pilgrimage of Justice and Peace, a call from the 10th Assembly of the WCC. As part of the programme of the pilgrims at the ecumenical centre, a panel on the approach to faith organizations to COP21 was organized. "Facing the climate crisis: ethical and spiritual challenges" had the participation of Nadia Gonella (Peoples' Pilgrimage), Martin Kopp (LWF), Vitumbiko Chinoko (ACT Alliance) and was moderated by WCC's programme executive for Care for Creation and Climate Justice, Dr Guillermo Kerber. Kerber evaluated the panel as a positive experience. "All panelists agreed that COP21 will just be a relevant milestone in the longer journey for climate justice", he said, stressing that "mobilization of faith communities, such as the various pilgrimages and fast for the climate campaign, contribute to raising awareness and involving more people to address the climate crisis", he added. One of the key points of consensus among participants was also the fact that the international community has the opportunity to deliver a fair, ambitious and binding treaty, as faith and spiritual leaders recently requested, to keep average temperature rise below 1.5degreeC. An increase beyond this would imply further dramatic consequences to the most vulnerable populations suffering the consequences of climate change. One of the pilgrims, Alan Silyan of the Philippines, commented, "Climate change has evolved from a political to a moral issue. If we're disconnected from our environment, we're disconnected from our spirituality." Copyright Targeted News Services AutoTriage6yd 151106 30VitinMar-5345557 30TagarumaMar \</doc>

COP21 , the United Nations climate Change conference , beginning on November 30th, will have over 190 members of the UN convene in Paris to discuss legally binding agreements on addressing climate change. The event has been heralded as the last chance for world leaders to address climate change. Unfortunately, the COP21 isn't going to save us in time. According to the proposals presented by 146 countries and the European Union (which make up about 86 percent of global emissions), we would still see global temperatures rise three degrees celsius by 2100, one degree more than the prescribed two degree limit. Though one degree may not seem like much, it would cause severe droughts in the western United States which would mean food shortages and desertification, according to National Geographic. As far as sea level rise is concerned, tens of thousands of homes would be flooded in the Bay of Bengal. For us in Hawaii, that means we could see Aiea become the new Waikiki. What do we do? Though there is little information about how countries are planning to achieve their carbon reduction goals, one thing is for sure: carbon pricing is clearly not a big enough part of the conversation. If it were, we would certainly be able to avoid breaking the 2 degree threshold. Carbon pricing is the most effective solution for reducing CO2 emissions. Here's how it works. A fee is assessed on all fossil fuels. That fee will rise every year until industries can no longer find it profitable to invest in fossil fuels. As a result, they will be forced to invest in the only other option available: renewable energy. Bill Gates thinks it's a good idea. So does former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich. At least three Nobel Laureates also agree. One of those three, economist Joseph Stiglitz, insists that a carbon tax is our only viable option for stopping climate change. Revenue Neutral Carbon Tax A carbon tax could hurt the world's most economically disadvantaged people and potentially destabilize the economy. This is true if we're talking about a pure carbon tax. A revenue neutral carbon tax, however,would do the opposite. Such a tax would rebate all money generated from the fees back to the public or through other such mechanisms as reducing income taxes. It certainly worked in Vancouver. Vancouver, B.C. implemented a revenue neutral carbon tax in 2008 and after only five years was able to reduce gasoline consumption by seven times while maintaining economic stability. A model for a US revenue neutral carbon tax would not only maintain economic stability however, but grow it. According to a report from Regional Economic Models Inc., such a proposal would create 2.8 million jobs in just 20 years and increase the national GDP by $1.3 trillion. Methane Tax Carbon emissions isn't all we're up against. With the animal agricultural industry producing 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions (versus 13 percent from the entire transportation industry), we need to address methane emissions as well, if not more. Methane gas is up to 86 times more potent than CO2. So what can we do about that? Enact a methane tax, of course. Just as a carbon tax would force industries to divest from fossil fuels as their prices rise, so too would the animal agricultural industry be forced to change its practices to avoid taxation. Be it methane or carbon, the answer is clear: tax greenhouse gasses. Yet the UN seems to be unable to get the message. Perhaps it will take a while to get the whole world on the same page. At the end of the day, it's probably just not very convenient to put the safety of the planet before profits. \</doc>

For 20 years running, the U.N. has held an annual conference on climate change. Never in the two decades of meetings, talks and lobbying have the assembled delegates managed to procure what is needed most: a legally binding and universal agreement on how to slow the rise of global temperatures. They came close in 1997 (Kyoto) and in 2009 (Copenhagen), but those two conferences, like the other 18, failed to achieve this goal. The importance of the 21st Conference of the Parties in Paris cannot be overstated. The host city is reeling from a deadly terrorist attack on November 13 that left over 120 dead and 300 wounded. A number of planned demonstrations, concerts and festivities will be canceled, but the core event of COP21 will go on: starting on November 30, leaders and high-level officials from 196 parties have 12 days to reach an accord that could save the planet. The primary objective of COP21 is to divvy up carbon cuts to the developing and developed nations to reduce worldwide greenhouse gas emissions and cap global warming at 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit over pre-Industrial Revolution levels by 2100. That's roughly the point at which, research suggests, the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica will start to melt at an unstoppable pace, prompting a catastrophic rise in global sea levels. Parts of the world will be hit by devastating floods while others will experience severe droughts that will lead to famine as crops fail and potable water supplies dry up. HYPERLINK http://www.newsweek.com/cop21-paris-attacks-climate-talks-security-395012 http://www.newsweek.com/ HYPERLINK cop21 -paris-attacks-climate-talks-security-395012 Related: After Paris Attacks, Tenor of COP21 Climate Talks Might Change Negotiating how to limit global warming may prove difficult; achieving a binding agreement will prove even harder. "We have a long history of countries saying they'll do something and then not doing it," says Scott Barrett, a professor of natural resource economics at Columbia University. The protocol that came out of the Kyoto climate conference in 1997, for example, was legally binding, committing 37 industrialized countries and the European Union to reducing their emissions by an average of 5 percent against 1990 levels from 2008 to 2012. But it collapsed. Though the U.S. signed the document, Congress later refused to ratify it. Other countries, including Canada and Japan, failed to meet their targets--without repercussion. And developing countries, such as China and India, were exempt from emissions reductions entirely. In 2009, COP15 again tried to reach a universal, lasting agreement. After days of fraught negotiations, the conference frantically pulled together a document at the last minute called the Copenhagen Accord. It included an agreement that deep cuts to worldwide emissions were required and that global temperatures should be limited to the 3.6-degree increase, but there was a crucial deficiency: It wasn't legally binding. The conference as whole voted only to "take note" of it. Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador and Cuba didn't agree to the accord--their delegates criticized the fact that they were excluded from the drafting process by the larger, wealthier member states. Bill McKibben, co-founder of 350.org, a New York-based climate change campaign, told news outlets at the time that the Copenhagen Accord was " a declaration that small and poor countries don't matter."' This time around, to engender stronger feelings of inclusion and generate greater participation, the U.N. has asked each member state to submit an Intended Nationally Determined Contribution prior to the meeting. Essentially, this allows each country to list the emissions reductions it intends to make by 2025 or 2030, as well as other planned efforts to combat climate change. The idea is that the conference can then draft a protocol knowing in advance what member states are prepared to accept. Despite the inclusionary approach, many countries still seem resistant: By the submission deadline of October 1, 50 of the 196 parties had not sent in their INDCs. But it's not all silence and missed deadlines. India, which has proved disagreeable in the past, appears eager to help make COP21 a success, says Liz Gallagher, who leads the Climate Diplomacy program at the nonprofit environmental policy organization E3G, which is headquartered in London. According to Gallagher, India is likely to come to the conference in a cooperative mood. The country has begun investing heavily in solar power development, and Gallagher believes Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend COP21 hoping to win foreign investment in this project. The heroes of COP21 could be the U.S. and China. Though China is the world's biggest carbon emitter and historically intransigent on environmental issues, it is now focused on investing in renewable energy and reducing its domestic pollution, which is responsible for the deaths of 1.6 million Chinese people a year, according to scientists at the University of California, Berkeley. Beijing has already agreed to ensure that its emissions will peak around 2030. R HYPERLINK http://www.newsweek.com/cop21-clean-energy-paris-climate-talks-393928 http://www.newsweek.com/ HYPERLINK cop21 -clean-energy-paris-climate-talks-393928 elated: COP21 Meanwhile, U.S. President Barack Obama has been stressing the importance of action on climate change throughout his second term in office. From June 25, 2013, to June 25, 2015, the president made some mention of climate change once every 4.5 days, according to the White House. COP21 is the last big conference before his presidency ends, and Obama will want to round off his climate legacy with a decisive win. The president recently garnered praise from various environmental campaigners after he rejected an application to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to Nebraska. Like China, the U.S. has already made an emissions reduction commitment--vowing to cut its emissions by 26 to 28 percent, compared with 2005 levels, by 2025. Even with the cooperation of the U.S., China and India, as well as that of the climate-conscious EU, problems remain. Oil-rich nations, such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia, are likely to be troublemakers at COP21 , says Gallagher. They risk losing revenue if other countries shift to renewable energy sources or cut down on oil exports in an attempt to curb their emissions. Several other oil-exporting nations, including Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Nigeria and Angola, had yet to submit their INDCs by press time, indicating an unwillingness to engage on the issue of climate change. A second set of holdouts, according to Gallagher, are Bolivia and Venezuela, whose socialist governments resent what they perceive as interference from bigger, richer countries. Venezuela and Cuba--which opposed the Copenhagen Accord--also had yet to release their pledges. Though developing nations will have more input this time around, there is little to deter countries from ignoring whatever deal is made. Though Gallagher and Barrett both say some form of universal agreement will be reached, they are unsure whether it will be any good, practically speaking. For example, dissenting countries, Gallagher says, may water down the wording of any accord, ensuring that the language is kept as vague as possible. And 12 days may not be enough time to agree on carbon cuts, funding and how to slow the rise in global temperatures. COP21 has set itself a very ambitious goal; it is looking unlikely that it will meet it. \</doc>

The World Council of Churches issued the following news release: "We believe that you will serve the world by showing the best of human creativity and capacity", said Rev. Dr Olav Fykse Tveit, the general secretary of the World Council of Churches (WCC), on 8 December in his address to the High Level Segment of the COP21 international climate conference in Paris. Tveit was speaking on behalf of more than 150 leaders from various religious traditions on all inhabited continents who signed a statement last October which they submitted to Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The WCC general secretary pointed out that COP21 is "the right moment for real and visionary leadership, and it is an irrefutable moral duty for all governments to agree on concrete and measurable steps towards global climate justice and partnerships for climate resilience." The Statement of Faith and Spiritual Leaders to the High-Level Ministerial Segment of the COP21 , mentioned by Tveit, was previously distributed by the UNFCCC to all parties negotiating in Paris. The signatories of the statement called for a fair, ambitious and binding global deal applicable to all countries to phase out greenhouse gas emissions and phase in 100% renewable energy by the middle of the century, to stay below 1.5-2degreeC of warming above pre-industrial levels. " COP21 COP21 represents. "The people around the world who suffer today from the effects of climate change, and will do so tomorrow, have hope and the right to hope that you will make significant contributions to reduce the world's carbon emissions", he said. Tveit's message of hope also acknowledged changes that already are happening worldwide. "Many are changing their priorities and their life styles to protect the globe. So many are with us, physically or symbolically, on a pilgrimage of climate justice and peace", he said. Tveit went on and shared that many in the financial and business sectors are changing their investments and practices, turning towards de-carbonization, renewable energy and new methods of production and transportation. Earlier the same day, Tveit attended the 7th Sustainable Innovation Forum, at the Stade de France, promoted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). He was one of the speakers on a round table addressing the role of ethics & faith in climate solutions. He also met privately with environmentalist, former U.S. vice-president, and Nobel peace laureate Al Gore. Copyright Targeted News Services AutoTriage6yd 151210 30VitinMar-5379487 30VitinMar \</doc>

ARUSHA, Dec. 12 -- The Secretary General of the East African Community, Amb. Dr Richard Sezibera has cautioned the international community that the world was at a crossroads and the outcome of the Paris Climate Conference shall either bequeath a better, safer planet to future generations "or destroy our common heritage and our shared humanity". Speaking at the 21st Session of the Conference of Parties ( COP21 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), also serving as the 11th Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP11) currently underway in Paris, France, the Secretary General expressed the wishes and expectations of the East African citizens on the Paris Climate Change Talks and reckoned that the Agreement must take into consideration the interest of the vulnerable and poor by ensuring that adaptation is equally prioritized and differentiated responsibilities of developed and developing countries reflected in the Agreement. Amb. Sezibera further urged that issues related to loss and damage associated with climate change impact must be firmly anchored in the agreement through the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage and country ownership of adaptation and mitigation programmes and projects, and ensure transparency in the provisions of financial, technology transfer and other forms of support including capacity building which should be customized to specific needs of beneficiary countries. "EAC is ready and committed towards supporting implementation of the Paris Agreement by supporting EAC Partner States through the process of ratification of the agreement to pave way for its early entry into force in 2020", the Secretary General reiterated. The EAC official reaffirmed the region's commitment to aligning its existing Regional Climate Change Policy (2011), the 5 year EAC Climate Change Strategy and Master Plan (2033) to the Paris Agreement as well as fast tracking the process for enacting a Regional Climate Change Bill through the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA). He called for international support in the capitalization of the EAC Climate Change Fund through pioneering the accreditation of EAC as a Regional Implementing Entities (RIE) under the Adaptation Fund (AF) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF). Speaking at the African Day of COP21 convened under the theme; Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCS): implications, prospects and Africa's readiness to contribute to climate solutions, the Secretary General applauded the EAC Partner States for submitting their INDCs to address climate change mitigation and adaptation. "Information included in the INDCs should facilitate negotiations and deliver a new Climate Agreement in Paris" said the Secretary General. He stated that region was looking forward to the implementation of INDCs based on associated support requirements of finance, technology transfer, and capacity building, to be provided by the developed countries. He asserted that EAC was fully in support of the continental climate resilient and low carbon development initiatives and programmes such as the Africa Climate Smart Agriculture Alliance (ACSA); the African Adaptation and Loss and Damage Initiative, and the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI) launched in Paris. The newly established EAC Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (EACREEE) stands to contribute to the implementation of the latter Initiative.

With the start of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 21 ), environmentalists, journalists, and policymakers turn their eyes to Le Bourget, France, anticipating a plan to limit greenhouse gas emissions and curb warming. As medical students, we too turn our eyes to Le Bourget. The approaching negotiations will have a profound impact on human health, and as a result, on our futures as clinicians. Projections from the World Health Organization, World Bank, and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggest that climate change will affect billions of people and present a major public health crisis in the coming decades. Reports from The Lancet\~Commission on Health and Climate Change have echoed these concerns, concluding that climate change is the "biggest global health threat of the 21st century." Many of the health impacts of climate change are direct. Warming can increase transmission rates and broaden ranges of vector-borne diseases like malaria, dengue fever, tick-borne encephalitis, Lyme disease, and schistosomiasis. With malaria, for example, higher temperatures allow the parasite to mature exponentially more rapidly. Even with modest warming, tens of millions more people will be exposed to malaria. Notably, dengue fever stands to spread even more widely than malaria. Increased humidity and mosquito prevalence may put billions more at risk for contracting the virus. Climate change also has a direct impact on the extremity of weather events. Droughts, heat waves, floods, and storms all stand to increase in severity and frequency. Without major changes to our energy system, the new norm will include "unprecedented" disasters time and again. These events may lead to acute medical problems that can be especially devastating to developing health systems. The indirect consequences of climate change on health are less obvious but perhaps of even greater importance. A warming planet spells a range of health problems resulting from an unstable food and water supply, massive migratory upheavals, increased armed conflict, and other disruptions to the essential infrastructure of society. Climate change threatens basic human needs, risking the stability required for good health. As medical students and future physicians, we will spend much of our time and this nation's resources treating and managing diseases already affecting our patients. The cost-effective and lifesaving power of preventive medicine reminds us that taking action early in the course of a disease often allows for greater quality of life at a reduced cost. Our perspective on\~climate change should be the same. With catastrophe looming on the horizon, we need to take action as soon as possible. If no substantial agreement emerges at COP 21 , we will continue down a path that forces us to reactively treat the consequences of our short-sighted actions. But, if we instead forge a comprehensive emissions reduction plan, we have the opportunity to prevent climate change from defining the next generation of medicine. Riley Brian, Cheyenne Smith and Andrew Wilmington are first-years at the\~Pritzker School of Medicine. \</doc>

The following information was released by the United Nations: Less than two months after 196 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) adopted the Paris Agreement, the global community is already seeing signs of it being a decisive turning point, according to a senior UN official dealing with climate issues. A month and a half since 196 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) adopted the Paris Agreement, the global community is already seeing signs of it being a decisive turning point, according to a senior UN official dealing with climate issues. "Much has been happening since Paris the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed that 2015 was the hottest year on record, not just by a little but by a lot," Janos Pasztor, who was today appointed as Senior Adviser to the Secretary-General on Climate Change, told reporters at a briefing in New York. For the past year, Mr. Pasztor had been leading the UN's climate change efforts as Assistant Secretary-General on Climate Change, working towards last December's 21st United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ). Recalling that UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has invited world leaders to a signing ceremony on 22 April which coincides with International Mother Earth Day the climate advisor noted that it will be the first day the Agreement is open for formal signatures. He said Mr. Ban is urging countries to quickly ratify the agreement so it can enter into force as soon as possible, adding that the event will also be an opportunity to discuss efforts to implement national climate plans, known as INDCs, and to generally "maintain the momentum of the action agenda." Meanwhile, he underlined the Secretary-General's recent call for a doubling of investments in clean energy by 2020, which he said was greeted "very positively" by many investors. "The Paris Agreement sent a clear message to markets and investors that it's time to get serious about climate change. We're now seeing evidence that the signal has been received loud and clear," Mr. Pasztor stressed. Meanwhile, in a statement issued by the UN Spokesperson's Office, Mr. Ban expressed his deep gratitude for Mr. Pasztor's "dedicated service and leadership" over the past quarter of a century with the world body on the key global challenges of climate change, energy and sustainability. "In his new role as Senior Adviser to the Secretary-General on Climate Change, Mr. Pasztor will support efforts of the Secretary-General to mobilize world leaders and all sectors of society to implement the landmark Paris Agreement," the statement indicated. \</doc>

The International Energy Agency issued the following news release: A peak in global energy-related emissions could be achieved as early as 2020 and at no net economic cost, the International Energy Agency said on Monday in its new World Energy Outlook Special Report on Energy and Climate Change. The Agency showed how to achieve an early peak in emissions as one of four key pillars that it believes are needed to make the upcoming UN climate talks a success, from an energy perspective. The world is at a critical juncture in its efforts to combat climate change, with momentum building towards the 21st UN Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) in Paris in December 2015. World greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions from energy production and use are double the level of all other sources combined, meaning that action to combat climate change must come first and foremost from the energy sector. The IEA proposes that the following four key pillars are needed to make COP21 a success, from an energy perspective: 1. Peak in emissions - set the conditions to achieve an early peak in globalenergy-related emissions. 2. Five-year revision - review national climate targets regularly, to test the scope to raise ambition. 3. Lock in the vision - translate the world's climate goal into a collective long-term emissions goal. 4. Track the transition - establish a process for tracking achievements inthe energy sector. "As IEA analysis has repeatedly shown that the cost and difficulty of mitigating greenhouse-gas emissions increases every year, time is of the essence," said IEA Executive Director Maria van der Hoeven. "It is clear that the energy sector must play a critical role if efforts to reduce emissions are to succeed. While we see growing consensus among countries that it is time to act, we must ensure that the steps taken are adequate and that the commitments made are kept." A peak in global energy-related emissions could be achieved as early as 2020 if governments implement just five key policy measures, as shown in the IEA's "Bridge Scenario". This major climate milestone is possible utilising only proven technologies and policies, and without changing the economic and development prospects of any region. Intended as an effective bridge to further action, the five measures focus on:  Increasing energy efficiency in the industry, buildings and transport sectors  Reducing the use of the least-efficient coal-fired power plants and banning their construction  Increasing investment in renewable energy technologies in the power sector from $270 billion in 2014 to $400 billion in 2030  Gradual phasing out of fossil-fuel subsidies to end-users by 2030  Reducing methane emissions in oil and gas production For countries that have submitted climate pledges for COP21 , the proposed strategy identifies possible areas for over-achievement. For those that have yet to make a submission, it sets out a pragmatic baseline. The IEA report highlights the need for climate pledges for COP21 to be viewed as the basis from which to create a "virtuous circle" of increasing ambition, and advocates, as its second pillar, a five-year review cycle to test the scope for further action. Both the situation and the solutions are evolving rapidly: the world's shrinking "carbon budget" means that any delay in taking action can be costly, while the pace of energy sector innovation means that a five-year review would allow national targets to keep up with events and help build investor confidence. As its third pillar, the IEA recommends that the goal of keeping the increase in long-term average global temperatures to below two degrees Celsius (2 degreeC) also be expressed as a long-term greenhouse-gas emissions target, making it more straightforward to apply in the energy sector. Doing so would help anchor future expectations, guide investment decisions, provide an incentive to develop new technologies, drive needed market reforms and spur the implementation of strong domestic policies, such as carbon pricing - all of which are necessary to meet the 2 degreeC goal. The final pillar proposed by the IEA report is that the COP21 agreement establish a strong process for tracking progress in the energy sector. Tracking national progress would both provide clear evidence of results, reassuring the international community that others are acting diligently, and identify countries that are struggling with implementation, enabling assistance to be provided if needed. In recognition of this need, the IEA report sets out appropriate metrics to monitor energy sector decarbonisation. "Any climate agreement reached at COP21 must have the energy sector at its core or risk being judged a failure," said IEA Chief Economist Fatih Birol. "Climate pledges submitted for COP21 are an important first step to meeting our climate goal, and our report shows that they will have a material impact on future energy trends." Collectively, countries accounting for around two-thirds of global energy-related emissions have either formally submitted their climate pledges for COP21 (known as "Intended Nationally Determined Contributions [INDCs]") or have signalled their possible content (such as China). A first assessment reveals these pledges will have a positive impact on future energy trends, but fall short of the major course correction required to meet the 2 degreeC goal. The assessment of the INDCs shows that the growth in global energy-related emissions slows but does not peak by 2030. The link between economic growth and emissions weakens significantly, but is not broken: the economy grows by 88% from 2013 to 2030 and energy-related carbon dioxide emissions by 8%. Renewables are the leading source of electricity by 2030, but inefficient coal-fired power generation capacity declines only slightly. Such findings underline the need for ambitious national pledges for COP21 that can act as a solid base upon which to build stronger action, such as those enabled by a transfer of resources (technology or finance). The World Energy Outlook Special Report on Energy and Climate Change will be available for free download shortly. Further information related to the World Energy Outlook Special Report on Energy and Climate Change, including the link for a free download and materials from the launch presentation, will be availabe on this webpage shortly.

"I'm heartened by the progress being made here in Paris and am optimistic that the outcome of the negotiations will prove the international community is ready to meet the challenge of climate change head on and do what is necessary to keep the future of our children and our planet safe. We cannot afford to delay action any longer."

In case you missed it, almost 200 nations signed an agreement pledging to hopefully limit rising global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050 or 2 degrees Celsius by 2070. Even the United States and China signed on, despite both being loth to agree to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. While the whole affair seemed miraculous, in many ways it was business as usual. Of course the signing parties promised to limit global climate change. Any self-respecting national would do so, lest it be seen as complicit or implicit in the suffering of future generations. Yes, the international community did agree something had to be done. The implementation will be much trickier. Fiona Harvey of the Guardian remarked Dec. 13 that this was the world's greatest diplomatic success. When previous benchmarks include the Treaty of Versailles, the regular dealings of the U.N. Security Council and the Israel-Palestine peace process, I suppose this is true. When every nation, no matter how small, has a say at a massive forum, this is indeed a special moment. In the next few months we will start to see the finger pointing, name calling and general wilting of this deal as wealthy nations call on the developing ones to change, and developing nations demand the developed world pay for hampering their development. Even more bruising will be President Obama facing down a Republican Senate likely hell-bent on making another political fight. Obama will once again be accused of somehow violating the constitutional purview of the Senate to ratify treaties, and Obama will be cornered into soapboxing about the moral implications of not agreeing to this pledge. Even some Democrats from coal country will have a hard time ignoring the angry miners. For those who know me well, it is a poorly-held secret that my politics are quite ... rarified. On a good day, I have monarchist and globalist tendencies. Like many people likely too well-read and too educated for their own good, the idea of a philosopher empress or emperor leading us into a new golden age sounds thrilling. I love the Lord of the Rings, and even more the idea of the return of the king. I keep thinking, especially as a Christian, how no politician I can think of has been named in the last century a saint by any church. Curious, however, is how the Russian Orthodox Church in the last decade made Nicholas the II a saint and martyr. What does this have to do with the climate conference and political fighting? Surprisingly, a great deal. Considering the structure of the global agreement and the lack of any cohesive instrument of implementation, it will be a wonder if anything gets done by the deadlines. The U.N., despite its failings, has an extraordinary capacity for good. A vast amount of good research, good ideas and good work on behalf of minorities, women, children and the poor comes out of its many organizations across the world. Some of the millennium development goals have even been reached. For example, extreme poverty, defined as people living on less than $1.25 per day, has been reduced from 47 percent of the world population to 14 percent. Cheers to some good progress. Yet, everyone gets on board with helping poor people by one method or another. We just fight about how to do it. Global climate change is another issue entirely. The issue of united, multilateral action on the part of 196 countries is like getting the entire family - including both sets of grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins - to agree on what movie to go see on holidays. It almost never happens unless you come from a family where Granny is more or less in charge. This is because, quite plainly, the U.N. is not a government. It is barely a government organization. It is a potent mixture between a non-governmental organization , university research department and a debate club. Dictators and autocrats rub shoulders with democrats and Nobel Peace Laureates. It is, in a word, a mess. The problem with international cooperation and governance begins even closer to home. Our own governmental structures are barely functioning. The military is strapped with mandatory sequestration; social security likely will not exist in 50 years; and the Affordable Care Act has done only a haphazard job of fixing the trudging beast known as American healthcare. Let's add to the list: political deadlock; demagogues on the campaign trail; crushing rates of student debt; and continually large levels of underemployment. If the U.N.'s problem is that no overarching social contract exists for the world, our problem is that our social contract is either tearing or is shredded already. The preamble and mission statement of the U.S. constitution says, "We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America." Justice is not being established. The struggle for civil rights for all has never ended. Women are still being paid less than men. People of color are overrepresented in the penal system and poverty statistics, but underrepresented (and maybe even poorly represented) in the halls of power. Transgender people are being murdered on the streets for who they are. We are not domestically tranquil. The news cannot seem to report enough the number of shootings taking place every day in this country. Setting massacres with awful assault weapons aside, people, young people, are murdering each other with handguns on the streets every day. Let's take the common defense. I don't think massive budget cuts defend us well, but neither do misappropriation of defense budgets for idiotic and useless military research programs. As a serviceperson told me once, the defense cuts are just as bad for the military as being thrown massive amounts they don't know what to do with. The general welfare I do not see. The wealthiest nation in the world should not have the income disparities, poverty traps, lack of cohesive safety nets, crumbling infrastructure and patchwork regulation we have. We are smarter and better than that, but the results of the last days seem to indicate otherwise. To secure the blessing of liberty for ourselves and our posterity, we need a radically different political, economic and social settlement. This would likely require nothing less than a new constitution, a new way of government and a drastic rethinking of our societal values. Here comes the tangent, but stick with me. I have watched the "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" trailer many times, and each time I get goose bumps. Part of it is just a love for that fictional universe, but there is another reason: it is a universe of noble, epic struggles. We lack that. I am not saying we should look to paint people as Sith lords or Imperials and go kill them. I am, however, saying that we need to seek again for deep purposes and grand societal goals. There is no denying that the status quo is both toxic and unsustainable. Quite literally our current local, national and global state is killing us. We were once a people that strove for the stars, not for the next windfall bonus or one-night stand. We believed in more than just cynicism and sex. Not long ago in this same galaxy we believed in securing by whatever means necessary justice, tranquility, the common good and the blessing of liberty for ourselves and everyone else. We fought and won wars for those and lesser ideals. I am not pining, as many do, for a bygone golden age. I am pining for a golden future. I am pining for us to struggle for that future. We as a nation, as a species, were meant for glory. We were meant to reach for the stars and take them into our fold. Our world, our Earth, our Terra was meant to be the beacon of light in the darkness of space. Humans have the capacity for endless cruelty and greed. We know this. We also have the capacity for endless love, compassion and empathy. I do not have faith in the agreement out of the Paris climate summit because it is shortsighted. The U.N. is shortsighted. In many ways, the U.S. was built to be shortsighted, too. The potent cocktail of democratic processes for just about everything, mass media and instantly gratifying consumerism provide an environment of endless opportunism, profiteering and rent seeking in institutions that need it least. The agreement, the U.N. and the U.S. were all built on the foundation of maximal participation and minimal disagreement. In the vein of the Third French Republic, these participatory artifices were and are meant to be that which divides us least. Unfortunately, this desire to offend no one leaves everyone grossly dissatisfied and most political jobs half done. I exhort us to do better. I am not exhorting us to have an all-powerful monarch over the United States or even the world. I am, however, calling us to deeply consider a global constitution, a global social contract, a foundation for a liberal, democratic and progressive global order. Moreover, we should strive for the greatest of heights, not merely that which sells well. We deserve something imperial, if at least for our goals to be measured in the currency of glory, beauty and new levels of human flourishing. So, my friends, as you continue to study and work in earnest in the days to come, think of what could be. We have the historic opportunity to be architects of a future beyond our currently limited imagining. We have the dream of glory for all humanity in front of us. We just need to let it in.

Cambridge: Massachusetts Institute of Technology has issued the following news release: Today the MIT Climate CoLab, in collaboration with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, announced that it will launch a series of global online contests to help strengthen the resilience of vulnerable countries to respond to climate-related hazards. The suite of contests are part of the secretary-general\' s Climate Resilience Initiative: Anticipate, Absorb, Reshape (A2R), a new global, multi-stakeholder initiative that will accelerate action on the ground to enhance climate resilience of the most vulnerable countries and people by 2020. A2R was announced at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) on Nov. 30 and is supported by 13 UN entities. The A2R global contests will be hosted by the Climate CoLab, a project of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. The Climate CoLab is an online platform where a growing community of 50,000 people from around the world work with experts and each other to submit, develop, and select solutions to different aspects of the climate change problem.  No matter the outcome of the international climate negotiations, it is clear that now more than ever before, we need the ideas and contributions of as many people as possible to address climate change, said MIT Professor Thomas Malone, founder and principal investigator for the Climate CoLab.  We hope these contests inspire experts and non-experts alike to work together in this critical time. The first A2R contest will seek early actions that can be taken to ensure that vulnerable communities are prepared for climate-related hazards. Climate change is projected to increase the frequency and severity of climate-related hazards, such as storms and extreme precipitation, flooding, sea-level rise, and heat waves. While advances in science and technology  global computer models, satellite imagery, and cheaper equipment for local meteorological offices, among others  have dramatically increased the ability to predict extreme weather events and provide early warnings to the most vulnerable communities, Cyclone Nargis, Hurricane Katrina, and the food crisis in Niger are examples of situations when information about threats was insufficient to avert a disaster. To combat this, the UN-led A2R effort will seek innovations to strengthen the ability of vulnerable communities to prepare for and respond to disaster warnings quickly and effectively. Advising the contests will be directors from United Nations entities and other leading international organizations. The contests will create a pathway for innovators to receive recognition and for communities worldwide to gain access to the solutions they need to more adequately prepare for the impacts of climate change.

It's a buzz so electric, you can almost feel it.<nl/>And the conversation has extended far beyond the Champs-\'c9lys\'e9es. Citizens across the globe are taking notice. A recent Pew survey[2] found that an average of 54 percent of people surveyed globally consider climate change to be a very serious problem, and a median of 78 percent support the idea of their country limiting greenhouse gas emissions as part of an international agreement in Paris. By these numbers, then, the world is ready for bold action.<nl/> Yet, COP21 runs the risk of falling short of expectations. In the wake of Montreal, Kyoto, Copenhagen and all the other COPs, leaders must sustain the massive drumbeat of COP21 engagement in order to make an impact far beyond the next week. Companies, NGOs and global influencers alike need to inspire interest and engagement of the masses - to make all global citizens want to take action. The conversation should move beyond the board room, the CEO handshake, the editorial page or closed delegate meetings and become integrated into the mainstream.<nl/>To create a global sense of urgency and action, organizations and individuals have the responsibility to provide access to information for all and to engage through channels that resonate culturally and personally. In a world where more people have\~cell phones than toilets[3] and where smartphone usage is expected to grow to 6.1 billion by 2020[4], it's imperative that communications be a mix of both traditional and new channels.<nl/> To read more on Cone's Prove Your Purpose[5] blog, click here[6].<nl/><nl/>Tweet me: <nl/> KEYWORDS: Environment and Climate Change, Climate Change / Global Warming, COP21 , Cone Communications<nl/> [ 1]: HYPERLINK http://3blmedia.com/CSR-Profiles/Cone-Communications http://3blmedia.com/CSR-Profiles/Cone-Communications [ 2]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/11/05/global-concern-about-climate-change-broad-support-for-limiting-emissions/ http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/11/05/global-concern-about-climate-change-broad-support-for-limiting-emissions/ [ 3]: \~ HYPERLINK http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/03/25/more-people-have-cell-phones-than-toilets-u-n-study-shows/ http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/03/25/more-people-have-cell-phones-than-toilets-u-n-study-shows/ [ 4]: \~ HYPERLINK http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/02/6-1b-smartphone-users-globally-by-2020-overtaking-basic-fixed-phone-subscriptions/#.vqnbz9x:RPIH http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/02/6-1b-smartphone-users-globally-by-2020-overtaking-basic-fixed-phone-subscriptions/#.vqnbz9x:RPIH [ 5]: \~ http://www.conecomm.com/prove-your-purpose http://www.conecomm.com/prove-your-purpose [ 6]: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.conecomm.com/cop21 http://www.conecomm.com/ HYPERLINK cop21 \</doc>

Dec 01, 2015( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com COP21 DESCRIPTION: Continuing its leadership in corporate social responsibility (CSR) and carbon reduction, BNY Mellon has been named to CDP's global Climate 'A' List for climate performance leadership and its S...limate Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI). For the third consecutive year, BNY Mellon has received perfect scores on both climate change disclosure and performance. The company's "A" for performance and score of 100 for disclosure make it the only financial institution globally and one of two S...00 companies to receive a perfect score for the past three years. CDP - formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project - is an international, not-for-profit organization providing the only global system for companies and cities to measure, disclose, manage and share vital environmental information.<nl/> The disclosure and performance scores reflect BNY Mellon's assessment of potential risks and opportunities associated with climate change, management of corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and progress toward emission reduction goals. Since 2008, BNY Mellon has reduced its scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 32 percent, excluding data centers. It also continues to offset over 60 percent of its global electricity consumption through the purchase of renewable energy, on-site solar generation, and renewable energy credits.<nl/> BNY Mellon's recognition by CDP's Climate 'A' List and CDLI is the latest top CSR ranking for the firm. Within its peer group, it was the only firm named to the DJSI World Index[2] , one of the most highly regarded global sustainability indices, in both 2014 and 2015 and has the top ranking from Bloomberg for CSR disclosure. BNY Mellon has also been included three years in a row in the FTSE4Good Index of firms demonstrating strong CSR performance.<nl/> 'Our very strong CDP scores over the past three years demonstrate our well-established commitment to the highest standards of environmental performance in the actions we take to reduce our carbon impact and to transparency in the disclosure of climate change-related information,' said Karen B. Peetz[3], President of BNY Mellon. 'Beyond our recognition by CDP, we're proud of our leading performance across CSR rankings from respected industry organizations. Taken together, these ratings show that BNY Mellon is a leader in responsible business practices, benefiting both our stakeholders and society.'<nl/> Furthering its leadership in climate change accountability, BNY Mellon is encouraging others to act strongly and swiftly to create a low-carbon future. In the lead up to COP21 , the United Nations ' Climate Change Conference in Paris, BNY Mellon has signed the White House's American Business Act on Climate Pledge to voice support for a strong outcome from the climate negotiations in Paris and commit to ongoing support for climate action.<nl/> 'Businesses, in partnership with governments, non-governmental organizations and others, have an important role to play in shaping a low-carbon future. Taking strategic action to mitigate climate change is good for our clients, our investors, our people and our world,' said Peetz.<nl/> BNY Mellon's pledge builds on its successful track record of environmental stewardship and can be viewed here[4].<nl/> Related<nl/>CEO Q...BNY Mellon's Gerald Hassell on Corporate Social Responsibility\~[5] Karen Peetz Q...Investment Opportunities Emerging from Global Social and Environmental Trends\~[6] BNY Mellon Highlights 2014 Corporate Social Responsibility Achievements in Latest Report\~[7]<nl/> Tweet me: <nl/> KEYWORDS: Awards and Recognition, Business ...ade, COP21 , White House, American Business Act on Climate Pledge, CDP, climate performance, climate disclosure, BNY Mellon<nl/> [ 1]: HYPERLINK http://3blmedia.com/CSR-Profiles/BNY-Mellon http://3blmedia.com/CSR-Profiles/BNY-Mellon [ 2]: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/newsroom/news/press-releases/bny-mellon-named-to-dow-jones-sustainability-world-index-for-second-consecutive-year.jsp https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/newsroom/news/press-releases/bny-mellon-named-to-dow-jones-sustainability-world-index-for-second-consecutive-year.jsp [ 3]: \~ https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/who-we-are/leadership/peetz.jsp https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/who-we-are/leadership/peetz.jsp [ 4]: \~ HYPERLINK https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/11/30/white-house-announces-additional-commitments-american-business-act https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/11/30/white-house-announces-additional-commitments-american-business-act HYPERLINK https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/newsroom/news/expert-voices/ceo-q-and-a-bny-mellons-gerald-hassell-on-corporate-social-responsibility.jsp https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/newsroom/news/expert-voices/ceo-q-and-a-bny-mellons-gerald-hassell-on-corporate-social-responsibility.jsp [ 6]: \~ https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/newsroom/news/expert-voices/karen-peetz-q-and-a-investment-opportunities-emerging-from-global-social-and-environmental-trends.jsp https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/newsroom/news/expert-voices/karen-peetz-q-and-a-investment-opportunities-emerging-from-global-social-and-environmental-trends.jsp [ 7]: \~ https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/newsroom/news/company-news/bny-mellon-highlights-2014-corporate-social-responsibility-achievements-in-latest-report.jsp https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/newsroom/news/company-news/bny-mellon-highlights-2014-corporate-social-responsibility-achievements-in-latest-report.jsp \</doc>

In an effort to spread awareness on environmental issues and current attempts to address them by talking about the recent climate summit COP21 , the Environmental Student Assembly hosted USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences Dean Steven Lamy, Shannon Gibson, a professor in international relations, and the USC Schwarzenegger Institute Global Director Bonnie Reiss Thursday afternoon. The talks began with background about COP21 and the concept of global warming as a whole. Held in Paris shortly after the November terrorist attacks, COP21 addressed the issue of climate change and how different countries and communities could reduce carbon emissions. It was the 21st of a series of meetings following the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on climate control and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Talks at the summit centered around not letting the average global temperature rise above 1.5 degrees Celsius and countries constructing goals for lowering greenhouse gas emissions. After explaining the purpose of the meeting, the speakers delved into the implications concerning the standards that each country set up in order to decrease carbon emissions. "This is like Weight Watchers, people come in and make promises but the enforcement mechanism is not there," Lamy said. "There is going to be smaller countries that will be leaders in reducing carbon emissions like Sweden or Norway." Lamy explained that more skeptical countries like Russia could look to these "leader" countries to mold their policies, reducing emissions yet boosting their economies. Reiss echoed this sentiment by saying the lack of global enforcement to hold these countries accountable poses a challenge for the world. "The problem seems to be that there is no enforcing programs that will make these 'intended commitments' come true," Reiss said. "This issue is still in the hands of nation states. We have not yet decided on a system of global governance." She followed this up by stating that the consumer has the most power by choosing to support or not support corporations that aren't environmentally friendly. "Individuals should divest from companies that contribute lots of emissions," Reiss said. She then transitioned into her talks about how spreading environmental awareness should begin on a microscale. She stated that despite its difficulty, it's important that the U.S. effectively convey the severity of the issue to its citizens. "In a country like the United States, anything complicated is avoided," Reiss said. "We need to communicate in a way that is more relevant to people and voters." Gibson added to this argument by stating that students should be critical consumers, buying products based on background research and figuring out how much of an impact it actually makes on the environment. She talked about how green symbols on many big company products are actually industry markings that have low standards and mean next to nothing. Reiss brought it back to the USC students by urging the those in attendance to be smart consumers. "The kind of transition it's going to take for a low-carbon system is going to be huge," Reiss said. "But it begins with your generation - you guys." \</doc>

The following information was released by the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities: World leaders will gather in Paris starting November 30 for a two-week-long United Nations climate change conference known as COP 21 . COP 21 . As part of this pledge, President Eric Kaler noted that the University is committed to reducing carbon emissions 50 percent by the end of 2020; making all campuses carbon neutral by 2050; preparing students to understand the causes and impacts of climate change through the emerging Grand Challenges curriculum; and supporting research and creative capacity to develop sustainable cities and resilient communities and to provide secure food, water, and energy in a carbon-constrained world and changing climate. In addition to the pledge, experts from the University will be attending and participating in the deliberations and will be available to comment in advance or from on the ground in Paris. University conference participants available for interviews include: Ellen Anderson Executive Director, Energy Transition Lab, and Associate Adjunct Faculty, Law School Anderson is available to explain what COP 21 means and why it is relevant to Minnesotans in particular. Her areas of expertise include energy law and policy with a focus on Minnesota, renewable energy and climate change. Jack DeWaard Assistant Professor, Sociology, and Graduate Faculty in Population Studies, Minnesota Population Center DeWaard's research focuses on the causes, characteristics and consequences of human migration, and increasingly has focused on migration and population displacement caused by environmental conditions and climate change.

The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa issued the following news: "Africa, came to amplify and light up COP21 . It is the continent of the future, it is the continent of opportunities." Through this statement, Boni Yayi, President of the Republic of Benin set the tone on the Africa day high level opening of the Africa pavilion. According to President Yayi, "Africa needs to stop looking elsewhere and it must act to transform challenges into opportunities." He noted that world leaders have gathered in Paris to negotiate with the hope of "coming out with a new climate governance framework for the world - a new legal instrument and an equitable result." With the momentum and successes arising from the 3rd International Conference on Financing for Development (FFD3) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and given the fundamental importance of climate change on development and finance "it is out of question that the COP21 is a failure," stressed President Yayi. He called on the African negotiators to speak with one voice and work tirelessly to ensure that the new climate agreement results in a fair deal for Africa. The Pavilion was created to serve as a platform for the coordination of events, interests and stakeholders as a framework for exchange and fusion of ideas on climate change and its impact on the continent. More importantly according President Yayi, the Pavilion is a symbol of the unity of Africa speaking with one voice on issues of common interest. He appealed for an agreement that complies with Article 2 of the UNFCCC, on the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere; Compliance with Article 3 of the Convention regarding the basic principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities; The precautionary principle and the right to sustainable development; Raising the "polluter pays principle" and a balanced emphasis on adaptation and mitigation; The operationalization of concrete measures to address loss and damage associated with climate change impacts, and ways of implementation covering finance, technology transfer and capacity building. For his part, Ibrahim Assane Mayaki, Executive Secretary of NEPAD Agency said that the time has come for action and that Africa needs more than ever, "to work together to be stronger, more pragmatic and concrete." COP21 , Africa needs to continue working, and NEPAD will continue to play its role. Copyright Targeted News Services 18EstebanLiz 151205-5374946 MSTRUCK \</doc>

Dec 14, 2015( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com An historic breakthrough. An unprecedented game changer. Those are some of the terms being used to describe the outcome of COP21 , and for once, hyperbole seems appropriate. For the first time, nearly every country in the world has signed on to a universal agreement that commits the global community to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to address climate change.<nl/> The Paris deal represents a seismic shift in global economic policy, says The New York Times, 'the moment at which the rise in planet-warming carbon emissions that started during the Industrial Revolution began to level out and eventually decline.' For the global financial and energy markets, it's a strong signal to re-think investments in fossil fuels and double down on zero-carbon energy sources.<nl/> A few years ago, all the major oil and gas companies had divisions working with renewables wind, solar, and hydro power. As oil prices rose, those units never very large were phased out. The bottom line, post- COP21 ? The combination of today's low oil prices, which continue to fall, and the international agreement to lower GHGs will cause the major companies to consider an historic pivot in their strategies. Remember BP's bold branding as 'Beyond Petroleum'? It may have been just too far ahead of its time. Today, that message seems prophetic.

F\'e9d\'e9ration: International Energy Agency has issued the following news release: A peak in global energy-related emissions could be achieved as early as 2020 and at no net economic cost, the International Energy Agency said on Monday in its new World Energy Outlook Special Report on Energy and Climate Change. The Agency showed how to achieve an early peak in emissions as one of four key pillars that it believes are needed to make the upcoming UN climate talks a success, from an energy perspective. The world is at a critical juncture in its efforts to combat climate change, with momentum building towards the 21st UN Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) in Paris in December 2015. World greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions from energy production and use are double the level of all other sources combined, meaning that action to combat climate change must come first and foremost from the energy sector. The IEA proposes that the following four key pillars are needed to make COP21 a success, from an energy perspective: 1. Peak in emissions \- set the conditions to achieve an early peak in globalenergy-related emissions. 2. Five-year revision \- review national climate targets regularly, to test the scope to raise ambition. 3. Lock in the vision \- translate the world's climate goal into a collective long-term emissions goal. 4. Track the transition \- establish a process for tracking achievements inthe energy sector. "As IEA analysis has repeatedly shown that the cost and difficulty of mitigating greenhouse-gas emissions increases every year, time is of the essence," said IEA Executive Director Maria van der Hoeven. "It is clear that the energy sector must play a critical role if efforts to reduce emissions are to succeed. While we see growing consensus among countries that it is time to act, we must ensure that the steps taken are adequate and that the commitments made are kept." A peak in global energy-related emissions could be achieved as early as 2020 if governments implement just five key policy measures, as shown in the IEA\' s  Bridge Scenario . This major climate milestone is possible utilising only proven technologies and policies, and without changing the economic and development prospects of any region. Intended as an effective bridge to further action, the five measures focus on: Increasing energy efficiency in the industry, buildings and transport sectors Reducing the use of the least-efficient coal-fired power plants and banning their construction Gradual phasing out of fossil-fuel subsidies to end-users by 2030 Reducing methane emissions in oil and gas production For countries that have submitted climate pledges for COP21 , the proposed strategy identifies possible areas for over-achievement. For those that have yet to make a submission, it sets out a pragmatic baseline. The IEA report highlights the need for climate pledges for COP21 to be viewed as the basis from which to create a  virtuous circle of increasing ambition, and advocates, as its second pillar, a five-year review cycle to test the scope for further action. Both the situation and the solutions are evolving rapidly: the world\' s shrinking  carbon budget means that any delay in taking action can be costly, while the pace of energy sector innovation means that a five-year review would allow national targets to keep up with events and help build investor confidence. As its third pillar, the IEA recommends that the goal of keeping the increase in long-term average global temperatures to below two degrees Celsius (2 \'b0C) also be expressed as a long-term greenhouse-gas emissions target, making it more straightforward to apply in the energy sector. Doing so would help anchor future expectations, guide investment decisions, provide an incentive to develop new technologies, drive needed market reforms and spur the implementation of strong domestic policies, such as carbon pricing \- all of which are necessary to meet the 2 \'b0C goal. The final pillar proposed by the IEA report is that the COP21 agreement establish a strong process for tracking progress in the energy sector. Tracking national progress would both provide clear evidence of results, reassuring the international community that others are acting diligently, and identify countries that are struggling with implementation, enabling assistance to be provided if needed. In recognition of this need, the IEA report sets out appropriate metrics to monitor energy sector decarbonisation.  Any climate agreement reached at COP21 must have the energy sector at its core or risk being judged a failure, said IEA Chief Economist Fatih Birol.  Climate pledges submitted for COP21 are an important first step to meeting our climate goal, and our report shows that they will have a material impact on future energy trends. Collectively, countries accounting for around two-thirds of global energy-related emissions have either formally submitted their climate pledges for COP21 (known as  Intended Nationally Determined Contributions [INDCs] ) or have signalled their possible content (such as China). A first assessment reveals these pledges will have a positive impact on future energy trends, but fall short of the major course correction required to meet the 2 \'b0C goal. The assessment of the INDCs shows that the growth in global energy-related emissions slows but does not peak by 2030. The link between economic growth and emissions weakens significantly, but is not broken: the economy grows by 88% from 2013 to 2030 and energy-related carbon dioxide emissions by 8%. Renewables are the leading source of electricity by 2030, but inefficient coal-fired power generation capacity declines only slightly. Such findings underline the need for ambitious national pledges for COP21 that can act as a solid base upon which to build stronger action, such as those enabled by a transfer of resources (technology or finance).

The University of California-San Diego issued the following news release: University of California, San Diego scientists and students will be traveling to international climate negotiations in Paris next week to inform the talks with climate science findings and to spur the momentum toward effective international climate action that UC San Diego scientists have been instrumental in creating. The contingent of 16 researchers, students, and staff is part of the UC Revelle Program for Climate Science and Policy, a non-governmental organization that represents the University of California system at United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conferences held annually. "Participation in COP21 and associated climate negotiations advance our understanding and protection of our planet, which is one of our grand research themes at UC San Diego," said UC San Diego Chancellor Pradeep K. Khosla. "We are committed to conducting cutting-edge research and disseminating our knowledge to improve our world." The 21st Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) will be held from Nov. 30 to Dec. 11 and negotiators are hopeful that the accord will yield a binding agreement among countries to meet targets for reducing their emissions of greenhouse gases. "Our role in these climate conferences is to bring science into the conversation as much as possible so that the strategies that may become national policies have the best chance to be effective in mitigating the changes in nature that human activities have precipitated," said Margaret Leinen, the director of Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego and the head of the UC Revelle delegation. At COP21 The side event is one of hundreds of UNFCCC-sanctioned events that take place at the COP21 venue, Le Bourget. Side events are intended to be platforms for NGOs to brief negotiators on myriad aspects of the climate change issue. David Victor, a professor of international relations at UC San Diego's School of Global Policy and Strategy and director of the Laboratory on International Law and Regulation, will also attend the Paris talks. Victor said that his observations of early COP meetings led him to believe they would lead inevitably to inaction, a process he described in his 2011 book Global Warming Gridlock: Creating More Effective Strategies for Protecting the Planet. "That's what we've seen all the way through the Copenhagen conference (COP15) in 2009," said Victor. "When that conference ended in failure, it also opened a space for countries to try new strategies and ideas. That included a larger role for "bottom up" approaches in which countries would set their own policies - giving them flexibility to tailor their contributions to what they were willing and able to do at home. For years I have thought that kind of approach would be more effective, and in Paris, we will see it on display. So that's why I am going - to see how countries grapple with this new system and because I think, finally, it will have an impact." In all, more than 30 researchers and students from throughout the University of California system are expected to attend COP21 . Additionally Scripps Oceanography climate and atmospheric scientist Veerabhadran Ramanathan will take part in several events at COP21 related to a June 2015 encyclical from Pope Francis, Laudato Si, that calls on Catholics to understand the importance of environmental protection as an social justice objective. Ramanathan, a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences since 2004, played a pivotal role in the creation of the encyclical. In May 2014, he organized a historic joint workshop of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences and made a personal appeal to the pope to raise awareness about the effects of climate change on society, especially on the world's poor. Ramanathan will also participate in panel discussions hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, a union of 46 countries, the European Union, and UNEP formed in 2012 largely to address pollutants that pose a dual problem of accelerating global warming and posing a hazard to public health. For students attending COP21 , the event is an opportunity to observe how their science is translated to diplomacy and public policy arenas. Scripps Oceanography will co-host exhibits at which students and researchers can directly engage with other conference participants. "You could not find a better target audience," said Yassir Eddebbar, a fifth-year PhD candidate in oceanography at Scripps. "While working at the Scripps booth, you can interact with delegates from dozens of countries within a couple hours. The gap in awareness of ocean topics in these meetings is concerning, and highlights the importance of the presence of ocean scientists in these conferences." "I'm also excited for the opportunity to interact with people from all around the world and get to learn more about the wide variety of issues that are being faced in connection to climate change, many of which may not be as obvious," said Mariela Brooks, another PhD candidate in oceanography at Scripps. The UC San Diego delegation will be presenting news throughout COP21 via its website and several social media channels. Researchers will be live-Tweeting from the event through the feeds @scripps_ocean and @ucrevelle.

Shumlin in 2008, but I didn't vote for him in 2014 because of his support for the fracked gas pipeline,' said Johnson-Kurts, who is the communications director for the Vermont-based Rights and Democracy and is the press secretary of the US Youth Delegation to the climate talks. <nl/> Aly Johnson-Kurts.

He touted Vermont's work in scaling back carbon emissions and ramping up renewable energy production.<nl/> Shumlin said Wednesday he disagreed with the message of the protesters and that it didn't make a difference.<nl/> 'Nobody noticed,' he said.<nl/> In a video of the protest[10] obtained by Vermont Public Radio, Shumlin attempted to gain back control of the event, telling Johnson-Kurts that 'I know your Mom and Dad and I know they taught you better manners than this,' adding 'you're missing classes back at Smith (College) that you're going to get in trouble for.'<nl/> Later, speaking to Vermont reporters on a conference call, Shumlin said: 'My view is that they share our sense of urgency.' <nl/> The governor then shifted the discussion to the goals of the climate conference, and said American leaders are pushing hard to secure a deal by Saturday.<nl/> 'For the first time in history, the United States of America is not the skunk at the garden party,' Shumlin said, noting that Secretary of State John Kerry proposed doubling[11] climate aid to struggling countries on Wednesday.<nl/> He said developing countries need financial subsidies from countries like the United States to help lower emissions and build efficiencies into infrastructure and transportation.<nl/> 'The developed countries have a responsibility to help,' the governor said.<nl/> Shumlin said he has been telling Vermont's green energy story and is picking up ideas for Vermont from other world leaders.<nl/> He said the Green Mountain State is leading the world in its commitment to building a renewable energy economy and reducing carbon emissions. But he acknowledged that in Vermont 'we don't have such a great story to tell in terms of transportation.' <nl/> He pointed to Norway's subsidies that encourage more efficiency in transportation, where more than one-fifth of new car sales are of electric vehicles. The country has removed taxes on electric vehicles, as well as charges for tolls, ferry rides and parking for efficient automobiles, according to The New York Times[12].<nl/> 'I have never seen a bigger commitment by world leaders to actually move the dial on our emissions as we are seeing here,' Shumlin said.<nl/> The good news, the governor added, is that the talks appear to be making progress.<nl/> 'Nobody has walked out,' he said.<nl/> Besides the confrontation by protesters in Paris, Shumlin is also facing criticism back home. Vermont Republican Party chairman Dave Sunderland has issued a number of open letters to the governor criticizing his trip to Paris. The party chair said the trip was unnecessary when everyday Vermonters are struggling.<nl/> 'Do you feel attending this conference instead of focusing on our state's stagnant economy, declining affordability and plummeting workforce is the job that Vermonters narrowly elected you to do just over a year ago?' Sunderland asked Wednesday.<nl/> The party chairman pointed to a number of pressing state issues, including a $40 million budget shortfall and persistent technical issues with Vermont Health Connect, that should have precluded Shumlin from attending the Paris conference.<nl/> Sunderland also suggested Shumlin should have participated in the climate talks through video conferencing. <nl/> 'You've frequently touted the state's telecommunication advances  you should be taking advantage of them now,' he said.<nl/> Sunderland finished both letters by offering a list of questions regarding the Paris trip. They included how much carbon pollution would be produced from it, who would be paying each expense and if Shumlin would be bringing any friends or relatives on the trip. <nl/> Shumlin did not directly address Sunderland's concerns, but spokesman Scott Coriell issued a blistering response to Sunderland's, advocating the importance of the climate change summit, and Shumlin's attendance.<nl/> 'Climate change is real. It's depressing that in 2015 I have to make that point to you, but given your history of climate change denial I feel compelled to,' Coriell replied to Sunderland. 'Lucky for you, I know a guy who will be with some of the world's leading climate scientists next week. I will ask him to bring back some literature for you to read.'<nl/> Coriell also pointed to a United Nations press release stating all carbon emissions from the conference would be offset by the French government.

Zurich: Asea Brown Boveri has issued the following news release: ABB\' s innovative electric bus charging technology was one of the highlights of a show of sustainable transport systems around the Eiffel Tower in Paris, where world leaders are meeting to seek a global agreement to tackle climate change. At separate events in the French capital, ABB CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer and Bazmi Husain, Country Managing Director in India and incoming Chief Technology Officer, said a sustainable energy supply could be created by shifting to renewable power and using energy more efficiently, provided supportive policy was in place. In the \' blue zone\' , where world leaders are deliberating under tight security, Spiesshofer told a high-profile audience on Dec. 7 that expanding wind and solar power generation capacity was insufficient on its own. To ensure the reliability of our energy supply, the growth of renewable generation must go hand-in-hand with investment in technology to integrate their intermittent output into the grid. Spiesshofer also encouraged the faster deployment of low-carbon microgrids to bring clean energy to the millions of people without electricity. ABB CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer (left) speaking at COP21 in Paris Access and resilience  We need to lower carbon emissions, but we also need to ensure that this is done in way that expands access to energy, and at the same time increases the resilience of the power grid, Spiesshofer said.  The task is a vast one, which is why the private and public sector must collaborate closely to bring this vision to reality. The CEO was speaking at the invitation of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) after ABB joined its Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) initiative a year ago. ABB is supporting an SE4ALL project to help developing and emerging economies transition their markets to energy-efficient products through an integrated policy approach. ABB's incoming CTO, Bazmi Husain (right) speaking at the World Climate Summit forum Innovation and leadership A day earlier, Husain had spoken at the World Climate Summit, a business, finance and government forum running alongside the negotiations of the 2015 climate conference, known officially as  COP 21  . He was part of a panel looking at the innovation and leadership required to reach the internationally agreed goal of keeping global warming below 2&deg;C. Husain highlighted the unique opportunity available to emerging markets such as India to leapfrog traditional power technologies. These markets could bring clean power to off-grid communities by giving them low-carbon microgrids - small networks powered by renewable energy - rather than by investing heavily in expanding their traditional transmission grid. The role of policy But the panelists disagreed on the importance of governments\' role in driving the low-carbon transition.  Get the largest companies together and there\' s nothing we can\' t do, said Paul Dickinson, Executive Chairman of the Carbon Disclosure Project, which has persuaded 800 large companies to factor the cost of carbon into their activities and says this is resulting in a change in their behavior on capital expenditure.  The private sector needs certainty, and the hesitation of governments is damaging, said Felipe Calderon, Chairman of New Climate Economy, an initiative to analyze the economic benefits and costs of acting on climate change. Government action could trigger trillions of dollars of investment, he added. This view was endorsed by Sir David King, a British government advisor, who noted that the low-carbon sector was the fastest growing industry in Britain. Its expansion rate was 30 percent over the past five years, and government policy had been the driver, he added. The technology exists\'   Most of the technology needed for sustainable development exists today, Husain said in his concluding remarks,  but if we are looking for people to adopt it without policy help, it will not work. Policy is a must, as it will be some time before many of the technologies are economically feasible. On Dec. 7, Husain represented ABB at a meeting of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) in Paris. Through the WBCSD\' s Low Carbon Technology Partnerships initiative (LTCPi), ABB has been collaborating with customers and competitors on proposals to scale up and develop low-carbon technologies. Over the past year, ABB experts for energy efficient motors and distribution transformers have contributed to the creation of models to quantify the potential energy, financial and CO2 savings on a country and regional level. This work is an important basis for SE4ALL\' s next steps of proposing ambition levels for new performance standards and of persuading governments to adopt them.

Morocco's recently-announced goal to generate more than half of its electricity from renewables by 2030 presents strong business opportunities, energy experts announced at the World Future Energy Summit. By 2030, Morocco aims to generate 52 percent of its electricity from renewables, including 2 gigawatts each from solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, Morocco announced at the recent COP 21 United Nations Climate Change Conference . Currently Morocco' is the Middle East's largest energy importer, at more than 97 percent of its total, according to the World Bank. Demonstrating the strong investment and business potential, the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy (MASEN)'s Solar Integrated Projects call for USD 9 billion in investment by 2020, according to a recent report by the World Future Council. Meeting Morocco's ambitious renewable energy targets will require international investment and sharing of global best practices, as the country flips the equation from being an energy importer to potential exporter, Morocco-watchers agreed. Encouraging new business opportunities and innovation in the solar markets of Morocco and the region is the WFES Solar Expo. More than 150 solar exhibitors will interact with innovators, project developers, and buyers to experience the latest solar innovations, learn about solar trends, and network with solar experts at the WFES conference. Morocco's signature solar project is Noor, which is set to be the world's largest concentrated solar power plant in the world, with a capacity of more than 500 megawatts and set to power 1.1 million homes by 2018, according to the World Bank. Supporting Morocco's renewables, the World Bank has joined the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, BMCE Ban, and Clean Technology Fund in investing in solar plants and wind farms in Morocco. Morocco will also host COP 22 in 2016. Masdar and the Moroccan government recently announced a partnership to install solar home systems in more than 17,000 homes in rural Morocco. Furthermore, Masdar recently announced that Morocco is one of three key markets in the Middle East and North Africa for renewable energy investment over the next 10 years. WFES 2016, hosted by Masdar, will be co-located with the International Water Summit and EcoWASTE at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre from 18-21 January 2016. \</doc>

The World Coal Association issued the following news release: The COP21 climate negotiations opened yesterday morning in Paris, with the much-expected Leaders' Day. Great expectations would be perhaps a good way to summarise the mood in the room La Seine in Le Bourget. With a list of 150 leaders, including heads of state and government, we heard encouraging messages for negotiators in an effort to set the political momentum for the summit to be a success. Leaders have made calls for an ambitious and successful outcome at COP21 , highlighting the COP as a turning point. President Hollande of France, followed by other European and developed countries, have pointed out the need for a universal, differentiated and legally binding agreement. Developing countries have emphasised the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and the need for flexibilities in a balanced and fair agreement. Several recurring themes were mentioned such as the universal scope of the agreement, it's legally binding nature, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, and technology transfer, amongst others. Climate finance has been called many times a crucial element for a successful agreement and pledges for increasing funds have been made. However, it is still very early to say if the pledges that have started today will meet the previous Cancun commitment of reaching USD 100 billion and if the Paris negotiations will provide the additional and new funds required to support mitigation and adaptation purposes. Technology transfer and intensifying innovation, research and development of clean technologies were also mentioned many times. Leaders called for support for developing countries, especially the poorest and more vulnerable, in their efforts to achieve sustainable development through access to and transfer of technology. Many countries including the USA, China, Russia and Germany have pledged to increased efforts and funds for innovation, research and development and have also mentioned the role of business in those efforts. All those pledges and announcements are positive signs, particularly when many developing countries have noted their reliance on receiving the appropriate financial and technical support in their intended nationally determined contributions (INDC). For those countries that need to use coal to meet energy demand and other development needs, it is important to receive the necessary support for investing in cleaner technologies, such as high efficiency low emission coal technologies and carbon capture and storage. Those technologies will be instrumental in achieving their mitigation commitments, while increasing access to energy for their population and using that energy for economic growth and development. The leaders have generated a sense of optimism and it seems we can expect a Paris agreement based on the INDCs. Whether the text will be a substantial and ambitious way forward, providing countries with the necessary tools to make their INDC a reality, including those who have identified a role for low emission coal technologies, will only be seen at the end of the negotiations. It will be an interesting two weeks ahead. [Category: Energy] Copyright Targeted News Services AutoTriage17jl 151202 30TacordaCheng-5370442 30TacordaCheng \</doc>

Houston: Direct Energy has issued the follwoing news release: Since the United Nations Climate Change Conference 21st Conference of the Parties ( COP21 ) Paris Agreement was adopted on December 12, 2015, energy consumers have been watching for signs of price changes and hearing information on how the agreement will affect their energy bills. But because the agreement is part of a much longer process playing out on both political and market stages, the resulting higher prices haven\' t actually appeared. Indeed, there are still scenes to be played and players to be heard before Paris Agreement ( COP21 ) takes effect in 2020. As this process unfolds, our monthly Paris Climate Conference series will discuss the facts and trends to help you understand how these developments will impact your world and daily life. Let\' s briefly review the core aspects of the Paris Agreement:Goals: Limit greenhouse gas emissions, specifically carbon dioxide (CO2), in order to hold  the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2KC above pre-industrial levels and limit global  temperature increase to 1.5KC above pre-industrial levels.  Increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development, in a manner that does not threaten food production. Provide funding ($100 billion) to assist emerging and developing countries create  a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate resilient development. Emissions: As part of the Paris Agreement, participants had to submit their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for reducing emissions for the post-2020 period. As of December 15, 187 countries representing 98% of global population had submitted plans. Canada intends to achieve an economy-wide target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. The United States intends to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% below its 2005 levels by 2025 and to make best efforts to reduce its emissions by 28%. Agreement Status: The agreement is not binding. There are no penalties for not complying, but there are binding rules to participate. The agreement won\' t be officially signed until April 22, 2016 and won\' t take effect until 2020. Time frame: In 2018, all parties to the agreement will reconvene to discuss ways to further reduce emissions. In 2023, all parties will present their updated NDC\' s to further reduce emissions, and these will be updated every five years until 2030. Business Thought Leaders\' ThoughtsWhen COP21 COP21 . The WEF\' s own survey of 750 people from business, academia, civil society, and the public sector found that developed world business leaders were primarily concerned with energy shocks, cyber attacks, and unemployment. The Annual Global Price Waterhouse Cooper CEO Business Survey also conducted at the forum found similar results with 1,300 global business leaders, showing that over-regulation was thought the biggest threat to business  especially among North American CEOs, followed by geopolitical uncertainty and cyber attacks. Those in the power sector (worldwide) shared the over-regulation concern  but 81% said new battery and power technologies could transform their industry. The important point here is that new power technologies have been moving away from utilizing fossil fuels for decades and are almost now entirely focused on cleaner, green energy: solar in particular. Solar panel prices have fallen by 70% since 2009, making residential installation more and more affordable. Essentially, technology now lets you control your own home\' s power generation and usage with your iPhone. And it\' s getting cheaper to do it. Many US utilities understand the real market potential behind changing energy technology. The thinking goes like this: since consumers want the cleaner power technology, there\' s more money to be made selling the stuff to them rather than fighting them and losing their green dollars to someone else. During a recent National Press Club panel on the impact of the Paris Agreement on US utilities, Joe Garcia, former Chairman of the Florida Public Service Commission, explained consumers want the benefits that come with new power technologies,  It isn\' t that regulation got us what we\' ve got. It\' s that the market has created this tremendous opportunity. Large institutions like electric companies don\' t change course overnight, though it does sound like a metamorphosis of power utility structure is happening&hellip;ish. While new fields of opportunity are opening up, old methods of operating are showing their long-concealed high-costs. In the next installment of the Paris Climate Conference series, we\' ll look at where the planned NDC programs for Canada and the United States intend to reduce emissions and where those programs are in their development.

The World Council of Churches issued the following news release: "Get up and go!" is the motto of an ecumenical pilgrimage for climate justice that will invite pilgrims to walk from Flensburg to Paris, where the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 21 ) will start at the end of November. In Brekklum, in the northern region of the country, more than 60 delegates representing partner churches of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Northern Germany are gathering for a ten-day consultation on issues of global justice, 16 - 20 September. The general secretary of the World Council of Churches (WCC), Rev. Dr Olav Fykse Tveit, has sent messages of greetings and encouragement to the participants of both initiatives. "The future of humanity and creation requires and deserves that we as Christians leave our divisions and tensions behind", read the message from the WCC general secretary to those convened in Brekklum by Melisande Schifter, member of the WCC Commission of the Churches on International Affairs. "Only together can we become credible witnesses for the good news of the gospel and overcome the boundaries that separate us. There is only one common future for humanity, not many and not just mine. Real hope is the only hope we share," the text continued. Tveit stressed that such convictions motivated the delegates of the WCC 10th Assembly at Busan in 2013 to call on churches and all people of good will to join in a pilgrimage of justice and peace. He expressed encouragement to the pilgrims in Flensburg who have begun the journey towards Paris. "Those who started in Flensburg are part of a worldwide movement for climate justice. Four hundred thousand people demonstrated on the streets of Manhattan in September last year. We were there in New York at the same time, together with representatives of many different religions, to express our care for creation in front of the United Nations," Tveit's message recalled. The pilgrimage from Flensburg to Paris is supported by a broad ecumenical alliance of German regional Evangelical churches, Roman Catholic dioceses, associations and development agencies like Bread for the World and Misereor.

Dec 04, 2015( Hindustan Times Blogs: HYPERLINK http://blogs.hindustantimes.com Global warming is indeed a serious issue which imperils the future of humankind and the life span of the world. Meteorologists, environmentalists and climate change experts have been warning for four decades regarding the hazards of ozone depletion owing to green house gas emissions and the resultant global warming consequential droughts, inclement weather and natural catastrophes. It was not till 1995 that the first Conference of Parties (COP) was held and another three years elapsed before the Kyoto Protocol was adopted at COP3, a nonbinding agreement by 192 parties to lower greenhouse gas emissions to 5% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. Eight years later, at COP11 the Montreal Action Plan was generated to "extend the life of the Kyoto Protocol beyond its 2012 expiration date and negotiate deeper cuts in greenhouse gas emissions". Set in this backdrop, COP21 assumes great importance since this year leaders of 150 nations, along with 40,000 delegates from 195 countries, attended the conference of parties for climate talks to adopt major steps towards setting up legally binding mechanisms which will keep the world at bay from crossing the 2 degrees Celsius global temperature rise barrier. Some previous conference of parties ended in a fiasco because the major industrialised nations refused to abide by the rules and take cognitive steps for reducing greenhouse gas emissions for example the 2009 Copenhagen COP15 is deemed a failure for it concluded without reaching any agreement. COP21 held greater promise because of the dynamic participation of the Chinese President, who has been actively canvassing for reining in this peril to nature and humanity. In 2014, President Xi Jinping took the bold step of signing a joint statement with the United States on climate change sending strong political signals to the world through its solemn promises demonstrating its determination to take a green, low-carbon and sustainable development path. So far, China has signed a series of bilateral statements on climate change with India, Brazil, the European Union (EU), the United States, France and others, and submitted to the UNFCCC in June 2015 the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), which details China's own contribution to combating climate change for the sake of all mankind. China itself has also included the fight against climate change in its 13th Five Years Plan for national socioeconomic development in the 2016-2020 period, which demonstrates its serious commitment to support the protection of the environment and its attitude towards climate change. China also supports a comprehensive review every five years of the progress made towards the achievement of the approved long-term objectives, which also demonstrates China's capability for and confidence in meeting its commitments. President Xi believes that an active engagement in the fight against climate change is not only the duty from which "a responsible major country" cannot evade, but is also in line with the urgent requirement of China's current socioeconomic development. Currently China is the world's leading country both in energy saving and in the use of new and renewable energy. In 2014, the energy consumption and the emission of carbon dioxide per unit of the gross domestic product (GDP) decreased by 29.9 percent and 33.8 percent respectively, compared to the 2005 levels. While making progress of its own, China has never hesitated in providing every possible support and assistance to countries or regions whose economic development, reserves of resources and technological level are lagging behind. In September, Chinese President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Barack Obama signed the China-US joint presidential statement on climate change, in which China pledged 20 billion Renminbi (3.1 billion US dollars) in support of a South-South climate cooperation fund to help other developing countries combat climate change. As the world's biggest developing country, China has not only made remarkable achievements in managing environmental problems, saving energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and developing green and low carbon technologies, but has also contributed to the progress of international negotiations in reaching a new global climate agreement. President Xi Jinping's content wise hard hitting speech delivered in his usual composed style, reiterated the Chinese government's resolve to continue to advance international cooperation on climate change, and earnestly implement its policy commitment to south-south cooperation. He announced that next year, China will launch cooperation projects to set up 10 pilot low-carbon industrial parks and start 100 mitigation and adaptation programs in other developing countries, and provide them with 1000 training opportunities on climate change. The Chinese President lived up to his promise by reiterating that China will continue to promote international cooperation in such areas as clean energy, disaster prevention and mitigation, ecological protection and climate-smart agriculture, and low-carbon and smart cities. It is essential to note that irresponsible criticism of China regarding its approach to global warming must now stop. China has visibly demonstrated that it is conscious of the factor that also being a developing country and a major player simultaneously, it can identify itself with the hurdles and hardships of the developing countries and that is the reason why President Xi took a stand for the developing countries and iterated that it should be made clear what the expectations should be from rich countries and from poor countries if the COP21 is aiming for a binding for all agreement this year. By consciously calibrating COP21 , China has proved that it is ready to step into a pivotal role in reaching common ground on key issues. To act on climate change is not only driven by China's domestic needs for sustainable development, but also driven by its sense of responsibility to fully engage in global governance, and to forge a community of shared destiny for humankind, as clearly outlined in the action plan unveiled by President Xi Jinping on occasion of COP21 .

Nov 30, 2015( Adam Smith Institute Blog: HYPERLINK http://www.adamsmith.org/blog COP21 here, that great gabfest to talk about climate change[1]:<nl/> <nl/>Ever clearer is that the debate on climate change is essentially over. Whether just a modern day delusion or not, virtually all political leaders now buy into the idea of man-made warming, and most of them seem willing to do something about it.<nl/><nl/>The question, as always, is what should be done. We have long taken the above view: the truth or not of climate change is not the important point. Politics is about what people believe, not the truth. Thus we've been advocating a carbon tax on the grounds that we know they're going to do something so we might as well tell everyone to do what will cure the problem, if it exists, at least cost. Usefully, it's also what every economist looking at the problem has also said, from Stern through Nordhaus to Tol.<nl/> However, there's an implication of that:<nl/><nl/>Much fiercer carbon taxes are coming, driving huge change not just in energy consumption and production, but in all the myriad industries that depend on hydro-carbons, from plastics to automotive, metal bashing and even many service activities, which can be surprisingly energy intensive.<nl/><nl/>That's actually not true, not here in the UK at least. Because we largely already have a carbon tax. It's not distributed correctly, this is true (too much on petrol, not enough on farming) but overall we're already coughing up about the 'correct' amount as calculated by Stern (and more than Nordhaus or Tol would suggest for today). The combination of the fuel duty escalator, the EU's cap and trade, the minimum carbon price and so on, while they're not quite exactly the way it should all be done, do have roughly the right effect and size. According to Stern's numbers the UK should be paying something like \£330 billion a year in carbon tax given the roughly 500 million tonnes CO2 a year. We're already paying that much when you tot everything up so we're done.<nl/> Yes, it's entirely true that some other people might have a lot of work to do to meet whatever is agreed in Paris. But as far as the UK is concerned we're done, we've already put the correct and recommended policies into place. We've nothing else that we need to do except perhaps a little tinkering here and there. There's most certainly no justification for significant rises in the general tax level, whatever COP21 agrees. Not that that's what we'll be told of course .<nl/> [ 1]: HYPERLINK http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/12022838/Higher-carbon-taxes-are-coming-get-used-to-it.html http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/12022838/Higher-carbon-taxes-are-coming-get-used-to-it.html \</doc>
<doc ID="COP21_USA307" COP="COP21" country="USA" date="October 27, 2015 Tuesday"source="The Stanford Daily: Stanford University" >
Last Monday, a fellow freshman posted a piece criticizing Fossil Free Stanford's pressure on the University to divest from fossil fuels. He expressed his fear with regard to our recent pledge for civil disobedience, in which 114 students have committed to civil disobedience if the University doesn't divest before the COP21 negotiations at the end of November, because he didn't want to be "signing a pledge before [he] even [knew] what [he'd be] doing." As new members of Fossil Free Stanford, we want to recognize his concern as reasonable, and do our best to replace it with knowledge and understanding of what we are trying to do. On the logistical side, we want to clarify that while the specific logistics of the planned civil disobedience are not public, they will be shared with individuals who sign the pledge to join us. Signing the pledge does not, of course, commit them in any way to participating if these details make them uncomfortable. Additionally, we fully acknowledge that there are risks inherent in nonviolent civil disobedience. We have lawyers directly involved in the planning of our action, and will host mandatory trainings on legal risks and expected behavior in the run-up. Please see our website for more questions: fossilfreestanford.org. In response to questions of rashness, it's important to note that long before we arrived and joined the team, FFS had been working intensively with Stanford's Administration (for three years). In the seven days before launching our pledge for civil disobedience, for example, members of our team met with the Advisory Panel on Investment Responsibility and Licensing, with whom they've met regularly, and the Office of the President, and had a letter read aloud to the Special Committee on Investment Responsibility of the Board of Trustees. In that same time period, a firm but civil letter was delivered to the every member of the Board of Trustees by our ASSU President and Vice President, John-Lancaster Finley and Brandon Hill, in coordination with FFS. Additionally, both the ASSU Senate and the Graduate Student Council have passed resolutions calling for full fossil fuel divestment. And we in FFS are committed to continuing to build our relationships with the administration moving forward. As our campaign has grown in numbers and determination, we have seen administrators become increasingly interested in talking about solutions. But there's really only time for a couple more weeks of talk, not a couple more years. After three years of work, our Board of Trustees continues to maintain a vested interest in the success of fossil fuel companies, companies which have understood the consequences of their product for 40 years and have buried the truth beneath irresponsible lies. Therefore in protest we've turned to civil disobedience - because time is running out. Three years is a long time for an administration to discuss something this urgent without coming to a decision. The COP 21 United Nations Climate Change Conference starts on Noc. 29, and the U.N. has declared it the "last chance to adopt a global agreement that makes it possible to secure a safe climate." We cannot allow Stanford's Board of Trustees to deliberate any longer. It is imperative now, more than it ever has been, to definitively announce that U.S. civil society does not see a future for fossil fuels. The strongest statement that Stanford can make is to pull financial support for this destructive, distortionary industry. The fossil fuel industry has controlled the political space around climate discussions for decades, while the impacts of fossil fuel combustion have approached dangerous levels. The harm caused will and already does affect communities disproportionately. These effects are today being felt much more immediately and severely by communities of color and low-income communities already facing other injustices like systemic racism and profiling. By divesting from companies that contribute to climate change, Stanford can refuse to support further oppression of these communities and encourage the U.S. negotiators heading to Paris to do the same by supporting a robust international climate agreement.

ABIDJAN, Nov. 30 -- The global conference on climate change, COP21 , opened on Monday, November 30 in Paris, with the participation of a large delegation from the African Development Bank (AfDB) led by its President, Akinwumi Adesina. Defending the interests of Africa and Africans COP21 agenda are set forth in detail in this position paper. In order to achieve these goals, several bilateral meetings will be held by Adesina and several of the Bank's Vice-Presidents and Senior Staff. An African Pavilion has been organized by the AfDB in cooperation with its partners, the African Union/NEPAD and the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA). The African Pavilion will feature a photography exhibition of photographs showing the effects of climate change across the African continent and will organize more than 100 events over the two weeks of the conference (For the program, click here). A program full of highlights One of the highlights of the first day of the conference is the meeting of the presidents of multilateral development banks on climate-related funding - i.e. the financial resources allocated to fighting climate change. The African Development Bank, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the European Investment Bank will take part. This meeting follows two others, the International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa last July, and the World Bank-IMF Annual Meetings in Lima, Peru, in October. In Lima, President Akinwumi Adesina unveiled the Bank's plan to nearly triple its annual climate financing to reach $5 billion a year by 2020. Tuesday, December 1 is Africa Day. At noon Paris time (GMT+1), the African Pavilion will officially be opened by AfDB President Akinwumi Adesina, the African Union Chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, and ECA Executive Secretary Carlos Lopes, in the presence of French President Francois Hollande. It will also see the launch of the New Deal on Energy for Africa, which Adesina hopes will receive wide international support. COP21 runs for two weeks.

The number of people who believe climate change is a serious problem facing the United States is declining, but the amount still remains a majority, a poll released Monday indicates. A new Washington Post-ABC News poll shows 63 percent of those surveyed say climate change is a serious problem facing the country, down from 69 percent in June. Fifty-two percent say climate change is a "very serious" problem, down from 57 percent. About 47 percent believe the government should do more to deal with global warming, down from 61 percent in 2008. About one-third believe the government is doing the "right amount" and one-fifth believe the government should do less, an increase from one-tenth of people who believed that eight years ago. The poll found 51 percent of people say there is "a lot of disagreement among scientists" over the existence of global warming, down 11 percent from 2008. About 43 percent say scientists agree with one another. Among party lines, Democrats and Republicans continue to largely disagree on the issue. More than 80 percent of Democrats say global warming is a serious problem, contrasting the nearly 60 percent of Republicans who believe it is not a serious problem. About 65 percent of Democrats want the U.S. government to take more action against climate change and 57 percent say most scientists agree on whether global warming is occurring. Less than 25 percent of Republicans believe the government should take more action against climate change while about 66 percent say there is "a lot of disagreement" among scientists. Democrats and Democratic-leaning Independents are 43 percent more likely than Republicans and Republican-leaning Independents to say scientists agree on global warming. About 60 percent of people younger than 30 say climate change is a "very serious problem," while less than half of people older than 50 share that sentiment. The poll was conducted from Nov. 16-19 with a random sample of 1,004 adults with a 3.5 percent margin of error. President Barack Obama on Monday warned climate change could be the most dramatic threat to the world during a speech at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, adding that immediate, global action is needed. About 150 world leaders and 40,000 delegates from 195 countries are attending the the two-week long conference, also called COP21 . The main goal of the conference is to create a legally binding and universal agreement on reducing global carbon emissions, with the hopes of holding global average temperatures short of a 2 degree Celsius increase over pre-industrial global temperatures. \</doc>

The following information was released by the World Meteorological Organization: More than 150 heads of state and government attended the opening session of the U.N. Climate Change negotiations (known as COP21 ) in Paris on 30 November, in an unprecedented show of global political support for an ambitious and extensive agreement. "Never before did so many heads of state from so many different countries attend a conference. But then again, never have the stakes been so high," said French President Francois Hollande. "It's about the future of the planet," he said. "The menace of climate change is too great for us to be content with a minimalistic agreement. The Heads of State and Government who have come to Paris have come to express the voice of ambition," said COP President and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius. "The time for brinksmanship is over," said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. "Let us build a durable climate regime with clear rules of the road that all countries can agree to follow. Paris must mark a turning point. We need the world to know that we are headed to a low-emissions, climate-resilient future, and that there is no going back," he said. On the eve of the COP21 conference, 184 countries covering around 95 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions had delivered their national climate action plans to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). These pledges constitute a good foundation, but are not enough to keep the world below the maximum global average temperature rise of 2 degrees Celsius. U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres said a "remarkable" turning point had been reached in action to cut greenhouse gas emissions. "But the task is not done. It is up to you to both capture this progress and chart an unequivocal path forward, with a clear destination, agreed milestones and a predictable timeline that responds to the demands of science and the urgency of the challenge. Ahead of COP21 WMO also issued a provisional statement on the status of the climate in 2015, a year which is likely to be be the warmest on record and to reach the symbolic and significant milestone of 1 Celsius above the pre-industrial era. The years 2011-2015 have been the warmest five-year period on record, with many extreme weather events - especially heatwaves - influenced by climate change, according to a WMO five-year analysis. "The state of the global climate in 2015 will make history as for a number of reasons," said WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud. "Levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere reached new highs and in the Northern hemisphere spring 2015 the three-month global average concentration of CO2 crossed the 400 parts per million barrier for the first time. 2015 is likely to be the hottest year on record, with ocean surface temperatures at the highest level since measurements began. It is probable that the 1C Celsius threshold will be crossed," said Mr Jarraud. "This is all bad news for the planet." WMO supports the Climate Change Convention through a wide range of scientific and technical activities. .A top-level WMO delegation, with support from representatives of National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs), is contributing actively to the COP-2). It is providing scientific statements to inform the intergovernmental discussions, status reports on operational climate observations and services, and information for the general public. In the run-up to COP21 , WMO released another series of the acclaimed Weather Reports for the Future. This comprises videos from well-known television presenters from around the world giving realistic weather reports for the year 2050, based on climate change projections. \</doc>

The World Coal Association issued the following news release: Benjamin Sporton, World Coal Association Chief Executive, made the following comments today on the Paris Agreement.  The foundation of this Paris Agreement are the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted by countries in the lead-up to COP21 . Countries must be supported in the implementation of their INDCs, which for many include a role for low emission coal technologies, such as high efficiency low emissions coal and carbon capture and storage.  With the commitments countries made going into COP21 , the International Energy Agency said electricity generation from coal would grow by 24% by 2040.  We welcome the renewed commitment to climate finance and call on the various finance, technology and capacity building mechanisms to support countries implement all aspects of their INDCs.  The increased ambition of this agreement also underscores the need to speed up efforts to deploy carbon capture and storage. We call on governments to move quickly to support increased investment in CCS and through providing policy parity for CCS alongside other low emission technologies.

The following information was released by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT): Today the MIT Climate CoLab, in collaboration with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, announced that it will launch a series of global online contests to help strengthen the resilience of vulnerable countries to respond to climate-related hazards. The suite of contests are part of the secretary-general's Climate Resilience Initiative: Anticipate, Absorb, Reshape (A2R), a new global, multi-stakeholder initiative that will accelerate action on the ground to enhance climate resilience of the most vulnerable countries and people by 2020. A2R was announced at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP21 ) on Nov. 30 and is supported by 13 UN entities. The A2R global contests will be hosted by the Climate CoLab, a project of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. The Climate CoLab is an online platform where a growing community of 50,000 people from around the world work with experts and each other to submit, develop, and select solutions to different aspects of the climate change problem. "No matter the outcome of the international climate negotiations, it is clear that now more than ever before, we need the ideas and contributions of as many people as possible to address climate change," said MIT Professor Thomas Malone, founder and principal investigator for the Climate CoLab. "We hope these contests inspire experts and non-experts alike to work together in this critical time." The first A2R contest will seek early actions that can be taken to ensure that vulnerable communities are prepared for climate-related hazards. Climate change is projected to increase the frequency and severity of climate-related hazards, such as storms and extreme precipitation, flooding, sea-level rise, and heat waves. While advances in science and technology global computer models, satellite imagery, and cheaper equipment for local meteorological offices, among others have dramatically increased the ability to predict extreme weather events and provide early warnings to the most vulnerable communities, Cyclone Nargis, Hurricane Katrina, and the food crisis in Niger are examples of situations when information about threats was insufficient to avert a disaster. To combat this, the UN-led A2R effort will seek innovations to strengthen the ability of vulnerable communities to prepare for and respond to disaster warnings quickly and effectively. Advising the contests will be directors from United Nations entities and other leading international organizations. The contests will create a pathway for innovators to receive recognition and for communities worldwide to gain access to the solutions they need to more adequately prepare for the impacts of climate change. Until the A2R contests are launched, all are welcome to enter and work on proposals in the Anticipate, Absorb, Reshape Workspace. Once the contests open, authors can move their proposals from the workspace to the open contests. \</doc>

Today marks one month until world leaders converge in Paris for COP21 , also known as the 2015 Paris Climate Conference. Here are five things you should know as we head toward this critical event. What is COP21 COP stands for Conference of Parties, an annual meeting of all nations that make up the United Nations Framework on Climate Change -- 195 nations in total. This is the 21st meeting (thus COP21 ), with the first occurring in Berlin in 1995. The purpose of the meetings is to continually assess the nations' progress in dealing with climate change and, every so often, negotiate agreements and set goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions that are the primary drivers of climate change. Previous memorable meetings include COP3 in Kyoto, Japan, which brought about the Kyoto Protocol; COP11, which generated the Montreal Action Plan; and COP15 in Copenhagen, Denmark, which was largely deemed a failure because a binding agreement wasn't reached. What is the goal of the 2015 conference? The goal for Paris in December is pretty clear-cut: to achieve a legally binding agreement, with universal participation among all nations, to keep global warming below what most scientists say is the critical threshold of 2 degrees Celsius of warming. (This refers to the increase in globally averaged temperature since the Industrial Revolution.) This will not be an easy goal to reach, since the planet already has been warmed by 0.85 degrees Celsius since 1880, according to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in 2014, and many scientists say the gases we have already emitted into the atmosphere will "lock us in" to around 2 degrees Celsius of warming. Therefore, it will take significant reductions in emissions in the near future, especially from the largest emitters such as the United States and China, as well as commitments to sustainable development from all countries, which must be financed by the developed (i.e., rich) nations. Who will be there? With more than 40,000 delegates from 195 countries all over the world, it's a huge meeting. In fact, this is the largest conference the French government has ever organized. The host country's President, Francois Hollande will welcome many major world leaders, including U.S. President Barack Obama, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, leaders of three countries with the largest carbon emissions. Many national leaders will be present for the beginning of COP21 , which will hopefully kick off the negotiations with some political momentum. This is a stark change from COP15 in Copenhagen, when the heads of state, including Obama, came in for the last two days of negotiations. This resulted in slow negotiations until the end and talks that ultimately stalled and left the delegates frustrated and embarrassed. It is not clear if Pope Francis will attend the Paris climate conference. The Pope has been a very vocal leader for climate activism and the battle against climate change, and his encyclical, which was released in June, was widely seen as a call for action to put pressure on delegates at COP21 to come up with an agreement. What is necessary for it to be a success? Since the goal is very clear for COP21 , it is necessary for the nations to unanimously adopt a legally binding agreement that will reduce global carbon emissions and aim to keep warming below the 2-degree threshold. Anything resembling Copenhagen in 2009, where some limits to greenhouse gases were agreed upon but no treaty was ultimately signed, would be deemed a failure. The limits that were put in place in the Kyoto Protocol will run out in 2020, so it is imperative that the attendees leave Paris with a new agreement to begin in 2020 and enable long-term change beyond that. The negotiations in Paris will not just focus on national commitments to reduce greenhouse gases, but will also have a financial aspect, which could prove to be a sticking point. Previous meetings have established a $100 billion-per-year commitment, starting in 2020, from developed countries to help developing countries combat climate change and build through sustainable development. Where this money comes from will be a major negotiating point -- how much from public vs. private sources? What role will businesses play? Answering these financial questions will be crucial to the success or failure of the Paris talks. Why is it important to me? Assuming you plan on living on this planet for the next few decades, as opposed to joining the Mars One colonization project, you will be affected by climate change and should care about the outcome of the Paris climate conference, as it will be critical in framing the international response to man-made climate change. A warming climate will lead to more frequent and extreme heat waves, droughts and flash floods. In addition to extreme weather, melting glaciers and ice sheets are raising sea levels, which will continue and affect the lives of hundreds of millions of coastal residents worldwide. Other effects such as water scarcity and changes in food supply will also accompany climate change and, like most of the other effects, will hit the developing world disproportionately. So even as the holiday season is in full swing next month, take a minute from your shopping and keep an eye on the proceedings in Paris, as the fate of the world as we know it could be at stake. \</doc>

February 2016 has now entered the climate hall of fame, or shame. Not only was it the hottest February on record, but it showed the biggest spike in temperature since scientists starting keeping track more than a century ago, according to NASA data. On Saturday, the Administration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies released a report showing February 2016 to be not just the hottest February on record, but the hottest seasonally-adjusted month since 1880.\~ In other words, NASA tracks not only monthly temperatures, but how they compare to that month's long-term average, and February showed the biggest deviation from any month's average in all 136 years of climate records. The all-time absolute\~hottest month on record was July 2015, which at 16.61\'b0 C (61.86\'b0F) was "only" 0.73\'b0 C above July's baseline average. 2015 went on to become the warmest year in recorded history, but many scientists think 2016 is already well on its way to taking that prize. Until October 2015, no month had ever varied more than 1\'b0\~C from the 1951-1980 average. The coldest months were less than one degree colder than average, and the hottest months were less than one degree hotter. In December, governments at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (or COP21 )\~pledged to take strong measures to stave off more than a 2\'b0 C hike.\~ The trend is bigger than a few hot months, or even a record-hot year. "There's nothing magical about a calendar year," said Deke Arndt, chief of the monitoring branch of the National Centers for Environmental Information at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to\~Discover Magazine: We (myself included) really, really overdo the cook-off comparisons of one year versus another.... But the fact is, we've been setting a new 'warmest 12 month stretch in recorded history' record almost every month for the past year. That's the story, scientifically.\~ The monthly rise above baseline average may dip down again this spring, as the El Ni\'f1o-fueled ocean warming that helped create higher temps falls off; the phenomenon also drove drought and ensuing forest fires this year, pushing up CO2 levels as well, according to Weather Underground. But the huge difference between February 1998 and February 2016's record-breaking temperatures, despite both being El Ni\'f1o years, is just one reason climate scientists believe the long-term trend is clear: global warming, not just storm systems, played a role. But storms are a major reason to worry about the impact of climate change, particularly in the world's poorest countries, which pushed at the COP21 conference for a temp-raising limit of 1.5\'b0 C. Disasters as diverse as drought in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia; cyclones in the Pacific; and rising coastal waters have all been linked to warming temperatures, and the hardest-hit nations, which tend to emit fewer greenhouse gases, often lack the resources to adjust. Developed countries at COP21 pledged $100 billion per year by 2020 to help. Of course, some up and down fluctuations in global temperature are normal. "We have had 10,000 fairly warm, fairly boring years, with little wiggles caused by the sun getting brighter or dimmer, and wiggles caused by volcanoes exploding and blocking the sun with dust for a couple years," Penn State University geoscience professor Richard Alley told NPR at the end of the climate conference. The problem is that we're not wiggling anymore. Since the 1880s, global temperatures have already risen about 1\'b0 C. This February, in comparison, was 1.35\'b0 C above the monthly average from just 1951-1980, when the impact of global warming was already in play. It was more than 1.6\'b0 C warmer than the average temperatures between 1880 and 1900. "This result is a\~true shocker, and yet another reminder of the incessant long-term rise in global temperature resulting from human-produced greenhouse gases," Jeffrey Masters and climate journalist Bob Henson wrote at Weather Underground. "We are now hurtling at a frightening pace toward the globally agreed maximum of 2.0\'b0 C warming over pre-industrial levels." \</doc>

Climate change has been held responsible many of the social and economic woes affecting mainly the poorest in the global South and now many are seeing it as one of the root causes of refugee crises. In his State of the Union speech here Sep. 9 to the European Parliament, even European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker said that an "ambitious, robust and binding" climate treaty is needed to prevent another refugee crisis. Climate change is one the root causes of a new migration phenomenon," said Juncker. "Climate refugees will become a new challenge - if we do not act swiftly." Calling on the European Union and its international partners to be more ambitious about climate protection, Juncker warned that "the EU will not sign just any deal" at the United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ), scheduled to be held in Paris in December. The COP21 Climate change marked by longer-lasting droughts, more violent storms and rising sea levels is worsening the living conditions of hundreds of millions. Particularly in the poorest countries, climate change has the effect of forcing people who are unable to adapt to leave their homes. In the Sahelian countries, Bangladesh and in the South Pacific people have already had to flee because of climate impacts. According to Jan Kowalzig from Oxfam, "climate change is already causing a lot of damage in the global South. It could ruin all progress which has been made in the fight against global poverty over the last decades." However, it is the relationship between climate change and the refugee phenomenon that is attracting the attention of many experts. Earlier this year, a study by a research team from Columbia University and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) held global warming partly responsible for the civil war in Syria. The study noted that between 2006 and 2010, Syria faced the "worst drought in the instrumental record", leading to crop failures and mass migration within the country. According to climate models, this drought would have been highly improbable without climate change. "For Syria, a country marked by poor governance and unsustainable agricultural and environmental policies, the drought had a catalytic effect, contributing to political unrest," the study concluded. The number of refugees entering Europe this year is the highest on record and Syrians are by far the largest group - an estimated nine million Syrians have left their homes so far. Besides the Syrian crisis, the United Nations warns that, worldwide, climate change could increase the number of refugees dramatically. Srgjan Kerim, president of the United Nations General Assembly, has estimated that global warming could cause up to 200 million refugees until 2050. "Tomorrow we will have climate refugees and we have to know that," Juncker told the European Parliament. Oxfam's Kowalzig explains what needs to be included in a climate treaty to mitigate a potential refugee crisis: "Climate change expels people from their homes and this is where a potential climate treaty in Paris comes in: first, we need to cut emissions and keep global warming below two degrees; secondly, people in poor countries need support to adapt to climate change; and thirdly, a climate treaty in Paris has to lay down rules for damages and losses caused by global warming where adaption is not possible." In his speech in Strasbourg, Juncker also admitted that the European Union "is probably not doing enough" to tackle climate change. The EU has announced greenhouse gas emission cuts of 40 percent by 2030 as part of its 'Intended Nationally Determined Contribution' (INDC). INDCs are the commitments every country is supposed to announce before the climate conference in Paris. However, because a treaty in Paris based on the INDCs will not be enough to keep global warming below 2oC, many organisations and countries from the global South are demanding a five-yearly "review and improve" process to make climate commitments more ambitious over time. Any agreement reached in Paris should at least offer a perspective for effective climate protection and this depends heavily on the process of creating a regular built-in review that would enable countries to improve that agreement. Last week, formal negotiations ahead of COP21 in Paris were held, but while there was support for long-term goals, short-term commitments seemed to be far less popular. An agreement in Paris with short-term commitments and five-year cycles without a concrete long-term goal might not be perfect. It would lack a perspective beyond 2030, but it would enhance climate protection and greenhouse gas reduction in the next 15 years. On the other hand, an agreement with an ambitious long-term goal but no effective short-term measures would allow countries to fall far behind with their greenhouse gas reductions and many would just not be able to catch up after 2030.

In case you don't know, Brandalism[1] is brand vandalism, and just two days before the launch of the UN COP21 Climate Conference over 600 posters have popped up around Paris to highlight pollution and the results.<nl/> The unique creations come from big names such as Banksy-collaborator Paul Insect, Alex One, Know Hope, Escif, Cleon Peterson, Hyuro, Jimmy Cauty, Ron English and many others and are strategically placed in advertising spaces owned by JC Decaux, one the the largest outdoor advertising firms and an official sponsor of the climate talks. The project aims to challenge the corporate takeover of the climate change event, doing so with connections between advertising, the promotion of consumerism, and fossil fuel consumption.

Bureaucracies. They can be weird, right? Sometimes they form their own microcultures and create unique words to go with those cultures. Example: The United Nations Paris Climate Change Conference and the 21st session of the Conference of Parties. In U.N.-speak, it's called COP21 . If you haven't heard about COP21 yet, it's a big meeting of bureaucrats from 195 nations happening between November 30 and December 11 in Paris, where they'll discuss the current impact of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. They also might negotiate new agreements or set goals aimed at cutting emissions in the future. Here's a sampling of unique language surrounding COP21 . See if you can figure it out. It's from a document about workflow -- and be warned -- it may give you a headache: "... the ADP shall hold its first session of 2016 in conjunction with the first sessions of the SBSTA and the SBI in 2016 to organize its work on the implementation of the work programme referred to in paragraphs 7--9 above and to prepare draft decisions to be recommended by the COP to the CMA for consideration and adoption at its first session; ..." It brings to mind a more familiar acronym: WTF. I'm wondering who ADP is. Apparently it's important to know when the COP will get with the CMA. Seems like there may be a bit of drama here: Will the ADP be able to coordinate with the SBSTA and the SBI? Seriously, how will everyday humans understand this alien bureau-speak without a cheat sheet? Wait! Cheat sheet. Great idea! Here are some COP21 -related acronyms we may run into during the conference. Alliances of nations: To strengthen their negotiating positions, nations with similar interests come to COP21 as members of various alliances -- kind of like an episode of TV's "Survivor" or "Big Brother." Climate change blogger Renee Juliene Karunungan has been having some fun with it, too. "In high school you had the jocks and cheerleaders, the bullies, and the nerds. In the UNFCCC you have the negotiating blocks ..." Some of these names sound like they could be the next new recording artist, dropping a fresh album on iTunes. Who knows? Soon we all might be chillin' to the infectious beats of G77, AR5 and BASIC. G77: The Group of 77 and China also includes Chile, India, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and 72 others OPEC: The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries: CD: Cartagena Dialogue is an informal alliance of about 40 countries. AOSIS: Alliance of Small Island States are 44 island and low-lying coastal countries AILAC: Association of Independent Latin American and Caribbean States MLDC: Mountainous Landlocked Developing Countries includes Armenia, Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan BASIC: Brazil, South Africa, India, China LAS: League of Arab States: 21 Arab nations in northern and northeastern Africa and southwest Asia CVF: Climate Vulnerable Forum is made up of 20 nations which describe themselves as "highly vulnerable to a warming planet."

ASEAN: Association of Southeast Asian Nations consists of 10 member states BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa CACAM Group: Central Asia, Caucasus, Albania and Moldova Things: UNFCCC: United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a global climate treaty agreed on in 1992. COP21 comes 21 years after the birth of UNFCCC. GHG: Greenhouse gases are gases blamed for climate change because they trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere. Examples include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases. AR5: The Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which details the effects of climate change, both currently and in the future CDM: The Clean Development Mechanism allows emission reduction projects in developing countries earn certified emission reduction (CER) credits which can be traded and sold, and used by industrialized countries to a meet part of their emission reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol is a 1997 global climate treaty that extended a previous treaty from 1992. Panels and groups: IPCC: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change evaluates scientific information surrounding climate change. WGs: Three Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change working groups, which are tasked with three different areas of interest CSD: The Commission on Sustainable Development is tasked with following up on agreements at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), aka the Earth Summit.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization issued the following news release: Six months ahead of the Paris Climate Conference ( COP21 ) that will take place at the end of 2015, World Oceans Day, celebrated on 8 June each year, provided an opportunity to launch a Call to take the ocean into account in climate negotiations. This Call echoes the recommendations formulated by representatives of the scientific community and civil society through a day of discussions organized by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO and the Ocean and Climate Platform at UNESCO Headquarters. The Day was opened by UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova in the presence, notably, of the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Laurent Fabius, the United Nations and UN-Oceans representative Miguel Serpa Soares, and the Director of the French National Museum of Natural History and representative of the Ocean and Climate Platform, Gilles Boeuf. The workshops, round tables, UNESCO Campus open to students and exhibitions that set the pace of the Day were designed to highlight the ocean's essential role in climate processes. Yet international climate negotiations have not paid nearly enough attention to it. "It is imperative that we improve our understanding of the link between ocean and climate, and that we raise awareness regarding what we already know" declared the Director-General of UNESCO, recalling the launch of the Ocean & Climate Platform at UNESCO a year ago "to share scientific knowledge with negotiators and the general public". "There can be no sustainable development without a living ocean. Any attempt to reach a climate agreement must take the ocean's role into account in order to succeed" further highlighted Irina Bokova. "The COP [ United Nations Climate Change Conference ] in Paris must help to accelerate public awareness because the ocean is part of the solution. It is a critical ally in the fight against climate change" stressed Laurent Fabius, who pledged that a day would be dedicated to the ocean during COP21 . The Day concluded with a Call aiming to mobilize the Member States and raise the awareness climate negotiations stakeholders. The signatories (members of the Ocean and Climate Platform comprising NGOs, private sector representatives, scientific institutions and IOC-UNESCO) stressed the importance of protected and functioning marine ecosystems in view of the services they provide, such as their natural capacity to capture CO2. Additionally, their role as "lung" of the planet is as important as forests'. The Call also pleas for an integration of sustainable marine biodiversity management projects into climate finance mechanisms. The need to support scientific research, as a means to expand our understanding of climate processes and thus improve political action is another component. It will be presented to Member States during COP21 in December 2015, together with a set of recommendations to include the ocean in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. It was read by Sandra Bessudo, the Columbian High Presidential Counselor for Environmental Management, Biodiversity, Water & Climate Change, to the attendees of the closing ceremony, notably HSH Prince Albert II of Monaco, Tommy Remengesau, President of Palau, Freundel Stuart, Prime Minister of Barbados, and Danny Faure, Vice-president of the Seychelles. Everyone is invited to give the ocean a voice by signing the Call on change.org/oceanforclimate (#OceanForClimate), thus joining forces with the scientists, skippers, and associations that will champion this vital call for the planet's future during climate negotiations. About the Ocean and Climate Platform The Ocean and Climate Platform stems from an alliance of non-governmental organizations and research institutes, with the support of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO. It was established in on 10 June 2014 on the occasion of World Oceans day. Today the Platform includes scientific organizations, universities, research institutions, non-profit associations, foundations, science centers, public institutions and business organizations, all acting to bring the ocean to the forefront in climate discussions.

U.S., June 30 -- World Travel Market's World Responsible Tourism Day (WRTD) 2015 will tackle the issue of climate change weeks before it is discussed by the United Nations to achieve the first legally binding agreement in 20 years. WRTD - the largest day of global responsible tourism action - takes place on Wednesday 4 November, weeks before the world's leaders gather in Paris at the United Nations Climate Change Conference to discuss how to reduce greenhouse gas emission to limit the global temperate increase to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The November 30 -December 11UN conference aims to succeed where the same event in Copenhagen failed in 2009, by reaching a global consensus on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. WRTD will kick off with a keynote address from controversial Kevin Anderson, Professor of Energy and Climate Change in the School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering at the University of Manchester. Anderson, who is also Deputy Director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, advises the Prime Minister's office on carbon trading and has contributed to the development of the UK's Climate Change Act. Following Anderson's keynote address will be a panel debate, chaired by BBC journalist Stephen Sackur, where he will be joined by senior industry executives, and Anderson, to discuss how the travel industry can help in the reduction of greenhouse gasses. The afternoon's content concludes with the carbon debate - where the motion The tourism industry could do much more to take responsibility for reducing carbon emissions will be hotly contested. World Travel Market, Senior Director, Simon Press said: "The United Nations Climate Change conference in Paris has the potential to have a significant impact on the travel industry. "With World Travel Market taking places weeks before the conference we can help set the agenda by discussing climate change and the role the travel industry can play in addressing the issue. "Kevin Anderson is a highly respected speaker on the climate change and will present to delegates a thought-provoking, controversial and potential worrying picture of where the world is on tackling climate change."WRTD - the largest day of global responsible tourism action - takes place on Wednesday 4 November, weeks before the world's leaders gather in Paris at the United Nations Climate Change Conference to discuss how to reduce greenhouse gas emission to limit the global temperate increase to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

Oct 19, 2015( Tech City News: HYPERLINK http://techcitynews.com http://techcitynews.com At the time of writing there over 80 signatories representing over $1trn in assets under management.<nl/> In parallel, the Portfolio Decarbonisation Coalition was launched by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) to mobilize a critical mass of institutional investors committed to gradually decarbonising their portfolios. Institutional investors have committed to decarbonising over $100bn of equity portfolios.<nl/> It is reasonable to assume that such voluntary initiatives will, over the course of the next decade, be accompanied by mandatory regulatory requirements as national governments seek greater transparency from investors and their agents over whether and indeed how Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) analysis is being incorporated into the portfolio construction process.<nl/> All this is occurring against the backdrop of a growing global fossil fuel divestment campaign, with over 440 institutions pledging to drop fossil fuel holdings by September 2015. The primary driver for this action comes from the risk that company reserves will become stranded as governments move to limit rising global temperatures.<nl/> 2014 also saw the United States and China, the world's largest polluters and economies, agree an historic deal to cut their emissions, while the European Union announced that it would reduce its emissions by 40% by 2030.<nl/> Action at the national, city, state and region level is also growing rapidly. Since January 2012, the number of carbon pricing instruments already implemented or scheduled for implementation has almost doubled, jumping from 20 to 38. Moreover, the share of emissions covered by carbon pricing has increased threefold over the last decade.<nl/> As of 2015 there are now 39 national and 23 sub-national schemes putting a price on carbon. Together, carbon pricing instruments cover about half of the emissions in these jurisdictions, which translates to about 12% of global emissions.<nl/> 2015 has seen countries announce in increasing numbers their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), their pledges to limit emissions in the run up to the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in December. As of September, 33 submissions have been received by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, reflecting 60 countries (including the European Union member states), and covering around 66% of global emissions.<nl/> Meanwhile, the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has become increasingly vocal on the issue of a carbon assets becoming stranded. In September 2015 he warned that investors face 'potentially huge' losses from climate change action that could make vast reserves of oil, coal and gas 'literally unburnable'.<nl/> Perhaps the most significant event of 2015 was the introduction of 'la loi transition \'e9nerg\'e9tique pour la croissance verte' in France which has made it mandatory for institutional investors to begin disclosing the full carbon footprint of their portfolios with a view to reducing their exposure to carbon over time from 2016. Other countries may well follow suit.<nl/> So what does all of this mean? Regardless of whatever comes out of Paris COP21 , the cost of carbon is increasing.<nl/> Sam Gill is CEO of ET Index[1], a company focused on advancing environmental tracking - a stock market incentive mechanism designed to bring about global reductions in carbon emissions by linking company share price to emissions.<nl/> Ahead of COP21 in Paris in December,\~he will\~explore a number of the key\~issues he\~believes surround the climate change debate and the inevitable shift away from fossil fuels.<nl/> The post # COP21 : Should investors care about Paris climate talks?[2] appeared first on Tech City News[3].<nl/> [ 1]: HYPERLINK http://etindex.com http://etindex.com / [ 2]: \~ HYPERLINK http://techcitynews.com/2015/10/19/cop21-should-investors-care-about-paris-climate-talks/ http://techcitynews.com/2015/10/19/ HYPERLINK cop21 -should-investors-care-about-paris-climate-talks/ [ 3]: \~ HYPERLINK http://techcitynews.com http://techcitynews.com \</doc>

The following information was released by the European Parliament: A delegation of 15 MEPs heads to Paris this week as world leaders gather at COP21 to hammer out a global agreement to fight climate change. Back in Brussels members of the civil liberties committee discuss the current situation concerning so-called migrant "hotspots" in Greece and Italy. In addition MEPs meet their counterparts from African, Caribbean and Pacific countries in Brussels, and Parliament's political groups prepare for the final plenary session of the year in Strasbourg next week. From Monday to Friday a delegation of 15 MEPs, led by the chair of Parliament's environment committee Giovanni La Via, takes part in the UN climate conference in Paris. In a resolution adopted in October ahead of the COP21 meeting, Parliament called on the EU and its member states to scale up climate finance commitments and to propose a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Live updates from Paris are available on our Storify page. On Monday the civil liberties committee discusses the current situation at the "hotspots" which are being set up in Greece and Italy to help tackle the extraordinary migratory flows of late. Representatives of the European Asylum Support Office, Frontex, the Greek and Italian authorities as well as NGOs will be in attendance. On Monday the internal market committee debates draft EU rules to ban semi-automatic weapons for civilian use and prevent both the reactivation of deactivated weapons and the purchase of spare parts online. Also on Monday Parliament, Commission and Council representatives meet to discuss the proposed EU cybersecurity directive. From Monday to Wednesday the 30th ACP-EU joint parliamentary assembly takes place in Brussels. MEPs and their counterparts from the parliaments of African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states are to debate and vote on resolutions on migration, human rights and humanitarian refugees. On Thursday the budgets committee votes on a request from Ireland and Finland for over 3 million in EU aid to help more than 1,300 redundant workers in finding new employment. Political groups also prepare for the final plenary session of 2015 which takes place in Strasbourg next week. \</doc>

The White House today released the readout from President Obama's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the COP21 Summit. The White House says Obama and Putin "continued their discussion of the situation in Syria and Ukraine. President Obama expressed his regret for the recent loss of a Russian pilot and crew member and reiterated the United States' support for de-escalation between Russia and Turkey. The two Presidents discussed the imperative of making progress on the Vienna process to bring about a ceasefire and political resolution to the civil war in Syria. President Obama reiterated his belief that it will be necessary for Bashar al-Asad to leave power as a part of the transition and stressed the imperative of focusing military efforts against ISIL, as our international coalition is doing, rather than targeting moderate opposition. The two leaders directed their Foreign Ministers to continue to work together to move the Vienna process forward. President Obama also emphasized the importance of working towards a diplomatic solution to the crisis in eastern Ukraine through full implementation of Russia's obligations under the Minsk agreements, noting that if Minsk is fully implemented, sanctions can be rolled back." \</doc>

Dhaka has urged the European Union (EU) countries to support Climate Vulnerable Forum's (CVF), chaired by Bangladesh, demands regarding climate adaptation and financing during the upcoming UN climate conference, COP26 to be held in Glasgow. The urge was made while foreign minister DR A K Abdul Momen along with environment, forest and climate change minister Md Shahab Uddin briefed the ambassadors of the EU countries stationed here regarding Bangladesh's preparation and expectation centering the COP26 at the foreign ministry. "We want their (EU's) partnership at the COP 26 ... so that they talk in favour of our issues those we will raise during the COP26 ," Dr Momen told newsmen at a briefing after a recent meeting with the European envoys. During the COP 26, the minister said Bangladesh's major issues will be to get support from developed countries in climate adaptation to refrain people from being climate refugees. "We will raise the loss and damage issue during the COP26 ... and we sought their (EU's) support in this regards," Momen said adding that the 'loss and damage' issue has been added in the COP26 agenda. The minister said, he urged the EU to contribute in realizing the 100 billion US dollar annual climate fund that was supposed to start from 2020, pledged by the most carbon emitting developed countries at the Paris agreement in 2015. "We are optimistic that the $100 billion US pledge will be ensured during the COP26 ," he added. He said Bangladesh will also raise the demand at the COP26 to allocate climate fund for mitigation and adaptation under 50:50 ratio. \</doc>

The Glasgow Climate Change Conference (October 31-November 12, 2021), the world leaders' climate summit brought together the head of states and delegates (a total of 11,000 participants from 195 states, UN organizations, inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations), made strong calls for greater ambition with making new financial pledges by several developed countries. The COP26 adopted the Climate Pact: phasing-down unabated coal power plants and phasing-out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies with a strong statement by the UN Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres at his opening and closing session: ' COP26 must keep 1.5\'b0 C Goal Alive'. The synthesis report of UNFCCC showed that the updated NDCs would lead to 2.7\'b0 C of global warming by 2100. The COP26 COP26 pact includes: developed countries to double their adaptation finance (from 2019 level) by 2025; parties to updated NDCs before the next COP27; annual high-level ministerial roundtable on pre-2030 ambition; dialogue between parties on loss and damage for future adaptation works treating it not a technocratic issue, rather it is a life or death issue to convene from 2021 to 2024. The ambition on mitigation: (i) to reduce global carbon emissions by 45% by 2030, also actions to introduce pricing on carbon; (ii) to protect vulnerable communities from dangers of climate change (last decade, 4.0 billion people suffered from climate-related disasters); and (iii) COP must be a moment of solidarity, ensuring US$ 100 billion a year climate finance commitment in support of developing countries (even needed far greater finance to fight and recover from COVID-19, build resilience and pursue for sustainable development). Bangladesh in COP26 The Hon'ble Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, joined the COP26 delivered a speech on the need of contemporary climate actions to the COP leaders, and pointed out that Bangladesh is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries, but contributing only less than 0.47% of global emissions is a model of climate-adaptation program, faced most climate challenges successfully. The country has established 'Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund' in 2009 and has allocated US$480 million from its own resources, doubled climate-related expenses in last 7 years, doubled in Annual Development Plan from US$1.44 billion (2015-2016) to US$2.96 billion in 2021-2022, and presently preparing the National Adaptation Plan. Bangladesh has already canceled 10 coal-based plants worth US$12 billion of foreign investment, working on a sustainable energy mix, and hopes for 40% energy from renewable sources by 2041. As a Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) and V-20, Bangladesh promotes the interest of 48 climate-vulnerable countries; sharing best practices, and adaptation knowledge with other vulnerable countries through Global Centre on South-Asia Regional Adaptation Office in Dhaka. Bangladesh Prime Minister extends the COP leaders for the climate commitments and wished for working together for the following achievable goals: (1) The major emitters must submit the ambitious NDCs, and implement those; (2) The developed countries should fulfill their commitments of providing US$100 billion with a 50:50 balance between adaptation and mitigation, and also need to synergies amongst various climate funds; (3) The developed countries should disseminate clean energy, green, and advanced technology to the most vulnerable developing countries at affordable costs. The CVF countries are needed to be considered for their development; (4) The issue of loss and damage must be addressed, including global sharing of responsibility for climate migrants by sea-level rise, salinity increase, river erosion, floods, and droughts; and (5) There should be 'common global commitments' for leaving a healthier planet for the future generation. Bangladesh's NDC Bangladesh has already prepared its ambitious and updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) 2021, and submitted them to UNFCCC on 26 August 2021. Bangladesh has undertaken a progressive approach to develop its economy on a low carbon pathway. In the NDC, Bangladesh committed to reduce GHG emissions in the power, industry and transport sectors of 12 MTCO2e or 5% below 'business-as-usual' with domestic resources by 2030 as unconditional and 36 MTCO2e or 15% below 'business-as-usual' with foreign technology support within 2030 as conditional contribution. The Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015 by COP21, signed and ratified by 191 Parties. The Paris goals are to combat climate change, protecting sustainable development pathways: (i) to limit global temperature within 1.5 degree Celsius; (ii) limit the GHG at same level, that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally between 2050 and 2100; (iii) the key element of the Paris goal is Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), previously referred as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) before the ratification, to set by each country of its own emission-reduction targets, reviewed every five years to raise ambition, and (iv) rich countries to help poorer nations by providing "climate finance" to adapt to climate change and switch to renewable energy. Bangladesh submitted its first INDC to UNFCCC on 25 September 2015, later the NDC Implementation Roadmap and Action Plan in 2018. In the NDCs, Bangladesh has covered the sectors of energy (power, transport, energy use in industry, residential, commercial, agriculture and brick manufacturing), Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU), Agriculture, Forestry and other Land-use (AFOLU) and waste sectors according to IPCC guidelines. The updated NDC tries to represent an economy-wide GHG emission reduction, an implementation roadmap for NDC to manage growing emissions to play its role in global efforts to limit temperature within 1.5 degree Celsius. Bangladesh is contributing only 0.47 tonnes of annual carbon emission (0.36% of the global carbon emissions), while developed nations are about 20 tonnes. Bangladesh is the 7th most affected country of the world due to adverse impacts of climate change, ranks 152 out-of 188 countries of world GHG emission, 33rd most vulnerable country and 25th least-ready country (meaning that it is highly vulnerable, not ready to prevent or reduce climate change effects). Carbon Emissions Scenario 2021-2030 Bangladesh's total GHG emission is found to be increased from 169.05 MTCO2e in 2012 to 409.4 MTCO2e in 2030 under the Business as Usual (BAU) scenario with an increase of 2.4 times than base year (2012). The sector-wise emissions under BAU scenario by 2030 are 312.54 MTCO2e (76.34% of total) in energy, 10.97 MTCO2e (2.68% of total) in IPPU, 55.01 MTCO2e (13.44% of total) in AFOLU and 30.89 MTCO2e (7.55% of total) in waste sector. The highest contribution (24.91% of total) of GHG emission is found for the industry (energy) sub-sector followed by power (23.24% of total) and transport (8.86% of total) under the energy sector. Bangladesh Mitigation Action Plan: 2021-2030 The mitigation scenario is achievable but ambitious unconditional and conditional GHG mitigation measures by 2030 for the updated NDC have been prepared. In the unconditional part of NDC, only mitigation measures are considered which would be implemented based on current local-level capacity, and financed through internal resources. The conditional emission reduction will be implemented by international funding and technological support. The updated unconditional and conditional contributions are: Unconditional Contribution In the unconditional scenario, GHG emissions would be reduced by 27.56 MTCO2e (6.73%) below BAU in 2030, where 26.3 MTCO2e (95.4%) emission reduction will from Energy sector while 0.64 (2.3%) and 0.6 (2.2%) MTCO2e reduction will from AFOLU (agriculture) and waste sector respectively. Conditional Contribution In the conditional scenario, GHG emissions would be reduced by 61.9 MTCO2e (15.12%) below BAU in 2030 in the respective sectors. This reduction is proposed in an unconditional scenario. The conditional mitigation measures will be implemented by Bangladesh, if there is external financial/technology support. The conditional scenario is 59.7 MTCO2e (96.46%), emission reduction from the energy sector, while 0.4 (0.65%) MTCO2e and 1.84 (2.97%) MTCO2e reduction will be from AFOLU (agriculture) and waste sector respectively. Potential Action Plan: 2021-2030 Unconditional Contribution The targeted GHG emission reduction for unconditional contributions will be implemented through a set of mitigation actions in different sectors: Power: Implementation of renewable energy projects-911.8 MW; Grid-connected Solar-581 MW; Wind-149 MW; Biomass-20 MW; Biogas-5 MW; New Hydro-100 MW; Solar Mini-grid-56.8 MW; Installation of New Combined Cycle Gas based power plant-3208 MW; Efficiency improvement of existing gas turbine power plant-570 MW; Installation of prepaid meters; Establishment of waste to energy plants. Transport: Improvement of road traffic congestion (5% in fuel efficiency); Development of Urban Transport Master Plans to improve transport systems with Urban-City Plan; Introducing Intelligent Transport System based public transport management system to ensure better performance, enhance reliability, safety and services; Modal-shift from road to rail (10% modal-shift) through different transport projects, i.e. Padma Bridge etc.; Improved Inland Water Transport System (to enhance navigation performance). Industry: Achieve 10% energy efficiency in industry sub-sector through Energy Efficiency and Conservation Master Plan up to 2030. Agriculture: Implementation of 5,925 numbers solar irrigation pumps (generating 176.38MW). Brick Kilns: 14% emission reduction through banning fixed chimney kilns, encouraging advanced technology and non-fired brick use. Residential and Commercial: Use energy-efficient appliances in buildings to achieve 5% and 12% reduction in emission respectively. Forestry: Increase covering forest-trees from 22.37% (2014) to 24%; Afforestation and reforestation in the coastal areas, islands and degraded areas -150,000 hectares; Restore the deforested forests -337,800 hectares at hill and plain land; Plantation in roadsides, embankments, private lands. Conditional Contribution The mitigation actions for conditional contributions will be in a more extensive way along with the unconditional contribution in different sectors: Power: Implementation of renewable energy projects of 4114.3 MW; Grid-connected Solar-2277 MW; Wind-597 MW; Biomass-50 MW; Biogas-5 MW; New Hydro-1000 MW; Solar Mini-grid-56.8 MW; Waste to Electricity-128.5 MW; Coal power plant with Ultra-super critical technology-12147 MW; Installation of new Combined-cycle gas based power plant-5613 MW; Efficiency improvement of Existing Gas Turbine power plant-570 MW; Installation of prepaid meter; Bring-down system loss to single digit by 2030. Transport: Improvement of road traffic congestion (15% in fuel efficiency); Development of Urban Transport Master Plans to improve transport systems with Urban-City Plan; Introducing Intelligent Transport System based public transport management system to ensure better performance, enhance reliability, safety and services; Modal-shift from road to rail (25% modal-shift) through different Transport projects such as Multi-modal hub creation, new bridges etc.; Electrification of the railway system and double-track construction; Improved Inland Water Transport system (same as unconditional). Industry: Achieve 20% energy efficiency in the industry sub-sector through Energy Efficiency and Conservation Master Plan up-to 2030; Promote green-industry and carbon-financing. Agriculture: Implementation of 4,102 numbers solar irrigation pumps (generating 164 MW). Brick Kilns: 47% emission reduction through banning fixed chimney kilns, encouraging advanced technology and non-fired brick use. Residential and Commercial: Use energy-efficient appliances in buildings to achieve 19% and 25% reduction in emission respectively. Fugitive Emission: 51% emission reduction from gas-leakage through CDM projects. Forestry: Maintain covering forest-trees through collaborative forest management, and social forestry programs; coastal afforestation program, restoration of degraded or deforested areas; Plantation in roadsides, embankments, private lands. Conclusions Bangladesh is adapting a two-fold strategy against climate change impact. The main focus is to increase resilience to the impact, and to achieve lower greenhouse gas emission, more resilient development. Bangladesh has given emphasis on the 'mitigation' and £daptation' programs for NDC, which co-exist for the long-term vision. Bangladesh currently spends US$ 2.0 billion per year, around 6-7% of its annual budget on climate change adaptation, of which 75% money comes from the government, while the rest comes from international development partners including bilateral, multilateral and private funding. It is estimated that the country would need US$ 5.7 billion as adaptation finance by 2050.Bangladesh's NDC, has an adaptation component that describes the priorities of future long-term vision with mitigation actions. The adaptation and mitigation often coexist, and quite a few adaptation actions have mitigation co-benefits. Also the agreed decisions of COP26 would be an opportunity to make Bangladesh a stronger ambition to climate adaptation action plan (Source: UNFCCC 2021). \</doc>

Nov. 9 Tokyo(The Japan News/ANN)  Japanese companies are promoting their decarbonization technologies at the 26th U.N. Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ). As decarbonization is a global issue, related technologies could become a future focus of exports. Therefore, the companies are trying to expand business opportunities by pitching their technologies to dignitaries from various countries participating in COP26 . At the COP26 COP26 , some business seminars and events are also being held online for the first time, making it possible for about 30 companies to participate from Japan. Technologies for capturing and monitoring greenhouse gas emissions have attracted attention at the pavilion. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. pitches its carbon dioxide capture and storage technology. The technology is designed to collect CO2 from exhaust gas generated by thermal power plants and other factories by using a special liquid, which absorbs CO2, and then to compress and store the captured CO2 underground or in the deep sea. The company said this technology has the capability to capture more than 90% of the CO2 in exhaust gas. The technology has been adopted at 13 locations around the world, holding a 70% global share. MHI aims to take COP26 as an opportunity to expand its market further. Reuven Carlyle, a member of the Washington State legislature who visited the Japan Pavilion, expressed his surprise at such advanced technology, saying it could contribute to decarbonization efforts around the world.  Longer drive range Energy sources that do not emit greenhouse gases and energy-saving technologies also have drawn strong interest among COP26 participants. Panasonic Corp. is presenting its fuel-cell system that uses hydrogen at factories and commercial buildings. Combined with solar power generation, this system aims to generate up to 10,000 kilowatts or more of electricity without emitting greenhouse gases. The company intends to put it to practical use in 2030 or later with an eye toward adoption of the system in locations such as large semiconductor factories and storage battery plants. "There has been strong interest [in the system] mainly from oil-producing countries that are trying to shift their industry focus," said Shoji Kusumoto, director of Panasonic's Environmental Management Department. COP26 According to the International Energy Agency, annual investment of $4 trillion (about \£5450 trillion) in clean energy is required worldwide to achieve decarbonization. Japan is also likely to see a growing need to sell decarbonization technologies overseas from the viewpoint of its growth strategy. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

The 26th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) began on Monday at the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) in Glasgow with a mission to unite the world to tackle climate change and its adverse impacts. The United Kingdom is hosting this year's COP26 event where world leaders have gathered with the aim of securing global net zero carbon emissions by mid-century and keeping global warming below 1.5\'baC. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is also the President of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), joined the event with other world leaders. On her arrival at the programme venue, United Nations Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson welcomed her. Hasina arrived in Scotland on Sunday (Oct 31) to attend the conference dubbed the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties. Her daughter Saima Wazed Hossain, Thematic Ambassador of CVF, is also accompanying her. Hasina will deliver her speech after the inauguration ceremony of COP26 . The first COP meeting was held in Berlin, Germany in 1995, and was dubbed COP1. At COPs, nations come together to assess global progress towards tackling climate change. The COP26 climate summit comes six years after the Paris Agreement was signed by over 190 countries to limit the rise of global temperatures to well below 2C with a view of reaching 1.5C. According to the UN, global temperatures are currently set to rise to 2.7C. Scientists are clear that emissions must halve by 2030 to keep the aims made in Paris within reach. \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 8 -- A counter climate summit has kicked off in Glasgow ahead of the final week of Cop26 , with activists criticising "false promises" and inaction from world leaders at the UN-led conference. The People's Summit for Climate Justice, which is running from Sunday to Wednesday, will host around 200 sessions in-person and online. Organisers said it will "centre the voices of the most marginalised, those who are being hit hardest by climate change right now, and the people resisting and organising for change", reports The Independent. Jana Ahlers, the counter summit's programme co-ordinator, said the counter-event will bring together "indigenous peoples, bus drivers, film makers, refugees, pilots, farmers, feminists, forest dwellers, artists, doctors, anti-racists and climate justice activists". "To deliver justice you have to guarantee that all people are around the table," she said. The summit will include workshops on how to sue fossil fuel companies and on defending the right to protest, a tour of Glasgow's biggest polluters and sessions on climate movements from around the world. It comes after protesters rallied in cities across the world to demand climate justice on Saturday in a day of action, which was also organised by the Cop26 Coalition. Thousands took to the street in London on the final weekend of the Glasgow climate summit. Speaking about the counter summit, Harpreet Kaur Paul from climate campaign group Tipping Point UK said: "What is on the table for discussion at Cop26 falls far short of what justice and science demand." She said this meant it was "essential" to participate in the People's Summit. Ramon Mejia from the Grassroots Global Justice Alliance said the event was an "opportunity for our members, frontline communities and global movements to ensure our voices are heard". He added: "We will oppose false promises like 'net-zero' commitments, uplift real solutions from the frontlines, and demand our governments take the aggressive action required for climate justice and to be accountable to the People and the Planet." Indigenous groups have complained of being sidelined by the main Cop26 event at Glasgow's SEC. "We still don't have a seat at the table," Tom Goldtooth, executive director of the Indigenous Environmental Network, told The Independent this week. "In some areas [of the venue] we don't have access, and they're very critical in terms of negotiations. So we're forced to try to grab people in the hallways."

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is all set to hold the COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland from October 31. The two-week long event is taking place at a time when the entire world from East to West and North to South is struggling to face a crisis like situation with short supply of fossil fuel, a major source of carbon emission and global warming. The global market is currently witnessing a sharp rise in prices of coal, gas and LNG amid production cuts while the demand for energy skyrocketed as the countries were trying to recover from the COVID-induced economic slowdown. The European Union, which is committed to phase out fossil fuel as soon as possible, is now struggling to ensure energy supply while the United Kingdom, which is hosting the event in partnership with Italy, has started rationing gas due to its shortage. Under the circumstances, the countries were making their desperate efforts to source fossil fuel to keep their engines running. As a result, the global temperature would increase further. In this critical situation, the leaders, including Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, and negotiators from across the world are set to attend the COP26 while the entire world is waiting to see what decisions are being delivered by the leaderships to save the planet from climate change impacts. However, relevant experts are expecting that the COP26 would be able to finalize through negotiation the 'Rule Book' for implementing the Paris Agreement on climate change. The targets are to mitigate the global pollution level by 45 percent by 2030 and achieve Net Zero emission by 2050. Because the world would not be able to face the looming threat after 2100 unless it can limit global warming to a level of 1.5 degrees Celsius by then. Scientists and experts sounded the alarm in a report, AR6, of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). According to the IPCC report, the world will have to cut 45 percent GHG emission by 2030 to 'keep the target of 1.5C alive'. Otherwise, it will not be possible to achieve the Net Zero target by 2050 and, as a result, the global temperature rise cannot be restricted even to 2 degrees C by 2100. But achieving the targets has become even more uncertain by now as the world's economic activities are increasingly getting operational after the COVID-19 pandemic, which has created a sudden energy supply crisis and a substantial price hike of energy while the developing and developed countries were suffering from fuel supply uncertainty. Despite this uncomfortable situation, Bangladesh however revised up its NDC to reduce GHG emission by 22 percent from 15 percent. The country has already achieved in many cases the unconditional target of 5 percent as set in the previous NDC. But there is hardly any progress in getting international support for emission control. Bangladesh is, however, committed to make its effort towards the Net Zero goal despite having its no obligation to do so. The country has already abandoned developing 10 coal-based power plants from its power generation plan, risking energy security. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is expected to highlight the country's position again at the climate change conference in Glasgow on November 1, when she would also call upon the world communities, particularly the G20 countries, to annually contribute US$100 billion to the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The negotiators on climate change issues were, however, expecting that the COP26 presidency, the United Kingdom, would play a pivotal role to make the event successful in terms of what the world communities want to achieve there. The UK has come out of using coal in the last few years and is now facing a gas crisis as a result. GCF Fund It has been widely recognized that the path shown by the scientists would not be so easy at all taking into consideration the challenges of maintaining the development trend in the developed countries as well as the efforts being made by the developing countries to become developed ones. However, the countries recognized that though highly challenging, riding through the path is not impossible. But it requires a united effort by the global communities and a huge investment. The world leaders had agreed in the COP21 in Paris in 2015 that an amount of US$100 billion will have to be contributed to the GCF annually from 2020 to 2024. Ahead of the COP26 COP26 to realize the rest US$20 billion. The developed countries had committed to annually contribute US$ 100 billion to the GCF from 2020. There were no indications in the report or from others responsible, however, about the fund supposed to be contributed by the developed countries in 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 to the GCF. 'Nobody wants to spend money easily. (In this case) It may be challenging, but achievable subject to keeping pressure for it,' said Dr A. Atiq Rahman, Executive Director at the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies. Meanwhile, the COP26 is supposed to start discussion on mobilizing increased funds from 2025 to an extent that may range between US$150 billion and US$200 billion. Before setting the new threshold, the countries will have to arrange the US$400 billion in the remaining years to 2024. At the same time, the countries will have to finalize a strategy to get funds in accordance with the new target. Keeping 1.5C Movement Alive In the Paris climate conference, the world leaders could not set the temperature rise level at 1.5C despite the developing and vulnerable countries along with the environmental activists and civil society organizations raised voice to do so. However, the Paris meeting decided to keep it well below 2 degrees Celsius. However, the IPCC report recommended the global leaders to take aggressive steps to achieve the Net Zero emission target by 2050 for limiting the temperature rise to 1.5C. The aggressive step should aim at reducing the GHG emission by 45 percent in next Nine years from the level of 2010. Experts think that the G20 countries will have to take the lead to achieve the target as they cause 80 percent of the total global GHG emission. However, nine countries of the G20 remained out of the most polluting countries' list, known as annexure 1, prepared in 1992. But the global situation has changed a lot by now as many countries like China, South Korea, South Africa, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Brazil have reached a new level of industrial development, pushing substantially up their level of GHG emission. So, these countries will have to take the responsibilities of reducing GHG emission too. At the same time, the countries having very negligible levels of emission will also have to make a commitment to cut carbon emission and work on that. Experts thought that the G20 and OECD countries had to face increased incidents of natural disasters like drought, flood, cyclone and bush fires in the recent past years. As a result, people of these countries are putting pressure on their leaders to invest more on cutting the pollution. Some of the countries, however, have already announced their respective roadmaps to cut emission, which is considered to be creating a new dynamism in the COP26 towards keeping the 1.5C movement alive. Adaptation and Mitigation Fund Adaptation support is a long pending demand for facing the adverse impact of climate change. It is now being expected that a special discussion on the issue of Global Goal on Adaptation under the Paris Agreement will get momentum in the COP26 with a view to mobilize more funds for the GCF, GEF and LDC. The developing countries are expected to put pressure on the issue to make progress in this regard. Loss and Damage The Santiago Network for Loss and Damage had started working on setting a strategy to get finance from the COP25 held in Madrid in 2019. The network is now waiting to begin its formal journey during the COP26 when its management, funding sources and spending mechanism would be decided. Its temporary secretariat is expected to be launched from Glasgow, where a coordination committee would be formed. Negotiators were expecting a major breakthrough on the loss and damage issue. Market Mechanism The global leaders could not yet finalize the 'Rule Book' for implementation of the Paris Agreement. However, some progress could be made at the COP25 in Madrid, but the market mechanism for carbon trading could not be formulated. The parties must finalize it at the COP26 based on three proposals on table, including market mechanism and non-market mechanism. The countries could not yet agree on a carbon market mechanism proposal. Negotiators in the Bangladesh team for COP26 were expecting that the Article 6 of market mechanism would be finalized at the COP26 as there is no alternative to do so for operationalizing the Paris Agreement. Bangladesh NDC Despite having no obligation to cut carbon emission, Bangladesh has enhanced its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to cut emission from its previous stance. The country has revised up its unconditional target to reduce emission by 7.6 percent by 2030 based on 2012 level from the previous target of 5 percent based on 2011 while unconditional and conditional target combined to 21.85 percent from previous 15 percent. Bangladesh targets to cut carbon pollution by 90 million tonnes during this period. To achieve the target, the country added energy and waste sectors with the existing three sectors - Power, Industry and transportation - to achieve the emission reduction target. Agriculture and forestry have also been added partially to the list. Conclusion As the President of Climate Vulnerable Countries' Forum, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina reiterated her call to the world leaders to protect the planet by taking measures in an aggressive manner that would help limit the temperature rise at 1.5C. So, the main challenge of the COP26 is to start effective implementation of the Paris Agreement through ensuring mobilization of US$100 billion annually up to 2024 and increasing the funds availability from 2025. It would go beyond human capacity to control the future global disasters that might emerge unless the rich countries come forward with open minds to take measures by now. \</doc>

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday welcomed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at the COP26 in Glasgow. Bangladesh Awami League shared the photos of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina with the UN chief and the British Prime Minister on its verified Facebook page. Photos of British Prime Minister Borish Jonson and UN chief giving elbow bumps with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina separately, as posted by Awami League web team on the verified page of the party, went viral on social media. The UK is hosting the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow that will continue till November 12. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, while delivering her speech, made a four-point call to the world saying the major emitters must submit ambitious NDCs, and implement those. She also said the developed countries should fulfil their commitments of providing 100 billion dollars annually with a 50:50 balance between adaptation and mitigation. The issue of loss and damage, Hasina said, must be addressed, including global sharing of responsibility for climate migrants displaced by sea-level rise, salinity increase, river erosion, floods, and draughts."

Terming Bangladesh a 'credible and important' voice in climate space, British High Commissioner to Bangladesh Robert Chatterton Dickson has said there is an 'enormous' amount of work to do and follow up ahead of the COP27 making sure that commitments made on the climate front are now 'turned into action' on the ground. 'There's a real sense of hope for what we're able to achieve at COP26 and in particular, the growth of trust between nations,' he said, focusing on the priority climate actions that all need to be taken before the COP27 in Egypt, now in just eight months' time. The 27th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 27) to the UNFCCC will take place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt in November this year. High Commissioner Dickson was addressing a webinar titled 'Building on the outcomes of COP26 : Priority Climate Actions Ahead of COP27' held on Friday. Additional Secretary (Climate Change Wing) at the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Md Mizanul Haque Chowdhury, International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) Director Prof Dr Saleemul Huq, its Deputy Director Prof Dr Mizan R. Khan and Independent Consultant, Environment, Climate Change and Research Systems Dr Haseeb Md. Irfanullah joined as discussants at the webinar moderated by UNB Director Nahar Khan. The British envoy said the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina played an 'enormously important role' in Glasgow in shining the spotlight on the urgency of tackling climate action for vulnerable nations and a crucial role in raising global ambition. 'And we obviously very much hope that Bangladeshi input into the negotiations and discussions will continue because I think Bangladesh is an enormously credible and important voice in this space,' Dickson said. She said COP26 was eventually held last November following a delay due to the pandemic but a number of incremental steps were achieved that they can build upon in the run up to the COP27. ' COP26 Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change and by 2050, with a projected 50 cm rise in sea level, Bangladesh may lose approximately 11% of its land, affecting an estimated 15 million people living in its low-lying coastal region, she said, quoting the Environmental Justice Foundation. Mizanul Chowdhury said delivering the promised US$ 100 billion by the developed countries is a matter of 'building trust' among nations for further fruitful climate negotiations. He said developed countries and larger emitting nations must update their nationally determined contributions (NDC) with more ambitious mitigation targets before the COP 27 to reduce the existing gap so that the rising global average temperature can be limited to 1.5 degrees. Chowdhury also laid importance on transfer of clean, green and advanced technology to the most vulnerable, developing countries for addressing the issue of loss and damage. The governance issues of the Santiago Network for a specific financing window for loss and damage need to be addressed ensuring climate justice to the most affected climate frontier people, he said. Saleemul Huq highlighted three key areas - the COP26 outcomes and how they will take that forward; the actual impacts of climate change, which are now a reality around the world; about possible avenues of further collaboration building on a very strong foundation between Bangladesh and the UK to tackle climate change. Talking about implementation of the Glasgow decisions on loss and damage, he said there were two decisions - to create a setup and get it up and running as quickly as possible something called the Santiago network on loss and damage. 'This is a very good development, a very excellent outcome of the Glasgow discussions. We need to take that forward.' Huge work ahead of COP27; commitments need to turn into action: Robert Dickson The second one is the Glasgow dialogue on finance for loss and damage. 'This is something of a disappointment, I must say because the CVF countries under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina actually asked for a Glasgow facility on finance for loss and damage,' Prof Huq said. He said they need to be doing things while they talk and that is the responsibility of the COP26 Presidency to ensure that they have a fruitful dialogue. Prof Huq hoped that dialogue will actually lead to something more substantive than just keep talking. The COP26 presidency has the responsibility to hand over to the COP27 incoming Presidency for something to happen in Egypt at COP27. 'Beyond simply talking about it, alright, we just cannot continue to talk about loss and damage and do nothing.' On adaptation issues, he said support for adaptation needs to be redoubled and they need to be much more at speed on doing the adaptation. Prof Huq laid emphasis on building on a very well established and historic relationship between the UK and Bangladesh in the area of academia, collaborative research and universities. Huge work ahead of COP27; commitments need to turn into action: Robert Dickson 'Bangladesh and the UK have a lot of knowledge and experience that can be combined together for the global good,' he said. Prof Huq proposed to the High Commissioner in particular and his colleagues in FCDO that they try and design a more strategic five-year programme of collaborative research between the UK and Bangladesh to tackle the twin threats of climate change and poverty globally. 'We will do it as two countries, but we will do it for the global goal.' Prof Mizan Khan said they find a serious disconnect between global climate science and climate policy, both internationally as well as nationally. He said their responsibility should be to make the climate fears visible so that the citizens feel the pain of the context. 'We need to put global climate diplomacy on a different level from other kinds of diplomacies where national interest gets precedence over the collective interest.' He said climate change is a global problem for survival and they cannot deny it anymore. 'We need to think collectively, imposing a social discount rate on climate investments. This is something very urgent that I feel, otherwise, we cannot make any decision.' Prof Mizan Khan said developed countries have assumed obligatory responsibility with the language support; still, the basic principles that are new and additional adequacy and predictability - these are the four principles of climate finance, but still, those are not respected. The problem is that the developed countries still look at the global politics of climate change from the pure individual national interest perspective, but this is a global problem where collective action and collective solutions are needed and that is not respected, he said. Dr Haseeb Irfanullah said COP27 offers Bangladesh the opportunity in three interconnected areas. He said at the COP26 , Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has shown tremendous leadership and presented before the world a new development philosophy, moving from resilience to prosperity through the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan. As the country is preparing its national budget for FY2022-2023, Dr Haseeb urged the government of Bangladesh to establish a biodiversity conservation fund. 'If we can create this national funding mechanism, it will be a fantastic milestone for Bangladesh's leadership in implementing the COP-26 decision,' he said. Because, Dr Haseeb said, the nature-based solution has been considered one of the effective ways to take ambitious, long-term actions against climate change. He urged the concerned Bangladesh ministries to incorporate economic recovery potentials of nature-based solutions in the post-disaster rebuilding plans, when they try to build back better; as well as the post-pandemic recovery plan. Dr Haseeb said they need to move forward, being called the "adaptation capital of the world," or "adaptation leader," or "adaptation teacher". 'I would love to see Bangladesh being more focused globally, and amazingly aggressive to raise funds for its prosperity and other development plans,' he said. Dr Haseeb said Bangladesh needs to be aggressive in funding its climate plans. 'What is stopping us from desperately starting before COP27?' British High Commissioner Dickson said it is worth remembering what they achieved in November last year, when the countries of the world gathered in Glasgow for COP26 . Dickson is very encouraged that the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change in Bangladesh are drawing up a strategy to implement the 'Glasgow Leaders Declaration on Forest and Land Use' which commits signatory countries to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. 'And that's obviously an enormously important issue in Bangladesh as it is elsewhere. And I'm also pleased to hear that Bangladesh is already working on a revised nationally determined contribution, because it's really up to all of us now, to protect and strengthen the gains that we made at COP26 ,' said the high commissioner. Dickson said they continue to look forward to the Bangladesh national adaptation plan, which they hope will set out far-reaching and transformative adaptation measures. Huge work ahead of COP27; commitments need to turn into action: Robert Dickson Earlier, COP26 The UK hosted the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow on 31 October - 13 November 2021. The COP26 summit brought parties together to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The UK now holds the Presidency until COP27 later this year. As the Presidency of the COP, the UK says there is "crucial work" to be done as they spend the coming months working with governments and organisations to make sure they deliver on the Glasgow Climate Pact, turning momentum into action. The UK Presidency will do so by aiming for four goals - ensuring promises on emissions reductions are kept to keep 1.5 degrees alive; delivering for climate vulnerable countries by ensuring commitments on adaptation and loss and damage are honoured; getting finance flowing and working together and continuing to be an inclusive Presidency.

COP 26, the UN Climate Conference, ended on 13 November 2021 in Glasgow, Scotland. Analysts have been assessing the values of the attained progress in global climate talks. Surely, the parties (197 countries who took part in the UN climate conference) have different agendas and assessment viewpoints. Therefore, it is unlikely that all the participants would evaluate the conference outcomes from the same standpoints. However, there is consensus on certain issues and the parties agree to continue dialogue, meet again next year in Egypt and have agreed to carry forward their efforts to work out ways to restrict global atmospheric temperature within 1.5 degree Celsius to abate climate disasters. The parties have agreed to cut Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions (as a mitigation measure for atmospheric temperature rise) at a faster rate and considered appropriate reviewing the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) annually (not once in every five years, as agreed in 2015 in Paris Climate Conference and in Paris Climate accord as the parties agreed that the present available NDC are inadequate to limit global temperature rises to 1.5 degree Celsius). The review of NDCs and determining the appropriate level to achieve GHG emission within the agreed time table (not the pledged Net Zero achievement targets at 2050, 2060 or 2070 as many countries announced) for 2030 may help attain some visible changes in the global climate change. Parties also agreed to 'phase down' coal and other fossil fuel use and discussed to limiting ongoing huge subsidies in different forms for fossil fuels. Despite pressures from industrially developed countries, decisions for 'phasing out' of coal was not possible to agree within the parties. Despite an agreed decision in the Paris Climate Conference in 2015 to create an annual US$100 billion fund from 2020 to help the developing countries cut GHG emissions and to cope with (adapt) the global climate crisis impacts, only US$80 billion were made available in 2021. Major parts of the available climate financing so far have been directed to GHG emission cutting projects (for example, for the renewable energy development projects at the middle income countries) and the poor and most vulnerable (due to climate change) countries receive no funds to their needs for financing climate change adaptation schemes. The UN and the parties of the climate conference participants raised the issue for at least £ 50:50 split between the funding for emission cuts and funding for adaptation'. The COP26 agreed to 'double the proportion of climate finance going to adaptation' but the details to be worked out. The COP26 For many countries, it is really unphysical and unacceptable to rapidly increase renewable energy share and switch off their existing GHS emitting industries, power plants, natural gas hydrate methane emission etc. While gradually shifting from polluting industries and power generation infrastructures, the countries may take advantage of the global carbon markets. The list of frustration remains among the parties in COP26 for not accomplishment of an agreement among the parties on total restriction on subsidizing fossil fuel, phasing out coal, meeting the commitments for allocating US$100 billion annual funds for the climate vulnerable countries for their adaptation efforts, including technology transfer, capacity development and for compensating the loss and damage (they have been incurring due to unabated pollution for several decades by the industrially developed countries, unwillingness of the 'developed west' to engage in negotiations with the developing nations to find out ways and to finance for fighting climate disasters). The Chinese and Indian positions on different climate issues have been widely discussed in the media while covering COP26 discussions. The positive expectations on climate cooperation further improved as the largest two polluting countries and the two largest economies of the world, USA and China have agreed to cooperate in climate issues despite their differences in several other major global and regional issues. The Russian Federation has tried to promote some issues in the COP26 as well. They wanted 'technological neutrality' involving among others recognition of nuclear energy as 'green'. Russia also proposed to focus less on emission cutting measures rather than emission absorption (Russia has huge carbon absorbing forest resources). The industrially developed western countries have been trying to consolidate their global leadership in the process of the fight against global warming and they considered that their 'close to green economy' will enable them to take the lead. On the contrary, China, Russia, and many other developing nations are suspicious about the agendas of the 'west' and want to turn them from some narrow interests into universal rules for everyone. Bangladesh intended to cut carbon emissions approximately 90 million tonnes (22%) within 2030 as it has communicated in the COP26 . If Bangladesh maintains business as usual (that is, it does take no initiative to reduce GHG emissions), the country's GHG emissions will go up to 409 million tonnes in 2030. It may be mentioned that Bangladesh's 55% carbon emissions come from the power sector (mainly dependent on fossil fuel burning such as natural gas and LNG, furnace oil, diesel, coal) followed by industries, transport, agriculture, brick kilns, commercial activities etc. The ambitious goal for attaining the GHG emission reduction target within 2030 demands major policy shifts, large investment and huge capacity development within the country including for human capital development. Bangladesh targets 60,000 megawatts of electricity generation in 2041 including with 40% renewable energy share. The present installed capacity of electricity generation in the country stands at 24,000 including 700 MW renewable energy. The government earlier had a set target for attaining 10% share of electricity generation from renewable sources within 2020. The real achievement is far behind the target of renewable energy development. The State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources of Bangladesh has shown his confidence in achieving the goal as the government's determination was communicated to the international forums including in the Climate Vulnerable Forum, where Bangladesh is the chair. So far, there is no clear roadmap on the plans and strategies for attaining the 40% renewable energy share within the next 20 years for the country. Sector experts are unsure that Bangladesh may attain 40% target of renewable energy as there is no credible roadmap so far for attaining the targets. The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change hopes that within 2030 the transport sector will see major shift as several thousand electric and hybrid vehicles along with electric trains, energy efficient and less polluting fuel oil vehicles will be moving in the country's wide roads and approximately 86,000 unfit and polluting vehicles will be withdrawn from the roads. Also, it is hoped that the hugely polluting brick kilns (nearly 6,000 at present in the country) will seize their operations (within 2024) and compressed hollow brick blocks will replace the age-old bricks as the major construction materials in the country. The ministry further wants to encourage technology shifts in agriculture and industries and in commercial activities to enable energy savings and energy efficient activities. Further, the ministry considers that the solid waste management will be significantly improved by using the technology for waste to electric energy, incinerating harmful wastes and by implementing integrated landfill for waste management.

Dhaka, Nov. 5 -- The British government says the "end of coal is in sight" after Poland, Vietnam and Chile and other countries pledged for the first time to phase out coal-based power generation and stop building new plants. The COP26 Coal is the most polluting fossil fuel, and greenhouse gas emissions from burning it are the single-biggest contributor to climate change. Weaning the world off coal is seen as vital to achieving globally agreed climate targets, including limiting global warming to the 1.5 degrees Celsius (34.7 Fahrenheit) threshold to avert disaster. The British government said signatories of the COP26 agreement are committing to ending all investment in new coal power generation domestically and internationally, as well as rapidly scale up clean power generation. Participating nations also committed to phasing out coal power in the 2030s for large economies, and the 2040s for smaller economies. "The end of coal is in sight," said Kwasi Kwarteng, the British business and energy secretary. "The world is moving in the right direction, standing ready to seal coal's fate and embrace the environmental and economic benefits of building a future that is powered by clean energy." Separately, the Powering Past Coal Alliance - an international campaign aimed at phasing out the material - said it had secured 28 new members, including Ukraine, which pledged to quit the fuel by 2035. Coal formed roughly a third of Ukraine's power last year. Factors including concerns over planet-warming pollution and a worsening economic profile for coal-based power generation have curbed its share in wealthy western countries including the United Kingdom, Germany and Ireland over the last few decades. But coal still produced approximately 37 percent of the world's electricity in 2019, and a cheap, abundant local supply means the fuel dominates power production in countries including South Africa, Poland and India. The global pipeline for new coal power projects has shrivelled in recent years, although China, India, Vietnam and Indonesia are among those planning to build new coal plants. The UK did not confirm if those countries would be involved in the COP26 coal phase-out pledge, or if Vietnam's promise would affect its pipeline of coal projects already in the pre-construction stage. China said in September it would stop funding overseas coal plants, although the pledge did not cover domestic projects. Australia also lags behind, according to Will Steffen, climate change expert at the Australian National University, who says the country continues to invest in coal projects. "Unfortunately, our government is actually expanding the coal industry. We're opening up new coal mines with project lifespans of 25 years or so," Steffen told Al Jazeera. "If we continue with this, we'd put the Paris climate goals out of reach." A raft of finance announcements are expected at COP26 on Thursday to accompany the coal pledges - through new investments in clean power, and funds to support workers and regions that depend on the coal sector for their livelihoods. Countries including the UK and the United States announced an $8.5bn partnership with South Africa at the COP26 conference on Tuesday, to help the country phase out coal faster.

Dhaka, Nov. 6 -- Thousands of youth took to the Scottish city of Glasgow on Friday to protest lack of action by leaders at the COP26 climate summit. Led by their teenaged heroine Greta Thunberg, they marched through the streets of Glasgow to press for more action from COP26 on climate change, report new agencies. The demonstrators weaved their way through the city centre en route to George Square where Ms. Thunberg, 18, and others were expected to speak at an afternoon rally. There was a festive-like atmosphere and the crowd included with many young children and couples pushing baby carriages. At one point on the route a group of about two dozen elementary school children held up hand-made signs and chanted "Stop climate change." Youth activists shout slogans as they march to protest against climate inaction on the sidelines of the COP26 UN Climate Summit in Glasgow. The march was organized by Friday for Future, a youth-led movement inspired by Ms. Thunberg's silent protest outside the Swedish parliament in 2018. Her action caused a global sensation and motivated a new generation of climate activists. "This is a really powerful show of the people's fight for climate justice," said Aliya Hirji, a high-school student from Toronto who joined the march and belongs to Friday for Future in Canada. "As a young person I'm always trying to remain optimistic and hopeful because this is my future on the line. I can't resort to feeling a sense of doom because then I won't act. But it's really hard." Ms. Hirji has been an observer at COP26 this week and she has found the experience frustrating. "I've been blocked from a lot of conference rooms," she said. "I've had world leaders just turn their backs on me and walk away as I'm trying speak. It's been really frustrating. It's hard to expect an equitable outcome when COP itself is inequitable." Glenn Wright and his wife, Shannon, who run a farm near Saskatoon, came to support the Friday for Future cause. "They are getting more attention now than any of the other activists," said Mr. Wright who has been attending COP as part of a National Farmers Union delegation. "Greta really has started a huge movement." Ms. Wright said the couple have also been inspired by their two children. "It's about the future and that's what our kids represent. That's why we're here for sure," she said as she held up a Canadian flag. Ms. Wright, who is also a COP26 delegate, has found the conference difficult. "There are times when I have been brought to tears," she said. "Some of it is pretty depressing. It's hard to stay optimistic but I think we have to for our children." Joining them was Sadie Vipond, a 15-year old student from Calgary who has been involved in a lawsuit against the federal government over climate change. The suit alleges Ottawa has failed to adequately protect the future of young Canadians. The group suffered a set back recently when judge dismissed the case because it was too broad. However, Ms. Vipond said they have filed an appeal. "We're suing them because they have not adequately done enough to protect youth against the effects of climate change," she explained as she lined up with her father, Joe Vipond, and other marchers. "Everyone involved in the case has been affected by climate change. Personally I was evacuated due to the 2013 Calgary flood. And the smoke that drifts over Calgary every summer is very detrimental. Basically we are asking for a science-based recovery plan." Inside the conference venue, negotiators' goal on Friday was to get countries to promise to cut greenhouse-gas emissions and avert a rise in the average global temperature of 1.5 degrees compared with preindustrial levels. Scientists say this is a tipping point: Beyond it, the world will face far more extreme weather events. Throughout the week, various governments have pledged to phase out coal, slash their methane output or reduce deforestation. The British president of COP26 acknowledged on Friday that much more needed to be done to secure more ambitious commitments to stop the world's slide into climate catastrophe, urging national negotiators to step up the pace. "It is not possible for a large number of unresolved issues to continue into week 2," Alok Sharma said in a note published by the United Nations. Delegates from nearly 200 countries are in Glasgow to hammer out how to meet the Paris Agreement goals of limiting temperature rises to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius. Twenty nations including the United States and Canada promised to end overseas fossil fuel funding by the end of 2022. And over 40 countries pledged to phase out coal - the most polluting fossil fuel - although details were vague and a timeline for doing so not disclosed. The promises followed a major assessment that showed global CO2 emissions are set to rebound in 2021 to pre-pandemic levels. Thunberg herself was not impressed, tweeting after the twin announcements: "This is no longer a climate conference. This is a Global North greenwash festival."

British High Commissioner to Bangladesh Robert Chatterton Dickson on Wednesday emphasised the need for urgent climate action, pinpointing that there are three areas where Bangladesh has a particular role to play at COP26 . The UK will host the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow on October 31- November 12. While speaking at DCAB Talk, the High Commissioner said he would bid farewell to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on her departure for the UK for COP26 and other bilateral meetings. DCAB (Diplomatic Correspondents Association, Bangladesh) hosted the event. DCAB President Pantho Rahaman and its General Secretary AKM Moinuddin also spoke at the event. The High Commissioner said there are three areas where Bangladesh had a particular role to play at COP26 First, he said, as a leader on climate adaptation and a country highly vulnerable to climate change, Bangladesh could make the moral case for increased investment in adaptation as well as offering its practical experience as one of the founding members of the Adaptation Action Coalition, which puts a particular emphasis on the locally-led adaptation on the ground. Secondly, Dickson said, Bangladesh could show leadership on mitigation by publishing an ambitious nationally determined contribution (NDC). The High Commissioner commended the radical transformation of Bangladesh's forward energy plans, including the removal of significant elements of coal-fired power from the plans that the government has to generate the electricity that Bangladesh needs to power its economic growth. The UK hoped Bangladesh would be ambitious in this space. Third, the High Commissioner said, Bangladesh had a particular role to play at COP26 through the Prime Minister's role as Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, which brings together 48 climate vulnerable countries. Bangladesh's international leadership will be important in ensuring sufficient pressure is applied to the big emitters by the climate-vulnerable to reach the ambitious global deal that will be needed, he said. Scientific evidence from the International Panel on Climate Change, and evidence from each day's news, showed unprecedented climate events happening around the world. The Paris Agreement of 2015 agreed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, which would lower the risk of these catastrophic events. It was clear that the event in Glasgow was the last, best opportunity to work out how to meet the Paris targets. Over 20,000 delegates are expected at COP26 , bringing together all the people who would need to work together to achieve the targets set by world leaders. The High Commissioner welcomed the large delegation that would attend from Bangladesh, led by the Prime Minister, and which represented many strands of interest for the country. He said the UK, in its role as President, had set four goals for COP26 . COP26 : Dickson says Bangladesh has particular role in 3 areas First, Dickson said, the UK hoped all countries would agree to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, with ambitious interim emissions reductions targets, as set out in each country's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), by 2030. This would enable the world to keep the goal of 1.5 degrees alive. The UK had published a detailed plan of how it would radically transform its own economy in order to do its part, as a major industrialised economy, to help deliver those targets. The second, he said, was adaptation: improving the way in which countries adapted to the climate crisis and encouraging countries affected by climate change to protect and restore ecosystems, build defences and put warning systems in place. The High Commissioner said the world had a lot to learn from Bangladesh in this regard. The third was to mobilise finance, including the $100 billion annually that had been promised by developed countries to help developing countries, and help unleash the trillions of dollars that would be needed from the private sector to make sure the other goals happened. On October 25, the UK had published a Climate Finance Delivery Plan to provide coherence and clarity on when and how developed countries would meet the $100 billion climate finance goal. The fourth was to accelerate collaboration between governments, businesses and civil society so that ambition could be turned into outcomes. The High Commissioner then provided his reflections on the wider bilateral relationship between the UK and Bangladesh beyond COP. \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 5 -- Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's climate leadership and the Mujib Climate Prosperity Decade Plan 2021-2030 have been highly praised at the fourth CVF- COP26 Dialogue in London. Former British Prime Minister David Cameron said Bangladesh as the CVF Presidency should make a powerful statement at the COP26 to ensure that world leaders take heed of the extreme climatic vulnerabilities of the 48 CVF countries contributing less than 5.0 per cent of global emissions. Recalling his visit to Bangladesh in 2017, Cameron praised Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's leadership, paying tribute to the country's economic progress and development. Maldives former President Mohamed Nasheed came up with a strong opinion that climate vulnerable countries should be provided with fresh financing under the loss and damage initiative in order to avoid falling into debt due to climate-related loss and the impact of Covid on the economy. He suggested decolonising climate dialogue to give all parties a fair chance, reports UNB. Bangladesh High Commission in London in partnership with the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) Secretariat organised the Dialogue recently, said the Bangladesh High Commission in London on Tuesday. Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen joined the dialogue virtually from Washington DC while prominent global climate leaders and eminent climate experts including CVF Thematic Ambassador on Ambition and former Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed; the UK's Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Edward Miliband; Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland; and Chair of the CVF Expert Advisory Group Prof Dr Saleemul Huq, participated in the dialogue as co-panellists. Bangladesh High Commissioner to the UK Saida Muna Tasneem made a presentation on the Mujib Climate Prosperity Decade Plan 2021-2030, announced by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at the CVF Leaders' Summit on 7 October 2020 under Bangladesh's CVF Presidency during the Mujib Year. Foreign Minister Dr Momen said as CVF chair, Bangladesh will amplify the voices of the most vulnerable countries at the COP26 at the CVF- COP26 Leaders' Summit on the sidelines of COP26 and forge an ambitious Dhaka-Glasgow CVF- COP26 Climate Declaration. "A Climate Emergency Pact should also be established between the UK's COP26 presidency and CVF members in Glasgow to effectively support those nations most in need." Dr Momen commended Prime Minister Boris Johnson for UK's proactive leadership as COP26 host in Glasgow next month and called for closing the major emission and financing gaps at COP26 for capping temperatures at 1.5 degrees. High Commissioner Saida Muna Tasneem provided an overview of the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan, stating, the Mujib plan is an ambitious roadmap of actions being taken by the CVF President Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to promote the concept of climate prosperity by making strategic investments in building resilience and a low-carbon sustainable and prosperous development pathway. The High Commissioner hoped that at the COP26 many more CVF countries would come up with climate prosperity plans which need sustained green financing from richer countries. Edward Miliband stressed the urgency of developed nations' obligations towards the developing world, especially to provide funding under the 100 billion dollars promised in Copenhagen to assist vulnerable countries in addressing climate-related losses and damages. Commonwealth SG Patricia Scotland reaffirmed Commonwealth's commitment to helping its members confront climate challenges in a coordinated way. She said climate efforts, unlike vaccine nationalism, should be a global initiative to save the planet for future generations. The dialogue was attended by CVF High Commissioners, Ambassadors and climate experts. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

British politician Alok Sharma, set to preside over COP26 , visited Bangladesh recently and discussed shared priorities with Bangladesh, which he said remains a "crucial" partner on the road to COP26 . COP26 . The COP 26 UN Climate Change Conference, hosted by the UK in partnership with Italy, will take place from October 31, 2021 in the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) in Glasgow, UK. The COP26 'The next decade will be make, or break, for our planet, and effective global collaboration will be vital to tackling the pressing challenges the world faces. So I am delighted to have witnessed UK-Bangladeshi climate partnership in action, and heard such positive ambition from my Bangladeshi friends," he said. 'I am inspired by the innovative work I have seen here to address some of the worst effects of climate change, and hope that Bangladesh will continue to lead by example ahead of COP26 which is our best hope of building a brighter future.' The COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma also visited Sundarbans on June 3 this year. He visited the WildTeam Conservation Biology Centre (WCBC) in the Sundarbans. The British High Commissioner to Bangladesh, Robert Chatterton Dickson, and his other colleagues from the UK accompanied them. During his visit he came to know about WildTeam's pioneering work with the Forest Department in Tiger Conservation through engaging the local communities. The tiger population has rebounded slightly - at least the decline has been halted. The number rose to 114 in 2018, up from 106 recorded in 2015. Mr Sharma met with the Village Tiger Response Team (VTRT) members, and the TigerScouts. In 2007 WildTeam formed the VTRT by engaging the communities for managing human-tiger conflict. WildTeam also formed BaghBandhus (tiger ambassadors) to improve community engagement and raise awareness within the community. WildTeam, with the support from USAID's Bagh Activity, started Sundarbans Education Centres in five schools around the Sundarbans. With their support TigerScouts were formed with secondary school students from the Sundarbans villages, to educate school children to build an environment friendly future generation. Mr Sharma, along with the TigerScouts, planted a 'sundari' sapling at WCBC's 'mini Sundarbans'. It is believed that Sundarbans has been named after the 'sundari' (Heritiera fomes) tree that propagates through the forest. The British High Commissioner also planted a sapling. WildTeam built WCBC with the support of IUCN-KfW to engage the communities to manage the natural resources in a sustainable way. Due to increasing salinity, there is an acute shortage of drinking water in the area. During his visit to Bangladesh Mr Sharma met Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, and other government ministers, and youths to discuss climate issues. A joint statement on UK-Bangladesh climate action was signed, which is a foundation for a long-term climate partnership. It is understood that the climate talks will be the biggest international summit the UK has ever hosted, bringing together over 30,000 delegates including heads of state, climate experts and campaigners to agree coordinated action to tackle climate change. The COP26 'The next decade will be make, or break, for our planet, and effective global collaboration will be vital to tackling the pressing challenges the world faces. So I am delighted to have witnessed UK-Bangladeshi climate partnership in action, and heard such positive ambition from my Bangladeshi friends.' \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 7 -- Protests are under way for a second day in cities around the world as part of a global mobilisation against what campaigners say is a lack of urgency to address global warming at a crunch United Nations climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland. From Paris to Sydney, Nairobi to Seoul, more than 200 events are planned worldwide on Saturday to demand immediate action for communities already affected by climate change, particularly in the poorer countries in the South, reports Al Jazeera and news agencies. In Glasgow, organisers and police said they expected up to 50,000 people to parade through the streets of the city near the COP26 summit venue, which is under tight security. "The mood is mixed here," Al Jazeera's Andrew Simmons, reporting from Glasgow, said. "There is anger, there is some form of celebratory tactics to be used, and there is real concern particularly among the families who have joined the demonstrations. "We're seeing many children and families turning out, and the message primarily to the climate diplomats is one of you must stand accountable. We are halfway through COP26 right now, and the pressure has never been greater," he added. Delegates from nearly 200 countries are in Glasgow to hammer out how to meet the Paris Agreement goals of limiting temperature rises to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius (34.7 to 35.6 Fahrenheit). So far, some countries have signed up to pledges to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, with separate deals on phasing out coal, ending foreign fossil fuel funding and slashing methane. The promises followed a significant assessment that showed global carbon dioxide emissions were set to rebound in 2021 to pre-pandemic levels. But campaigners have been left unimpressed by the summit, with prominent environmental activist Greta Thunberg calling it a "failure". "They cannot ignore the scientific consensus and they cannot ignore us," said Thunberg. "This is no longer a climate conference. This is now a global greenwashing festival." 'We want more' In Australia on Saturday, more than 1,000 protesters in Sydney and Melbourne - some dressed as lumps of coal or Prime Minister Scott Morrison, a vigorous defender of the mining industry - labelled the talks "a sham" and their national leader "an absolute embarrassment". "No more blah, blah blah. Real climate action now," read one sign at a protest in Sydney. "We're all out here to show that we want more from our government," Georgia, one of the protesters, told the Reuters news agency. Melbourne's protest was smaller than Sydney's, with just a few hundred people turning out for a rally that also featured a giant koala emitting plumes of smoke and protesters dressed as skeletons on bikes. Several smaller events were held elsewhere in Australia. Meanwhile, the South Korean capital of Seoul saw approximately 500 demonstrators take to the streets demanding immediate action for communities already hit by the fallout of a heating planet. South Korea has few energy resources of its own and relies on imported coal - a cheap but dirty fuel - for about 40 percent of the electricity powering the world's 12th-largest economy, according to figures from the International Energy Agency. The country aims to be carbon neutral by 2050, but local activists say the goal cannot be accomplished without more fundamental changes. "At COP26 , the expected 'blah blah blah' is taking place," Climate Strike, one of the organising groups of Saturday's march in Seoul, said. 'It can't go on like this' COP26 negotiations continued on Saturday before taking a pause on Sunday ahead of what is shaping up to be a frantic week of shuttle diplomacy, as ministers arrive to push through hard-fought compromises on a number of issues. Countries still need to flesh out how pledges made in the Paris deal will work in practice, including rules governing carbon markets, common reporting timeframes and transparency. According to the UN, countries came into COP26 with national climate plans that, when brought together, put Earth on course to warm 2.7C (36.9F) this century. With just 1.1C (34F) of warming so far, communities across the world are already facing ever more intense fire and drought, displacement and economic ruin wrought by global heating. Brianna Fruean, a Samoan member of the Pacific Climate Warriors, who addressed a world leaders' summit at the start of COP26 , said it was time for leaders to take note of protesters' demands. "It can't go on like this," she said. "We refuse to be just victims to this crisis. We are not drowning, we are fighting and on Saturday the world will hear us."

A webinar titled 'Building on the outcomes of COP26 : Priority Climate Actions Ahead of COP27' will be held on Friday highlighting the ground reality on the climate front and required efforts to mitigate the situation keeping in mind the climate vulnerability of Bangladesh. The webinar, to be hosted by United News of Bangladesh (UNB) in partnership with the British High Commission in Dhaka, will also discuss ways to strengthen the climate partnership between Bangladesh and the United Kingdom. The UK now holds the Presidency until COP27 later this year. Additional Secretary (Climate Change Wing) at the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Md Mizanul Haque Chowdhury, British High Commissioner to Bangladesh Robert Chatterton Dickson, International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) Director Prof Dr Saleemul Huq, its Deputy Director Prof Dr Mizan R. Khan and Independent Consultant, Environment, Climate Change and Research Systems Dr Haseeb Md. Irfanullah will join as discussants at the webinar. United News of Bangladesh (UNB) Director Nahar Khan will moderate the webinar which will be premiered on UNB Facebook page and its YouTube channel at 7:30pm on Friday. The UK hosted the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow on 31 October - 13 November 2021. The COP26 As the Presidency of the COP, the UK says there is "crucial work" to be done as they spend the coming months working with governments and organisations to make sure they deliver on the Glasgow Climate Pact, turning momentum into action. The UK Presidency will do so by aiming for four goals - ensuring promises on emissions reductions are kept to keep 1.5 degrees alive; delivering for climate vulnerable countries by ensuring commitments on adaptation and loss and damage are honoured; getting finance flowing and working together and continuing to be an inclusive Presidency. The 27th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 27) to the UNFCCC will take place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt in November this year. \</doc>

COP26 Regional Ambassador Ken O'Flaherty has said it is possible for countries like Bangladesh to significantly expand its renewable energy sector as it has been the cheapest option for new energy in Asian countries. 'It's clear that over the next decade the cost of renewable energy will continue to fall. So countries which don't invest in renewable energy risk losing competitive advantage,' he told UNB in an interview at the British High Commissioner's residence here. Across the region, the envoy said, he is seeing governments recognize the opportunities offered by renewable energy and said countries like Bangladesh can look into potential cooperation at regional level on hydropower. Ambassador Ken said there is lot of interest in investing renewable energy and hydropower but what the investors need is a clear signal from the government. Bangladesh can significantly expand renewable energy: COP26 Envoy 'We're working with the governments like Bangladesh to ensure that there's a clear framework for supporting that investment in domestic and regional power systems,' said the envoy. Ken, who was appointed UK government's COP26 Regional Ambassador to Asia-Pacific and South Asia in March 2020, said renewable energy is the cheapest source of energy worldwide compared to coal. Talking about clean and cheap energy, he said they think there is a strong appetite for it and they have seen countries in Asia announcing their policies to move away from coal. 'We're seeing more and more countries to adopt similar policies. I'm very confident that ahead of COP26 , we'll see more countries in this region adopt net zero target.' Ken laid emphasis on ensuring that countries have access to climate finance to help them take advantage of cheap, clean energy. Responding to a question, he said Bangladesh is already very active in climate change arena and the country has a lot to teach the world in building resilience to climate impacts. He said Bangladesh also has a role in terms of raising the voices of vulnerable countries to encourage the big emitters worldwide take strong actions as consequences of climate change is visible. 'Bangladesh has a very strong moral voice in the international community.' Since Bangladesh is currently the chair of Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), Ken said, they very much hope that there will be another way for Bangladesh to ensure voices of vulnerable countries calling strong climate actions can be heard. The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 Parties at COP 21 in Paris, on 12 December 2015 and entered into force on 4 November 2016. Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels. 'We want to see strong action by the governments to deliver on what was agreed five years ago,' Ken said underlining the urgency of action to tackle climate change. He said the consequences of not meeting of the target (1.5 degrees Celsius) will be 'catastrophic' in particular for countries which are vulnerable such as Bangladesh. 'It's clear that action by governments is essential.' Ken said economies and societies will be devastated by the climate change and they are calling to governments to commit net zero targets. 'We're also calling for short-term actions.' The envoy said worldwide they are seeing more and more extreme weather events and these extreme weather events will only increase in its intensity and frequency. He said the COP26 There is a call to developed countries to make good on their promise to mobilize US$ 100 billion annually in climate finance to support the needs of developing nations. 'We're working very hard to encourage the international donor community to step up further to make sure that US$ 100 billion promise can be met,' ken said. During his recent daylong visit to Bangladesh, Ken met Special Envoy to the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) Presidency Abul Kalam Azad and discussed COP26 preparations and plans for the climate vulnerable country engagement. He was accompanied by British High Commissioner to Bangladesh Robert Chatterton Dickson. He welcomed recent CVF Asia communique and commitment to no new coal and expects greater action by major emitters must be acted upon. COP26 Ambassador Ken also met Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Md Shahab Uddin and discussed COP26 preparations and Bangladesh's priorities on climate adaptation, finance, losses and damages. He hoped that Bangladesh would confirm the 2050 NetZero target before Glasgow. He also met State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid to discuss plans for increasing renewable energy, including solar power. Both global and regional support is required for Bangladesh's energy transition, they agreed. \</doc>

The outcome of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) is crucial for climate-vulnerable countries like Bangladesh, said Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD). In less than two weeks, world leaders, government officials, negotiators, and representatives of the private sector and civil society organisations are going to attend the COP26 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). CPD and the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) jointly organised the virtual dialogue "Bangladesh's Expectations from COP26 " Sunday to shed light on the expectations from the Conference. Dr Fahmida Khatun, executive director of CPD, and Professor Mizanur Rahman Khan, deputy director of ICCCAD, made presentations at the dialogue. The study pointed out that the least developed countries (LDCs) are the worst victims of climate change vulnerability. Moreover, the ongoing pandemic has put enormous pressure on climate-vulnerable countries. In Bangladesh, annual average temperatures increased by 0.64 per cent in 2018, which was 10.20 times faster than the annual average temperature increase of 0.06 per cent in 1961. Due to floods, Bangladesh is expected to incur losses equivalent to 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). Given these critical consequences, Bangladesh has an active interest in the outcome of COP26 . Five specific agendas are critically important for Bangladesh. First, ensuring the commitments of major carbon-emitting countries to limit carbon emission; second, scaling up climate funds urgently to support climate-vulnerable countries; third, ensuring the bigger share of climate fund towards adaptation; fourth, finalising the Paris Rulebook to ensure accountability; and fifth, establishing the mechanism for loss and damage. The upcoming climate summit is going to be a defining moment for world leaders. How they are going to implement the commitments of the Paris climate agreement are to be seen following the COP26 , said Dr Fahmida while presenting at the dialogue. The report also recommended that vulnerable countries like Bangladesh have to ensure investment in renewable energy and energy infrastructures. Considering that the challenges are manifold, the study proposed a collaborative action of all countries to produce an "Adaptation Communication." "There is a huge gulf between the claimed delivery and the actual receipt, and the mitigation and adaptation ratio is still not improving," Professor Mizan mentioned in his presentation. The study also pointed out that the European Union (EU) is the largest contributor in terms of climate finance. He also raised the question of whether or not the UK-led COP26 would be able to change the game. Charles Whiteley, ambassador and head of the EU delegation to Bangladesh, said many of the points featured in the study show a high degree of commonality with Bangladesh's activities on climate change adaptation. The EU already submitted their nationally determined contribution (NDC) emphasising 55 per cent greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction by 2030. He felt that the private sector has a bigger role to play in tackling climate change. Md Ziaul Haque, director of Dhaka region at the Department of Environment, focused on three critical issues - keeping the global 1.5-degree temperature goal alive, ensuring that $100 billion is mobilised and allocated each year to the developing countries, and operationalising the global goals adaptation. He said the mitigation ambition of Bangladesh has increased over the last years. "So, the country has been planning for a long-term low emission strategy and is now pushing for having dedicated spaces to discuss the issue of adaptation at various levels." "Bangladesh has already submitted its enhanced NDC, and it is expected that some concrete outcomes will emerge from the COP26 ." Judith Herbertson, development director of FCDO Bangladesh, highlighted two important issues - mitigation in line with the 1.5-degree global goal, and adaptation with a focus on protecting communities and natural habitats and access to climate finance. She also emphasised the need for assistance from financial institutions for sustainable climate financing in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic as well as on the adaptation of a loss and damage mechanism. Dr Saleemul, director of the ICCCAD, also emphasised the collective responsibility to tackle climate change. He mentioned that, on behalf of the climate-vulnerable countries, Bangladesh has a big role to play. Regarding the $100 billion climate finance commitment, he said the current demand for finance is at least $500 billion in five years. "We should work beyond the COP26 ." Professor Rehman Sobhan, chairman of CPD, said there are some asymmetries between individual responses and the wider externality of the global system. He said Bangladesh should focus more on its strategies and fulfilling the commitments to achieve the goals at the national level, and that would automatically help the country achieve the global commitments as well. \</doc>

Dhaka, March 11 -- A webinar titled "Building on the outcomes of COP26 : Priority Climate Actions Ahead of COP27" will be held today (Friday) highlighting the ground reality on the climate front and required efforts to mitigate the situation keeping in mind the climate vulnerability of Bangladesh. The webinar, to be hosted by United News of Bangladesh (UNB) in partnership with the British High Commission in Dhaka, will also discuss ways to strengthen the climate partnership between Bangladesh and the United Kingdom. The UK now holds the Presidency until COP27 later this year, reports UNB. Additional Secretary (Climate Change Wing) at the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Md Mizanul Haque Chowdhury, British High Commissioner to Bangladesh Robert Chatterton Dickson, International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) Director Prof Dr Saleemul Huq, its Deputy Director Prof Dr Mizan R. Khan and Independent Consultant, Environment, Climate Change and Research Systems Dr Haseeb Md. Irfanullah will join as discussants at the webinar. United News of Bangladesh (UNB) Director Nahar Khan will moderate the webinar which will be premiered on UNB Facebook page and its YouTube channel at 7:30pm on Friday. The UK hosted the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow on 31 October - 13 November 2021. The COP26 As the Presidency of the COP, the UK says there is "crucial work" to be done as they spend the coming months working with governments and organisations to make sure they deliver on the Glasgow Climate Pact, turning momentum into action. The UK Presidency will do so by aiming for four goals - ensuring promises on emissions reductions are kept to keep 1.5 degrees alive; delivering for climate vulnerable countries by ensuring commitments on adaptation and loss and damage are honoured; getting finance flowing and working together and continuing to be an inclusive Presidency. The 27th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 27) to the UNFCCC will take place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt in November this year.

We understand that the nations need to reach a meeting of minds and conclude agreements on critical outstanding issues for limiting global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius. There have been lots of talks, pledges and commitments so far. But the achievements are frustratingly not proportionate to that level. Nevertheless, there have been some success stories too. Some momentum has been created in some areas. Some beginnings have already been made. The COVID19 outbreak and devastation has frustrated progress in many areas. The post-COVID economic recovery and hasty actions of transitions have created a global fuel market crash. But the world has realized the requirement of moving out of dirty fossil fuel. Greener and cleaner energy use has gathered momentum. Technology evolution is making renewable cheaper progressively. Against the backdrop of emissions continuing to rise, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has issued a code red for the climate. Not much time is left. COP26 at Glasgow must walk the talk. The code red states that unless the world community acts immediately, the 1.5C limit would slip out of reach. The temperature has already risen at least 1.1 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Extreme weather conditions have been experienced across the world. Europe and China have witnessed devastating floods. Wildfires have happened in North America. Temperature has set new records in many countries. The world's first climate induced famine has been witnessed in Madagascar. Alarming impacts of climate change are visible in the Himalayan Mountain range. Glaciers melted into giant lakes which, when they burst their banks, have a devastating impact on those living in the foothills. The island of Barbuda in the Caribbean was struck by hurricane Irma in 2017. Much of the damage is still unrestored. The climate change induced devastations send a very clear message for the world particularly to the largest emitters, the G20 group of nations, to act now to reduce emissions. Communities from East Africa, Southeast Asia, from South America to the Pacific all want actions not words or pledges. What Can Happen If Warming Continues to Grow? If temperatures continue to rise, we will step through a series of one-way doors, and the end destination of which is climate catastrophe. That is why countries on the front-line of climate change fought so hard, for the 1.5-degree temperature limit to be enshrined in the Paris Agreement. The 1.5C to stay alive is not a hollow slogan. It is a matter of survival. In Glasgow, the world must deliver an outcome, which keeps 1.5 degrees in reach. What Does the World Need to Do? At the COP26 summit in Glasgow, the key goals for achieving are emissions reductions, adaptation, finance and working together, including making the negotiations in Glasgow a success. On emissions reductions, many climate vulnerable countries are leading the way. From Bhutan and Suriname, which have already achieved net zero, to the small island developing state of Barbados, which will be fossil fuel free by 2030. There has been some progress in setting out ambitious plans to cut emissions by 2030, those 2030 Nationally Determined Contributions. When the UK took on the COP26 Presidency, a net zero target covered less than 30 percent of the global economy. That figure is now 75 per cent, and climbing. In recent days, Turkey and the UAE have both declared net zero targets. The UAE's an historic first in the Gulf. More than 70 countries in total have come forward over the past two years with updated, and more ambitious, 2030 NDCs. And that includes every G7 nation, all of which have NDCs aligned with net zero by 2050, and some of the world's most climate vulnerable countries. The Red Code stated that the developing world wants the same ambition, the same level of commitment, from the largest nations, the G20 countries which account for around 80 per cent of global emissions. The response of the G20 will quite simply be make, or break, for keeping 1.5 within reach. And at the G20 Climate and Energy Ministers meeting in July, every G20 country agreed to set out ambitious 2030 emissions reduction targets before COP26 . The UK, France, Italy, Germany, the EU, Canada, the US, Argentina, Japan, South Korea and South Africa have done so. The NDCs and net zero commitments are critical to keeping 1.5 alive. But the targets must translate into change across our economies and our societies. The Red Code urged the countries to take actions needed to move to a cleaner world: To consign coal power to history. To accelerate the drive to clean electric vehicles. To end deforestation. And to reduce methane emissions. What Does this Mean to Developing Economies? Transition from fossil fuels to green energy would not be as smooth and easy from a developing economy. The world is already encountering global gas supply challenges. Global fuel market price volatility has threatened creating economic meltdown. But some encouraging developments are also there. It has been decided that no G7 countries would finance any more coal projects internationally. South Korea has also made a similar commitment. China has also announced that it would be choking the financing of the new coal power. China has ramped up support for renewables. COP26 is expected to witness new commitments on coal, cars, methane and deforestation. Red Code reiterated that keeping 1.5C alive has always been about driving action, and ambition, over this next vital decade. Analysis suggests that the commitments made in Paris in 2015, would have capped the rise in temperature to below 4 degrees. If the commitments made since then by countries are fully implemented, it could bend the temperature curve towards two degrees. But to keep 1.5 within reach, we need to go further. So the Glasgow negotiated outcome must launch a decade of ever-increasing ambition. A system is required that accelerates progress recognizing that, whilst all countries must act, those with the greatest responsibility must do more. The Climate Vulnerable Forum, for example, has suggested that countries' progress towards the Paris goals should be assessed at each COP until 2025. Paris Rule Book Finalization: To keep driving that ambition to 2030, the Paris Rulebook needs to be finalized also. This must be resolved to unleash the full power of the Paris Agreement. But this is no easy task. The outstanding issues have been discussed for years, without resolution. Even if net zero is achieved tomorrow, the climate will continue to change. So it is vital that governments set out their plans to protect people and nature from its effects, and that we increase support and finance for adaptation. The crisis of climate vulnerable nations must be appreciated. And the world must redress the balance between finance for mitigation and finance for adaptation. Loss and Damage and Adaptation Debate: There has been encouraging progress in the debate on loss and damage, a renewed determination to find solutions. It is expected that at COP26 all would come together, as a global community, to help equip the most vulnerable, to protect themselves from climate change. There must be progress made in negotiations on loss and damage and adaptation. Now whether it is adaptation, or emissions reductions, we know that without finance, tackling climate change will be impossible. So developed countries must deliver on the 100 billion dollars a year promised to developing nations. The report from the OECD last month set out that in 2019 international climate finance almost reached the 80 billion-dollar mark, still over 20 billion shy of where we needed to be in 2020. Under the UK Presidency, every G7 nation has committed to do more towards the 100 billion dollars. The UK, Germany, Canada, Japan and the US have pledged new money. And the European Commission, Sweden and Denmark also have been pledging additional funds, so we are now within touching distance of the $100billion. COP26 would also start deliberations on the post 2025 finance goal. It is expected that COP26 would hear progress on SDR channeling to developing and vulnerable countries at the IMF and World Bank Annual meetings this week. And also we need development banks to play their part, to help mobilize private funds, driving down the cost of capital. Conclusion Nations of the world look forward to COP26 with renewed hopes that there would be a meeting of minds on critical outstanding issues of the Paris agreement. Major polluting nations in revised NDCs would commit pledges towards achieving global emissions restricting below 1.5 degree Celsius by the end of current millennium, net zero emissions by 2050. The Paris rulebook would be finalized, debate on loss and damage and financing would be resolved. Adaptation, mitigation and financing roadblocks would be removed. Nations would commit and deliver 100 Billion Dollars to the Green Climate Fund. Developed nations would commit to assist climate vulnerable nations financially and technically in the implementation of projects to reduce emissions. We would be happy even if 75% of what is said above is achieved. It is one world and it would not benefit anyone anywhere in the world if global warming continues devastating with ferocity as it is doing now. \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 31 -- The Cop26 climate conference beginning in Glasgow today with the participation of about 100 heads of state or government would keep the world awaiting good outcomes as the key barrier created by former US president Donald against the Paris Deal process is no longer there. President Joe Biden has brought his nation back to the process and has already been to Europe to attend the conference and give it a push. The UN system in its latest report said that carbon emissions in 2020 have been the highest so far, underlining the need for commitment by nations to agree on equitable emission cuts to save the planet from environmental catastrophe. The poor nations want the rich nations to take historic responsibility for polluting the environment by reckless emission of greenhouse gases since the time of the industrial revolution. They also want the industrial nations to help them share the burden of climate adaptation and mitigation because they are not resourceful enough to finance those on their own. It is hoped that the industrial nations which demonstrated responsibility by helping reach the Paris deal in 2015 will show similar understanding this time too. Although these nations are primarily responsible for global warming, it's adverse effects fall on all countries in the form of natural disasters of greater intensity and destructiveness. The bone of contention would however be the funding part. The rich nations failed to live up to their commitment of providing $100 billion per year in the last several years for the developing nations to pursue climate-friendly development activities. The peoples of the world want to believe that the world leaders would not fail them this time. Why should they? There is no dissenting voice as far as the science of global warming and the adverse impacts humanity is facing are concerned. We wish the Cop26 conference all success.

Nov. 17 Thimphu(Kuensel/ANN)- The UN Climate Change Conference made some achievements, though not all expectations in terms of delivering on commitments made by carbon-emitting countries towards climate change mitigation were met, said Agriculture Minister Yeshey Penjore yesterday. The minister and his delegation from Bhutan to the COP26 arrived in Paro yesterday. However, he said that the conference, which was held from October 31 to November 12 in Glasgow in the United Kingdom, was successful in terms of strengthening Bhutan's relations with development partners. "We held many bilateral meetings on the side lines with our development partners," he said. He said that a report on Bhutan's participation at the COP26 would be submitted to the Cabinet. Speaking at the "high-level segment" of the conference on November 9, Lyonpo Yeshey Penjor emphasised the urgent need for COP to deliver ambitious, concrete, and enhanced climate actions. He called upon developed countries to scale up finance for adaptation, loss, and damage, and said technology transfer and capacity building are needed to enable vulnerable countries to cope with climate-induced challenges. Lyonpo also underscored the need to make finance easily accessible with fewer procedural challenges. He said that water resources, agriculture, and infrastructure for life, food security, and livelihood were at risk in the fragile mountain ecosystems of countries like Bhutan. "We are imposed upon by loss and damages frequently induced by climate disasters. As such, adaptation is a priority for us," he said. He added that adaptation must be supported with grants in finance for developing countries. He requested that countries live up to the USD 100 billion climate finance commitment, and said that adaptation must receive an equal share in climate financing. He called on investors, governments, multinational donors, and the private sector, among others, to support Bhutan's green initiatives. The summit took place against the backdrop of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report which showed that "unless there are rapid, sustained, and large-scale reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, the Paris Agreement goal of 1.5 degree Celsius will be impossible to reach". Lyonpo also highlighted that under the strong environmental stewardship of the Bhutanese Monarchs, the country continued to lead the way towards sustainable development and a low emission climate-resilient development pathway. Towards the end of the COP26 , Bhutan will hand over tne responsibility of chairing the LDC Group for Climate Change negotiations to Senegal of the African continent. The position of Group Chair rotates amongst member countries for a two-year term.

Describing the climate crisis as a matter of life or death, frontline youths have urged developed nations to keep their promise on climate finance and act urgently. They made the remark at a virtual dialogue "Youth, Climate Action and the Commonwealth: Field Experience and the Solutions" held Friday. Marking Commonwealth Day, YouthNet for Climate Justice organised the webinar with support from the British High Commission in Dhaka and Commonwealth Secretariat. State Minister for Water Resources Zahid Faruk spoke as the chief guest while Abul Kalam Azad, special envoy of the Climate Vulnerable Forum Presidency, chaired the event moderated by Sohanur Rahaman, executive coordinator of the YouthNet for Climate Justice. Tanvir Shakil Joy, lawmaker from Sirajganj-1, climate scientist Professor Saleemul Huq and Ken O'Flaherty, UK's COP26 regional ambassador to Asia-Pacific and South Asia, also joined the programme as special guests. Zahid Faruk said young people are the first to be affected by the environmental challenges facing their societies and Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 is perhaps the best gift to the future generations by the present generation. The vision of the Delta Plan is to build a prosperous Bangladesh through adopting compact, comprehensive, and effective strategies in line with the changing times, he said. O'Flaherty noted that the Glasgow Climate Pact created a path where countries had agreed to involve youths in both decision making and in national delegations following calls from young people. "We want to work with youths and continue to learn from people who are most affected and vulnerable," he said. About the youth leadership in COP26 and upcoming COP27, Ken said the youth leadership has been at the heart of COP26 and "it will continue to be our pillar in the upcoming COP27 as the UK holds its presidency." Saleemul Huq said, "We need to go beyond rhetoric and do actions. Dialogues cannot be just talk, talk, and talk. We need actions and youths need to be the ones to drive that action." About ensuring loss and damage funding issues, he said, "Loss and damage are happening. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report that was published a few days ago has reinforced that message. "And for every impact of climate change that happens everywhere in the world, including in rich countries, the people, who are being affected, are losing their livelihoods, homes, crops. And if we put it in dollar terms then for every hundred dollars loss, the victim is losing a hundred dollars." \</doc>

Two ARTivism competition winners from Bangladesh and one from Rohingya refugee community in Cox's Bazar are among 17 prize winners in an Asia-wide climate art competition, whose artworks are on display at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland. The competition in Asia region, organized by Save the Children, asked children to express their climate crisis concerns and solutions through art. Finalists in the regional competition were shortlisted from national competitions in eight Asian countries and two refugee communities. In Bangladesh, the competition was jointly arranged by Save the Children in Bangladesh and Kishor Alo. In regional competition, a painting by Mostofa Nurul Absar from Brahmanbaria district, has won Gold Medal under the category 'Nature' and a photograph by Ushoshi Momen from Dhaka has won Silver Medal under the category 'Prepare and Adapt' from Bangladesh. The winning entries - chosen by a panel of teenage climate activists - include paintings, photography, poems and rap songs from Bangladesh, China, Japan, Korea, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Vietnam. They have been exhibited alongside the other finalists in a virtual gallery and being displayed at the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of Parties ( COP26 ) from 1-12th November in Glasgow, Scotland. Eleven-year-old Mostofa Nurul Absar, winner of the Gold Medal for his painting 'Climate change and the life of a Royal Bengal Tiger' said they have to make the world livable not only for humans but also for our valuable wildlife. 'I am overwhelmed about my painting reaching to the world leaders directly. I just want them to hear my message and act.' Program Development and Quality Director Reefat Bin Sattar from Save the Children in Bangladesh said, 'I am very happy about our children that they understand the climate emergency. They have projected the crisis through their artworks very well to make the world leaders understand the urgency of taking action immediately. We have to prioritize their messages which they have given through the artworks.' The children from Bangladesh took part in the photography and painting competition titled 'ARTivism: Climate Change in My Eyes' and shared their thoughts on climate change through photographs and paintings. More than five hundred children of the country took part in this competition. First 40 people and then after further screening, four children have won this competition in country level. These final four artworks have been sent to the region to compete with the other Asian countries and finally the two artworks got selected for displaying in COP26 . \</doc>

Nov. 15 Tokyo(Yomiuri Shimbun/ANN)  U.N. climate talks wrapped up Saturday with an agreement to work toward the "phasedown" of dependence on coal-fired thermal power generation. The Glasgow Climate Pact adopted at the 26th U.N. Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow included "accelerating efforts towards the phasedown of unabated coal power," for which measures to curb emissions are yet to be devised. At the time of its adoption, the COP26 president's draft statement used the word "phaseout" regarding coal-fired thermal power generation, but India demanded a revision at the last minute. Ultimately, phaseout was replaced with the weaker expression "phasedown." It is extremely unusual for a COP agreement to include a clause on restrictions on the use of coal. It is also rare for the president's draft to be changed at the last minute before adoption. In principle, COP pacts are agreed upon unanimously. The last-minute change therefore showed that host country Britain, which hopes to accelerate the abandonment of coal, made concessions to India and China, which are highly dependent on coal-fired power generation. Japan also plans to continue to suspend and abolish inefficient coal-fired power plants, with the aim of reducing the proportion of coal in the nation's energy mix to 19% in fiscal 2030. The Paris Agreement framework adopted in 2015 stipulated efforts to limit global warming to well below 2 C, and preferably to 1.5 C, compared to pre-industrial levels. The Glasgow pact, however, stated the long-term global goal to "pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels," stressing that the world will realize the 1.5 C target. It also called for each country to review its reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions by the end of next year, further urging the international community to strengthen its climate change strategies. The Glasgow conference agreed on rules for internationally transferring mitigation outcomes and completed the Paris Agreement rulebook to implement the system an area where past COPs had failed to reach a consensus, making it known as the last piece of the Paris Agreement. Under the system, when developed countries provide technical assistance to developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a portion of the reduction can be credited to the developed countries. Emerging countries demanded that credits issued under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol framework also be certified under the Paris Agreement, but developed countries opposed the idea. In Glasgow, the two sides reached a compromise that credits issued from 2013 on will be certified. This agreement could cut an estimated 9 billion tons, or 30% of the world's total emissions yearly through 2030. As for financial assistance to developing countries, the Glasgow pact referred to "deep regret" that developed countries had not achieved their goal of contributing $100 billion (about \£511 trillion) annually by 2020. It urged them to achieve the target as soon as possible, taking into account requests from developing countries to increase the amount. "We have the first ever international agreement to phase down coal and a road map to limit global warming to 1.5 C," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said after the summit, underscoring the achievements of COP26 .

Dhaka, Oct. 30 -- Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will leave Dhaka for Glasgow on Sunday to join the 2021 United Nations climate change conference, COP26 , a crucial summit for Bangladesh, one of the countries that are most vulnerable to the effects of global warming. Hasina, who has added responsibilities as the chairperson of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a global partnership of 48 countries that are disproportionately affected by the consequences of global warming, will address the summit on the first day before joining talks at different levels, reports bdnews24.com. She will push for setting up Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs, to keep the rate of planetary warming down to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a $100 billion climate fund pledged by the developed nations, and cooperation to increase the use of renewable energy, Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen said at a news conference in Dhaka on Saturday. "The industrialised nations will have to play the key role because the G20 countries account for 80 per cent of carbon emission. [We will urge them] to work strongly to cut emissions," Momen said. In an official plan last week, they said they are confident they can reach their goal of handing over the fund by 2023, three years later than originally targeted, in the Paris COP summit in 2015. "We want them to act rather than talk," said Momen. Bangladesh has demanded 50 per cent of the fund to be spent on adaptation and the rest on cutting emissions. Bangladesh accounts for 0.47 per cent of global greenhouse emissions, and it needs more renewable energy to cut the rate further, the foreign minister said. The government has taken an aggressive plan called Mujib Prosperity Plan to reach that goal, he said. Bangladesh expects the COP26 summit to adopt a 'Dhaka-Glasgow Declaration' calling for the prevention of climate change, adaptation to its effects and funds. After speaking at the summit, Hasina will attend a joint meeting of CVF and Commonwealth as the chief guest on Nov 1. She will also join a meeting on action and solidarity in the 'critical decade' at the invitation of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson the same day. The prime minister will join a meeting on women and climate on Nov 2. She will also address Scottish MPs calling for "climate prosperity". Hasina will preside over the CVF- COP26 Leaders Dialogue during the visit. Besides the CVF countries, leaders of the UK and other countries will join the dialogue. During the 13-day tour, Hasina will travel to London and Paris as well. She will hold a bilateral meeting with Johnson in Glasgow, although Bangladesh wanted London to be the venue. Britain hopes the summit in Glasgow, which begins on Oct 31, will adopt plans to help move closer to the target of limiting the rise in the average global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. But reluctance among major carbon polluters, including China, India and Australia, to embrace stronger plans to reduce their planet-warming emissions has dented hopes for an ambitious outcome from the crucial UN climate summit. Johnson said on Saturday he estimated the chances of a successful outcome to the UN climate change summit at about six out of 10. A slew of national announcements just before the two-week COP26 talks has done little to advance efforts to meet global warming limits, which are set to be smashed without far steeper emissions cuts, analysts said. China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, on Thursday submitted an updated set of contributions to the UN climate body that were widely seen as offering nothing new compared with earlier pledges from its leader. Other big players, including Australia and India, have also fallen short, while uncertainties remain around whether US President Joe Biden can get approval for domestic legislation vital to his climate plans ahead of the COP26 conference.

Nov. 3 Bangkok(The Nation/ANN)- In his speech at the 26th Conference of the Parties to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP26 ), Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha proudly announced that Thailand had cut greenhouse gas emissions by 17 per cent in 2019. He pointed out that this reduction far exceeded the target of a 7 per cent reduction by 2020 that had been set in 2015 when Thailand joined the Paris Agreement. Many world leaders are attending the COP26 , which kicked off on Monday in Glasgow, Scotland. The @ThaigovSpokesman Facebook page posted on Tuesday that "PM Prayut told the summit that Thailand is committed to solving climate change problems and will cooperate with every country to achieve the global target, for the future of our children." At the summit, Prayut said: "We are ready to upgrade our effort in climate change management to the next level, to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, and completely eliminate the emission of greenhouse gases to 0 per cent by 2065. "We have no 'Plan B' when it comes to remedying the world's climate, as there is no 'Planet B' that we can fall back on," he said. "I would therefore like to urge every country to take care of our planet." After the summit, Prayut met other world leaders to discuss ideas as well as invite them to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit, which will be hosted by Thailand in 2022. The leaders who Prayut extended the invite to include German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British PM Boris Johnson and Canadian PM Justin Trudeau. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen has underscored the need for hosting a climate event on the sidelines of COP26 in Glasgow in early November to bolster cooperation among the climate-vulnerable nations, including Bangladesh. Dr Momen batted for the joint climate event -- Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) -- during bilateral discussions with COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma at 9 Downing Street in London on Friday. The 2021 UN Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26 , is slated for November this year. He proposed that the UK and Bangladesh expand their bilateral climate ties, especially in transferring green technology, promoting green investment, and supporting climate mitigation projects such as building embankments to protect people from sea-level rise and riverbank erosion The Foreign Minister highlighted Bangladesh's important role in CVF under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina At the meeting, Dr Momen briefed Sharma on the COP26 agenda for Bangladesh focusing particularly on loss and damage and the proposed CVF- COP26 Leaders' Summit under Bangladesh's Presidency. Thanking Sharma for visiting Bangladesh last June, he also congratulated him on organising the July COP26 The COP26 President-Designate, on his part, assured Bangladesh of the UK's continued support for its climate initiatives covering different areas, including collaboration to promote green financing and investment, and technology transfer to build a clean and green future. Bangladesh High Commissioner to the UK and Ireland, Saida Muna Tasneem, had accompanied Dr Momen to the talks, along with other senior members of the Minister's delegation. Later in the day, Dr Momen delivered a climate talk, titled 'Forging a CVF- COP26 Climate Solidarity', organised by the UK's foremost think-tank Chatham House, where he called for global solidarity and political commitment to combat climate challenges. Mentioning Bangladesh's various initiatives including the 'Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan Decade 2030' and Bangladesh's self-financed USD450 million Climate Change Trust Fund, the Minister said that Prime Minister Hasina has been pursuing a low carbon development path "although Bangladesh is a minimal emitter". During the meeting, the Minister noted that the Rohingyas posed a grave threat to the environment in southeastern Bangladesh and called for UK's support in repatriating them to their own country, Myanmar.

Dhaka, Oct. 16 -- COP26 Regional Ambassador Ken O'Flaherty has said it is possible for countries like Bangladesh to significantly expand its renewable energy sector as it has been the cheapest option for new energy in Asian countries. "It's clear that over the next decade the cost of renewable energy will continue to fall. So countries which don't invest in renewable energy risk losing competitive advantage," he told UNB in an interview at the British High Commissioner's residence here. Across the region, the envoy said, he is seeing governments recognise the opportunities offered by renewable energy and said countries like Bangladesh can look into potential cooperation at regional level on hydropower. Ambassador Ken said there is a lot of interest in investing in renewable energy and hydropower but what the investors need is a clear signal from the government. "We're working with the governments like Bangladesh to ensure that there's a clear framework for supporting that investment in domestic and regional power systems," said the envoy. Ken, who was appointed UK government's COP26 Regional Ambassador to Asia-Pacific and South Asia in March 2020, said renewable energy is the cheapest source of energy worldwide compared to coal. Talking about clean and cheap energy, he said they think there is a strong appetite for it and they have seen countries in Asia announcing their policies to move away from coal. "We're seeing more and more countries to adopt similar policies. I'm very confident that ahead of COP26 , we'll see more countries in this region adopt net zero target." Ken laid emphasis on ensuring that countries have access to climate finance to help them take advantage of cheap, clean energy. Responding to a question, he said Bangladesh is already very active in climate change arena and the country has a lot to teach the world in building resilience to climate impacts. He said Bangladesh also has a role in terms of raising the voices of vulnerable countries to encourage the big emitters worldwide take strong actions as consequences of climate change is visible. "Bangladesh has a very strong moral voice in the internal community." Since Bangladesh is currently the chair of Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), Ken said, they very much hope that there will be another way for Bangladesh to ensure voices of vulnerable countries calling strong climate actions can be heard. The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 Parties at COP 21 in Paris, on 12 December 2015 and entered into force on 4 November 2016. Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2.0, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels. "We want to see strong action by the governments to deliver on what was agreed five years ago," Ken said underlining the urgency of action to tackle climate change. He said the consequences of not meeting of the target (1.5 degrees Celsius) will be "catastrophic" in particular for countries which are vulnerable such as Bangladesh. "It's clear that action by governments is essential." Ken said economies and societies will be devastated by the climate change and they are calling to governments to commit net zero targets. "We're also calling for short-term actions." The envoy said worldwide they are seeing more and more extreme weather events and these extreme weather events will only increase in its intensity and frequency. He said the COP26 There is a call to developed countries to make good on their promise to mobilise US$ 100 billion annually in climate finance to support the needs of developing nations. "We're working very hard to encourage the international donor community to step up further to make sure that US$ 100 billion promise can be met," ken said. During his recent daylong visit to Bangladesh, Ken met Special Envoy to the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) Presidency Abul Kalam Azad and discussed COP26 preparations and plans for the climate vulnerable country engagement. He was accompanied by British High Commissioner to Bangladesh Robert Chatterton Dickson. He welcomed recent CVF Asia communique and commitment to no new coal and expects greater action by major emitters must be acted upon. COP26 Ambassador Ken also met Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Md Shahab Uddin and discussed COP26 preparations and Bangladesh's priorities on climate adaptation, finance, losses and damages. He hoped that Bangladesh would confirm the 2050 NetZero target before Glasgow. He also met State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid to discuss plans for increasing renewable energy, including solar power. Both global and regional support is required for Bangladesh's energy transition, they agreed. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Dhaka, Nov. 8 -- Former US president Barack Obama on Monday lent his backing to appeals for more help from those on the frontline of global warming, as developing and rich nations engage to try to end years of deadlock over cash for climate change. At the start of the second and final week of the UN climate talks in Glasgow - known as COP26 - ministers got down to the detail of trying to honour promises to pay for climate-linked losses and damages, and to address how to help nations adapt to the effects of climate change, reports Reuters. "We have to act now to help with adaptation and resilience," Obama told a meeting of island nations at the Glasgow talks," adding his views on the immediacy of the threat had been shaped by his experience growing up in Hawaii. Tuvalu's foreign minister, Simon Kofe, will offer a graphic demonstration of how rising sea levels affect his small island nation with a recorded speech to the conference dressed in a suit and tie while standing knee-deep in seawater. "The statement juxtaposes the COP26 setting with the real-life situations faced in Tuvalu due to the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise," said Kofe, standing at a lectern on the shores of the Pacific island. The speech will be broadcast to the Glasgow conference on Tuesday. Britain, which is hosting the COP26 meeting, attempted to set the pace on Monday by announcing 290 million pounds ($391 million) in new funding, including support for countries in the Asia Pacific region to deal with the impact of global warming. But Ghana's Environment Minister Kwaku Afriyie said negotiations were not reflecting the levels of ambition publicly voiced by developed countries. "It's very unfortunate and sad indeed," he said. While developing countries want more money to help them adapt to higher temperatures that have caused more frequent droughts, floods and wildfires, developed nations have been focused on channelling finance towards cutting emissions. The cost of both is huge, but the cost will be even higher unless the Glasgow talks can keep alive a goal that dates from UN talks in Paris in 2015 to keep global warming below 1.5 Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. Beyond the 1.5C level, the world risks devastating climate impacts. Richer nations need to show they can make good on the many pledges they delivered in the first week of the talks, which are scheduled to finish on Friday. Developing countries are wary. At a UN climate summit 12 years ago in Copenhagen, rich nations promised to hand developing countries $100 billion a year by 2020 to help them adapt to climate change. The target was missed and at COP26 , richer nations have said they will meet the goal in 2023 at the latest, with some hoping it could be delivered a year earlier. Potentially more problematic for rich nations is how they should compensate less developed countries for loss and damages caused by historic emissions, an area where concrete pledges have yet to be made. Emily Bohobo N'Dombaxe Dola, facilitator of the Adaptation Working Group of the official youth constituency to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said she was drawn to action after seeing how climate change had affected Senegal. "Now it is time for governments and donors to level up on equitable finance and plans for loss and damage and for adaptation," she said in a statement.

The voices of world leaders are always heard everywhere -- from the UN to COP26 . Can poor farmers make their way to that stage? Hardly! But the poorest small-scale farmers of Bangladesh spoke at the COP26 about the projects and practices that are helping them adapt, thanks to IFAD for arranging a virtual visit to Bangladesh, enabling them to speak up. The UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) has highlighted the impact of climate change on small-scale farmers at the 26th Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change currently underway in Glasgow, UK, through the virtual visit to Bangladesh. The small-scale farmers, who produce 70-80 percent of Bangladesh's food, are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change - and, ironically, contribute to it the least. 'Bangladesh contributes less than 0.47 percent of global emissions, yet it is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world,' Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said in her statement at the Leaders' Meeting on Action and Solidarity-The Critical Decade at COP26 . Accompanied by documentary filmmaker Qasa Alom, the audience virtually met and interacted with farmers participating in IFAD-supported projects, to discuss their climate challenges and how they and their rural communities are adapting. IFAD's experience in Bangladesh over 40 years shows how climate-sensitive agricultural techniques and approaches can have a direct impact on the lives and livelihoods of local populations. Two examples are the Haor Infrastructure and Livelihood Improvement Project-Climate Adaptation and Livelihood Protection project (HILIP-CALIP) and the Promoting Agricultural Commercialization and Enterprises project where IFAD is working with the government and other key partners to ensure that rural populations have all the tools and infrastructure they need to create profitable and sustainable livelihoods, despite the threat of cyclones, droughts, soil erosion and rising water levels. 'While progress is being made, the government of Bangladesh and the people of Bangladesh need more financial and technical support to mitigate and adapt to climate change,' said Donal Brown, Associate Vice-President at IFAD on Wednesday. 'Successful projects really need to be scaled up, and that's why the discussions at COP26 are so important. I'm confident that if we all come together and do provide the finance necessary, we will be able to have a successful response to climate change in countries like Bangladesh,' he added. In Sunamganj hoar district, participants spoke about how frequent and prolonged flooding would sweep away their homes and cattle, and how it cut off mobility. 'Six months of the year the roads are underwater, which meant I couldn't get to my crops to harvest them or sell them at market,' said Lalon, one of the participants. Children would also be unable to go to school. Submersible roads and an early warning system are two of the interventions made by HILIP-CALIP to help people in the area adapt. 'I use the submersible road during the pre-monsoon period for transporting and marketing of agricultural/non-agricultural products. And the early warning system helps us to organise ourselves and harvest before the flood comes and store it in protection shelters,' said Lalon. Meanwhile, in Satkhira district, near the Sundarbans, the world's largest deltaic mangrove forest, participants are taking to crab farming in response to the changing climate in their area. Introducing more saline tolerant species has helped farmers in the area combat the impact of rising sea levels and warming temperatures. 'I used to be a shrimp farmer but we have been experiencing more natural disasters in this region, which affected shrimp farming and the harvest. I learnt that crabs are easier to farm, as they are better able to deal with increased salinity and changing water temperatures,' said Masum. This activity is supported by PACE. Globally, only 3 percent of the global climate finance is targeted towards small-scale agriculture, and only 1.7 percent reaches small-scale farmers - a fraction of the support they need to adapt to a changing climate. IFAD said it is committing to ensuring that 40 percent of its core resources are dedicated to climate finance, with the vast majority of this being adaptation to climate finance, as well as expanding its capacity as an assembler of finance. IFAD has historically prioritised adaptation finance and from 2019-20, 92 percent of IFAD's climate finance was for climate change adaptation. The Building climate resilience in the Asia Pacific region report, released earlier this week, reviews the key results and lessons learned from the IFAD-supported Adaptation for Smallholder Agricultural Programme (ASAP) which ran from 2012 to 2017 and invested US$305 million in targeted rural development projects that needed support in adapting and mitigating the effects of climate change on rural communities. The ASAP programme made significant progress in the region, supporting more than 510,000 small-scale farming households to adapt to climate change in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Laos, Nepal and Vietnam. It analyses approaches and actions that were successful and can be 'scaled up' in the region, providing a solid foundation for the new phase of the programme called the Enhanced Adaptation for Smallholder Agricultural Programme (ASAP+), potentially channelling an additional US$500 million in climate finance to support the climate resilience of 10 million vulnerable people, particularly women and youth. \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 25 -- Developed nations are set to be three years late meeting a pledge to commit a total of $500 billion to help poorer countries tackle climate change and realise this has damaged mutual trust. British politician and president of the upcoming COP26 climate conference Alok Sharma gave the information at a televised news conference on Monday, reports Reuters. Rich nations vowed in 2009 to deliver $100 billion a year for five years, starting in 2020. But a plan on how to do so, prepared by Canada and Germany ahead of the United Nations COP26 summit in Scotland, said the annual target would now not be met until 2023. Climate finance is a crucial issue for the summit, which is aiming for more ambitious country commitments to limit warming. Failure to meet the target is a symbol of broken past promises that complicate efforts to set goals for ramping up climate aid. "Understandably, this has been a source of deep frustration for developing countries," Sharma said. "The aim of putting this plan together has been to rebuild trust ... countries will need to deliver on this." "The data also gives us confidence that we will likely be able to mobilise more than US$100 billion per year thereafter," said the 12-page plan. Environmental groups say this is not nearly enough. African nations believe the financing should be scaled up to more than tenfold to $1.3 trillion per year by 2030, a key African climate negotiator told Reuters this month. Teresa Anderson, the climate policy coordinator at ActionAid International, said meeting the goal was the "bare minimum needed to build trust" in the climate talks. "World leaders must recognise and address the glaring gap between the current $100 billion a year target and the trillions needed to tackle the scale and urgency of the crisis," she said in a statement. Germany's junior environment minister Jochen Flasbarth said it was "extremely unfortunate" the goal had not been reached by 2020 as planned. "(We) really pushed developed countries during the last weeks very hard, and not all of our conversations were very easy, to be polite," he said.

Nov. 16 Tokyo(The Japan News/ANN)  The 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP26 ) concluded with some tangible achievements, such as including in its agreement the de facto goal of limiting temperature increases to 1.5 C and the phased reduction of coal-fired power generation. However, it also showed that gaps remain between developed countries and developing countries. "I apologize for the way this process has unfolded, and I'm deeply sorry," said COP26 President Alok Sharma, just before the Glasgow Climate Pact was adopted on Saturday. "I also understand the deep disappointment, but I think as you have noted, it's also vital that we protect this package." Sharma had called for a phase-out of coal in the first draft of the agreement presented on Nov. 10. This wording was met with a fierce backlash from India and China, leading to a change from "phase-out" to "phasedown." The two countries reacted this way because of their energy situations. Coal-fired power accounts for over 70% of India's total power generation and for more than 60% in China. An important declaration made at an international conference could force a drastic change in their energy policies. Many revisions were made to the draft. On Saturday, the final day of the conference after the schedule was extended by one day, India's Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Bhupender Yadav called for a further revision at an informal meeting, questioning whether anyone could expect developing countries to make commitments on coal and fossil fuels. Representatives from India, China, the United States and the European Union then went on to have talks. At the last plenary session held immediately after, India demanded that the word "phase-out" be changed to "phasedown." The EU did not oppose the change, although it expressed disappointment, and Sharma also accepted it. The change is believed to have been the result of talks among the four parties to seek a compromise, a move that was criticized by some. A Swiss delegation said the pact was watered down through a process that lacked transparency.  Goal of 1.5 C The pact also includes a clause stating that parties should "pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C" above preindustrial levels by the end of this century. This is believed to have effectively made into a target the figure of 1.5 C, which had previously been presented as a level that nations should strive toward. Britain wanted to realize some substantial achievements as the host country, and proceeded to adjust the wording through informal talks. The clause's inclusion was approved by developed countries as well as island nations such as Tuvalu. Oil-producing countries including India, Russia, and Saudi Arabia reportedly were opposed to the proposal, saying that developed countries had already emitted a large amount of greenhouse gases and so they were allowed to do the same. The figure made it into the pact agreed upon by all 197 parties, despite some having been pessimistic. "This could send a strong message of political will," said one Japanese government official.  Lingering dissatisfaction However, keeping the temperature rise to 1.5 C will be very difficult. It cannot be achieved unless each country raises or reconsiders their targets on greenhouse gas emissions. The pact stipulates that actions should be in line with national circumstances. This statement was included apparently out of consideration for developing countries. However, it will be difficult to find a common foothold if emerging economies with large emissions, such as China and India, resist raising their targets by citing "national circumstances." The United States, the EU and other developed countries are urging the parties to implement related measures in a proactive way. U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry said the pact was the beginning of the efforts of the next decade. However, dissatisfaction remains among developing countries that the agreed financial support from developed countries and other support measures are insufficient. The two-week discussions at COP26 highlighted that all parties could agree on a broad goal to prevent global warming, but their conflicting interests remain a hurdle. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 22 -- UK's Queen Elizabeth II has expressed her irritation and criticized the global leaders who talk about climate change but do nothing to address global warming adding that it is still unclear who would turn up to the COP26 climate summit scheduled to be held in Glasgow next November. Her comment on climate change inaction passed on recently, many a way, a rare public foray into big power climate politics leading to worries that Chinese President Xi Jineng, leader of the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, would not attend the 31October -12 November Summit. The 95-year-old British monarch was filmed on a phone as she visited Cardiff to open the Welsh parliament last Thursday. At one point, speaking to her daughter-in-law Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and parliament presiding officer Elin Jones, she said "I've been hearing all about COP. I still don't know whose coming." On the recording, parts of which are inaudible, the queen also appears to say it is "irritating" when "they talk, but they don't do."Britain, which hosts the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26 , in Glasgow on Oct. 31-Nov 12, is seeking to get big power support for a more radical plan to tackle climate change. "It is now pretty clear that Xi is not going to turn up and the PM has been told that, "The Times quoted an unidentified British source as saying "What we don't know is what stance the Chinese are going to take." The UK's Queen is due to welcome leaders from around the world to COP26 , a climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, where several heads of state or government, including China's Xi Jinping, have not yet clearly said whether they will attend. Though a government minister, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, said the queen's comments had not been intended for broadcast adding that such comments made in private should stay private, but we all share the desire to see progress made and we know there will be hundreds of leaders coming to Glasgow for COP 26, speaking with Sky News. In Britain's constitutional monarchy the queen is meant to be above politics, and she rarely expresses opinions in public. Her son and heir, Prince Charles, though, has long been outspoken on environmental issues and lastly Charles' son Prince William has also taken up the cause, backing the Earth-shot Prize for environmental innovation that will be awarded. In an interview with the BBC broadcast, William criticized space tourism, saying the world's greatest minds should focus on fixing the Earth instead, the comments were aired a day after the 90-year-old "Star Trek" actor William Shatner became the oldest person to fly to space, in a rocket funded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. In the backdrop of the many such developments on the ensuing summit, Western leaders such as US President Joe Biden and British Morris Johnson have repeatedly warned that the world must change to slow climate change, but many environmental activists say leaders talk too much and do too little. Meanwhile, based on these comments on the issue Joe Biden's administration has issued a 40 page report warning that the climate crises 'Poses serious and systematic threat and risks to the US Economy and the Financial system' and as such setting out necessary steps for action as 'Climate impacts are already affecting American job, homes, families hard-earned savings and business. The report lays out what the White House calls government wide plans to protect the world's bigger economy. In the context of the contradictory syndrome, the doubt is still mounting whether the outcome of the Climate Summit would fulfil the expectations across the world, main focus of which centres on poverty-free, climate-tolerant economic situation necessitated for sustainable development here and there in the Earth to overcome the devastating havoc and damages due to ongoing Covid-19 crisis.

Dhaka, Sept. 3 -- Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen has proposed to host a CVF- COP26 joint event on the sideline of the upcoming COP26 to strengthen climate cooperation between the President of COP-26 and the most climate-vulnerable countries including Bangladesh. Momen made the proposal while holding a bilateral talk with COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma at 9 Downing Street in London on Thursday, according to a press release issued on Friday morning. During the meeting, the foreign minister highlighted Bangladesh's important role in the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) under the chairmanship of visionary leader Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina while discussing the joint event targeting the COP26 to be held in Glasgow in early November, reports BSS. The minister also proposed to expand bilateral climate relations between the UK and Bangladesh especially in transferring green technology, promoting green investment, and supporting climate mitigation projects such as building embankments to protect people from sea-level rise and river erosion. The foreign minister briefed Sharma on the COP26 agenda for Bangladesh focusing particularly on loss and damage and the proposed CVF- COP26 Leaders' Summit under Bangladesh Presidency. Thanking the COP-26 president-designate for visiting Bangladesh last June, Momen also congratulated him on organising the July COP26 Ministerial successfully. Sharma assured Bangladesh of the UK's continued support for its climate initiatives covering different areas, including collaboration to promote green financing and investment, and technology transfer to build a clean and green future. Bangladesh High Commissioner to the UK and Ireland Saida Muna Tasneem accompanied Dr Momen to the talk along with other senior members of the Minister's delegation. Later, Momen delivered a climate talk titled "Forging a CVF- COP26 Climate Solidarity" at the UK's foremost think tank Chatham House, calling for global solidarity and political commitment to combat climate challenges. The foreign minister said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has been pursuing a low carbon development path although Bangladesh is a minimal emitter. He highlighted Bangladesh's various initiatives including the "Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan Decade 2030" and Bangladesh's self-financed USD 450 million Climate Change Trust Fund to adapt to the adverse effects of global warming. Momen said the forcefully displaced Rohingyas posed a grave threat to the environment in southeastern Bangladesh and called for UK's support in repatriating them to their own country Myanmar. High Commissioner Tasneem gave a welcome speech at the dialogue, organised jointly by Bangladesh High Commission and Chatham House. The talk was also attended by Maldives Speaker and former President and CVF Thematic Ambassador for Ambition Mohamed Nasheed along with a number of CVF Ambassadors and High Commissioners and climate experts. Chatham House Chair Bernice Lee moderated the talk where several British and British-Bangladeshis joined in a question-and-answer session with the Bangladesh foreign minister.

Dhaka, Oct. 13 -- Ambassador of the EU Delegation to Bangladesh Charles Whiteley believes a wealth of ideas of Bangladesh to address climate challenges will enrich its preparation for the upcoming COP26 meet. "Bangladesh has a wealth of ideas on how to address the challenges of climate change both at home and in the wider world," says Mr Whiteley. "This exchange will help to enrich our preparations for COP 26 and to deliver a result that meets the need and expectations of both Bangladesh and the EU." The envoy was addressing a roundtable on climate change in the city on Monday ahead of the COP26 beginning in Glasgow on October 31, said an EU Delegation release on Tuesday. Centre for Policy Dialogue executive director Dr Fahmida Khatun, BRAC University professor emeritus Dr Ainun Nishat, Muniruzzaman and Shafqat Munir of the Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies, Dr Mizanur Rahman Khan of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, Dr Atiq Rahman of Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies, and UNDP climate specialist AK Mamunur Rashid spoke. Officials of the EU Delegation to Bangladesh Jeremy Opritesco, Dario Trombetta and Towheed Feroze also took part in the programme. Mr Whiteley highlighted the EU's commitment to achieving 'climate neutrality' by 2050 and underlined the important role played by both Bangladesh and the EU in the climate discourse. Other discussants shed light on the country's expectations from the COP26 and explored areas of working together with the EU after the meet to build climate resilience. They underscored meeting pledges on climate finance, the importance of technology transfer and capacity building, and keeping the warming limit to 1.5 degrees. The speakers also called for international discussion on climate-induced migration, the impact of Covid-19 and the importance of building resilience in the meet. The EU Delegation representatives told the roundtable that the EU's Climate Adaptation Strategy was published last August. The Team Europe Initiative on Green Energy Transition is expected to support the fulfilment of Bangladesh's energy needs through renewable energy, they cited.

Dhaka, Nov. 9 -- An overarching goal for the COP26 UN summit of "keeping alive" a 1.5-degree Celsius limit on global warming is in jeopardy, with deep splits about what would signal its demise. Global average surface temperatures are already up about 1.1C above pre-industrial times. And climate scientists say they will almost inevitably "overshoot" 1.5C, the most ambitious goal set in the 2015 Paris Agreement, as planet-heating emissions rebound after a dip due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some nations, especially island states at risk of being swamped by rising seas, say reaching 1.5C - in any year - would be the death knell of the iconic goal, reports Reuters. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, countries formally aimed to limit warming to "well below" 2C while "pursuing efforts" for 1.5C. At-risk nations want far more action by major emitters, led by China and the United States, to shift away from fossil fuels towards adopting more renewable energy sources. "Beyond 1.5 we cannot imagine a future. It is not a number for negotiation," said Satyendra Prasad, Fiji's ambassador to the United Nations. Many vulnerable countries have campaigned for years with the slogan "1.5 to stay alive". But the world is slipping off track. "Overshoot is very likely unavoidable," said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Germany-based Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Deep cuts in emissions, mainly from burning fossil fuels - twinned with mass plantings of trees that soak up carbon, and novel technologies for extracting greenhouse gases from the atmosphere - could eventually turn down the global thermostat. "We have this delicate dilemma that it's really important for policymakers to aim for 1.5 - but that does not mean that we lose the world's future at 1.6 or 1.7," Rockstrom said. The Earth might be able to tolerate a brief overshoot, he said, before irreversible changes set in, such as the meltdown of Antarctica's ice sheet or mass collapse of coral reefs. "Every tenth of a degree matters," he said, adding that people, especially the young, would have "every reason to be angry" if temperatures rise 1.5C. On the COP26 conference's website, the main goal listed by Britain is to "secure global net zero by mid-century and keep 1.5 degrees within reach." Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted at the start of the summit "Let's keep 1.5 alive # COP26 ". Britain has not defined what it means by "within reach" or "alive". The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in August that the 1.5C goal is likely to be breached in the period 2021-2040, even with steep cuts in emissions. ON 'LIFE SUPPORT' At best, the 1.5C goal "is on life support - it's in the ICU" (Intensive Care Unit), said Alden Meyer, of the E3G think-tank. He said the lack of a clear definition may make it easier for Britain and other nations to claim success at the end of the COP26 summit, due to close on Friday, buoyed by pledges to phase out coal, cut methane emissions and halt deforestation, among others. "The window (for 1.5) is closing, but there is still time for us to act," said Alok Sharma, the British president of the talks, asked to define when the 1.5C goal might be considered dead. He pointed to big progress in recent years. Before the 2015 Paris climate conference, he noted that one scientific projection showed the world was on track for a catastrophic 6C of warming. After pledges for emissions cuts in Paris, that fell to about 4C, he said. And last week, the International Energy Agency said new commitments in recent days, such as by India to reach net zero emissions by 2070, meant warming could be limited to 1.8C by 2100. The IEA added a key caveat that the projection would require all national goals to be met "in full and on time", after years of failed promises. The United Nations says emissions would have to fall 7.6% a year this decade to get on track for the 1.5C goal. Such a pace is unknown except during wartime, pandemics, recessions or the collapse of the Soviet Union and its smokestack industries. Greenhouse gas emissions tumbled by 5.4% in 2020 during lockdowns to curb the COVID-19 pandemic, close to the UN's recommended amount, but are on track to rebound by 4.9% this year, according to the Global Carbon Project. TECHNOLOGY ILLUSION? Some environmental groups say the idea of overshooting the 1.5C goal, and then reversing course, is a fantasy. "People who are talking about overshoots and having more time aren't serious about 1.5," said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International. "Technologies that don't exist yet are not a way to keep it alive," she said. Emerging technologies include machines to suck carbon from the air, or to capture and bury emissions from power plants. Mohamed Adow, head of the Nairobi-based think-tank Power Shift Africa, said the world should keep working for 1.5C, even if temperatures overshoot. "I can't imagine a time when we say we've given up on 1.5," he said. But all agree the opportunity to keep it in sight is shrinking fast. "Overshoot is not endless - probably 1.6, 1.7 maximum to get back down to 1.5 by the end of the century," said Niklas Hohne, founding partner of the New Climate Institute. He added that governments were doing too little to curb emissions - putting the crucial target at risk. "For me, 1.5 would be dead if we continue on this trajectory for another five years, maximum," he warned. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

The just concluded climate conference could not possibly achieve all what were expected, yet what has been achieved is not less encouraging. The 'Glasgow Climate Pact 2021' was adopted despite a last minute intervention by India to water down language from 'phasing out' coal to 'phasing down'. After two weeks of intensive talks in Glasgow, diplomats from almost 200 countries have agreed to ramp up their carbon-cutting commitments, phase out some fossil fuels and increase aid to poor countries on the front lines of climate change. The agreement will not put the world on track to avoid catastrophic warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). But experts observed that the pact represents a significant step on a path to a safer future. The pledges on emissions cuts made at the two-week Cop26 in Glasgow fell well short of those required for limiting temperatures to 1.5C, according to scientific advice. Countries agreed to return to negotiation table in 2022 for another conference (COP27) in Egypt, and re-examine their national plans, with a view to increasing their ambition on emission reduction. Countries have agreed a deal on the climate crisis that its backers said would keep within reach the goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C, the key threshold of safety set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement. The Glasgow Climate Pact 2021 has definitely given renewed hopes to climate vulnerable nations and developed countries in going ahead with their planned NDC achievements. Highlights of Glasgow Climate Pact Emissions Cuts (known as Mitigation) The current national plans on cutting emissions by 2030, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), are inadequate to limit temperature rises to 1.5C, and according to analysis published during the talks would lead to a disastrous 2.4C of heating. Only one major emitter - India - produced a new NDC at the talks, so the work of getting NDCs in line with a 1.5C goal was always going to stretch beyond the end of the Glasgow summit. However, under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations are only required to return every five years to set new NDCs - and in 2025 are scheduled to discuss NDCs for beyond 2030. Sticking to that timetable would take the world well beyond 1.5C, so one of the crucial aims for the UK hosts was to draw up a roadmap for swifter revisions. That was achieved - the question of revising NDCs will be on the agenda for next year's COP27, to be held in Egypt, and for the one following in 2023. Adaptation and Climate Finance Developing countries are angered by this, which was reflected at the talks, and have been promised that increases will follow in the next five years that will bring the finance for the next five years to $500bn. They also want more of the cash to be spent on adaptation, rather than emissions cuts. This is important because most of the climate finance currently available goes to funding emissions-cutting projects, such as renewable energy schemes, in middle-income countries that could often be funded easily without help, because they turn a profit. But the poorest countries who need money to adapt to the impact of extreme weather struggle to obtain any funding at all. In the end, the text agreed to double the proportion of climate finance going to adaptation. The UN and some countries were calling for a 50:50 split between funding for emissions cuts and funding for adaptation, so this has fallen short but is still an important step. Loss and Damage Loss and damage refers to the ravages of the climate crisis that are too destructive for countries to prevent or adapt to them - hurricanes and cyclones, for instance, or the inundation of low-lying areas by storm surges. Countries have been talking about loss and damage for a decade but the discussions have made little progress. Developing countries say they are already spending large sums from their already stretched budgets to repair the damage caused by the climate crisis, but developed countries are wary of the way the discussion has sometimes been framed, as a call for compensation or reparations for climate damage, which they cannot accept as it would lay them open to endless legal liability. At the last COP, discussions moved on far enough for the setting up of a database and communications and reporting system, called the Santiago Network. Many developing countries were hoping that COP26 could provide a further step towards some form of funding mechanism for loss and damage. That has not happened, and the issue will return to the talks next year. Reaffirming the Paris Agreement Some countries came to Glasgow opposed to stronger action and tried to suggest that focusing on 1.5C was 'reopening the Paris Agreement', the main goal of which is to hold temperature rises 'well below' 2C above pre-industrial levels while 'pursuing efforts' to limit rises to 1.5C. The UK hosts and supporters such as John Kerry of the US repeatedly pointed out that 'well below' 2C could not mean 1.9C or 1.8C, as those were not 'well below', and that going below that got close to 1.5C. There are also repeated references in the text to 'the best available science', which has moved on since the Paris Agreement to show even more clearly that 1.5C is much safer than 2C and that every fraction of a degree counts. So the argument at Glasgow was firmly won in favor of 1.5C - in itself an achievement for the UK hosts, and much better for the planet. What Leaders Said at Conclusion? Alok Sharma, the UK cabinet minister who presided over the fortnight-long COP26 talks in Glasgow, acknowledged the scale of the task remaining: 'We can now say with credibility that we have kept 1.5C alive. But, its pulse is weak and it will only survive if we keep our promises and translate commitments into rapid action.' UN Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guti\'e9rrez observed that further urgent work was needed to reaching the goal. He said, 'Our fragile planet is hanging by a thread. We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe. It is time to go into emergency mode - or our chance of reaching net zero [emissions] will itself be zero.' Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International said, 'It's meek, it's weak and the 1.5C goal is only just alive, but a signal has been sent that the era of coal is ending. And that matters.' Mary Robinson, former UN commissioner for human rights and chair of The Elders group of leaders and former states people said, ' Cop26 has made some progress, but nowhere near enough to avoid climate disaster. While millions around the world are already in crisis, not enough leaders came to Glasgow with a crisis mindset. The world urgently needs them to step up more decisively next year.' Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, representing the High Ambition Coalition of developed and developing countries said, 'This package is not perfect. The coal change and a weak outcome on loss and damage are blows. But it is real progress and elements of [it] are a lifeline for my country. We must not discount the crucial wins covered in this package.' Mohamed Adow, director of the Nairobi-based think tank Power Shift Africa, took a harsher view, 'The needs of the world's vulnerable people have been sacrificed on the altar of the rich world's selfishness. The outcome here reflects a Cop held in the rich world and the outcome contains the priorities of the rich world.' Making the concession, Lia Nicholson, lead negotiator for Antigua and Barbuda, which chairs the 37-strong Alliance of Small Island States said, 'We are extremely disappointed and we will express our grievance in due course.' The COP also resolved several outstanding technical issues that had prevented aspects of the 2015 Paris climate agreement from coming into operation. These issues, on carbon trading and the 'transparency' with which countries monitor and report their emissions, have dogged the annual climate meetings for six years but compromises were finally reached, which earned applause for Sharma. Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change said, 'After six years, this is a significant accomplishment.' One of the most contentious clauses in the final decision was a vaguely worded resolution to phase down 'inefficient' fossil fuel subsidies. Energy experts are clear that phasing out coal will be essential to stay within 1.5C of global heating, but the opposition to the inclusion of the reference to a phase out - particularly from major coal-using countries including China, India and South Africa - showed how hard it will be to gain a global end to the dirtiest fossil fuel in time to avoid a 1.5C rise. Major Polluters Must Reduce Pollution Drastically The Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) released an analysis on the sidelines of COP26 , which said China, the US, and the EU are likely to occupy more than 90% of the available 1.5 degree C carbon space by 2050. This would leave little room for developing nations including India, Bangladesh are others to grow their economies in the coming decades. Also, the three big emitters would consume 45% of the available carbon space by 2030. 'India, for example on the other hand, would emit 59% less than China, 58% less than the US, and 49% less than the EU, from 1850 to 2100, on a cumulative basis, despite turning net zero two decades later than the US and the EU and a decade later than China,' the analysis said. What Can Bangladesh Do? Bangladesh has no mentionable carbon footprint and for that matter has no obligation for reducing emissions. Still as a climate vulnerable country it has committed to Net Zero Emission to 2050. Nothing prevents Bangladesh using latest technologies of fossil fuel based power generation ensuring least C02 emissions. It should also restrict GHG emissions through energy efficiency. Bangladesh must also explore all possible avenues of renewable energy development. It must seek for greener energy (Nuclear, Hybrid Solar, Green Hydrogen). Bangladesh would require accessing to GCF and generous technical support and technology transfer from the developed nations towards achieving Net Zero commitments. There is no necessity that Bangladesh takes hurried decisions in cancelling its fossil fuel based under implementation projects. But it must phase down coal projects and must be more aggressive in renewable energy development and energy efficiency. \</doc>

Sourcing the finance for climate adaptation and mitigation efforts will be one of the biggest challenges faced by disaster-prone countries in forging a new agreement at key United Nations climate talks in November ( COP26 ). But rich countries will continue to miss the longstanding pledge to US$100 billion a year for the next four years, according to an analysis by Oxfam International. Data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) released recently showed that the climate finance reached only US$80 billion in 2019. Data was not available for 2020, but the US$100 billion target is likely to be missed amid the economic damage wreaked by the pandemic. Oxfam last year revealed the true value of financing is US$22 billion-only a quarter of what developed countries had reported. Ahead of the 26th Conference of Parties (COP) in Glasgow, Scotland, negotiating blocs from developing countries have called the shortfall an "emotive issue" within the climate talks, that "damages trust" among parties. \</doc>

Oct. 13 Thimphu (Kuensel/ANN)- The Least Developed Countries (LDC) Group will call for increased funds and urgent action from developed countries at the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) that will be held in Glasgow next month. The group adopted the Thimphu Call for Ambition and Action on Climate Change during the ministerial meeting held yesterday in the capital that points to key priorities for the LDC group. Bhutan has been the chair of the LDC Group since 2019, and the meeting is the last under Bhutan's chairmanship. Chief of LDC Group at the ministerial level and National Environment Commission, Dr Tandi Dorji, said that the pandemic has hit everyone around the globe but the one billion people living in the 46 LDCs are the worst hit, facing the quadruple crises of climate change, poverty, health, and economic challenges that are outpacing the disease itself. He said: "Climate change, by contrast, has no vaccine and poses a threat that is exponentially larger and far less reversible, and ultimately existential, if we do not act now." Bhutan, leading the 46 countries for negotiation at COP26 , would emphasise that climate change requires an urgent and immediate action that is both ambitious and equitable to support the interests of the poorest and most vulnerable countries and people. The call for action and ambition states: "[LDC would] call upon parties, and in particular to the G20 countries to further enhance their NDCs in line with 1.5 degrees Celsius pathways and consistent with their responsibilities and capabilities to undertake climate action, in order to reduce the emissions gap to 1.5\'b0C." Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) embody efforts by each country to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Bhutan submitted its second NDC in June 2021, setting much more ambitious targets and without changing the country's carbon-neutral goal that it's had since 2009, and has been achieving thus far. However, the country has a shortage of funds to finance climate change-related activities. LDCs urgently call for developed countries to deliver on the commitment of USD 100 billion per year to address the needs of developing countries. They also emphasise the importance of addressing the impacts of climate change on agriculture and call upon parties to agree on a process to determine a new finance goal that matches the scale of climate finance needed to support climate action. The chair of the LDC Group in climate negotiations, Sonam P Wangdi, said that the COP26 must prioritise the issue of loss and damage caused by climate change. "Our people are suffering in a variety of ways as a result of a crisis that they did little to cause," he said. "It is now time to discuss how the international community can fairly address the loss and the damage manifesting in developing countries because of climate change." ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Nov. 17 Tokyo(The Japan News/ANN)- Britain, which chaired the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP26 ), expressed appreciation for Japan's additional financial support for a global decarbonization initiative. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Environment Minister Tsuyoshi Yamaguchi flew to Glasgow for the summit, where Kishida pledged that Japan would provide up to $10 billion (about \£51.1 trillion) in new aid over the five years for decarbonization efforts, mainly in Asia. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Japan's assistance was huge and would change the relationship of trust between developed and developing countries. Developed countries had earlier pledged to contribute $100 billion annually by 2020 to help developing countries adopt clean energy, but the amount had reached only $80 billion in 2019. The shortfall has provoked a negative reaction from developing countries. With the additional financial support announced by Japan and other countries, the goal is now expected to be achieved as early as 2022. Meanwhile, Japan proposed new international trading rules for greenhouse gas reductions, worked hard to coordinate among countries concerned and helped reach an agreement on the rules, which were the last task set by the 2015 Paris Agreement. "Countries fell in line with Japan's proposal," Yamaguchi said. "This is where we felt our greatest presence." However, Japan came under fire over the issue of coal, as it has a policy of continuing coal-fired power generation. An international nongovernmental organization gave Japan its "Fossil of the Day" award, which mocks countries that have shown reluctance to tackle global warming. At the ministerial meeting that started on Nov. 9, Britain and other European countries took the lead in calling for the abolition of coal. During those negotiations, the Japanese delegation did not reveal much about Japan's position, remaining largely silent and not making its presence felt. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 29 -- The UN-led process for global engagement to tackle the adverse effects of climate change - the Conference of the Parties, gearing up for its 26th iteration in Glasgow, Scotland or COP26 - has never failed to disappoint anyone putting far too much store by them. From Copenhagen (2009) to Paris (2015), two of the more serious attempts in a generation to try and hammer out some sort of agreement in which nearly 200 countries can appear to be on the same page, we have seen how ambition in the build up to a conference has sadly fizzled out by the time world leaders actually gather around a negotiating table. From there, what actually commences is a treacherous game of leaks and briefings by anonymous sources that ultimately share one common objective: the shifting of blame towards others, at least just enough to satisfy domestic audiences who actually can have a say in the political fortunes of an incumbent government. Most electorates around the world don't have the damage being wrought on the environment very high on their list of priorities - unless and until you are on the frontlines, the danger is too remote, the solution too intangible, the reward too distant. Success on the other hand demands statesmanship on the part of the leaders, on a scale and magnitude that even they may not claim credit for. Host governments, who proceed to take over the chairing of the process for one year, share an obvious inclination towards making a good fist of it, if only for the associative benefits that are expected to flow from a successful conference. And so it is understandable that the UK has been taking the lead all-year round really, and in fact for almost two years now, since COP26 was originally scheduled to be held at the end of 2020 remember, but had to be postponed due to the small matter of a global pandemic. Which, by the way, is far from being declared as behind us even today. But unquestionably we are far better placed today in relation to beating COVID-19 than we were 12 months ago. A common refrain during the pandemic on social media possibly, and maybe even some op-ed pages, has been that this pandemic has shown us "conclusively", in case there remained any doubt, that the world - meaning we, as a species - must change its way now, and not just discuss it but also now execute the course correction that is needed to move towards a more sustainable way of living, and that at the personal level, calls for a more considerate and sensitive relationship with the environment that we inhabit. As Christiana Figueres, the Costa Rican diplomat who spearheaded the process that led to the Paris Agreement as Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change from 2010-15, once said: "Doing all we can means taking action not tomorrow but today, because when it comes to climate change, thought without action is not only empty. It is profoundly irresponsible." As COP26 As Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has previously indicated, Bangladesh, despite its miniscule carbon footprint, is no longer willing to wait around to take its cue from countries that have been expected to take the lead in steering the response since at least Copenhagen. Last week again, writing in the Financial Times with a view to COP26 , she reiterated this position on the part of her government, even as she came down hard on the rich, industrialised countries for their perpetual dithering and delaying. "[W]ith COP26 Under the plan, she said, they will obtain 30 percent of energy from renewables by the end of the decade. The plan is expected to simultaneously prevent up to 6.8 percent of the economic damage that would otherwise come not only from climate change but also increasingly uneconomic fossil fuel infrastructure. "I believe more developing nations will adopt such plans in the coming months and years, led by members of the Climate Vulnerable Forum," Hasina wrote. "This year's COP26 summit in Glasgow is the best opportunity we will ever have to make one." Although recent net-zero pledges from the European Union, the United States and others are welcome, she said that the 100 billion U.S. dollars per year finance pledge made 12 years ago remains unfulfilled. "Nor is their repeated refusal to take seriously the needs of those nations most immediately affected. Agreement to support the poorest in dealing with the losses and damages caused by climate change is far removed from implementation," she continued. "If developed nations wish to help they must address this. Cutting the cost of capital will substantially accelerate decarbonisation across the global south, yielding worldwide benefits. If western leaders cannot see the logic of this, perhaps recent events in their own backyards will help - for what were the extreme forest fires seen in North America and Australia or Germany's recent lethal floods, if not alarm bells clanging in regions of the world most responsible for climate change?" she wrote. The pledge on renewables is from Bangladesh's updated Nationally Determined Contribution document, that was revised in August to reflect the country's realignment of priorities, in line with today's new reality. As part of one of the first concrete actions the government has taken to signal this shift, State Minister for Energy and Power Nasrul Hamid earlier announced the cancellation of plans for 10 coal-fired power plants that were a cornerstone of the government's previous Masterplan for the power sector. An "ambitious NDC" was named by British High Commissioner Robert Chatterton Dickson during an appearance at DCAB this week (see story), as one of the three things that the host government would be looking forward to receiving from Bangladesh during the deliberations in Glasgow. In the next section we turn to a discussion on some of the salient parts of the revised NDC. What's in the new NDC In August 2021, Bangladesh updated its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). The NDC sets a 22% cut of all heat-trapping emissions by 2030 compared with 2012. This is to be achieved through a wide range of mitigation measures in the energy, land use and waste sectors. The pledge outlines a series of mitigation strategies for the power sector in particular, such as increasing the share of renewable sources in the energy mix, which is currently negligible; reducing coal; and installing prepaid meters. It also looks to reduce traffic congestion, promoting non-motorised vehicles, shifting from road to rail and more. Crucially, it wants to invest in natural gas, as part of a strategy to offset more polluting fuels. "Taking the business and economic activities in 2012 as yardsticks," explained Mirza Shawkat Ali, the director in charge of the climate change department at the Environment Ministry, to environmentalist outlet The Third Pole. "We have calculated that [without interventions] Bangladesh would gradually generate nearly 410 million tons of GHGs in 2030." "Out of this projected total, we have proposed to cut 27.56 million tons, or 6.73% of emissions in 2030," Ali said. "We have also proposed a further 61.9 million tonnes, or 15.21%, of emission cuts, provided we get financial and technological support," he added. "Bangladesh contributes less than 0.5% to the global emissions budget. As a Least Developed Country we have offered our highest." According to Bangladesh's NDC, the energy sector accounts for about 55% of the country's emissions, followed by agriculture, forest and land use, waste and industrial processes. By 2030, the UN expects the energy sector to make up more than 76% of Bangladesh's carbon emissions. In 2009, the government estimated Bangladesh's per capita income to be USD 690 per year, while electricity coverage stood at 45%. This is the moment in the country's history when fossil fuels took centre stage, with heavy investments in coal, oil and gas. The strategy paid off. In 2015, Bangladesh became a lower-middle-income country and poverty declined from 44% in 1991 to 15% in 2016, based on the international poverty line of USD 1.90 a day. Boosting electricity generation helped Bangladesh achieve over 7% economic growth in 2019, and the country's GDP rose by 5.47% between July 2020 and June 2021, when the rest of the world's economy collapsed during the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, per capita income rose to USD 2,227. Bangladesh's official plan for 2041 seeks to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030 and acquire high-income country status around 2041. The government has set a target to increase installed electricity generation capacity to 40 GW by 2030 and 60 GW by 2041, of which 40% would come from renewable sources. While Bangladesh achieved remarkable success in key development indicators such as energy access, connecting nearly 100% of its population to the grid, up from 20% in 2000, its economy remains reliant on fossil fuels, notably on natural gas. According to the International Energy Agency, gas makes up over 60% of the total energy supply, complemented by oil, biofuels and waste, and coal. The fuel, which is less polluting than oil and coal, is also known as a 'bridge fuel', a way of reducing a country's emissions while allowing its economy to develop. As part of its NDC, Bangladesh is trying to replace as much coal and oil as possible with gas, to progressively reduce its emissions. The coming transition The country's obsolete power transmission and distribution network is a roadblock to energy transition. The distribution network is decades old, and would not accommodate more than 10% of renewable energy, according to M Tamim, the BUET professor who has served as consultant to a variety of different projects in the power sector over the years. What he is getting at is that Bangladesh's electricity distribution network is not equipped to automatically regulate power flows, which means that an electricity overload due to additional renewable energy at certain times of the day would burn transformers and power lines. Currently, Tamim explained, power officials resort to creating outages to control the power load, while a more advanced grid system could independently regulate the flow of electricity, making room for more renewable power. Upgrading the grid to deal with climate change, Tamim said, would cost a whopping $20 billion - at least. That is why even as Bangladesh enters this year's COP26 negotiations with a clear pitch for sustainable growth, making the case for a certain amount of fossil fuels in the energy mix to sustain the country's economy in the coming decades, and getting it ready for a deeper energy transition, it must not relent in hounding the rich nations for the $100 billion pledge they made 12 years ago, but have yet failed to produce. The prime minister bears this responsibility even more as the current chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, for which over 40 member countries will be looking to her to provide the kind of leadership that brings results for them all, and not just her own country or government. Richer countries agreed in 2009 to establish a $100bn a year fund to help transfer technologies and minimise climate risks in the developing world, but progress has been slow. Alok Sharma, president of the Cop26 conference, said this week he hoped the fund would be made available in 2023, three years later than planned, and many developing nations are reluctant to commit to accelerating their emissions reductions until rich ones meet their pledges. A Chinese environment official said this week that this was "the biggest obstacle" to progress in the climate talks. A leaked draft of the communique from a meeting of the G20 nations, taking place in Rome over the weekend before countries head over to the UK, calls in brackets for "additional climate financing". That suggests there is plenty of negotiating and wrangling and back-and-forth still to come on this issue. Redemption for BoJo? British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is part of a new generation of Conservative politicians in the UK who do put climate on the agenda, and locate a sense of environmental stewardship as part of a commitment to (small 'c') conservatism. And he is not even the first lead his country with that outlook. The rebranding of the Tories as a party that actually embraces more liberal positions on some social issues really started under David Cameron, the man who led the party back to government in 2010, after three successive election defeats at the hands of the Labour party. With the important role that host governments inevitably play in the success or failure of any conference, all eyes will be on Johnson in the coming days, to see if he can steer the difficult negotiations through to a worthy outcome. The man who is destined to be remembered as the man who led Britain out of the EU (he was one of the leaders of the Brexit campaign) has for that same reason lost some of his lustre on the international stage, that had accrued through two spells as mayor of cosmopolitan London. He can point to bona fides from his time as mayor for a track record of caring for the environment, and the woman he married after getting to 10, Downing Street, Carrie Symonds, is a committed environmentalist with what is rumoured to be outsize influence in decisionmaking, according to a disgruntled ex-aide. Johnson though, is nothing if not a creature of Westminster, and his actions in the coming days will most likely be dictated by politics that is local. Writing in The Spectator, a bastion of the British right in the more traditional sense (on climate change, they remain sceptical), the journalist Katy Balls this week noted how just a few months ago, the view inside Downing Street was that the COP26 summit would be £ national morale booster'. But now, according to Balls, "The headlines are about rail strikes, bin men running away from rats on rubbish-strewn streets in Glasgow and the Prime Minister declaring that recycling doesn't work." People are already associating it with failure, Balls reports, although names are not forthcoming. Starting Sunday, we will begin to find out if her sources are quite so immaculate.

This week, we welcome the world to the United Kingdom for the COP26 Summit. Our goal, the driving aim for the thousands of leaders, negotiators and activists meeting in Glasgow over the next two weeks, is to get us on track to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. Though it may not feel like it when the delegates arrive in Scotland in November, the world is already heating up. The ill winds of climate change are blowing through the smallest islands and the biggest megacities, causing wildfires to burn, crops to fail and seas to rise. Developing countries and small island states are bearing the brunt of the crisis, with whole communities forced to flee rising floodwaters or encroaching drought. The Caribbean had a record-breaking 30 tropical storms in 2020, including six major hurricanes. Last month, addressing a climate roundtable at the UN General Assembly in New York, Barbados' Prime Minister Mia Mottley called the hurricanes that rage with increasing regularity and ferocity over her island the 'heart attacks of the climate crisis'. She asked us to 'mind the gap' and address the shortfall in international climate finance, so that countries who have done least to cause climate change do not suffer the greatest effects. I listened in New York, and as hosts of COP26 I am determined that we will deliver in Glasgow. We have ensured, as a first step, that the countries on the frontline of climate change are in the room with the biggest emitters to negotiate face-to-face, with appropriate social distancing of course. The UK has provided COVID-19 vaccines for delegates from over 70 countries who otherwise would not have been able to get them and offered to cover the cost of any quarantine, meaning everyone can access a safe and secure summit. This is also the moment for the wealthiest nations to step up. The G20 group of the world's biggest economies will meet in Rome this weekend, and many of those same leaders will travel on to Glasgow for COP. I have personally lobbied almost all of them over the last few months, from Brasilia to Riyadh, Moscow to Tokyo, to increase their ambition and come to the table with credible new commitments. That means committing to reach Net Zero emissions by the middle of the century and taking bold action on coal, cars, cash and trees over the crucial next decade to 2030. On cash, we know that developing countries are looking at us to make good on the commitment of delivering $100 billion in international climate finance every year to 2025. A delivery plan commissioned by the UK COP Presidency and delivered by Canada and Germany this week showed that we know how we will get there, but disappointingly we are unlikely to meet the target next year without significant new commitments in the coming weeks. The UK Government has ringfenced \£311.6 billion in aid spending for climate finance from 2020-2025, and will continue to urge other governments to do more. Those funds are being used to transformative effect, saving lives by shoring up defences to tropical storms, supporting farmers to flourish in droughts and protecting forests and marine life. Climate finance is critical to help countries adapt to and mitigate the very real threats from climate change today. But public and private finance also needs to back the global transition to clean energy and sustainable, climate-resilient infrastructure, ensuring green technology drives economic growth in developing countries. I will admit - like many other economies, the great cotton mills and steelworks of the UK's industrial revolution were not, back then, powered by the mammoth wind turbines which now grace our oceans. But we are now a nation reformed. The cars that roll off the production lines in Britain's industrial heartlands are increasingly electric, and we have pledged to end the sale of all new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. Clean green renewable energy powers more than 40% of our electricity, supported by massive investment in wind, solar and hydrogen power. This new Green Industrial Revolution is supporting some of the most ambitious emissions reductions targets anywhere in the world, while helping to secure more than half a million jobs over the next decade. This is the future of the global economy, which is why the UK Government - from our Export Finance agency to our aid programmes - is backing major sustainable projects around the world, including roads and bridges that can withstand extreme weather, wind farms and solar power. We know that history will not judge us kindly if COP26 does not deliver a better future for everyone. When we meet in Glasgow next week, the UK will do everything in our power to ensure that this Summit is the moment we come together for our planet. \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 9 -- US Ambassador Miller visited US government's climate resilience projects in Cox's Bazar and traveled to St Martin's Island to assess the effects of climate change and learn about local adaptation efforts while COP26 continues in Glasgow, Scotland. " COP26 Ambassador Miller learned about severe coastal erosion and sea level rise on the island, the impact on local fisheries, the degradation of coral colonies, and local efforts to restore mangroves and protect shorelines, according to a press release issued on Tuesday. The United States has partnered with Bangladesh on many climate resilience projects in the Cox's Bazar and Teknaf area. The US government, through its Agency for International Development (USAID), has donated more than 140 renovated cyclone shelters to the Cox's Bazar district administration, including one on St Martin's Island, to protect residents from frequent natural disasters. Since 2001, USAID has constructed over 700 multi-purpose cyclone shelters that serve as both safe havens and as schools in Bangladesh. Additionally, USAID support has strengthened flood forecasting and early warning systems to provide residents life-saving time to evacuate to shelter. Ambassador Miller was joined by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) Secretary of the Maritime Affairs Unit Rear Admiral (retd) Md Khurshed Alam, MoFA Director (Americas) Syed Shah Saad Andalib, EU Ambassador Charles Whiteley, Japanese Ambassador Ito Naoki, Australian High Commissioner Jeremy Bruer, and Australian First Secretary -- Development Cooperation, Kate Sangster. USAID supports the Bangladesh Forest Service and local communities to co-manage forests and wetlands, including the Teknaf Wildlife Sanctuary, thereby protecting more than 1.8 million acres of critical ecosystems across the country. The US government also supports restoration projects for degraded landscapes and ecosystems within the Teknaf Wildlife Sanctuary. Prior to his trip to St Martin's, Ambassador Miller visited USAID climate resilience projects where US investments have helped farmers adapt new techniques to overcome soil salinity, use organic pest control, and plant new trees while protecting existing natural resources.

Dhaka, Nov. 6 -- Bangladesh has adopted a 37bn-dollar programme for mitigation of climate change damages along the country's coastal areas, State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Dr Enamur Rahman has said here. He said this at a COP26 side event organized by the ministry in Glasgow on Thursday afternoon, reports UNB. Climate change-related incidents displace about 50,000 people every year in Bangladesh, the minister added. In 2017 Bangladesh was the 6th most stricken country among 135 countries that experienced displacement due to floods, he said. The World Bank's Groundswell report also estimated that by 2050 19 million people of Bangladesh will be migrating internally due to slow onset climate change processes such as water scarcity, declining crop productivity and sea level rise. The Government of Bangladesh (GoB) recognizes that displacement has grave implications for the rights and entitlements of the individuals and communities. Bangladesh has framed its National Strategy on Internal Displacement Management in January 2021. "I am confident that COP 26 will be able to develop a mechanism for institutionalizing loss and damage," he said. "I am also hopeful that this year's COP will be able to introduce concessional instruments in case of climate finance," he added. Natural disasters are increasing in Bangladesh due to climate change, Secretary of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief Mohammad Mohsin separately told the UNB correspondent covering the event. He said Bangladesh highlighted the need for international funds to deal with the damages and loss caused by climate change.

Feb. 3\'e2\€  Tokyo(The Japan News/ANN)- The government will host an online international conference in February and March aimed at promoting the international trading of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Some 50-100 countries are expected to participate. In November, the 26th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP26 ) agreed a set of implementation guidelines for emissions trading. Japan has been working on its own trading system, the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM), which it hopes will become an international standard. Under the current emissions trading system, when an industrialized country provides a developing country with technology or funds to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a portion of that reduction can be counted toward the industrialized country's own emissions. Since 2013, Japan has signed JCM agreements with 17 countries in Asia, Africa, Central and South America, and other regions. Utilizing the technological capabilities of Japanese companies, Japan has implemented more than 200 projects in these countries to support the introduction of renewable energy power generation and energy-saving equipment. Participating countries are presently working toward implementing the guidelines agreed at COP26 , which was held in Britain. Japan's online convocation \'e2\€  to run on Feb. 17 and March 7 \'e2\€  is the first large-scale international conference to follow COP26 . It will convene with cooperation from Britain and Egypt, the latter of which will preside over COP27 later this year. The conference is expected to attract about 1,000 participants from various countries on both days. During the meetings, Japan will introduce the JCM mechanism, give examples of its use, and lay out the government's policy on sharing know-how with interested countries. Developing countries will have the opportunity to present the case for their respective support needs and Japan will call on developing countries to become JCM partners. \'e3\€ \€ "The widespread adoption of the JCM method will contribute toward global decarbonization," a senior official of the Environment Ministry said. "It will also lead to the development of a market in which Japanese companies with high-quality technologies and products can easily enter the environmental infrastructure field." ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 25 -- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday it was "touch and go" whether the upcoming United Nations COP26 global climate conference will secure the agreements needed to help tackle climate change. Britain hopes the summit in Glasgow, which begins on Oct 31, will adopt plans to help limit the rise in the average global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, reports Reuters. "It is going to be very, very tough this summit. I am very worried because it might go wrong and we might not get the agreements that we need and it is touch and go, it is very, very difficult, but I think it can be done," Johnson said during a news conference with children. Johnson, as host of the summit, has cast the meeting as one of the last major chances to slow rising temperatures and had hoped it would showcase his attempt at global leadership. Hopes of a major breakthrough deal at the summit were dealt a blow last week when the Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin would not fly to Scotland for the talks. There is also uncertainty over whether China's Xi Jinping will attend. "It's very very far from clear that we'll get the progress that we need," Johnson said.

Dhaka, Sept. 20 -- Preparations have been taken for COP26 to be held in Glasgow from 1-12 November. Bangladesh under its Premier Sheikh Hasina's stewardship has been taking an important leadership role on behalf of a coalition of vulnerable frontline developing nations. Prime Minister Hasina currently chairs the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), which is a coalition of 48 of the world's most climate-vulnerable countries. It has members across the developing world, including Africa, Asia and the Small Island states, and represents the combined interests of 1.2 billion people. In its high-level meeting last week in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, the CVF put the finishing touches to its pre-COP Manifesto, under the expert guidance of A.K. Abdul Momen, Bangladesh Minister of Foreign Affairs, and CVF Presidency Special Envoy Abul Kalam Azad. Also participating was Mohamed Nasheed, former President of the Maldives and CVF Ambassador for Ambition, and ministers and representatives from DRC, Grenada, Kenya, Ghana, Ethiopia and Marshall Islands. The CVF nations began by declaring that COP26 must go ahead, despite the continuing COVID pandemic, because of the urgency of the situation. "This is the most important meeting for the future of the planet and it cannot wait", the representatives declared. The nations also referred to the IPCC report, which warned that without drastic emissions cuts within this decade the world will be locked into a catastrophic warming outcome above the 1.5C limit agreed in 2015 at the Paris conference. With the situation so critical, the CVF is now calling for a 'Climate Emergency Pact' to be delivered at COP26 . This would include the long-promised $100 billion annual provision of climate finance for developing countries, split 50:50 between adaptation and mitigation. It would also include annual ambition raising platforms mandated for each COP, instead of the mechanism focusing on 5-yearly increases in ambition. This recognises that each year counts, and that postponing increased mitigation until after 2025 will certainly put the 1.5C goal out of reach. It was also agreed to form a CVF Climate Survival Leadership Group for COP26 , headed by Bangladesh Foreign Affairs Minister A.K. Abdul Momen, the incumbent presidency of the CVF. The initiating group includes the following eminent persons: Minister Casten Nemra of Marshall Islands, Commissioner Fekadu Beyene of Ethiopia, Minister Andrea Meza Murillo of Costa Rica, Deputy Prime Minister Eve Bazaiba Masudi of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Minister Simon Stiell of Grenada, Minister Keriako Tobiko of Kenya, Mayor Mohammed Adjei Sowah of Accra, Ghana, CVF Ambassador for Ambition President Mohamed Nasheed, CVF Presidency Special Envoy Abul Kalam Azad, and Managing Partner Professor Patrick Verkooijen, CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation. The work of the CVF under PM Hasina's leadership, and with the support of her Special Envoy Abul Kalam Azad, has been supported from cabinet, through the National Parliament - with the engagement of the Saber Chowdhury at the head of the parliamentary environment committee - through to the inputs of leading national experts, including, in particular, PKSF Chair Dr. Qazi Kholiquzzaman, Prof. Ainun Nishat of BRAC University, Dr. Mohammed Asaduzzaman of BIDS, Dr. Atiq Rahman of BCAS, and Dr. Saleemul Huq of ICCCAD, among others. This great team effort of Bangladesh deserves much kudos. Another issue given attention was one raised previously by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina: the issue of the unsustainable debt burden now held by climate-vulnerable countries. Following Bangladesh's call for this issue to be given better consideration, CVF leaders agreed to launch an Emergency Coalition for Climate Resilient Debt Restructuring. Working with other leaders in the CVF and the Bangladesh presidency, former President Nasheed of the Maldives is proposing $1 trillion in climate-debt swaps for our nations, to enable us all to protect infrastructure and reduce the damage and death toll from climate breakdown. Bangladesh has also been leading the way with the development of the Climate Prosperity agenda, where vulnerable developing countries strategically plan an investment pathway that combines robust socio-economic development with maximum ambition for zero-carbon economies. This country's Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan, named in honor of the Father of the Nation, Shiekh Mujibur Rahman, is blazing the way, but many other countries from Africa and South Asia are lining up to carry out their own Climate Prosperity Plan efforts. This visionary and ambitious leadership from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Foreign Minister Abdul Momen and Special Envoy Azad has made the CVF one of the big deal-makers of the upcoming COP. This is a critically important role as the world looks to this meeting as potentially the last chance to avert catastrophic climate change. Thanks to the actions of Bangladesh, the chance of success is much greater. (Mr. Arif Hossain is the Executive Director of Farming Future Bangladesh.

Oct. 18 Manila(Inquirer/ANN)- WIND POWER Ilocos Norte boasts of wind power farms along the coastlines of Bangui Bay facing the West Philippine Sea. These have inspired investors to build wind power farms on the coastlines of Burgos and Pagudpud towns.  WILLIE LOMIBAO MANILA, Philippines  A faster transition to renewable energy sources could present an opportunity for investments in the Philippines, as it works to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an envoy for the upcoming United Nations climate change conference. Weeks ahead of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Ken O'Flaherty, Britain's COP26 regional ambassador to Asia-Pacific and South Asia, said the Philippines should set a clear policy on energy transition to convince the private sector to invest more in clean energy sources. (See related story in Business, Page B4.) The United Kingdom holds the presidency of COP26 , scheduled in Glasgow, Scotland, from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12. Among the United Kingdom's goals is to press rich nations to deliver on their climate finance pledges to aid developing countries in climate action. 'Clear policies' But O'Flaherty said the vast majority of the needed money will come from the private sector. "What we're hearing from the private sector is that there is money to invest in the energy transition in Asia, including the Philippines," O'Flaherty said in an interview with the Inquirer during his visit to Manila this month. But he also pointed out the need for "clear policies by governments in this region, which set the investment opportunities and provide security [for] the investors." "If the Philippines will be able to set a clear net-zero goal by 2050, and is able to give more details on its plan for future regulation and activity on the renewable energy sector, I think it will be in a much stronger position to be attracting that capital," he added. Although the Philippines has several laws aimed at promoting the use of such renewable energy sources as solar, wind, and hydropower, it remains lagging in its commitments to reduce carbon emissions, which have intensified climate change. Dropping prices In April, the country committed to slashing by 75 percent its emissions by 2030. But the bulk of this commitment, known as the nationally determined contribution, is hinged on foreign aid and resources. "The renewables boom in Asia is creating new opportunities. Those countries that are investing in renewable energy and technology will have higher growth rates than those who do not," O'Flaherty said. "I hope the Philippines can take advantage of cheap, green, and clean renewable energy and I think that will power the Philippine economy for the decade ahead," he added. COP26 was initially set in 2020 but was postponed due to the pandemic. About 120 world leaders are expected to personally attend the summit, led by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and including US President Joe Biden.

When the world leaders gather in Glasgow, Scotland in November for the COP26 UN climate summit, they have a heavy responsibility to save the planet from climate disasters. The summit, the largest since Paris meeting in 2015, is seen to be critical in reducing the carbon emission to prevent the global temperature from further increase. At least 200 countries, mostly the rich developed nations (believed to be the biggest emitters) are expected to come with a brief to cut carbon emission significantly. The goal is to keep the global warming below or within 1.5C and to achieve this, gigantic steps have to be made. The task will not be as easy as it may sound. On the other hand, the world leaders, caught between the difficult task of cutting the emissions and keeping the economy running, will have to walk tight rope as they meet for the summit. The dilemma that the world leaders face in dealing with the climate change issues has best been illustrated by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. He had to change his decision against attending the summit in the face of criticism at home and abroad. Overcoming his initial hesitation, he announced last week that he would be attending. Australia, a large producer of coal and gas, has to cut down its emission heavily. But it faces the problem of suffering production loss for lack of enough energy. A cut in coal production may also lead to a hike the power price that eventually will push the prices of commodities up impacting adversely the living standard of the people. Like Australia, other big carbon emitting nations like China (a big producer of coal) also faces the prospect of economic slowdown. This particular difficulty in arriving at a consensus on reducing carbon emission to 1.5C has made the upcoming Glasgow summit so critical. In order to save the planet from climate disasters, the world leaders will have to act decisively even though it means initial setback on the economic front. The Covid-19 pandemic that has started waning in most parts of the world had a huge negative impact on economic growth with people losing jobs, factories underperforming and the poor getting poorer. But now that the economy is bouncing back from the pandemic losses, there has been an increased demand on fuel and power to run the economy fast. With the oil production, which slowed down during one and half years of the pandemic, returning to normal, there has also been a surge in the prices because the economy's demand has witness a massive leap. With the winter approaching in parts of the world, the demand for coal and gas is also growing. The rising fuel price is pushing the transportation cost up besides making the companies to spend more for production. This in turn has impacted the prices of the essential commodities with the ordinary people recovering from the pandemic miseries have started feeling the heat. This is happening in the United Kingdom. Prices are rising in Japan and China too. Bangladesh is also feeling the pinch as is evident by growing media reports that prices of the essentials from onion to edible oil to sugar are making daily living for the common people costlier. That's why we see the line before TCB trucks is getting bigger every day. Even higher middle class people are also being seen standing behind the TCB trucks. So, while the world, especially the most climate vulnerable countries like Bangladesh, will look forward the COP26 and its outcome, the world is passing through a difficult phase of making hard choices: Carbon emissions must be brought down to a tolerable level and at the same time the economy must also be allowed to grow unhindered. \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 15 -- Chinese President Xi Jinping will not attend the COP26 climate summit in person, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been told. Britain, which hosts the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26 , in Glasgow on Oct 31-Nov 12, is seeking to get big power support for a more radical plan to tackle climate change, reports Reuters citing The Times. "It is now pretty clear that Xi is not going to turn up and the PM has been told that," The Times quoted an unidentified British source as saying. "What we don't know is what stance the Chinese are going to take." The Times said British organisers fear that Xi's decision to stay away could be a prelude to China refusing to set new climate change goals amid an energy crunch. The Chinese embassy in London could not be reached for immediate comment. Xi, China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, has not left the People's Republic since the beginning of the novel coronavirus pandemic. He has joined video calls with global leaders. China is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter so Xi's absence from discussions - either in person or via video calls - would mark a setback for Johnson's hopes of getting world leaders to agree a significant climate deal. Xi, 68, who has served as General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party since 2012, attended the 2015 Paris climate conference. Britain's Queen Elizabeth has been overheard saying that she was irritated by world leaders who talk about climate change but then do very little or nothing to address the crisis. "Extraordinary isn't it. I've been hearing all about COP," the 95-year-old monarch told Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, the wife of her son, Charles, Prince of Wales and the presiding officer of the Welsh assembly. "Still don't know who is coming..." "It's really irritating when they talk, but they don't do," Elizabeth said in a conversation picked up by a microphone.

Bangladesh High Commissioner to the UK Saida Muna Tasneem has received the prestigious 'Diplomat of the Year 2022 Award' from world-famous Diplomat Magazine, UK , for her 'outstanding contribution to climate diplomacy.' The award was handed over to the High Commissioner by the Editor of the Diplomat Magazine, London recently at an annual gala diplomatic event at London's Biltmore Mayfair in the presence of over 250 London-based diplomats, said the High Commission on Thursday. The Diplomat Award of the Year is an annual award given out by Diplomat Magazine UK based on nominations and votes cast by UK-based envoys of more than 165 countries who maintain resident missions in London. This is the first time that a Bangladeshi diplomat has received such recognition in the UK. While giving out the Award, Editor of Diplomat UK Venetia de Blocq van Kuffeler said, 'High Commissioner Saida Muna Tasneem was recognised for her outstanding contributions and leadership in championing climate diplomacy in London in the lead up to the COP26 as well as for her sustained initiatives to strengthening Bangladesh-UK diplomatic relations.' High Commissioner Muna said, "It is a great honour for me and my country to receive this recognition, especially in climate diplomacy. I am extremely grateful to my peers, envoys based in London for finding me worthy of their nomination.' She also said, 'I owe this award to our Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina who has given me the opportunity to showcase Bangladesh's climate diplomacy in London during the crucial year of COP 26 and Bangladesh's Climate Vulnerable Forum Presidency.' Muna receives 'Diplomat of the Year 2022 Award' in London The High Commissioner said the Prime Minister has not only been the voice of the vulnerable and a most influential climate leader at the COP 26 but also inspiration and a teacher in their learning of climate diplomacy. After receiving the award, the High Commissioner dedicated it to millions of climate migrants and victims of climate catastrophes in Bangladesh and the rest of the world. Now in its twelfth year, the annual 'Diplomat of the Year Award' is considered the highest-profile and most prestigious accolade for diplomats in London and is a key platform for peer review for diplomats from more than 165 countries based in London.

Dhaka, Oct. 15 -- A group of environmental activists from around Europe will head to the Cop26 summit in Glasgow on board a specially chartered "climate train". Around 500 people, who will also include representatives of the rail industry and policymakers, will set off from Amsterdam on October 30, reports news agencies. The journey has been billed as "Rail to the Cop" and is organised by Youth for Sustainable Travel, who sailed across the Atlantic Ocean in 2019 to join Cop25. After leaving Amsterdam they will travel via Rotterdam and Brussels to London, before taking an Avanti West Coast train to Glasgow. The organisations behind the climate train, who include parts of the European rail industry, say they want to promote rail transport as an alternative to aviation. Delegations from the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium will be on board. Mara de Pater, chairwoman of Youth for Sustainable Travel, said: "It is a unique opportunity to have all these different groups together on the train. "We organised a programme on the train to bring the different expertise and perspectives into discussion in dialogues and workshops. "The core theme in these sessions is fair and sustainable transition in the travel industry." She added: "However, at the moment, air traffic is much more attractive than the train due to legislation and regulations. "Airlines, for example, hardly pay any taxes, whereas train companies do."

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other leading multilateral development banks (MDBs) have issued a high-level joint statement affirming their commitment to mainstreaming nature into their policies, analysis, assessments, advice, investments, and operations. The statement, which was launched at COP26 in Glasgow, recognizes the critical role nature's ecosystems and biodiversity play in supporting the planet and people's health, well-being, and livelihood. The MDBs pledged to work together to support a sustainable, inclusive, green, and resilient post-COVID-19 recovery that upholds each bank's respective environmental, climate, economic, gender, social, and institutional sustainability standards, supporting green growth and jobs. The statement was also endorsed by the African Development Bank, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Caribbean Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, European Investment Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank, and World Bank Group. They have agreed to work together to consider a common approach to defining nature-positive finance, building on the MDB climate finance tracking methodology. "The Asian Development Bank?recognizes that protecting nature is?essential?to?addressing climate change and building prosperity for all,' said ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa. 'We endorse this common agenda to mainstream nature across our operations," he said. It is estimated that at least 28% of the $11.2 trillion in development finance institution investments in 2019 are highly exposed to the risks of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. The MDBs agreed to better work to understand this risk and tackle the drivers of nature loss and climate change by fostering and making 'nature-positive' investments. In his remarks at the MDBs' roundtable discussions in Glasgow, Mr. Asakawa said nature-positive investments will be key in contributing to ADB's recently announced ambition to provide $100 billion in cumulative climate financing from 2019-2030, including $34 billion dedicated to climate adaptation and resilience. The joint statement supports the need to better value nature so that natural capital is given weight equal to that of other measures of national wealth, such as gross domestic product, exports, and government revenues. \</doc>

Global leaders gathered in Rotterdam to participate in the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) high-level dialogue have said the climate emergency demands policy shift to adaptation The dialogue titled 'An Adaptation Acceleration Imperative for COP26 ' held in Rotterdam, Netherlands on Monday. Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen represented Bangladesh in the dialogue. With less than a hundred days to go until the world's most significant summit on climate change, the dialogue established that the success of COP26 will be determined by whether, for the first time, climate adaptation is elevated to an equal priority with the mitigation of carbon emissions. Patrick Verkooijen, the CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation, who convened the dialogue, said they are now living in the eye of the storm - £dapting the world to our climate emergency is essential for our safety even as we tackle a global pandemic'. "From now on, we're fighting a battle on two fronts: we have to fight to slash emissions while investing the same level of energy to adapt to a global climate emergency. Millions of lives and the safety of communities around the world are already at stake.' Over 50 leaders from the international climate and development community attended the dialogue which concluded with a communique adopted in the presence of the dialogue's co-conveners, chair of the Board, 8th Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation, Patrick Verkooijen, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva and UN High-Level Climate Champion on Private Sector for COP26 , Feike Sijbesma. The recent report from the IPCC warned a major worsening of climate impacts is coming a decade earlier than previously anticipated with unprecedented and irreversible changes. It highlighted that certain impacts, such as extreme heat spells, would double in scale over the next decade, demanding unprecedented acceleration and investment in adaptation and resilience to counteract the growing climate emergency. 'We should be very clear that there is no issue with the Paris Agreement itself. It has been exactly the framework we needed, if only it could be lived up to. What we need to do is rebuild confidence and trust to work together under the Paris regime," said Ban Ki-moon, 8th Secretary-General of the United Nations and Chair of the Global Center on Adaptation. He said countries are ready for new ambition on adaptation, and they are ready for much scaled up financing for adaptation too. "For this, solutions already out there need to be shared and put into place.' Ban Ki-moon noted that the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP), created by GCA in partnership with the African Development Bank and backed by the African Union, serves as a template for the ambition and approach that needs to be scaled across all regions of the world. President of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Chair of the African Union, Felix-Antoine Tshisekedi said at the peak of the corona pandemic, there was a collective political will, by all countries, to address the crisis. He also announced that, under the auspices of the African Union, he will chair a Leaders Event for friends of Africa's adaptation during COP26 . The event, jointly organized by the African Union, GCA and the African Development Bank, will catalyse the acceleration of action, financing and partnership necessary to achieve a transformative shift in adaptation on the ground in Africa. Mark Rutte, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, in opening the day's proceedings noted yhat the time to move forward on adaptation is now. "In the run up to COP26 , we need to translate our ambitions into firm action, planning, financing and implementation.' COP26 : Ambition: adaptation ambition must be fully aligned with science and the realities of the climate emergency and must be constantly raised year on year in a pathway that COP26 can establish. Finance: clear delivery on the UN-agreed annual $100 billion where financial flows for adaptation must be a on a par with financial flows for mitigation and the leveraging of pandemic recovery resources for maximum climate benefit including considering partial channelling of the $650 billion of newly allocated IMF Special Drawing Rights. Partnerships: Forge the partnerships necessary to deliver and mainstream bold climate adaptation action over the next decade as countries continue to grapple with the growing climate emergency building on the examples of GCA, African Development Bank and African Union's Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program. Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, who chaired the meeting, spoke about how finance is integral to adaptation ambition: Accelerating climate action in emerging markets and developing economies requires the international community to continue to deliver on the $100bn pledge made in Paris, and even more. "As part of these efforts and following the IMF's historic allocation of $650 billion of Special Drawing Rights [SDRs], including around $275 billion to low- and middle-income countries, we are discussing with our members the possibility of channelling some of these SDRS into creating a new Resilience and Sustainability Trust. This Trust could help vulnerable countries undertake the necessary transformational reforms to address climate and other structural challenges," said Kristalina. Amina Mohammed, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations said they need massively scaled-up investment in adaptation and resilience. "This is absolutely critical for those at the frontlines of the climate crisis. Yet, only 21 per cent of climate finance is channelled to adaptation efforts." Of the $70 billion that developing countries need now to adapt, only a fraction is being provided. Adaptation costs to the developing world could rise to as much as $300 billion dollars a year by 2030, Amina said. Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank Group echoing her remarks said that the African Development Bank's share of adaptation finance has increased from 49% in 2018 to 55% in 2019 and 63% in 2020. In closing remarks, Feike Sijbesma, UN High-Level Climate Champion on Private Sector for COP26 , and Co-Chair of the GCA, said adaptation is everybody's business. "We must think about how we can integrate businesses better into our adaptation and resilience-building efforts; and at the same time encourage a constructive role for the private sector in supporting adaptation efforts by governments and non-government actors.' \</doc>

Speakers at a recent webinar have warned that it would be extremely challenging for Bangladesh to come out of fossil fuel so soon and suggested making aggressive efforts to develop renewable energy and its storage capacities as well as ensuring efficient use of energy. They also suggested launching storage technology-based pilot projects to gradually reach a state that would facilitate using renewable energy round the clock. Energy and Power magazine in collaboration with SREDA and GIZ organized the webinar on ' COP26 Outcome and Its Implication on Energy Transition of Bangladesh' as part of a series titled 'EP Talks'. The speakers stressed on the need for expediting national preparedness towards achieving sustainable development through ensuring security of energy that would be clean, friendly to the environment. And, whatever achievement the country may be able to achieve must be kept well-documented with real time data so that the country can produce it as a case before the global community like climate change conference. Abul Kalam Azad, Special Envoy of Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) Presidency and President of Bangladesh Energy Forum took part in the discussion as chief guest while Mohammad Alauddin, Additional Secretary and Chairman of Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA), attended the talks as special guest. Dr. Nurul Quadir, former Additional Secretary and Climate Negotiator as well as a faculty of North South University, presented the keynote paper. Engr. Mohammad Hossain, Director General of Power Cell, Md. Ziaul Haque, Director of the Department of Environment and Climate Negotiator, Dr. Mizan R Khan, Deputy Director of International Climate Change and Development, Independent University, and Engr. Al Mudabbir Bin Anam, Program Coordinator of GIZ, Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Program (REEEP) phase 2, attended the event as panelist. EP Editor Mollah Amzad Hossain moderated the webinar. Mr Azad said the Mujib Climate Perspective Plan has set a target to develop a Mujib Energy Hub offshore Bangladesh where there is a prospect for generating around 20,000MW of wind power. An initiative has already been launched for resource mapping. He said introduction of the net metering system has facilitated commercialization of rooftop solar power installations. Higher success could be achieved in this regard through creation of greater awareness among the trade bodies and banks. People of the low-income group can also become self-reliant through selling power to the grid from the Solar Home System (SHS) with net metering. Work on emerging technologies like hydrogen and nitrogen energy should also start by now. Mr Azad also pointed out that greater enthusiasm is now being observed amongst all about energy and climate change. For the first time after threadbare discussion, a meeting of minds could be arrived at COP26 about fossil fuels and coal. But final agreement could not be reached. Bangladesh has pledged to increase contributions of renewable energy. But it cannot be achieved on a stand-alone basis. Active consideration is being given to import of hydroelectricity and solar power through regional collaborations. One of the milestone achievements of the COP26 was that the countries including developing ones have agreed to submit updated status of NDC every two years. Active participation of the world leaders was also very encouraging. Commitments for limiting global warming below 1.5 degree Celsius and providing US$ 100 billion to the climate fund were also other milestones achieved in the climate change conference. Good works must be carried forward for better preparation for the COP27. That would facilitate better knowledge-based preparations for planned negotiation in COP27, he said. Mr. Alauddin observed that COP26 has created a great awareness across all communities. We have achieved significant success in solar, but will have to give priority to import of hydropower. We have to proceed with the master plan. Five programs of energy efficiency as included in the PSMP are under implementation. Use of energy-efficient products would facilitate a great deal of limiting carbon emission. SREDA is also working on limiting use of primary fuel. Given the potential of solar power, he said concentrated solar may not be a feasible option. Rather, we can review the possibility of solar heating application and warming water using solar power. Engr. Mohammad Hossain said it has been mentioned that we have to increase activities on RE developments four times from the present level for achieving the targets set in the NDC. Now the total contribution of RE is about 700MW. If we take it four times, it stands at 2,800MW and would make no visible impact on carbon emission reduction. The developed countries in fact have to take greater initiatives. Bangladesh would, of course, dedicate its efforts within its capacity. The climate perspective plan is at a very nascent stage. Increasing four times the contribution of RE is very much possible. Initiatives have already been launched for increasing solar power generation and evacuating to national grid following bringing the entire country under the power coverage. Some far flung islands and char areas have been connected to the power grid through submarine cables. Process is ongoing for evacuating another 100MW of solar power to the grid soon. Agreements have also been signed for generating power from municipal wastes. Municipal wastes are sources of environmental pollution. Generation of power from it has multi-faceted benefits. We also have potential for generating power from offshore wind. We are focusing on hydropower and solar potential. We are the initiator of the power supply chain under the SAARC framework. Our Prime Minister has championed it. Taking on board the Indian perspective, some adjustments have been made through discussion in the forum. Now the Indian energy trade outlook is far more favorable for regional trading. Greater possibilities have now emerged for importing hydroelectricity from Nepal and Bhutan. Works are advancing for importing 500MW hydropower from Nepal. Stress is being given on energy efficiency for achieving Net Zero 2050 targets. The success of Bangladesh in COP26 is commendable. Bangladesh, encouraged from the world vision of phasing out coal, shelved 10 coal power projects. This has been acclaimed in COP26 . The declaration adopted at the COP26 was based upon among others four proposals of the Bangladesh Prime Minister. The loss and damage issue was also discussed at great length. Mr. Ziaul Haque pointed out that this was the first time that 45% carbon emission reduction by 2030 was established as a figure for limiting global warming at 1.5 degrees C by 2100 as a mitigation measure. But every country has to work sincerely on the NDCs towards achieving the emission restriction target. Even if the NDCs submitted so far are 100% achieved, the emissions would increase by 13.7% by 2030. The NDCs are weak and were discussed at length during COP26 . A working group has been created for devising a program on how much realistically emissions can be reduced by 2030. This group would submit recommendations on reduction of emissions by 2030 towards achieving the 1.5 degrees C global warming limit by the end of the millennium. It was also decided that countries would submit updated status of NDC achievement every two years for possible achievement by 2024. Bangladesh's achievement in NDC is mainly in energy. It would assist Bangladesh a great deal in getting international assistance if it can demonstrate achievement in mitigation. A good decision of 50:50 share on adaptation has been taken. We have worked on all options like solar, hydro, new hydro and wind for reducing emissions by 2030. Achievement of the target would be easier if we can start working on nitrogen technology as per the Mujib Perspective Plan. Dr. Mizan pointed out that for the first time in COP26 , all parties have agreed to phase down coal. Other fossil fuels would also come under scanner soon. Diplomacy is a factor there. Bangladesh may be severely impacted if liquid fuel is phased down soon. It would affect remittance. Creation of the Energy Transition Council is another achievement of COP26 . Discussing South Asian energy diplomacy, he said Bangladesh is promoting multinational energy trading. India is a key player here. Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal under the BBIN initiative are working on multinational energy collaboration. But the progress of energy and water diplomacy is not encouraging yet. Talks with the ADB are going on for financing a 1100 MW hydropower project targeted for sharing among four nations. But the progress is not encouraging. Multicountry sharing does not go with the ultra-nationalistic strategy of India. It appears that India is traveling back to two-nation theory. This is a stumbling block to regional energy collaboration. Engr. Mudabbir said that though not all expectations were fulfilled yet, COP26 made significant headways in some areas. Bangladesh could maintain its strong position in discussions. The Prime Minister and Chief of Climate Vulnerable Forum Presidency had a very effective role. Giving top priority to energy security, we must direct all actions. Our energy transition must be efficient and sustainable. The supply and price of fossil fuels would remain volatile. At the same time, the demand would continue to grow at geometric progression. Efficiency of RE is increasing and the cost is reducing. It is encouraging that the initiative for energy efficiency of Bangladesh is growing. We need to increase our energy efficiency to greater extent for making our development sustainable. For this, required actions and comprehensive planning are essential. For the first time this year, a comprehensive power and energy system master plan is being formulated. We hope that energy transactions would create dynamism in the development process. GIZ has been working on renewable energy and energy efficiency in Bangladesh for over 12 years. Dr. Nurul Quadir observed that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C would be possible if only all countries submit enabling NDCs and commit to implement it. Main focus of carbon emission was coal. But Phase Out had to be compromised to Phase Down for steep resistance from India and China. But relevant organizations could not be persuaded to pledge for reducing subsidies on inefficient fossil fuel use and concerned countries pledged for expediting phase down of coal. Adaptation for the first could be discussed extensively. Initiative could be launched for setting targets for adaptation. For this, plans have been made internally and at international levels. Assurances have been achieved for all out support to developing countries. Dedicated funds for loss and damage could not be sourced. It was supposed to be committed in COP26 . But it is encouraging that all agreed to extensively discuss over the next two years. A positive outcome is expected in 2024. The pledged US$100 billion fund every year has not been made available. But for the first time, major polluters could be brought under obligations. The Paris Rulebook could be finalized and all agreed to it. All agreed to submit a 5-year plan. Pledge for US$ 4 million for initiating works on loss and damage is an achievement of COP26 . This would assist greatly in advancing works in COP27. Bangladesh submitted an updated NDC to the UNFCCC for total (unconditional and conditional) reduction of 90 million tonnes of GHG emission by 2030. Bangladesh does not have an obligation for reducing GHG emissions though. Now Bangladesh has to proceed to achieve it. The plan and implementation strategy of the power and energy sector in the unconditional segment of reducing emission appears realistic. Bangladesh needs to prepare a comprehensive data base of emission reduction. Presenting the real time achievements would facilitate getting international financial assistance for implementing planned targets in the conditional segment. \</doc>

Oct. 5 Dhaka(The Daily Star/ANN)- The most important climate talk at the highest political level since the Paris climate conference in 2015 is set to take place in Glasgow, Scotland this year, from October 31 to November 12. This is the 26th Conference of Parties ( COP26 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This is not only the largest global climate summit, but also the largest global event as the sheer existence of the world will depend on the outcome of this year's conference. This climate summit carries a lot of significance for Bangladesh. The country is highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change, regularly experiencing floods, cyclones, storm surges, droughts, and other extreme climate events. Bangladesh faces the risk of sea-level rise due to global warming. The severity of the impact of climate change has already been scientifically proven. The sixth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), published in August 2021, has projected various scenarios to indicate where the world stands right now in reaching its targets for reducing the rate of global warming, and what it means in terms of the impact of global warming. The intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation and the severity of droughts and heatwaves due to the warming of the Earth will be insurmountable. Some of the consequences of climate change, such as melting ice sheets, rising seas, loss of species, and acidic oceans will be irreversible. The findings of the IPCC assessment report are far more bleak than ever, and a wake-up call for the global leaders to take meaningful actions. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. The significance of COP26 originates from the commitments of COP21, held in Paris in 2015. At the Paris summit, countries agreed to bring down their carbon emission levels to limit the rising temperature below 2 degrees Celsius, to adapt to the climate impacts, and to make funds available to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement is a legally binding commitment. However, the countries agreed to reduce emissions voluntarily by setting their emission reduction targets in their national plans. This is termed as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which spell out how much the countries would reduce their emissions. They also agreed to review and present their updated reduction plan every five years. Bangladesh, along with other climate vulnerable countries, has active interest in the outcome of COP26 Second, scaling up climate finance is urgently needed, so that vulnerable countries can make higher investments into reducing the risk of climate change with better adaptation schemes. Besides, vulnerable countries like Bangladesh have to invest in renewable energy and make such energy accessible to the poor. Unfortunately, the pledges made by the developed countries to mobilise USD 100 billion per year by 2020 remains unfulfilled. At the 76th United Nations General Assembly this year, the US committed to increase its contribution to climate finance by 2024. Earlier, a number of other developed countries also made pledges to increase their contributions to climate finance. However, there should be new pledges by the developed countries for the vulnerable countries. Experts and various climate action groups called for a minimum of USD 500 billion during 2020-24. Of course, a much bigger amount is needed. The commitment to increase the fund contributions is only one part of the story. For Bangladesh, accessibility of the climate fund is also challenging since a significant part of this fund is in the form of loans and non-concessional instruments. Third, Bangladesh and other climate vulnerable countries need more financing for adaptation. Regrettably, the climate fund is more focused towards mitigation, which is used mostly by the developed countries who emit GHGs more. Mitigation funds comprise 75 percent of the total climate finance, and are mostly used for energy and transport sectors. Least developed countries are not responsible for creating the problem of climate change, but are the worst victims of its negative impacts. Bangladesh has been successfully tackling various climate-related challenges with limited resources, and often with indigenous technologies. However, given the enormity of the problem, the country needs to enhance its adaptive capacity and strengthen its resilience. This will require higher resources and technology transfer to make a successful green transition. Moreover, we must keep in mind that the Covid-19 pandemic has put additional pressure on climate vulnerable countries. The pandemic is considered to have increased inequality not only within countries, but also among the countries. Therefore, without enhanced finance, these countries will face difficulty in recovering from the fallout of the pandemic and build their economies better. Fourth, Bangladesh also expects that the details of the Paris Rulebook are finalised at COP26 , so that the accountability of the activities of all countries is established. Three important components of the rulebook are: a) Guidance to facilitate global stocktaking for assessing collective progress on the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement; b) Establishment of a five-year time frame for NDCs by the countries, instead of a 10-year time frame, so that the progress can be tracked more often and measures can be taken accordingly; and c) Finalisation of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which sets rules for carbon markets in a way that financial support for adaptation is made available and human rights are safeguarded. This is important, since credible and tangible emission reduction is critical for environmental integrity. Fifth, the mechanism of loss and damage should be established. At COP19 in November 2013, the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts was established. The objective was to address loss and damage associated with the impacts of climate change in vulnerable developing countries. Article 8 of the Paris Agreement reaffirmed the Loss and Damage Mechanism as the main vehicle under the UNFCCC process for addressing the issue. The demand for loss and damage has been a long-standing issue. The developed countries have been resisting the idea. Along with the concerned global citizens, Bangladesh also recognises that failure to deliver on the climate commitments by global leaders in Glasgow will be devastating for the present and future generations. Leaders have expressed their hope for a positive outcome. The world is eagerly waiting to see how the fate of climate vulnerable citizens is determined at COP26 .

Dhaka, Nov. 18 -- Facebook advertisers promoted false and misleading claims about climate change on the platform in recent weeks, just as the COP26 conference was getting underway. Days after Facebook's vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, touted the company's efforts to combat climate misinformation in a blog as the Glasgow summit began, conservative media network Newsmax ran an ad on Facebook that called man-made global warming a "hoax." The ad, which had multiple versions, garnered more than 200,000 views. In another, conservative commentator Candace Owens said, "apparently we're just supposed to trust our new authoritarian government" on climate science, while a US libertarian think-tank ran an ad on how "modern doomsayers" had been wrongly predicting climate crises for decades. Newsmax, Owens and the Daily Wire, which paid for the ad from Owens's page, did not respond to requests for comment, reports Reuters. Facebook, which recently changed its name to Meta, does not have a specific policy on climate misinformation in ads or unpaid posts. Alphabet's Google said last month it would no longer allow ads that contradict scientific consensus on climate change on YouTube and its other services, though it would allow content that discusses false claims. Facebook generally does not remove misinformation in posts unless it determines they pose imminent real-world harm, as it did for falsehoods around COVID-19. The company says it demotes posts ranked as false by its third-party fact-checkers (of which Reuters is one) and prohibits ads with these debunked claims. It says advertisers that repeatedly post false information may face restrictions on their ability to advertise on Facebook. It exempts politicians' ads from fact-checks. Asked about ads pushing climate misinformation, a company spokesperson said in a statement: "While ads like these run across many platforms, Facebook offers an extra layer of transparency by requiring them to be available to the public in our Ad Library for up to seven years after publication." UK-based think-tank InfluenceMap, which identified misleading Facebook ads run from several media outlets and think-tanks around COP26 , also found fossil fuel companies and lobbying groups spent $574,000 on political and social issue Facebook ads during the summit, resulting in more than 22 million impressions and including content that promoted their environmental efforts in what InfluenceMap described as "greenwashing HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/slowly-european-regulators-turn-up-heat-greenwashing-2021-11-04 https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/slowly-european-regulators-turn-up-heat-greenwashing-2021-11-04 One ad paid for by the American Petroleum Institute panned over a natural landscape as it touted its efforts to tackle climate change, while BP America ran an ad detailing its support for climate-friendly policies in neon green writing. "Our social media posts represent a small fraction compared to the robust investments our companies make every day," the API said in a statement, saying the natural gas and oil industry was committed to lowering emissions. BP said in a statement that it was "actively advocating for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing, through a range of transparent channels, including social media advertising." Facebook has started adding informational labels to posts about climate change to direct users to its Climate Science Center, a new hub with facts and quizzes which it says is visited by more than 100,000 people a day. HYPERLINK https://reutersevents.com/events/rbs-usa https://reutersevents.com/events/rbs-usa event where he thought Facebook still fell short on climate issues, Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer said, "Obviously, there's been concern about people sharing misinformation about climate on Facebook." He did not directly answer why Facebook had not banned all climate misinformation ads but said it "didn't want people to profit over misinformation." EMPLOYEES QUESTION POLICY The documents were among a cache of disclosures made to the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress by whistleblower Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager who left in May. Reuters was among a group of news organisations able to view the documents. In the comments on an April post highlighting Facebook's commitment to reducing its own environmental impact, including by reaching net zero emissions for its global operations last year, one staff member asked if the company could start classifying and removing climate misinformation and hoaxes from its platforms. Two external researchers working with Facebook on its climate change efforts told Reuters they would like to see the company approach climate misinformation with the same proactiveness it has for COVID-19, which Facebook cracked down on during the pandemic. "It does need to be addressed with the same level of urgency," said John Cook, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Climate Change Communication Research Hub at Monash University who is advising Facebook on its climate misinformation work. "It is arguably more dangerous." Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Dhaka, Nov. 12 -- The 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP) is currently being held at the SEC Centre in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom - and during the conference, 'Nonajoler Kabbo' (The Salt in our Waters), the maiden directorial venture of young-aspiring Bangladeshi filmmaker Rezwan Shahriar Sumit, was screened on November 8, Monday. Depicting an epic cultural confrontation in Bangladesh's climate change and an elemental battle of land and sea, man and nature functioning as an interactive setting for a dramatic meditation on tradition and modernity, alongside the struggles and stories of fishermen living in coastal areas of Bangladesh and the effects of climate change at its entirety, the film was screened on an 80 feet IMAX Theatre at Glasgow Science Centre, the official venue for the COP26 Green Zone, at 6 pm local time. Rezwan Shahriar Sumit, also the writer and producer of the film, travelled from Bangladesh to Glasgow for the screening. From Glasgow, Sumit expressed his feelings with the Bangladeshi press via a video message, regarding this special occasion. "Nonajoler Kabbo depicts the struggles and stories of Hilsha-fishermen and their families living in the coastal areas of Bangladesh, who have been gradually losing their everything due to the havoc of climate change. We need to make the conversation on climate change and make it a pivotal part of our regular conversations, and we are hopeful that our film will help people to get through the actual reality so that we can be aware and take necessary measures to save our planet," Sumit said at the event. 'Nonajoler Kabbo' stars Fazlur Rahman Babu, Shatabdi Wadud, Titas Zia, Tasnova Tamanna, Ashok Bepari and others, while the music is directed by popular singer-composer Shayan Chowdhury Arnob. The film is scheduled to be released in Bangladesh on November 26, 2021. Co-produced by Rezwan Shahriar Sumit and French producer Ilann Girard, 'Nonajoler Kabbo' has won several national-international awards and grants, including the NETPAC Award (Best Asian Feature) at 26th Kolkata International Film Festival in 2021, TFL Audience Design Fund 2020, Bangladesh's National Film Grant in 2017, CNC Aide aux cinemas du monde 2018, and Spike Lee Writing Grant 2016, to name a few.

Nov. 18 Tokyo(The Yomiuri Shimbun/ANN)- Following the conclusion of the U.N. climate summit, where measures to combat climate change were center stage, nations will likely face various challenges associated with such efforts going forward. This series will explore what a future decarbonized society might look like based on initiatives being rolled out around the world. Poland's Belchatow power plant, the largest coal-fired power plant in Europe, generates about 20% of the electricity consumed in the country. In June, the company that owns the power station announced that by the end of 2036 it would close the plant, which is located in the middle of a forest on the outskirts of Belchatow, a city about 150 kilometers from Warsaw. In coal-rich Poland, coal-fired power accounts for 70% of all electricity generated  the highest ratio among the 27 EU member states. In February, the Polish government announced that it would introduce renewable energy sources and nuclear power plants in areas where coal is a key industry, with plans to invest an amount equivalent to \£51.7 trillion. About 100,000 people work in Poland's coal industry, with about 10,000 people involved in jobs linked to the Belchatow power plant, including those working in nearby coal mines. The company intends to gradually reduce the number of employees as workers reach retirement age. "I'm worried about jobs for young people," said a 72-year-old who worked at the power plant and in the mines for 25 years. "After the plant is closed, there will be no reason for them to stay in the region." During the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP26 ), a statement committing to shift away from coal power generation was signed by 46 countries and regions, including Poland. Britain, which chaired the conference, had originally called for advanced countries to end coal power by 2030 and for other countries by 2040. However, these targets were softened in the Nov. 4 statement to "the 2030s" and "the 2040s," respectively. Bearing in mind Poland is not a member of the Group of Seven industrialized nations or the Group of 20 advanced and emerging economies, Adam Guibourge-Czetwertynski, Poland's deputy minister of climate and environment, told The Yomiuri Shimbun that the situation will vary from country to country. Although the statement is not legally binding, Poland is expected to aim to end all coal power generation by the late 2040s. The electricity and heat production sector, which includes coal, is a large source of greenhouse gas emissions, along with the transportation sector. China depends on coal for more than 60% of its power generation and India for more than 70%. Japan relies on coal for about 30% of its power generation. Japan, the United States, China and India did not sign the Nov. 4 statement. The Glasgow Climate Pact was adopted at COP26 on Saturday. While an earlier draft used the expression "phase-out" regarding coal power, the language was softened and revised to "phasedown" at the last minute, because of objections from China and India, both of which are highly dependent on coal. At a press conference Sunday held after the closing of the climate summit, COP26 President Alok Sharma failed to hide his frustration. "In terms of China and India, they will on this particular issue have to explain themselves to developing countries," he said, as climate change is most seriously felt by such countries. The accessibility of energy sources varies from country to country and region to region, whether the issue is fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas, renewable energy or nuclear power. The question is how to move toward the common goal of realizing a decarbonized society, and how to find a realistic solution based on the different situations in each country.  Industries' burden The shift toward a coal-free economy presents a heavy challenge to Japan's manufacturing industry. A trial of a steelmaking technology that utilizes hydrogen has been underway since 2013 at East Nippon Works Kimitsu Area in Kimitsu, Chiba Prefecture, the core facility of Japan's largest steel company Nippon Steel Corp. A test furnace jointly developed with the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) and others is located in an enclosed area surrounded by 20-meter-high metallic walls. To prevent the outflow of technology, even people involved in the project are strictly restricted from accessing the area. According to an industry source, the technology could change the 150-year history of modern steelmaking. The basic process of steelmaking involves mixing coal and iron ore at very high temperatures, which produces a large amount of carbon dioxide. But in so-called hydrogen reduction steelmaking, iron ore is reacted with hydrogen and only water is discharged. The iron and steel industry accounts for 40% of carbon dioxide emissions generated by the industry sector in Japan. Hydrogen reduction steelmaking technology is expected to be a key asset in the industry to reduce emissions. However, commercialization of the technology does not appear to be close. The test furnace has succeeded in cutting carbon dioxide emissions by just 10%. With conventional furnaces, it is possible to reuse heat generated in the steelmaking process to generate power at the plants, but with hydrogen reduction steelmaking, heat is lost during the reaction so plants have to secure other power sources. It is said that it costs \£51 trillion to construct a conventional furnace. Nippon Steel estimates the research and development cost of the new technology at \£5500 billion and the cost of renewing facilities at \£54 or \£55 trillion. The company plans to raise steel prices and ask its suppliers and consumers to bear part of the cost, but it is uncertain whether it will gain their understanding. The company might be reluctant to invest a huge amount of money as the main objective of the project  decarbonization  is not directly related to the improvement of its products. The demand for steel products such as electromagnetic steel sheets used in electric vehicle motors and the basic structures of wind turbines for wind power generation is likely to increase worldwide. The huge costs involved in the shift away from coal might give competitors an edge in terms of price. "We should obtain public understanding first and then create a system that allows society as a whole to bear the cost," said Eiji Hashimoto, chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel Federation and president of Nippon Steel. The government is considering creating a system to make it easier for financial institutions to fund the development of new technologies, among other issues. How should funds be raised to pay for the transition to a decarbonized society? A road map is needed as soon as possible. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

The Bangladesh delegation led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at COP26 , including government officials, cabinet members and climate experts, remains hopeful of attaining two victories at this year's conference, as the second and final week commences at the Scottish Exhibition Centre. The first is an agreement on limiting the rise in average temperature from pre-industrial levels to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Secondly, a renewed pledge from the developed, industrialised countries - those who historically have damaged the climate most - to provide funding of USD 100 billion to the developing countries to deal with the effects of climate change. The latter is a promise first made in 2009, at COP15 in Copenhagen. It remains unfulfilled to this day. Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Shahab Uddin told UNB they were hopeful of some success in this year's COP conference. 'We hope that the leaders at this year's conference will agree on the issue of keeping the (rise in) temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius and developed countries will keep the promise of funding USD 100 billion for the climate change crisis. Though the leaders of some countries have not agreed, the discussion is moving positively and we hope that the opinion will be in our favour,' he said. He said Bangladesh strongly demands the developed countries to update their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) - each country's plan for dealing with climate change - with targets of limiting the rise in temperature to 1.5 degrees or 2 degrees (maximum) Celsius, reducing high rates of carbon emissions and to deal with greenhouse gases according to the countries' climate plans. The minister said the Paris conference had pledged funding of USD 100 billion each year from the developed countries to reduce emissions on carbon. Although it has not been finalized yet, the discussions are still 'positive'. Meanwhile, at an event in the Bangladesh Pavilion of Glasgow on Friday afternoon, the Minister said that Bangladesh submitted its updated NDC to the UNFCCC on August 26. It has been learned that the implementation of Bangladesh's NDC will require USD 32 billion as unconditional contribution and USD 143 billion as conditional contribution by 2030. Member of the Bangladesh delegation and climate expert Dr Atiqur Rahman told UNB that one of the issues in countries affected by climate change, like Bangladesh, is loss and damage. The issue of reducing temperature to 1.5 degree Celsius and getting developed countries to provide the funding of USD 100 billion, promised in 2009, have received positive responses so far. 'But whether the countries that bear historic responsibility for climate change (industrialised nations) will take the responsibility and keep the promise of funding USD 100 billion, can only be ascertained towards the end of the conference,' explained Dr Atiqur, recognized by the UN as a Champion of the Earth. \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 1 -- First, are EVs adequate for all countries? Will the world's poorest countries transition to e-mobility, or will they be left behind? Second, if EVS become popular in in high-income countries, what does that mean for the poorest countries in terms of natural resource extraction, fossil fuel exports, and/or country indebtedness? These questions are key, especially given the growing green divide between high- and low-income countries. High-income countries are historically responsible for most global emissions. The G20 countries contribute four-fifths of global emissions and want a high-tech solution to transport decarbonization. The world's poorest countries are the least responsible for climate change. They are most impacted by climate change and could be left behind in the drive for high-tech transport. The Sustainable Mobility for All (SuM4All) partnership-in conjunction with the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the Climate Compatible Growth program-is looking at these questions from the perspective of the world's poorest countries, and will present them in a discussion paper at COP26 . Countries with a low-carbon, universal, and reliable electricity supply, and with access to finance, are best suited to an electric transition. Where two- and three-wheelers are common, little new grid investment is needed, and where cars dominate, chargers and some grid strengthening are required. Where grid strengthening is necessary, there is an opportunity to reduce emissions in the transport sector and improve economic and business models. Countries in the Global South are diverse. In countries with weak electricity supplies, a fleet of EVs could strain the grid and drain electricity from industries and households. However, with coordinated action, EVs can underpin demand that de-risks new renewable energy investment. EV battery integration could also help stabilize unreliable grids. But without careful planning, a move to EVs could potentially cause deep economic damage. Fossil fuels are associated with taxes and subsidies, which present a challenge and an opportunity. For instance, most sub-Saharan African countries subsidize fossil fuels to protect consumers- at a huge fiscal cost. EVs will reduce this consumption, freeing those subsidies to be spent elsewhere. Tax flows on fossil fuels need to be repackaged into new systems that replace lost taxes by other means, such as road pricing. The high demand for fossil fuels for transport is expensive and feeds energy insecurity, because of the need to import fuels. Electromobility offers savings from cuts in oil imports, which will often more than pay for investment in new vehicles, charging systems, electricity grid strengthening, and renewable electricity supply systems. It will also lower the lifecycle cost of ownership. However, even with lower fuel imports and longer lifecycle business models, finance remains a barrier. Upfront investment costs in electricity systems and EVs are relatively high, although they are much lower than the lifetime costs of ICE vehicles and oil imports. This is problematic, because neither (micro-level) operators nor (macro-level) governments have the financial access to invest simultaneously in both power supplies and EVs. The right kind of instruments and support are critical, as is packaging it appropriately, so that developing countries can get access to the financing needed to move to zero emissions. Transport affordability, passenger safety, and better access to facilities all need to be considered in the EV model. A careful roll out of electromobility will result in better economic, business, and societal outcomes. However, if the transition to EVs in the Global North continues as now, old ICE cars will simply be shipped to the Global South. This may meet short-term needs, but it will lock in high fuel costs, accelerate emissions, and slow the collective action needed for the transition to climate-smart mobility in the Global South. A successful transition to EVs demands management across agencies. New, integrated supply chains (for electricity, maintenance, etc.) will need to be set up, and no single policy can bring about the systemic change required. Such a change will require new regulations and policies, as well as strong government leadership. It is important to think about the most useful policies and regulations and how best to strengthen institutions. Effective policies and strong institutions are needed to promote business on the demand side and secure investments on the supply side. Underlying this is an appropriate enabling environment. In many countries, weak regulations exacerbate past problems. Capacity-building and support for national environmental management agencies and ministries, and strong vehicle emission standards, will encourage the adoption of new EVs. Electromobility requires new materials, including batteries, charging infrastructure, new electricity generation and distribution infrastructure, and more. An inability to source critical materials delays uptake. Countries will need different sources for supplies-both materials and labor-to put all the moving parts together. If skills and materials are not well managed, the Global North may inadvertently monopolize scarce skills or materials and lock the Global South out of the transition to EVs. Or the North could create demands in the South that do not simultaneously support the investment needed for clean materials supply and processing, which could slow modernization. If well managed, though, new extractive industries in the South, part of a global EV transition, could be a basis for clean industrial growth. The discussion paper with the research findings will be released at COP26 in Glasgow on Wednesday, November 3. The paper is the culmination of a year of research and discussions between academics and practitioners from the SuM4All partnership, supported by consultation with low-income countries. We invite you to join us in this conversation by registering for the launch event.

The Glasgow climate conference cannot be undermined by any means in terms of holding it in an adverse condition due to COVID-19 pandemic. There is also a broad-based consensus that finalization of the Paris Rule Book with a Carbon Market Mechanism is a big achievement of the COP26 . A consensus on a target to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial level by 2100, instead of the previous goal of restricting it well below 2.0 degrees C level as agreed in the Paris climate conference, is another achievement of the just concluded conference of parties (COP). The major polluters like G20 countries were taking part in the discussion on limiting the temperature rise, but hardly coming up with any practical plan to achieve the target. The civil society organizations and environmental experts thought that their (G20 leaders) remarks during the discussions were not sincere enough or had no real meaning. The experts also considered that the G20 would not even come up soon with a proper plan in this regard. Different science reports, including the latest one of the IPCC, have apprehended that unless it is possible to cut global emission by 45 percent within 2030, the global temperature would increase by 1.9 degrees C and it might rise up to 2.7 or 3+ degrees C. The UNFCCC in a synopsis report on the NDCs submitted so far said that the global emission would increase by 13.7 percent within 2030 even if the NDCs are fully implemented. The CSOs and climate activists criticized that the major polluting countries raised their voice in favor of the 1.5 C target, but on the other hand they were working on ensuring sustainability of the fossil fuel business in the longer term. There is no doubt now that the dirtiest fuel coal will remain alive until 2050. It has also become clear by now that other fossil fuels like oil and gas would dominate the entire century unless there is any major technological discovery to meet the growing energy needs. Unlike previous COPs, the countries, however, recognized in Glasgow the looming dangers of climate change as predicted in the first part of the 6th IPCC report. But the major polluters are yet to submit their updated NDCs with emission cut ambition to the UNFCCC. Post- COP26 experts' analyses suggested that almost all the countries of the world are now suffering from climate impacts like floods, droughts, cyclone, wildfire, heavy snowfall and ice melting. It also put increased pressure on the politicians of the respective countries.Leaders of major polluting countries have started realizing the importance of the Loss and Damage issue. But many have raised concern that it may not be possible to restrict global warming not even below 3 degrees C by 2100 if major polluting countries cannot immediately plan and execute emission reduction. In the Glasgow summit, the major polluting nations did not submit ambitious NDCs, not even reacted positively towards its requirements. Major polluter China mentioned about reaching Net Zero by 2060 and another top polluter India informed about achieving Net Zero by 2070. But they also did not submit detailed plans for these. Experts, returning home from Glasgow, are meeting in post- COP26 discussions. Achievements and failures are being discussed threadbare. Based on the outcome of these discussions, a report would be prepared. Dr. Fazle Rabbi Sadeque Ahmed, Deputy Managing Director of PKSF and climate expert, observed that COP26 was the talk of the world following a year of global shutdown for COVID and shuttle diplomacy of the UK Presidency. Hence the expectations were sky high. But every major action needs money and resources. But not many encouraging decisions could be reached. Arrangement of a US$100 billion fund every year till 2023 has become uncertain now. Discussions have been launched for raising US$200 billion from 2025 each year, increasing it by US$100 billion over the next 5 years. However, the Paris Rule Book could be finalized through reaching agreements on market and non-market mechanisms under article 6. Major polluting nations for the first time agreed to discuss financing for Loss and Damage. Dr Rabbi thought that discussion in the COP is a continuous process. In every event some progress is achieved and the COP26 is not a difference. Dr. Mushfiqur Rahman, environment expert, observed that financing is a major challenge for emissions reduction and not many achievements were made here even in COP26 for overcoming the loss and damage of climate disasters. It is being said that some pledges would be met in 2023. But how much would that be? How would Bangladesh get finance even if the total required fund is pledged? These need extensive discussion. Secretary of Power Division Md Habibur Rahman mentioned in the post- COP26 discussion of SREDA that achieving net zero by 2050 is a major challenge. We are moving in the positive direction though we have no obligation. Power and energy sectors have major obligations for reducing emissions. Our achievement as per previous NDC was over 5%. According to the updated NDC, our unconditional emission reduction target is 6.73%. For the 15% conditional reduction target achievements, there is no alternative to accessing international finance. But developed nations have not yet committed enough money to the fund where from this finance can be accessed. The time limit has been extended in COP26 . Debate has ensued about RE targets by the Mujib Perspective Plan 2041. We are working on a RE contribution up to 40% by then. ATM Mostafa Kamal, Additional Secretary of Power Division, opined that highly populated China, India and Bangladesh cannot achieve the same level of success in non-carbon energy development like the less-populated Western European countries. Those developed countries have attained the pinnacle of development where the developing nations are endeavoring to reach. We have rights for creating emissions for continuing the development process. According to SDG, we do not only need to ensure supply of power and energy to all, we also have to ensure supply at affordable cost. Consequently, in consideration of the present technical innovations, we cannot but remain dependent on fossil fuels for quite sometimes into the future. But by adopting state-of-the-art modern technology, we are trying to reduce emissions as much as practical. Works are continuing on Energy Efficiency and Conservation. Achieving global finance would add impetus to our endeavors. DG of Power Cell Engr. Mohammad Hossain mentioned that Bangladesh entered the highway towards clean energy, shelving 10 coal power projects ahead of COP26 and mandating 'Phase Down" of coal power. But this has created risk for generating low cost power. Truly, no country in the world has become 100% RE dependent till now. Consequently, if not on coal, Bangladesh would continue to remain dependent on natural gas and oil for a considerable time into the future. 95% mitigation work needs to be done in the power sector for reducing emissions. Bangladesh by preparing action plans is going ahead with implementation. But not much encouraging response for global finance could be derived from the COP26 . Engr. Al Mudabbir Bin Anam of GIZ said political leaders charted a roadmap for reducing emissions. We all have to work to reach the end of the road. Bangladesh has to work with a mission for achieving Energy Efficiency. Dr. Nurul Quadir, Former Additional Secretary, in another post- COP26 discussion said some successes like Paris Rule Book finalization, increasing finance in adaptation, finalization of stocktaking and reporting were achieved in COP26 . But pledges for putting together US$100 billion every year in the climate fund have been deferred. Discussions about below 1.5 degrees C global warming limits have gathered momentum. There are frustrations regarding pledges for submission of ambitious NDCs by the major polluters. Consequently, there is genuine concern about achieving Net Zero by 2050. Ziaul Haq, Director of the Department of Environment (DOE), considered COP26 a success. Global stocktaking for reducing emissions from 2023 is a major milestone. Some 161 of the 197 countries submitted updated NDCs. But even if these are achieved 100% by 2030, emissions cannot be reduced by 45%. Rather it would increase by 13.7%. This remains a serious concern. Emeritus Professor Dr Ainun Nishat observed that the door for implementation of the Paris Agreement could be opened through finalization of article 6 in COP26 . The IPCC report got due attention in discussion in the COP. The host country can be given 6 out of 10 for their arrangements. The 1.5 degrees C warming limitation target has been recognized. These achievements would pave the way for stronger parleys in COP27. Ultimate success would not be achieved if appropriate planning for reducing emissions and access to financing cannot be ensured. Prof Saleemul Huq, Director of International Centre for Climate Change and Development, thought the achievement about Loss and Damage though marginal, yet it was an encouraging beginning. The CVF played an important role for this. Mirza Shawkat Ali, Director of the Department of Environment (DOE), pointed out that it is essential to monitor individual country contributions to the climate fund. Beginning of contribution to Loss and Damage fund is an achievement though not a major contribution has been made. 100 countries and 40 large automobile manufacturers have pledged to get rid of Internal Combustion Engines by 2040. It is a milestone achievement. Talks have ensued for doubling the contribution to the climate fund from 2025. The above observations of experts indicate successes achieved in the COP26 in different areas. But the major concern is hesitations of major polluting countries coming up with specific ambitious NDCs for restricting global warming below 1.5 degrees C by 2100. The primary target is reducing global emission from 50 giga tonnes to 32 giga tonnes by 2030. An analysis on the 161 NDCs submitted evidence that even if these are 100% implemented, this would rather increase emissions by 13.7% than reduce it by 45%. Different analysis evidence that 'phasing down' instead of 'phasing out' of coal would lead to continued use of coal till 2060 or 2070. No decision was taken even for reducing use of natural gas and oil. No roadmap could be worked out for reducing subsidies on fossil fuel use. Unless the civil society, experts and other pressure groups can stress the 20 major polluters in coming up with specific ambitious NDCs for limiting emissions soon, global warming instead of getting restricted to 1.5 degrees C would rather increase beyond 3 degrees C. However, some optimism has been created at COP26 . But at the same time concerns have intensified about uncertain future successes. World community has to keep fingers crossed for COP27. A trusted global community would be able to create required pressures on developed nations in taking right plans for reducing emissions and committing enough financial, technical, technological assistance towards developing, least developed and climate vulnerable nations for combating climate. The bottom line is actions, not words are necessary for the crossroads of human civilization. \</doc>

Nov. 1 Jakarta(Jakarta Post/ANN)- Managing climate change is the greatest challenge of our time, and the 26th United Nations Conference of the Parties in Glasgow, Scotland better known as COP26  represents a milestone in the world's efforts to take concerted action. Six years after the landmark Paris Agreement, nations are taking stock of the progress they've made on previous commitments, including their promises to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change. While the policy work continues, the question that many senior executives of corporations will ask is, "What do we do after COP26 ?" The first thing they'll have to do is recognize that with all the attention on climate change this year, things are speeding up in some key areas. First, regulations. Carbon-taxation and emissions-trading schemes will expand, and the price of carbon (already above \€ 60 per ton in Europe) will probably rise. Governments will promise more subsides to spur change, like the United States Department of Energy's Energy Earthshots initiative, which is designed to reduce the cost of green hydrogen. Second, financial disclosure. Companies will face more requirements to report on their climate risks. The International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation is laying the groundwork for a set of common reporting standards, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission is considering climate-change disclosures. Third, science-based targets. More companies will set ambitious decarbonization targets and sign onto the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), the gold standard for tracking these goals. More companies are including Scope 3 emissions in their plans. Fourth, scrutiny from investors. Sustainability, and climate change in particular, will become even more important for investment decisions. Fund managers are responding: the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative brings together 128 fund managers with US$43 trillion under their care in a pledge to make investment decisions that support the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. Fifth, customer expectations. Pressure from customers is leading more companies to look beyond their own operations and across their supply chains and use of their products. BMW plans to reduce carbon emissions across the entire life cycle of its vehicles, from production through ownership, by at least 40 percent by 2030. Most important, the focus is going to shift from setting targets to delivering results. Until now, executives may have been rewarded just for stating goals; from here on, they'll need to show real reductions. Here are four concrete things they can do to start reducing. First, make carbon transition a pillar of strategy. Too often, sustainability and carbon transition come as afterthoughts, but they should be baked into the strategy practice. The risks and opportunities of climate change should shape decisions about new products and how to improve operations. UK supermarket leader Sainsbury's is making carbon reduction a cornerstone of its strategy, with pledges to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions to net zero by 2040, and to cut Scope 3 emissions by 30 percent by 2030. Among many changes, it has switched to energy-saving lithium-ion pallet trucks. Second, get more bang for your net-zero buck. Companies are pushing their carbon transitions as rigorously as any other business initiatives, which means improving efficiency while reducing cost. German engineering and technology firm Bosch says it has been carbon neutral in Scope 1 and 2 emissions since 2020, thanks to greater energy efficiency. And it's also about finding opportunities to monetize investments in sustainable technologies. Mexican cement producer Cemex sells a line of concrete that contains 70 percent less carbon, and it offsets the rest of the related emissions to deliver a carbon-neutral product. Third, embed carbon transition into the fabric of the business. Even the best plans will fall flat without the right supporting practices. Pricing, incentives, and tracking are three practices that help carbon transitions stay on track. Pricing. More and more companies price carbon internally, like any other cost of doing business. More than 2,000 companies representing $27 trillion of market capitalization have embraced it, with a median price of $25 per ton CO2 equivalent in 2020. Incentives. Linking compensation incentives to carbon-reduction efforts keeps them on the agenda. French food producer Danone, for example, ties 20 percent of senior executives' annual compensation to social and environmental targets. Tracking. New software systems extract data from enterprise resource planning and other corporate systems, then calculate the precise carbon footprint and issue progress reports. Fourth, avoid the hourglass effect. In many companies, top management and new employees are enthusiastic about sustainability, while middle management is left to solve the revenue, cost, and safety implications. Many have little or no experience managing carbon reduction, but companies can support them by educating everyone about carbon reduction in their industry and clarifying the rules for trade-offs. The transition away from carbon and toward net-zero emissions is likely to be a top priority for many executives for the rest of their careers. For most companies, the window for consideration has closed. It's time to act and deliver meaningful carbon reductions. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Apr. 22 SINGAPORE (The Straits Times/ANN)  Developing energy systems that produce little or no planet-warming emissions may be the current focus of many countries, but young people today are also keeping an eye on how such developments could affect biodiversity and human communities. Ms Swati Mandloi, a youth delegate who attended COP26 , the United Nations' climate change conference in Glasgow held last November, said during a panel discussion organised by The Straits Times (ST): "We need to account not just for the carbon that enters our atmosphere... but also look at the wider ecosystem implications." The discussion, which aired on Earth Day on Friday (April 22), revolved around the theme of whether surging energy costs would spark a global rethink about the dependence on fossil fuels, and the current challenges of speeding up the adoption of renewables. The roundtable was moderated by Mr Warren Fernandez, ST editor and editor-in-chief of SPH Media Trust's English, Malay and Tamil Media Group. The other three panellists included Dr Victor Nian, an adviser at the Centre for Strategic Energy and Resource, ST climate change editor David Fogarty, and ST environment correspondent Audrey Tan. The pursuit of renewable energy to reduce carbon emissions can sometimes have a negative effect on the biodiversity in an area and carry tremendous social cost, case studies have shown. For example, the construction of dams can displace indigenous communities from their lands, said conservation group International Rivers on its website. Ms Swati, who is also a member of the Singapore Youth for Climate Action and World Wide Fund for Nature's Singapore's climate and energy team, added: "People often say the 'S' is silent in environmental, social, and governance (ESG), and that's for a reason because accounting for social impacts of energy systems can get overlooked really easily. ESG is a system measuring the sustainability of a company, investment or decision in three specific categories: environmental, social and governance. Moreover, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), a conservation charity, also noted on its website that the construction of dams can harm river dolphins, such as the Irrawaddy dolphins found in rivers in South-east Asia, such as the Mekong. "Poorly planned dams often reduce dolphins' food supply, change water quality and destroy habitats. As dams are constructed, the dynamite and noise can harm river dolphins. Once the dam is up, increased boat traffic can lead to more injuries and deaths from collisions," said the WWF. Ms Swati said: "So for (young people), it's extremely important that we don't let go of this opportunity where we can create more robust systems of accountability when we measure energy alternatives." She added that as the world moves toward a future less reliant on fossil fuels, workers that are well-versed in various areas are needed. Said Ms Swati: "We need people who understand environmental impact assessment aspect, how businesses interact, and how policies work on it, and then how to price that in a financial market... Green jobs need to be cross-sectoral." Dr Nian said that when it comes to sustainability, various sectors , from policy to industry and academia, needed to come together to come up with sustainable solutions, he added. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home \</doc>

Kohler Company is working toward achieving a Net Zero environmental impact by 2035. Clarke Energy's recent appearance at the United Nations Conference of the Parties (UN COP) event in Glasgow, Scotland helps support that initiative and more. Clarke participated in the delegations of the Association for Decentralized Energy (ADE) and the World Biogas Association (WBA), with the goal of supporting methane emission reduction, hydrogen economy and flexible power. Globally, Clarke Energy has supplied over 7GW of gas-engine fueled power generation capacity. This is typically deployed in a combined heat and power (CHP) configuration - generating power at efficiency levels up to 90%. 1.4GW of this power is renewable and largely deployed on biogas and landfill gas applications. Hydrogen Economy The hydrogen economy had a high-profile position at the conference particularly with respect to the decarbonization of global gas supplies that currently rely heavily on fossil natural gas. Hydrogen as a fuel source is being supported by legislation or initiatives in the UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States. Clarke Energy has already developed successful experience of using hydrogen mixed with carbon monoxide as a waste gas fuel at furnace sites in South Africa. Now the focus is on conversion of CHP plants and flexible gas engine peaking stations to operate on hydrogen as a gas. Flexible Power Flexible generation was a focus at COP26 as it will be a key enabler to the widespread deployment of renewable energy. With the growth in intermittent wind and solar power, alongside the closure of large base load power stations such as coal and nuclear, global power networks are becoming more and more unstable. There is a technical need to supply flexible power installations that either generate dispatchable energy or alternatively can time-shift power with technologies such as battery energy storage systems or renewable fuels such as biomethane or hydrogen. This is an area where Kohler is developing a range of new solutions including gas peaking stations - large grid connected power plants that can engage at short notice, to large battery energy storage plants or alternatively smaller localized microgrid technologies to support commercial buildings, industry and campuses. Methane Emission Avoidance On November 11, a high-profile pledge was made from 100 nations to slash global methane emissions. The US and China committed to boost climate cooperation over the next decade including planning to slash methane emissions. Methane is a "super-warmer of the atmosphere" and can be emitted from a range of sources linked to human activity including from decomposing waste at landfill sites, from wastewater and from agricultural wastes. When methane is emitted in this way it is typically called 'biogas' or 'landfill gas'. Using biogas for power generation is something Clarke Energy has excelled at over the last 30 years delivering more than 1.4GW of renewable electricity from biogas globally, and more recently biomethane. Alex Marshall, Group Business Development and Marketing Manager joined the World Biogas Association's delegation and secured coveted access to the 'Blue Zone' of the conference and was invited to speak at the Kenya Climate Change Working Group Association on avoiding emissions from short-lived atmospheric pollutants such as methane, black carbon, ozone and hydrofluorocarbons. Alex provided practical examples of how Clarke Energy is delivering methane reducing projects globally in countries such as Kenya, India, the United States, France, Romania and Greece. By continuing to boldly innovate in products and applications and acquire synergistic businesses, Kohler and Clarke are well positioned to support the transition to net zero. We are supporting global power generation networks, helping deliver resilient supplies of power, generating renewable energy and to support the push to reduce global methane emissions. \</doc>

Bangladesh and the United Kingdom are planning to sign a "climate accord" before COP26 and expressed optimism for a successful outcome of the COP26 with a possible CVF- COP26 event at Glasgow. The two countries agreed to work together to put nature at the heart of their climate action, building on the 2020 Leaders' Pledge for Nature and realising shared commitments towards conservation of biodiversity and ecosystems, as well as those under the Global Ocean Alliance and the Commonwealth Blue Charter. As founding members of the Adaptation Action Coalition, Bangladesh and the UK renewed their commitment to work together with other Coalition members to accelerate adaptation on the ground with a particular emphasis on promoting locally led climate action, according to a joint statement issued on Thursday. The two countries will do more to avert, minimise, and address Loss and Damage, said the joint statement on climate action between the two countries. Bangladesh and the UK will work together to get the network operating, following the UK-led Climate and Development Ministerial and drawing on the expertise in the UK, Bangladesh and internationally. Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen and COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma met on Wednesday during the visit of COP26 President-designate to Bangladesh on June 2-4. They jointly reaffirmed their commitment to enhancing cooperation between Bangladesh and the United Kingdom in tackling climate change's causes and adverse effects. They agreed to demonstrate sustained leadership to tackle the climate emergency bilaterally and globally. The two countries agreed to exchange expertise, share technology, facilitate partnerships, and identify practical solutions to common climate challenges. They expressed their resolve to work together to contribute to ensuring all countries meet their commitments under the Paris Agreement, and improve the resilience of those most vulnerable to climate change. The two countries reaffirmed their strong and steadfast commitment to strengthening implementation of UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. They recognized the urgent need to make ambitious and accelerated efforts to limit average temperature rises to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, strengthen adaptation to the impacts of climate change, and scale up finance and support towards these ends. They called for increased climate action in the lead up to the COP26 Summit, which will be held in Glasgow in November keeping in consideration the development needs of individual countries. They highlighted their commitment to achieving an ambitious outcome at COP26 , including through finalising the outstanding mandates of the Paris Rulebook. The COP26 The COP26 President-Designate welcomed the prospect of Bangladesh transitioning away from coal to clean and renewable energy, which will create economic growth and sustainable jobs. The Foreign Minister of Bangladesh underscored the necessity of securing commitments from global leaders, especially the G20, to curb global emissions substantially, arrest global temperature at 1.5 degrees, secure maximal climate finance especially for adaptation and concrete actions on low-carbon technology transfer. Bangladesh is committed to submitting an ambitious updated NDC in coming weeks, with a Net Zero target in the near future. The UK COP26 Presidency and Bangladesh recognise the importance of developed countries delivering their collective climate finance goal to jointly mobilise US$100 billion annually by 2020 through to 2025 from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral and in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation, to address the needs of developing countries. COP26 President-Designate welcomed Bangladesh's proactive leadership as the President of the Climate Vulnerable Forum and voicing the existential threats and extreme climate risks faced by 48 of the most climate vulnerable countries. He welcomed Bangladesh's Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan and Decade 2030 for capturing growth and prosperity through maximal resilience. The Foreign Minister commended the UK's dynamic leadership of COP26 and their special focus on mitigation, adaptation and resilience, climate financing and international cooperation. He also praised the UK for being the first major economy to declare Net Zero emissions by 2050. \</doc>

COP26 President-designate Alok Sharma will visit Bangladesh this week to discuss shared priorities as Bangladesh is considered one of the "crucial" partners on the road to COP26 . He will also travel to Viet Nam and Indonesia as part of his South East Asia and South Asia tour to strengthen support for UK COP26 climate priorities ahead of hosting the key UN climate change summit in Glasgow this November. With less than six months to go before COP26 , he will meet with leaders from government, business and civil society to press his personal priority for a move to global clean power, critical to limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C. Viet Nam, Indonesia and Bangladesh are fast-growing economies with significant renewable energy potential, said the UK government announcing his tri-nation visit. The visit will highlight their growing leadership and how the UK Presidency will work with countries to support workers and communities to make the transition to good green jobs. It builds on the recent Climate and Environment Ministerial meeting where, under the UK's leadership, G7 nations agreed to end all new direct government support for international coal power, and to increase support for clean energy alternatives like solar and wind. COP26 President-designate Sharma to visit Bangladesh this week G7 nations also agreed to work to increase the quantity of finance for climate action in order to meet the $100bn per annum target to support developing countries. Sharma will discuss the needs of countries most vulnerable to climate change, to ensure they are equipped to deal with its current and damaging effects ahead of COP26 . Preventing deforestation whilst ensuring development and trade is sustainable will also be high on the agenda, as COP26 looks to highlight the protection of nature and biodiversity as a key tool in limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C. Ahead of his visit, Sharma said last week the G7 made history with a major step forward towards consigning coal to history and moving to a decarbonised power system but tackling the climate crisis must be a global effort, which leaves no one behind. " COP26 He looks forward to discussing these shared priorities with friends across Viet Nam, Bangladesh and Indonesia, who will be crucial partners on the road to COP26 . \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 3 -- With national leaders gone from the UN climate conference in Scotland, attention turned on Wednesday to the state treasuries and the businesses and financiers responsible for carrying out the pledges to cut emissions and build infrastructure. A main aim of the COP26 talks is to secure enough national promises to cut greenhouse gas emissions - mostly from burning ubiquitous fossil fuels - to avert the worst climate disasters by keeping the rise in the global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But how exactly to meet those pledges, particularly in the developing world -- is still being worked out. Above all, it will need a lot of money. Among the most vexing questions are who should pay and how the funds can be channelled through the financial system quickly and effectively. A major goal will be to attract more private money. The issues are so important that organisers dedicated all of Wednesday for executives and public finance leaders to discuss them, reports Reuters. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero - an umbrella group that includes all the major Western banks as well as insurers and asset managers - announced that firms responsible for managing $130 trillion in capital, equivalent to 40 per cent of the world's financial assets, had signed up to assuming a "fair share" of decarbonisation. UN climate envoy Mark Carney, who pulled the alliance together, said it needed to find creative ways to channel private money purposefully into investment that advanced the UN-backed drive for 'net zero' greenhouse emissions by 2050. "The money is here - but that money needs net zero-aligned projects and (then) there's a way to turn this into a very, very powerful virtuous circle - and that's the challenge," he told the summit. $100 TRILLION NEEDED He said $100 trillion of investment were estimated to be required over the next three decades. "We need blended finance facilities that don't mobilise fractions of private capital for the public dollar but multiples ... in double digits," he added. "There are facilities that are being developed that can do this; we need to scale them dramatically." However, the chances of mobilising that kind of money are likely to decline if individual countries fail in Glasgow to collectively expand their emission reduction goals. US climate envoy John Kerry told a meeting of world mayors the pledges made so far gave the world only a 60 per cent chance of capping warming at 1.5 Celsius. He said around 65 per cent of global GDP was now covered by implementable climate change plans. "That means 35 per cent isn't. And we can't do it without that 35 per cent." British finance minister Rishi Sunak gave UK companies until 2023 to set out their plans to shift to a low-carbon economy, complete with interim targets. The UK is committing 100 million pounds ($136 million) to making climate finance more accessible to developing countries and helping to increase the volume of "green bonds" to finance climate-friendly projects.

Thanks to the relentless efforts made by the United Kingdom, the host country of the COP26 , that the Glasgow Climate Pact could be adopted. It was a major milestone achieved over the past six years. Deadlocks of negotiations could be over and the Rule Book could be finalized. There are no more impediments to start implementation of the Paris Agreement. However, there is a delicate balance between the interest and aspiration in the deal. Climate expert Nurul Quadir, a former Additional Secretary of Bangladesh government and now a faculty member of North South University, made the observation in an exclusive interview with Energy and Power Editor Mollah Amzad Hossain. How would you evaluate the achievements of the Glasgow Climate Summit? The Climate Pact declared at Glasgow has successfully resolved the deadlock of negotiations prolonged for over the past 6 years. The Act has signaled the official commencement of the implementation of the Paris Agreement. But we cannot say as yet that all issues have been resolved. But it is undoubtedly a giant positive step for the future. Agreement has been reached for global stocktaking every 5 years. It was possible to agree to a common format for registering the report. That would facilitate flow of similar climate related information for all countries. Every country talked loudly about achieving global warming restrictions below 1.5 degree C. This would help confront the challenges of achieving the target. Global Geopolitics is about climate issues. The negotiations have been going on for 20 years. How do you look at it? Any international summit experiences divergent views and opinions. In the days of multilateralism, every group tried achieving the goals from their own perspectives. This is more vibrant in climate negotiations. Final decisions cannot be taken without meeting the minds of all parties. Similarly a single country or a particular group of countries cannot take decisions. All stakeholders have to negotiate for arriving at a consensus. This was the 26th event of the UN Climate Summit or Conference of Parties (COP). The Paris Agreement was the culmination of the Kyoto Protocol. In 2015 two milestone achievements were made. These were the SDG and Disaster Management Protocol. At the initial stage, there was a general perception that climate concerns did not have scientific basis. But experts observed that it does not matter. If we feel that this might happen, we must take required precautions. Based on such feelings, we discussed it during the first conference and the IPCC was created. Energy policy and energy politics were there. The countries, which relied on imported fuel, were keen to resolve the climate issues at that stage. But those blessed with their own fuel were reluctant. We participated in the COP26 in accordance with IPCC guidelines. At a stage of the conference, big countries divided into groups and formed blocks - the USA was in one and the EU in another. The convention is actually a frame of convention and not the entire convention. But the frame of convention was concluded as indicators, policy guidelines and objectives are all included in that. COP is a forum where decisions need to be taken on consensus of all and not on majority decision. It is being said that Article 6 could be narrowed down. What does it actually mean? At Katowice in Poland, we made a breakthrough. The article 6 remained outstanding. World leaders left nothing unturned to create consensus this time. There is politics here. The Paris Agreement could be concluded as France and its allies were desperate for it. The CVF also tried their best. In COP26 , host UK and allies tried to achieve success. That is why some achievements could be made. But the Rule Book finalization and commencement of works on its basis may not be made. Only 2 days are left before the conclusion of COP26 . What would happen to the carbon mechanism? I have reasonable doubt about achieving carbon mechanism 6.2. But 6.8 non-market mechanism is important for us, where there can be some progress. Carbon Market Mechanism per CDM formulated in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol was supposed to end by 2020 in accordance with the Paris Agreement. But it could be done. Because the CDM rule has no mention about when it would end and how it would end. The LDC group does not want it to end. But Africans want the end of it. It is also unclear who would get the points - whether it is the donor country which provides money to a country for reducing emission or the host country? Now both parties are claiming this. That is where the double counting came. Some countries also brought the issues of emission reduction under previous CDM. The USA participated full-fledged in COP26 for the first time after Paris. I told earlier that the UK and its allies want to achieve something at COP26 . The USA also wants to see what has happened. John Kerry, special climate envoy of the US president, appeared vocal right from the onset. The USA and China have issued a joint statement. But there have been no talks about loss and damage. Loss and damage mechanism was introduced from Warsaw. Santiago network followed it up. A temporary secretariat was supposed to be set up from COP26 . Scotland has declared to contribute US$1 million for it. What do you expect? Some achievements would be made of what LDCs and other groups are demanding. First was deciding on a framework. Fortunately we could do that. The next is governance for it. There is a debate about CMA or COP doing it. Decision needs to be taken whether CMA or COP alone would do it. LDCs want both CMA and COP to govern. But the USA and its allies want only the CMA to govern. Third is the financing. Scotland committing US$1 million is a positive indicator. Loss and damage financing has been discussed at Glasgow. Meeting of minds between G77 plus China is also a positive development. The Heads of government of 123 countries joined the COP26 . Is there anything new? There were possibilities that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden would not come. But they both came. China was thought not to join, but they did. These were positive outcomes. There is a feeling now that something would happen. But it is not that COP26 would achieve everything. But negotiations in the leaders summit has created new dynamism. Bangladesh has submitted an enhanced NDC. US$176 billion would be required to implement this by 2030. Can it be achieved? Can Bangladesh attract global assistance for it? Bangladesh has no obligation for NDC. None was bothering as we were among the LDCs. There is nothing about submitting financial statement. Still Bangladesh submitted an enhanced NDC. It was also submitted earlier. Much greater was achieved than what was committed in earlier submitted NDC. But the target of financial assistance could not be achieved. It would be great if Bangladesh can achieve it now. The first IPCC report stated that 45% carbon emission reduction by 2030 would be required for meeting the target of 1.5C global warming limit. But even if the present NDCs are implemented, carbon emission would increase by 17%. Do you find any pathway of getting out of the situation in the current COP negotiations? One of the major issues of discussion in the ongoing COP was finding a pathway for restricting global warming below 1.5 degree C and reducing emission. But till now consensus for a pathway could not be reached. This means the NDCs submitted by countries would not be enough. Fresh enhanced NDCs would be required. G20 countries have to take the leading role. Global warming cannot be restricted below 1.5C unless China takes greater initiative for this. But there is tremendous pressure for it. Pressure groups are working right across the globe. US$100 billion was supposed to be contributed to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) every year from 2020. Oxfam said it has contributed about $20-22 billions. OECD report states of US$ 80 billions. What is the progress? Finally, what actually has the world achieved from COP26 ? Five Countries together contributed US$ 300-350 millions in the adaptation board. It is a significant achievement for adaptation. But we have to wait until the conclusion of the COP26 to assess other achievements. \</doc>

Oct. 25 Kathmandu(Kathmandu Post/ANN)- Nepal has been going through one of the worst climate catastrophes in recent years. With the present status of global gain in climate change mitigation, this trend seems never-ending. I started working as a climate journalist in 2018 and have had opportunities to listen to climate stories from people living in remote quarters of the country and from those living in big cities and learn about their plight. I was startled to see how underestimated the climate change problem remains. Those story collecting moments were really an eye-opener for me as I came to understand the effects of climate change that I had never imagined had any connection with climate. For instance, there is an old man in the village of Narainapur in Banke district who could not afford the wedding expenses of his daughter because repeated droughts had wreaked havoc on his crops and left him poorer. Just imagine! You are not able to even get married because of climate change. This shows how deeply climate change has penetrated our lives. We don't need to go far. It is enough to glance at the events of the past five years to gauge how the effect of climate change is increasing in frequency and intensity every day. We had one of the worst wildfire seasons in decades, leading to hazardous levels of air pollution. Educational institutions were closed all over Nepal, citing an environmental cause, an incident that had never happened before. When we were struggling with economic damage caused by Covid-19, our crops in the fields failed because of pests such as armyworms and locusts, both of which are linked to the changing climate. As we were beginning to hope to quench the thirst of our capital Kathmandu with water from the Melamchi project, which is finally about to be completed after it was started more than 20 years ago, floods swept away that hope with huge damage to the scheme. Tourism and agriculture appeared to be two ways that could help Nepal get out of the economic damage caused by Covid-19, but that hope too seems blurry as climate change has turned our snow-capped mountains into bare black hills, and various disasters catalysed by heavy rainfall has caused damage to the roads and thus hampered tourist movement. According to the Department of Transport, more than 200 roads have been damaged due to this year's monsoon. Further, farmers have lost their ready-to-harvest paddy to the monsoon mayhem lately, leading to huge economic losses. Along with other hilly districts of Nepal, Kathmandu saw a large outbreak of dengue in recent years, a disease that was once known only in the southern plains of the country. The list of climate hazards seems to be never-ending. Nepal that accounts for only 0.02 percent of the world's carbon emissions, cannot contribute much to climate change mitigation. However, it has made efforts to reduce emissions by promoting the electric vehicle and increasing forest cover through scientific forest management. At this time, the government should direct its efforts at helping people adjust to changing climate. But the actions of the government in this sector seem to be insufficient at the moment. The major reason why people are not able to grasp the effects of climate change is that they are not aware of the phenomenon. For instance, farmers are those groups of people who are majorly affected by climate change, but they are rarely aware of why they have uncertain rainfall or frequent droughts. They lack vital information and thus fail to react in this rapidly changing scenario. In many cases, the government has tried to help people by introducing new technology such as drip irrigation or rainwater harvesting. However, many farmers are not aware of these new technologies. And some who are aware lack training in using them. Even if the farmers know how to use them, they ultimately abandon the use of those modern mechanics due to the lack of essential knowledge of repair and maintenance. Crop insurance Similarly, crop insurance can be a critical instrument in farming communities to help them cover the losses due to climate-related disasters. Though the government of Nepal has been encouraging crop insurance by providing subsidies on premium payments to farmers, the majority of farmers are not even aware that such an insurance policy exists. Thus, it is necessary to raise awareness about the government's crop insurance policy in the farming community. Regarding other disasters such as wildfire and dengue outbreaks, the government should build capacity to prevent them. For instance, to prevent wildfires, local bodies can draw fire lines or equip communities to control them before they start spreading. Climate change is not a short-term problem. With the recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the future looks pretty bleak if world governments do not take proper actions to mitigate emissions. Being one of the most vulnerable countries, Nepal would be hampered unimaginably if sufficient adaptation efforts were not implemented. Nepal should come up with a long-term solution to mitigate the effects of climate change. The prime minister of Nepal himself is participating in the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) slated to be held in Glasgow in November this year. He and his delegation should be present with a robust agenda and strike a good bargain with the developed countries to help people overcome the current effects of climate change and avoid such developments in the future. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma arrived here on Wednesday morning on a two-day visit to to strengthen support for UK COP26 climate priorities ahead of hosting the crucial UN climate change summit in Glasgow this November. State Minister for Foreign Affairs Md Shahriar Alam received Sharma at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at 09.20am upon his arrival. He will hold a meeting with Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen at 12:30pm at Foreign Service Academy. Sharma is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at her official residence Ganobhaban at 11:30am. He will also attend "UK- Bangladesh Climate Partnership Roundtable" at 2pm at Foreign Service Academy before holding a joint briefing at 3pm. During his engagements in Dhaka, Sharma will discuss shared priorities with Bangladesh which remains a "crucial" partner on the road to COP26 . He will discuss the needs of countries most vulnerable to climate change, to ensure they are equipped to deal with its current and damaging effects ahead of COP26 . COP26 With less than six months to go before COP26 , he will meet leaders from government, business and civil society to press his personal priority for a move to global clean power, critical to limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C. Bangladesh is among the fast growing economies with significant renewable energy potential, said the UK government. The visit will highlight their growing leadership and how the UK Presidency will work with countries to support workers and communities to make the transition to good green jobs. It builds on the recent Climate and Environment Ministerial meeting where, under the UK's leadership, G7 nations agreed to end all new direct government support for international coal power, and to increase support for clean energy alternatives like solar and wind. G7 nations also agreed to work to increase the quantity of finance for climate action in order to meet the $100bn per annum target to support developing countries. Ahead of his visit, Sharma said last week, the G7 made history with a major step towards consigning coal to history and moving to a decarbonised power system but tackling the climate crisis must be a global effort, which leaves no one behind.

Bangladesh and the United Kingdom (UK) will hold a defence dialogue for the first time here on Wednesday where London is looking forward to conducting the growing relationship with Dhaka on a 'more strategic basis.' Both sides think such dialogue would 'create opportunities' for broader discussions on bilateral defence and military issues, cooperation in UN peacekeeping, visits, joint exercises, training, workshops, 'defence supply and procurement', and cooperation on capabilities. The dialogue is taking place at a time when there are emerging security concerns in various parts of the world including in Myanmar, Ukraine and Afghanistan. British High Commissioner to Bangladesh Robert Chatterton Dickson recently said 2021 was a "good year" for Bangladesh-UK defence relations, as a Royal Navy ship sailed to Chattogram after 13 years as part of their Carrier Strike Group deployment (CSG21) to the Indo Pacific region. The visit highlighted the bilateral defence connections, taking forward again strategic level training provided by the UK to the Bangladesh National Defence College. 'We're looking forward to talks to put this relationship on a more strategic basis,' said the High Commissioner. Last week, the fourth of the five C-130 J transport aircraft was delivered to Bangladesh by the UK under a government to government arrangement. A bilateral meeting was held between Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her British counterpart Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow. Following the meeting, Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen told reporters that the UK government is keen to provide five naval ships to Bangladesh, which will help strengthen the country's maritime security. \</doc>

Rosatom, state nuclear corporation of Russia hosted Small Modular Reactors (SMR) Day, on January 20 at EXPO 2020 in Dubai. Rosatom Director General Alexey Likhachev, World Nuclear Association Director General Sama Bilbao Y. Leon, and high-ranking representatives from international organizations and partner companies, UAE Atomic Energy Corporation Director General Mohamed Al-Hammadi and Russian Ambassador to the UAE Timur Zabirov attended the event. Small Modular Reactors Day was an international platform for discussing the benefits of Small Modular Reactors, the prospects of their development across the world. The program was opened by a multimedia demonstration on benefits of small modular reactor based nuclear power plants in a wide range of climates while ensuring a stable supply of electricity and achieving decarbonization goals. Rosatom's Director General said: 'For me personally, last year's UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow was a watershed moment. I literally felt the winds of change. Not just at COP26 but at all energy and climate conferences in 2021 it was clear that people were realizing that a carbon-free future is impossible without the peaceful use of nuclear technology. The role that nuclear energy can play in helping the world move away from hydrocarbons and meet our collective climate goals is now firmly in the public consciousness.' \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 28 -- Glasgow's council leader has insisted the city is ready for the COP26 conference - but "with caveats". Susan Aitken denied the city was a mess and said cleansing staff were "working round the clock" for the UN summit. In a meeting with the Scottish Affairs Committee, she addressed accusations that bins were overflowing and rubbish collectors had suffered rat attacks. The SNP councillor told MPs that other cities were dirtier than Glasgow and insisted she was "not embarrassed". Ms Aitken said: "The Cop26 board met last week and the verdict was that we are ready, with caveats. "The caveats are mainly technical, some of them have already been resolved "None of them were massive, none of them were enough to cause panic." Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, asked Ms Aitken whether the "technical issues" included cleansing staff being attacked by rats. His comments came after the GMB union said it was aware of four binmen being taken to hospital after such attacks. Ms Aitken admitted that there had been "small incidents" after "very minor contact with a rat". She added: "Our cleansing employees occasionally experience rats. "It's also not something that is unique to Glasgow, it's something that's happening right across the UK - all cities have rats." The city council leader was giving evidence to the Westminster committee about preparations for the climate summit, which begins on Sunday. Last week, cleansing staff in Glasgow said they would strike for a week during the conference. Ms Aitken told MPs that 12,000 additional hours had been worked to clean Glasgow ahead of Cop26 , with 150 new bins deployed across the city. She denied there was a rubbish problem in the city that was "unique to Glasgow". "We are, as are other cities globally, working to address the very serious challenges and impacts that were caused by the pandemic, but we were never going to be able to recover overnight. "We are making considerable progress, we're working round the clock to address those issues - particularly in the Cop26 zones in the city - but actually right across the city." 'Not embarrassed' Ms Aiken said the city's efforts were not just for "VIPs coming to Glasgow", but to improve services for residents. She added: "I'm not embarrassed. I'm confident that the visitors coming to Glasgow will see - as they always see - an incredibly vibrant, diverse, and welcoming urban space." Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has also said she believes Glasgow "is ready for Cop26 ". "I'm not going to stand here and say they don't exist in Glasgow. "Glasgow - as it has been with big events in past years - will be an excellent host for Cop26 , and that's important." More on climate summit top strapline The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

The 26th UN Conference Of the Parties ( COP26 ) on climate change, now in its second week and final week of negotiations, has failed so far to reach a decision on 'loss and damage', and it is now clear that there will be no decision made on this important issue at this year's conference. Speaking to members of the Bangladesh delegation and environmental experts at the Scottish Exhibition Centre, UNB was able to learn that they are already looking forward to the next such conference, which would be COP27, for a decision on this issue. Loss and damage from climate change refers to the complete and irrecoverable loss of some things and the repairable damage of other things due to the impacts of human-induced climate change. Mirza Shawkat Ali, a member of the Bangladesh government delegation, told UNB that the 'breakthrough recognition' of loss and damage in the Paris Agreement was the result of years of effort on the part of countries that are most affected by climate change, including Bangladesh. Although the developed countries are not very willing to discuss the matter voluntarily, Bangladesh has a strong role to play in this regard as it is the current chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum. Shawkat Ali said discussions on preparing guidelines for loss and damage, fundings and considering 'Loss and damage' under COP and CMA - the group of countries who have signed and ratified the Paris Agreement -are going on at this time. Keeping loss and damage as a separate agenda in each COP going forward is also being discussed. The Paris Agreement reaffirmed the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage as the main vehicle under the UNFCCC process to avert, minimize and address loss and damage associated with climate change impacts, including extreme weather events and slow onset events. Shawkat Ali added that discussions on Article 6, which relates to carbon markets, were going on at the technical level on Sunday. Adaptation is being discussed in various forums. However, talks on the $100-billion finance that industrialised countries pledged in 2009, but never followed through on, have ended. How to start long term finance will be finalised, Shawkat Ali said. Regarding the climate conference, Dr Atiqur Rahman, another member of the Bangladesh delegation and a world-renowned scientist and expert on climate change, said that the rate of reducing carbon emissions by developing countries is generally lower than in developed countries, who are mostly responsible for huge carbon emissions historically that developing countries are suffering from most. He said that due to climate change, cyclones, floods, cyclones, steep slopes, river and mountain erosion have increased in Bangladesh. Keeping the temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels can prevent the catastrophic effects of climate change. He said that salinity is increasing rapidly in the south region of Bangladesh. Salinity has been detected in Gopalganj too. Studies have shown that 1-2 types of crops have been damaged because of salinity. Besides, sea level has also risen. He added that displacement and migration has become a major problem in Bangladesh due to climate change. In this regard, migration and displacement issues are being discussed at the table of various platforms / negotiations. Meanwhile, Ziaul Haque, a member of the Bangladeshi delegation and co-ordinator of the LDC group, told UNB that although many issues were positive, discussions on loss and damage were long overdue. He said the developed world was supposed to give $100 billion to developing countries including Bangladesh by 2020, according to the promise made in 2009. However, in order to give 100 billion by 2021 is being discussed at the tactical level. In the meantime, about 80 billion are ready to be disbursed mentioned in the discussion. These 100 billion dollars will be disbursed till 2025. He said the countries that emit more carbon did not object to this in principle. However, the world leaders of many countries do not agree to pay for the damage caused by climate change. After so many days of discussion, this time it has been added to the agenda. Various conditions are also being attached for the money that is being promised. Saher Hossain Chowdhury, chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Environment and Forest Climate Change, told UNB that the talks were going positively. Hopefully this time there will be progress. Once again, there was talk of securing the bill of 100 billion in funding for the affected countries. But now time is running out for all the talk to give shape to an agreement, in the form of a text that almost 200 countries need to agree on. \</doc>

State Minister for Foreign Affairs M Shahriar Alam has called upon the young people and climate activists of Bangladesh and the UK to join hands and emerge as the greatest force for good for their respective countries in protecting the planet. He urged them to raise their voices at the COP26 and beyond, and be an asset to their local communities in saving the planet, people and nature for succeeding generations. "There is no planet B or plan B." The State Minister was addressing a youth climate dialogue titled "Bangladesh-UK Youth Voices on Climate Action: The Road to Glasgow" held virtually on Friday night. COP26 : Young people urged to raise voice to save planet Bangladesh High Commission in London, in collaboration with Tower Hamlets Council, organized the youth climate dialogue on the occasion of the 50th anniversaries of Bangladesh's Independence and Bangladesh-UK diplomatic relations. The event coincided with and be a part of the London Climate Action Week 2021. Minister for London, Paul Scully MP attended the event as the guest of honour which was co-chaired by High Commissioner of Bangladesh to Saida Muna Tasneem and Mayor of the Tower Hamlets Council John Biggs. Rushanara Ali MP of the Tower Hamlets Borough and Nahim Razzaq MP also attended. Councillor Asma Islam, Cabinet Member for Environment and Public Realm (Job Share) - Lead on Environment also spoke at the event. Shahriar said under the extraordinary climate-stewardship of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh has emerged a global leader in adaptation, climate-resilience, and nature-based climate solutions. "We are also submitting ambitious and quantified NDCs ahead of COP26 including a renewable energy target of 40% by 2041," he said. Bangladesh Parliament was the first in South Asia to declare a 'Planetary Emergency' and called on the world to work 'on a war-footing'' to stop climate change. Bangladesh government is spending on an average 2.5% of our GDP, US$5 billion each year in climate adaptation and resilience-building alongside the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, he added. "Without waiting for external; financing our government implemented more than 800 climate action projects from PM Sheikh Hasina's self-financed 450 million US$ National Climate Change Trust Fund," said the State Minister. He said Bangladesh looks forward to UK's robust and ambitious climate leadership at the COP26 and beyond specially in securing mitigation commitments by the G20 to curb global emissions substantially, arrest global temperatures at 1.5 degrees, secure maximal climate finance especially the promised 100 billion USD each year. He said talked about unlocking international carbon markets for transactional climate cooperation and low-carbon technology transfer, and address the profound loss and damage for the climatically displaced millions. Bangladesh is currently the President of the Climate Vulnerable Forum under the Chairmanship of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. \</doc>

Nov. 22 Karachi(DAWN/ANN)  There is urgent need for effective measures to support people to adapt to the effects of climate change and to reduce emissions. DAWN/ANN  Wasim Umar, a labourer, sits on a charpoy, placed on a road divider in the city of Jacobabad, Pakistan. This is where he sleeps at night. He does so because the passing vehicles blow gusts of air at him, offering the only respite from the heat. Children sleep in wet clothes at night and jump into agricultural wastewater in the day to cool off. Daily wage earners trade reduced wages for breaks their bodies compel them to take. Buying ice each day is a necessity for every household, often used to cool floors, when there isn't even enough electricity to power a fan. Heatwaves have forced residents of one of the planet's hottest cities to find desperate solutions as they face the adverse impact of climate change. As recently documented in Amnesty International's briefing Unliveable for Humans, Jacobabad reflects what happens when abject poverty meets climate change. Scalding heat and humidity levels have crossed the thresholds described by experts as "hotter than a human body can handle". Combine that with frequent power outages, rampant deforestation and inadequate shelter, and a climate change nightmare is born. For its part, Pakistan has been clear-headed about the impact of climate change. It has featured prominently in the country's foreign policy, been described as a cornerstone of the current government's vision, guided its media-savvy 'Billion Tree Tsunami' and taken centrestage at many a speech at international forums. At COP26 Signing up to global pledges to reduce methane emissions, pledges to eliminate deforestation by 2030 and calling out leaders at COP26 for saying more and doing less, it is evident Pakistan is serious about climate change. But just as pledges made at COP26 remain void without discernible just transitions, Pakistan too, must pave its way to changes we can see as clearly as the effects of climate change. The country's overdue revised Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) have finally been submitted to the UNFCCC, committing to cut 50 per cent of projected emissions below business-as-usual, and pledging to have 60pc of all energy produced to be renewable by 2030. In his COP26 COP26 . Commendable promises are announced, only to be followed by an almost impossible condition for their fulfilment. The fact is that while there are long-term benefits of Pakistan's climate change respo\£dnse measures, like the protection of wetlands, expanding mangrove forest cover, electronic vehicular policy, and 'green Eurobonds', there is a lack of immediate assistance to groups that are already bearing the brunt of climate change, as demonstrated in Jacobabad. Renewable and reliable sources of energy are not readily available or accessible, especially to those living in poverty. Assistance to cope with extreme weather events remains elusive. Livelihoods that are particularly susceptible to climate change remain beholden to exploitative labour practices. More needs to be done, and soon, to put in place human rights-consistent climate-adaptation measures in the context of rising temperatures, extreme rainfall, melting glaciers and more frequent days of unbearable heat. There is an urgent need for effective and human rights-consistent measures to support people to adapt to the effects of climate change and to reduce emissions, particularly by phasing out fossil fuels and protecting natural ecosystems. But the groups that need to be a part of the solution, like women, people living in poverty, farmers and fishermen are not being consulted. They are not participating in decisions involving their lives and steps are not being taken to remove obstacles that prevent them from doing so. While at COP26 , Pakistan duly recognised the role of the youth movement to mobilise action against climate change, they must inform the climate response back home as well. It is unlikely that Wasim Umar will know what happened at COP26 . He won't be able to track what pledges were made, which countries overpromised (all) and which countries underdelivered (all). But when he returns to the road at night, every single decision made in Glasgow could determine whether he sleeps that night. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen has proposed to host a CVF- COP26 joint event on the sideline of upcoming COP26 to strengthen climate cooperation between the President of COP-26 and the most climate-vulnerable countries including Bangladesh. Dr Momen made the proposal while holding a bilateral talk with COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma in London recently, according to a press release received here. During the meeting, foreign minister highlighted Bangladesh's important role in the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) under the chairmanship of visionary leader Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina while discussing about the joint event targeting the COP26 to be held in Glasgow in early November. Dr Momen also proposed to expand bilateral climate relations between the UK and Bangladesh especially in transferring green technology, promoting green investment, and supporting climate mitigation projects such as building embankments to protect people from sea-level rise and river erosion. The foreign minister briefed Sharma on the COP26 agenda for Bangladesh focusing particularly on loss and damage and the proposed CVF- COP26 Leaders' Summit under Bangladesh Presidency. Sharma assured Bangladesh of the UK's continued support for its climate initiatives covering different areas, including collaboration to promote green financing and investment, and technology transfer to build a clean and green future. Bangladesh High Commissioner to the UK and Ireland Saida Muna Tasneem accompanied Dr Momen to the talk along with other senior members of the Minister's delegation. \</doc>

Oct. 27 Kuala Lumpur(The Star/ANN)- South-East Asian nations are speeding up their plans to transmit renewable energy through a proposed regional power grid, with first trials set for 2022, as the area strives to meet climate change targets, government and company officials said. Some members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) are also exploring carbon capture storage (CCS) technology to reduce emissions, officials said at this week's Singapore International Energy Week conference. Asean has proposed that 23% of primary energy come from renewable sources by 2025. The announcements come ahead of the UN COP26 climate summit starting on Oct 31 in Glasgow, considered one of the last opportunities for countries to announce firm targets for cutting emissions this decade. "We've heard some very positive announcements in terms of investments going into renewables," Gauri Singh, Deputy Director-General of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said. "Asean are really looking at bringing in almost one-quarter of the energy from renewables by 2025  that's a very ambitious goal that they've set for themselves, but I think the international cooperation, and regional cooperation are going to play a very, very important role." Singapore will start importing renewable electricity from Malaysia by 2022 and later that year utilities in Asean will start transmitting the first 100 megawatts (MW) of electricity under a Laos-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore power integration project as part of a regional grid project. The Asean grid, an idea first proposed in 1999 to enhance regional energy security, will now facilitate renewable power transmission. Australia has also been tapped for its green energy supplies with plans to export to Singapore. "With the power sector accounting for almost a quarter of global emissions, decarbonising electricity generation is at the core of the global climate change effort," Gan Kim Yong, Singapore Minister for Trade and Industry said in a speech at the event. Singapore, which depends on natural gas for almost all of its power generation, plans to import up to 4 gigawatts (GW) of low-carbon electricity by 2035, or about 30% of its total supply. Singapore's Sunseap Group and Sembcorp Industries and Indonesia's PLN Batam and PT Trisurya Mitra Bersama (Suryagen) signed agreements this week on new solar power projects. Singapore plans to also launch standards and guidelines for renewable energy certificates that will allow companies to buy credits that verify their power is from renewable sources. Still, many Asean countries must address their reliance on fossil fuels in their power generation mix to meet their climate targets. For countries that are still heavily dependent on coal for power, CCS could be a solution in reducing emissions, said Arifin Tasrif, Indonesia's minister of energy and natural resources. "The Asean region is still in some ways dependent on coal power... this situation must be carefully considered when setting our path towards carbon neutrality, and significant efforts should be made," Tasrif said. Carbon capture technology is very important for Indonesia's strategy to reach its net-zero emissions goals, and the country will start using it by 2030, he said. Exxon Mobil Corp is pursuing CCS hubs across Asia and has started talks with countries on potential storage options for carbon dioxide. To be sure, the region will still require further regulations and massive investments in upgrading and connecting grids across borders. Asean will need at least US$367 billion in the next five years to finance its energy goals, Asean Secretary General Lim Jock Hoi said. The bloc needs to improve its investment environment and also expand beyond its current sources of finance to reach its energy transition targets, he added. "Much remains to be done," Lim said. "(There is a) need to improve the investment environment for energy transition, and to expand beyond our current sources of finance." ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Nov. 2\'e2\€  GLASGOW(Vietnam News/ANN) \'e2\€  Prime Minister Ph\'e1\'ba\£1m Minh Ch\'c3\£dnh along with many foreign investors and business executives attended a forum on the prospects of business and sustainable development in Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam held on the sidelines of 26th United Nations' Conference of Parties ( COP26 ). Under the chair of Jose Vinals, Chairman of Standard Chartered Bank, the conference drew the participation of more than 300 senior leaders of businesses and foreign investors who are customers of Standard Chartered and businesses that are members of the British Chamber of Commerce in Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam (Britcham). At the meeting, PM Ch\'c3\£dnh discussed in detail the major policies of Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam, the prospects of doing business and investing in Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam, Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam's goals at COP26 and sustainable development objectives it sets sight out as well as the opportunities and challenges Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam is facing in the context of global shift in supply chains. The Prime Minister emphasised that Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam was steadfast in its foreign policy of independence, self-reliance, diversification and multilateralisation; proactive and active integration into the world in a comprehensive and profound manner, and that the country wanted to be a friend, a reliable partner and an active and responsible member of the international community. Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam was currently focusing on restructuring the economy, with a focus on restructuring investment (public investment, promotion of public-private partnership, etc.), restructuring the banking system towards increasing the scale and quality, and national restructuring the country's growth model towards sustainable development and green growth. The Vietnamese Government leader held firm that peace, cooperation, sustainable development and green growth are global issues that affect all people, so a global and all-people approach is needed to address them. Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam started out as a poor country, experienced consecutive wars and then a prolonged economic embargo, and was still suffering from many socio-economic difficulties. Therefore, the PM called for fairness and justice in climate change response, developing green economy, and sustainable growth. Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam's efforts at green development would require support in climate technology and green finance from developed countries, he underlined. The country could make strong commitments on emission targets, especially methane gas, he noted. Ch\'c3\£dnh said in the first months of 2021, Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam still managed to keep its macroeconomy stable, ensuring balances in state budget revenues and expenditure, export-import, energy, and food. Many investors in Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam believe that the people are the decisive factor in attracting investment. "Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam sees people as both the actor, the centre, the goal and the driving force of development, and would not sacrifice social progress and justice in pursuit of unabated economic growth," he said. He stressed that "the more difficulties Vietnamese people face, the more they unite and strive to overcome all problems and move forward". "We are never confused or afraid of any enemies or difficulties, but naturally, we seek the support and help of international partners in the current integration trend," he said, reiterating how Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam has shifted from a place of poverty with an average GDP per capita less than US$100, to its current $3,500 level after 35 years of \'c4\' \'e1\'bb i m\'e1\'bb i (renewal). At the conference, PM Ch\'c3\£dnh witnessed the exchanges of memoranda of understanding with a total capital of US$8.5 billion for three Vietnamese businesses to help with sustainable development projects. In a separate meeting with PM Ch\'c3\£dnh, Standard Chartered Bank leader Jose Vinals expressed his gratitude for the support that the Vietnamese Government had provided for the bank, and reiterated the commitment to accompany Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam in its sustainable development efforts. He proposed a number of cooperation initiatives, including ways for Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam to participate more deeply in the fields of insurance, commerce, services and retail; measures on promoting foreign direct investment attraction; contributing to sustainable growth and respond to climate change through multi-billion dollar cooperation agreements and technology support with Vietnamese partner. PM Ch\'c3\£dnh appreciated various cooperation initiatives that the bank had made in Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam, especially in green development. He noted that previously when renewable, clean energy was not developed enough, Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam had to go with coal power to boost the economy as a developing nation, so the country's transition to clean energy now would need a lot of help from developed nations. PM Ch\'c3\£dnh said that Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam was currently focusing on restructuring the economy, including encouraging foreign banks to participate in restructuring banks that are weak in human resources, capital resources and management capacity. Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam was also continuing to improve the investment and business environment, including promoting digital transformation in the banking system to attract more foreign investment. VI\'e1\'bb t Nam also needed cooperation in the field of insurance and construction of large financial centres, he suggested to the Standard Chartered Bank leader. \'e2\€  VNS ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

The UN climate change conference begins in Glasgow, Scotland on October 31 with high hopes and aspirations about setting strategy to implement the Paris Agreement towards achieving the Net Zero carbon emission goal by 2050. There are, however, skepticism about the success of the event. All the parties to the conference or countries of the world are all set to take part in the two-week meeting organized by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) under the presidency of United Kingdom and in partnership with Italy. It is expected that the Paris Rulebook would be finalized at the 26th conference of parties ( COP26 ) through fixing a carbon mechanism while effective progress would be made regarding financing mechanism, including mobilization of US$100 billion annually from 2020. The COP26 would also witness a substantial development in discussion on loss and damage issue as a movement has been launched to see how financing could be mobilized in this regard from a temporary secretariat in Glasgow. The conference also aims at expediting submission and implementation of the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to reduce carbon emission as a strategy to cut 45 percent of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission by 2030. The conference is expected to get political directions towards achieving the target to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius within the first three days and the negotiators would follow the directions to finalize the strategy. However, the UN Secretary General and the British Prime Minister have apprised the global leaders of the extreme consequences the planet would have to face if Glasgow fails. They also brought it to the notice of the leaders that the negotiations on the finalizing the strategy could be even more difficult than that of the Paris Agreement. The head of 120 states or governments are expected to attend this conference and make their respective country's commitment towards achieving the 1.5C goal. The negotiators involved in the process were expecting that the political directions would help them finalize the Paris Rulebook. Many, however, were skeptical about finalizing it during this conference and dropped broader hint that no decision can be finalized unless all the 197 parties agree with it. Like the past ones, there will be 60 points of discussion under CMP16 and CMA3 in this COP26 . The parties will take part in the negotiations under different forums and groups, including G77 plus China, 27-member EU group and the umbrella group of USA, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. There are also subgroups like LDCs, Africa group, Alliance of the Small Island States, and BSIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China). There are some other non-negotiating groups like CVF, Most Vulnerable Country, High Vulnerable Country, SAARC and ASEAN. In fact, the main goal of the COP26 is to keep alive the discussion on limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C. Other issues of discussion include: Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts. Matters relating to finance Long-term climate finance Reports of GCF and GEF Development and transfer of technologies Capacity-building under the Convention. Matters relating to the least developed countries. Gender and climate change. All matters of adaptation. Carbon Market Mechanism COP26 . He said that there are differences about the method of carbon credit counting. Until now, the countries which will undertake project to reduce carbon pollution and the ones that will invest in the projects want to take credit points. In that case, it would be double counting which is not desirable. On the other hand, many think that the real approach would be non-market mechanism. However, economist Dr Mohammed Assaduzzaman thought that the Paris Rulebook is unlikely to be finalized at the COP26 . Around 40 out of the total 197 parties have not yet submitted their NDCs and it is being said that a final call will be made for them from this conference to submit the NDCs by a specified deadline. And, there will be a call to introduce a monitoring system to implement those under the Paris Agreement. Bangladesh has already submitted its revised NDC to the UNFCCC in August last with a wider commitment to reduce emission from more sectors than what it committed in its previous NDC. According to the latest NDC, Bangladesh wishes to reduce 21.85 percent emission by 2030. According to different press reports, Bangladesh will have to invest around US$ 176 billion, including US$58 billion own resources, in next nine years to achieve this goal. Director General of Power Cell Mohammed Hossain said this investment would come as part of our using energy-efficient technologies under the power sector development plan. However, implementation of the country's revised NDC would depend on the availability of fund and technology, which is also applicable for other countries too. There is also doubt about whether the COP26 would be able to take decision on monitoring mechanism for implementation of the NDCs. However, it expected that there would be some progress in this regard as the global target to reduce 45 percent emission by 2030 would not be possible without successful implementation of the global NDCs. 100 Billion Dollar Fund The parties have so far committed only US$52 billion to the US$100 billion fund since 2020 while the actual disbursement still remained much lower. However, the OECD in its latest report claimed that they had already mobilized and disbursed around US$80 billion. However, the fund should have been provided beyond the bilateral development assistance, but it was not clear yet. Amid these circumstances, now it is being said that the fund mobilization deadline should be extended to 2023 from 2020. Emeritus Prof. Dr Ainun Nishat said there is hardly any possibility of achieving success, despite widespread discussions taking place in this regard. IPCC Report and Challenges to Reduce 45 Percent Emission by 2030 The first part of the IPCC report was published recently, highlighting the possible impacts of global warming on the countries of the world. The report says, the global carbon emission should be reduced by 45 percent by 2030 to achieve the targets of Net Zero emission by 2050 and limiting temperature rise to 1.5C by 2100. It also mentioned that the G20 countries are responsible for 80 percent of the global carbon emission. But the required commitments for reducing the emission to the desired level are still absent in the NDCs. Dr Ainun Nishat thought that the global temperature would rise to more than 3.0C even after full implementation of the NDCs so far announced. It could have catastrophic results for the planet. However, many were expecting that the global leaders would come up with new directions in Glasgow like that of Paris, which might take much forward the ongoing negotiations. Loss and Damage The developed countries which were earlier reluctant to discuss the loss and damage issue are expected to remain positive about the issue during this COP26 . Environment lawyer and Bangladesh negotiator Hafijul Islam Khan said it sometimes sounds like the 'Polluters Pay' concept but it has no recognition in the Paris Agreement. However, there is a liability to accept the historic responsibility of pollution. The negotiation on Mechanism for Loss and Damage may make some progress in Glasgow. A temporary secretariat of Santiago Network would start its journey to put pressure on mobilizing funds for the Loss and Damage. However, many apprehended that the launching of the secretariat would not be possible before COP27 as there is an issue to see whether the UNFCCC can do so. Conclusion The COP26 COP26 President and British State Minister Alok Sharma said that achieving any success here would be even more difficult than that of Paris. He, however, expected that the global leaders would be able to deliver necessary directives. Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will also make the country's commitments there. But the experts involved in the negotiation process thought that the COP26 would fall short of expectations. But the Paris Rulebook would be finalized here as starting implementation of the Paris Agreement entirely depends on it. \</doc>

The global women leaders at a high-level event here on Tuesday adopted a declaration with a call to improve women's participation and leadership in all climate actions as well as to connect the fight against gender inequality closely with the fight against climate change. The declaration was adopted at the High-level Panel on Women and Climate Change, held on the sideline of the COP26 World Leaders' Summit at Scottish Pavilion in Glasgow. The Scottish authority and the UN Women hosted the event to discuss the importance of women's leadership in addressing climate change and its gendered impacts. In the declaration titled 'Glasgow Women's Leadership on Gender Equality and Climate Change,' they said Climate change is an urgent human rights issue posing a serious risk to the fundamental rights to life, health, food, water and sanitation, decent work and an adequate standard of living of individuals and communities across the world. Climate change exacerbates existing inequalities, including gender inequality, they added. The women leaders said, 'We believe that the fight against climate change must be closely connected to the fight against gender inequality, and agree that ensuring women's and girls' leadership is vital if global efforts to tackle climate change are to succeed.' They said women and girls are commonly disproportionately affected by climate change and face greater risks and burdens from its impacts, particularly in situations of poverty. 'Despite increased vulnerability to climate impacts, we recognize that women and girls have been creating and leading innovative climate solutions at all levels. One of the great injustices of the climate crisis is that the people and countries who are worst affected are those who have contributed at least to its causes,' they added. 'We therefore call for all climate actions to recognize the differentiated impact of climate change by factors such as age, gender, disability and location, and ensure women's and girls' voice and agency and their full and effective participation and leadership in policy and decision. - making at community, national and international levels, and increase ambition in all sectors,' the leaders said. Expressing their gratefulness to those who have led efforts to date at government, intergovernmental, private sector and civil society levels to advance the interests of women and girls in climate action, they said, 'We particularly acknowledge women leaders, especially young women and girls at all levels who have championed this agenda, and commit to pushing forward their work including through increased financing, broadening partnerships, and advocacy.' The women leaders welcomed the dedicated agenda item under the UNFCCC addressing issues of gender and climate change and the 5-year enhanced Lima work program on gender and its gender action plan agreed at COP 25. 'We hope to see strong efforts by all stakeholders to implement the activities included in the GAP,' they said. They acknowledged parallel efforts to promote gender equality in climate change policies, programs and initiatives, including the UN Secretary General's initiative on Gender and Climate Change, launched at the Global Climate Action Summit 2019, and the Feminist Action for Climate Justice action coalition under the Generation Equality Forum. 'We encourage all countries yet to pledge action under these important initiatives to do so before the sixty-sixth session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW66) in March 2022. At CSW 66, we will work towards achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls in the context of climate change, environmental and disaster risk reduction policies and programs,' they added. The leaders agreed on the importance of achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, notably Sustainable Development Goal 5 on achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls. 'We agree that concrete actions are needed to improve women's and girls' participation and leadership in all climate actions,' they said. The women leaders called all leaders - women and men - both in government and civil society - to commit to increased and sustained support for women and girls' climate change initiatives at the national and global levels in order to achieve sustainable progress towards meeting the challenges of the climate crisis. The statement will remain open to further signatures from women leaders from across government, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, business and civil society till the 66th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women in March 2022. Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, UN Under-Secretary-General and UN Women Executive Director Sima Sami Bahous, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu and Iceland Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir, among others, were present at the event. \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 2 -- The people of Gabura in Bangladesh are having everything that's most threatening about climate change thrown at them. Storms keep wrecking their coastal defences, and rising sea levels are pushing salty seawater into their wells and fields. Bangladesh is one of the countries hit hardest by extreme weather, and this vulnerable community is enduring exactly the kind of future that the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow is trying to avoid. It's also experiencing the painful reality of a key issue at the talks- how a promise of financial help for the poorest nations remains unfulfilled after 12 long years. And the story of one woman, Shorbanu Khatun, represents all that's proved least effective about international efforts to tackle climate change so far. I met her in 2009 when Gabura was still reeling from the aftermath of a cyclone that had left the village totally exposed to the waves. She and her four children were living in a makeshift shelter perched on a high narrow ridge, the only safe ground for about 5,000 people. At every high tide, seawater poured through gaps in a series of earth embankments meant to hold back the sea. Whenever they could, the men of the village formed human chains to pass along handfuls of mud to fill the holes - mud was all they had, and it never really did the job. 'Hopenhagen' To highlight the plight of the village - and the needs of all developing countries suffering from climate change - Oxfam offered Shorbanu the chance to make her case on a global stage. She made the long journey to Denmark in December 2009 to the COP15 climate conference, the equivalent of the meeting underway in Glasgow now. When I saw her there, I asked what she made of the giant event - it was given the optimistic billing of "Hopenhagen". "It's good to be with all these big people," she told me, and she seemed upbeat about the chances of them listening. And as it happens, while Shorbanu was in Copenhagen, the richest nations made a promise to the poorest countries - that by 2020 they would give them $100bn a year to deal with the impacts of climate change. At the time, this was seen as a breakthrough offer because it signalled to developing nations that their needs and losses were being taken seriously. But 12 years later, that target has not been met and, as things stand, it won't be until 2023. 'Water everywhere' So what does this mean for Shorbanu and the people of Gabura? A trickle of aid has reached them, but not remotely on the scale promised in Copenhagen, and much of the assistance that has got through was raised within Bangladesh. It has paid for sandbags to reinforce some of the mud embankments, though the biggest storms still breakthrough. A new school has been built and, when cyclones strike, the concrete structure serves as a storm shelter. But all the time the rise of the sea, millimetre by millimetre, fuelled by the melting of the distant polar ice, contaminates local wells and keeps reducing supplies of drinking water. "There is water everywhere around us," Shorbanu says, "but it doesn't have any use. We have a serious crisis." The nearest safe source is more than a mile away, at a solar-powered desalination plant built by the charity Oxfam, but reaching it involves walking in punishing heat and then carrying a heavy container back again, every day. Many people try to rely on water that's closer at hand, but find it causes skin diseases because of the high salt content and - for women in particular - washing in dirty water increases the likelihood of infections. Shorbanu, now aged 44, sounds more worried and desperate than ever. "We have no idea what we can do," she says. "If people help us, then something can change. "We don't have the money to move to other places. I have nothing that I can give to my children." One of her sons now has a job on a shrimp farm. It's a growing industry as fields are turned into ponds, but it creates shortages of locally grown food, exacerbating problems of malnutrition. What does Shorbanu most want from anyone who might read her story, especially the leaders deciding the outcome of the talks in Glasgow? She wants a strong embankment, which will not be destroyed so easily, and easy access to drinking water. But most of all, she says, she wants action: "We have suffered a lot - we do not want our children and grandchildren to suffer more."

The country's largest solar park in Mongla started supplying electricity to the national grid from 25 December 2021. The plant would supply 134.3 megawatts peak (solar power measuring unit). Energon Renewables, a subsidiary of the industrial conglomerate Orion Group, has built the plant on a 350-acre site that had originally been developed for a coal power project in 2014. The Orion Group shelved the coal project and struck a deal with the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) in February 2019 on building the solar park. The solar plant is a milestone in Bangladesh's efforts to reduce emissions as Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at the COP26 announced a "target of generating 40% of our energy from renewable sources by 2041". The $196 million green power plant project stands in striking contrast to the Rampal coal power plant, located just nearby in Bagerhat district. "We developed the project against many odds," said Salman Obaidul Karim, managing director of Orion Group. "We had to deal with all the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. We also had to change our [solar solutions] supplier. And then there was the huge container congestion that created a global supply chain chaos," he added. Salman Obaidul Karim pointed out that the project was a good way to go forward in the post- COP26 world, which aimed at a drastic reduction of carbon emissions by all nations of the world. "We are very proud that the commercial operation date of this project coincides with our 50th year as an independent nation in the month of victory," he noted. Chinese manufacturer Longi Solar has provided the photovoltaics (PV) while Sungrow Power Supply Co Ltd supplied its central inverter solutions. Engineering Procurement Contractor of the project and Mahindra Susten Pvt Ltd worked as an Owner's Engineer and Project Management Consultancy. The project has been financed by a combination of local and foreign lenders. This green project will contribute to reducing around 1,80,000 tonnes of CO2 emission a year. Energon uses energy-efficient Mono Perc cells to capture solar rays and convert them to power, which will then be supplied as Alternating Current electricity to the main grid in Mongla, some 13km away from the plant. Mono Perc cells have the highest efficiency in generating power among the four types of solar cells available in the market. Bagerhat is now home to Bangladesh's largest solar PV plant after overtaking the 73MW Mymensingh solar power facility. Orion Group has five fuel-based power plants with a capacity to generate 511MW of electricity. \</doc>

Nov. 15\'e2\€  HANOI (Vietnam News/ANN) \'e2\€  A report titled "Climate change in Viet Nam, Impacts and Adaptation" has been introduced within the framework of COP26 in Glasgow, UK. The report, developed by more than 60 Vietnamese and French researchers, covers their common willingness to develop a long-term vision of the economic, social and territorial issues of resilient development for Vietnam. Can you briefly introduce the report and its aims? The use of the 2050 Facility to finance this applied research project is fully justified by its long-term prospective approach, a focus on issues of adaptation and resilience and strong expectations on the Vietnamese side. Vietnam is often presented as one of the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, AFD and the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD) have undertaken the ambitious scientific collaboration around the GEMMES Vietnam project with the general objective to support the country in the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement regarding impacts and adaptation. On the occasion of COP26 , this report is proposing an assessment of the socio-economic impacts of climate change in Vietnam by 2050 and scenarios for the country when global average temperature increases by 1.5-2 degrees Celsius, particularly those relating to health, energy, agriculture and household incomes. The report also includes climate change impacts on Vietnam's macroeconomy and the Mekong Delta region. Regarding economic impacts, according to scenarios, when global temperature increases by 1.5 degrees Celsius in mid-2025, Vietnam will lose 4.5 per cent of GDP yearly. When the global temperature increases by 2 degrees Celsius around 2040, the losses account for 6.7 per cent of GDP yearly. In addition to direct visible impacts of climate change, there are indirect/invisible impacts that could result in the reduction of up to 30 per cent of the country's GDP. The report also mentions the complexity of impacts caused by climate change and environmental changes caused by other reasons, particularly due to human activities. About ten days ago, the report was handed over to MONRE. We expect that it would be helpful material for scientists and policymakers when developing and making important climate change policies. What is the visible evidence of climate change and its impacts in Vietnam? Thanh: To assess the impacts of climate change on different sectors, it is necessary to have climate information in the past, at present and in the future. The report built a database on Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam's climate for the last 40 years. Data shows that average temperatures and rainfall in Vietnam increased over recent years, causing extreme weather such as days with high temperatures, the number of heatwaves in a year, floods or droughts. Over the 1981-2018 period, annual temperatures increased by a nationwide average of 0.21 degrees Celsius per decade while the annual rainfall increased slightly by 5.5 per cent for the country as a whole with contrasting trends depending on the region. The trend for the sea-level rise was about 3.6mm per year during the 1993-2018 period. Such data partly reflects that climate change did happen and is happening now in Vietnam. For future projections, two downscale approaches \'e2\€  dynamical and statistical \'e2\€  are applied. The statistical one is used to downscale 31 global models under four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios while experiments are used to dynamically project temperature/rainfall. According to the results, average temperature in Vietnam in the middle or at the end of the 21st century is projected to increase by 1.13 \'c2\'b10.87 degrees Celsius under RCP 2.6 and 1.9\'c2\'b1 0.81 degrees Celsius under RCP 8.5 relative to the baseline 1986-2005 period. Annual rainfall obtained with the dynamic approach is projected to increase in most parts of Vietnam in the future but with a different seasonal distribution. Sea level rise in the coastal areas is projected to increase by between 0.24 and 0.27m in the mid-century period; between 0.44m and 0.73m at the end of the century. What sectors do you think make climate change in Vietnam more serious? What sectors are most affected by climate change's impacts? Espagne: In my opinion, energy, particularly the use of fossil energy and transportation contributes most to worsening climate change. Meanwhile, climate change and its negative impacts such as rising sea levels and more natural disasters heavily affected the agriculture and infrastructure sector. Infrastructure works are more vulnerable to being damaged by natural disasters like floods, storms or earthquakes. Responding to the impacts, changes need to be made. We must shift to greener energies instead of fossil energy, improve energy efficiency and use electrical transportation. Once designing or developing infrastructure works, priority should be given to models that can adapt to harsher weather conditions. To mitigate the negative impacts of climate change, it is proposed that the world reduce 7-8 per cent of the emissions of greenhouse gases for ten continuous years. The rate is similar to the reduction that the world forcibly obtained last year during the COVID-19 pandemic when many human activities and interventions were disrupted. However, we need to reduce the emissions with voluntary measures instead of being placed in a force majeure situation like the pandemic. Does the report have specific recommendations for each sector affected by climate change? Can you name some major recommendations for agriculture and the Mekong Delta region which are said to be most vulnerable to climate change in Vietnam? Each chapter in the report deals with a key issue or sector that is affected by climate change in Vietnam. To compile a chapter, we closely co-operated with relevant agencies, research institutes and experts to analyse the situation in Vietnam and then, offer recommendations. For countries with emerging economies like Vietnam, the adaptation to climate change must not involve a single specific sector but the whole country, the whole economy. Thus, comprehensive inclusive policies are needed to ensure a proper adaptation. The Vietnamese Mekong Delta is for example subject to a combination of drivers of change, of which, anthropogenic drivers \'e2\€  namely hydropower dams, sand mining and groundwater extractions \'e2\€  pose the greatest threats in the first half of this century while climate change will probably dominate the second half of the century. The Mekong Delta region has an extremely low-lying delta plain with an average elevation of about 80cm. Therefore, it's extremely vulnerable to even small changes in relative sea level, which arise from the cumulative effects of global sea-level change and local vertical land movements, for example, land subsidence. So, it is important to limit activities like sand mining or underground water extractions. The Government of Vietnam was aware of the issue and had policies to solve it. The Mekong Delta region is also strongly influenced by the water governance of the whole Mekong Basin. A regional mechanism to manage dams and reservoirs upstream of the Mekong River is very important to ensure water supply for downstream areas. Other key recommendations in the report are to strengthen data gathering and availability, to encourage local resilience and to mainstream adaptation into development planning. Weather forecast and early warning systems and raising awareness on adaptation are still needed to improve preventive and proactive actions. The availability of good statistical data is also crucial to understanding the role of climate finance. Regarding local resilience, the ability of local actors to mobilise various sources to restore and implement everyday pragmatic adjustments and to develop multiple options to cope with shocks, reveals a high degree of flexibility at the local level that can foster adaptive capacity and reinforce resilience. What are your recommendations for better observing climate change in Vietnam? Th\'c3\~nh: When assessing climate change, the most important work is to develop a database. However, one of the biggest problems that researchers face is the uncertainty of results and scenarios. Thus, it is very important to choose results/scenarios. Moreover, uncertainty must be taken into account in all decision-making processes. Once the climate database is developed, it should be used and shared widely. The more people use that database, the more meaningful the data is. For example, the uncertainty in rainfall projection over Vietnam is an issue that needs further careful study in future, particularly when updating the scenarios with the recent available outputs of CMIP 6 \'e2\€  Coupled Model Intercomparison Project of World Climate Research Programme. The downscale results from CMIP 5 Global Climate Models might not cover all probabilities that may occur in the future. A study that applies the probabilities method could be envisaged to build a new high-resolution climate change scenario set for Vietnam. This new approach is expected to better depict the tails of the probability distribution and thus could better take into account the extreme risks that might occur in the future.

After hectic negotiations in the Glasgow climate conference, nations have stricken a deal aimed at fighting climate change. The 26th conference of parties ( COP26 ) had to go into overtime for the deal to be agreed and the two-week event that started on October 31 came to an end on November 13, 2021. The deal titled 'Glasgow Climate Pact' is the first ever agreement to cut use of coal, which is considered to be the most responsible fossil fuel for emitting greenhouse gases. It also committed to providing more money for the developing countries to help stave off the consequences of climate impacts. But many observers thought the promises made in the deal were not enough to limit temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial level. The pledges, if fulfilled, would only limit global warming to about 2.4C and the planet would have to face dangerous consequences. With a temperature rise so far of just 1.1C above pre-industrial level, the world is already facing dangerous heating with record temperatures, wildfires, floods and droughts. They expressed the fear as India and China took a dramatic stance on a commitment to phase out coal that was included in earlier negotiation drafts. Large emitters such as China, Saudi Arabia and Russia had tried to remove the mention of polluting fuels, according to delegates. India's climate minister Bhupender Yadav said developing countries have still to deal with their development agendas and poverty eradication. Amid this situation, he asked how they could promise to phase out coal and fossil fuel subsidies. His statement had prompted the countries in the end to agree on a change in the language of the draft to "phase down" rather than "phase out" coal. This last minute compromise caused expressions of disappointment by many as they thought the negotiators had avoided a major climate concern just to reach a face-saving deal and left an escape route for the major polluters. COP26 President Alok Sharma himself recognized the setback and said he was "deeply sorry" for how events had unfolded. He told delegates in his concluding remarks that it was vital to protect the agreement as a whole. Mr. Sharma said that China and India will have to explain themselves to climate vulnerable nations as the two nations pushed for the language change. He urged China and India to justify their actions in this regard. He, however, termed the deal a "fragile win" and insisted that it "keeps 1.5C within reach". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson expected the world to "look back on COP26 in Glasgow as the beginning of the end of climate change". "There is still a huge amount more to do in the coming years. But today's agreement is a big step forward and, critically, we have the first ever international agreement to phase down coal and a roadmap to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees," he said. John Kerry, the US envoy for climate, viewed that the summit would result in a decision that "was somehow going to end the crisis". UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: "We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe... it is time to go into emergency mode - or our chance of reaching net zero will itself be zero." As part of the agreement, the parties are expected to pledge further major carbon cuts in the COP27 next year with the aim of reaching the 1.5C goal. "We would like to express our profound disappointment that the language we agreed on, on coal and fossil fuels subsidies, has been further watered down," Swiss environment minister Simonetta Sommaruga said. "This will not bring us closer to 1.5C, but make it more difficult to reach it." Some observers have, however, considered the deal as a victory and stressed that it is the first time coal is explicitly mentioned in UN documents of this type. "They changed a word but they can't change the signal coming out of this COP - that the era of coal is ending," said Greenpeace international executive director Jennifer Morgan. Finance was a contentious issue as the developed nations missed the date (2020) to provide US$100bn annually to help developing nations adapt to climate effects and make the transition to clean energy. Mr Sharma, however, claimed around $500bn would be mobilized by 2025. Poorer countries had been calling throughout the meeting for funding through the principle of loss and damage - the idea that richer countries should compensate poorer ones for climate change effects they are unable to adapt to. This was one of the big disappointments of the COP26 for many delegations. Several countries that stood to benefit, however, backed the agreement on the basis that talks on loss and damage would continue. "We recognize the presidency's efforts to try and create a space to find common ground. The final landing zone, however, is not even close to capturing what we had hoped," said Lia Nicholson, delegate for Antigua and Barbuda, while speaking on behalf of the small island states. The COP26 However, COP26 By other terms of the wide-ranging set of decisions, resolutions and statements that make up the outcome of COP26 , governments were, among other things, asked to provide tighter deadlines for updating their plans to reduce emissions. On the thorny question of financing from developed countries in support of climate action in developing countries, the text emphasizes the need to mobilize climate finance 'from all sources to reach the level needed to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, including significantly increasing support for developing country Parties, beyond $100 billion per year'. 'Negotiations are never easy...this is the nature of consensus and multilateralism,' said Patricia Espinosa, the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). She stressed that for every announcement made during the past two weeks, the expectation is that the implementation 'plans and the fine print' will follow. 'Let us enjoy what we accomplished but also prepare for what is coming,' Ms. Espinosa said, after recognizing the advancements on adaptation, among others. Earlier during the conference's final stocktaking plenary, many countries lamented that the package of agreed decisions was not enough. Some called it "disappointing", but overall, said they recognized it was balanced for what could be agreed at this moment in time and given their differences. Countries like Nigeria, Palau, the Philippines, Chile and Turkey all said that although there were imperfections, they broadly supported the text. 'It is (an) incremental step forward but not in line with the progress needed. It will be too late for the Maldives. This deal does not bring hope to our hearts,' said the Maldives' top negotiator in a bittersweet speech. Mr John Kerry said the text 'is a powerful statement' and assured delegates that his country will engage constructively in a dialogue on "loss and damage" and adaptation, two of issues that proved most difficult for the negotiators to agree upon. Beyond the political negotiations and the Leaders' Summit, COP26 brought together about 50,000 participants online and in-person to share innovative ideas, solutions, attend cultural events and build partnerships and coalitions. The conference heard many encouraging announcements. One of the biggest was that leaders from over 120 countries, representing about 90 percent of the world's forests, pledged to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030, the date by which the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to curb poverty and secure the planet's future are supposed to have been achieved. There was also a methane pledge, led by the United States and the European Union, by which more than 100 countries agreed to cut emissions of this greenhouse gas by 2030. Meanwhile, more than 40 countries - including major coal-users such as Poland, Vietnam and Chile - agreed to shift away from coal, one of the biggest generators of CO2 emissions. The private sector also showed strong engagement with nearly 500 global financial services firms agreeing to align $130 trillion - some 40 percent of the world's financial assets - with the goals set out in the Paris Agreement, including limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Also, in a surprise for many, the United States and China pledged to boost climate cooperation over the next decade. In a joint declaration they said they had agreed to take steps on a range of issues, including methane emissions, transition to clean energy and decarbonization. They also reiterated their commitment to keep the 1.5C goal alive. Regarding green transport, more than 100 national governments, cities, states and major car companies signed the?Glasgow Declaration on Zero-Emission Cars and Vans?to end the sale of internal combustion engines by 2035 in leading markets, and by 2040 worldwide.? At least 13 nations also committed to end the sale of fossil fuel powered heavy duty vehicles by 2040. Many 'smaller' but equally inspiring commitments were made over the two weeks, including one by 11 countries which created the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA). Ireland, France, Denmark, and Costa Rica among others, as well as some subnational governments, launched this first-of-its kind alliance to set an end date for national oil and gas exploration and extraction. Finance was extensively discussed throughout the session and there was consensus in the need to continue increasing support to developing countries. The call to at least double finance for adaptation was welcomed by the Parties. The duty to fulfill the pledge of providing US$100 billion annually from developed to developing countries was also reaffirmed. And a process to define the new global goal on finance was launched. On mitigation, the persistent gap in emissions has been clearly identified and Parties collectively agreed to work to reduce that gap and to ensure that the world continues to advance during the present decade, so that the rise in the average temperature is limited to 1.5 degrees. Parties are encouraged to strengthen their emissions reductions and to align their national climate action pledges with the Paris Agreement. In addition, a key outcome is the conclusion of the so-called Paris rulebook. An agreement was reached on the fundamental norms related to Article 6 on carbon markets, which will make the Paris Agreement fully operational. This will give certainty and predictability to both market and non-market approaches in support of mitigation as well as adaptation. And the negotiations on the Enhanced Transparency Framework were also concluded, providing for agreed tables and formats to account and report for targets and emissions. The Heads of State and Government and the delegates who participated in COP26 brought to the conference a keen awareness of the severity of the climate crisis that the world faces and of the need to live up to the historic responsibility of setting the world on the path to address this existential challenge. Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina urged the developed countries to submit their NDCs in line with their obligations under the 2015 Paris Agreement and implement those to cut carbon emissions to negate climate change impacts. 'The major emitters must submit ambitious NDCs, and implement those,' she said in her statement at the COP26 . She highlighted that compromising its development needs, Bangladesh updated its NDC, scrapping 10 coal-based power plants projects involving US$12 billion foreign investment and setting a roadmap to have 40 percent of the country's energy from renewable sources by 2041 alongside various other measures. Sheikh Hasina, also chair of the 48-nation Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) and V20 (The Vulnerable20), demanded developed countries fulfil their commitments of providing US$100 billion annually with a 50:50 balance between adaptation and mitigation. She also sought transfer of developed world's clean and green technology at affordable costs to the most vulnerable countries, reminding the developed nations that CVF countries also need development. 'The issue of loss and damage must be addressed, including global sharing of responsibility for climate migrants displaced by sea-level rise, salinity increase, river erosion, floods, and draughts,' she added. COP26 retained a significant demand for nations to set tougher climate pledges next year, rather than every five years, as they are currently required to do - an acknowledgement that existing commitments to cut emissions of planet-heating greenhouse gases are nowhere near enough. Host country Britain said a UN committee should report next year on progress towards delivering the $100 billion in overall annual climate funding that rich nations had promised by 2020 but failed to deliver. And it said governments should meet in 2022, 2024 and 2026 to discuss climate finance. Even $100 billion a year is far short of poorer countries' actual needs, which could hit $300 billion by 2030 in adaptation costs alone, according to the United Nations, in addition to economic losses from crop failure or climate-related disasters. Saleemul Huq, director of the ICCCAD climate NGO, said the British COP26 presidency had been "bullied" overnight into rejecting specific loss and damage funding. "The UK's words to the vulnerable countries have been proven to be totally unreliable," he said. \</doc>

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has said effective action plans are not possible without adequate, sustained, and flexible climate finance. 'It's sad and disappointing that till now the major greenhouse gas-emitting countries have failed to deliver their promised annual amount of 100 billion dollars,' she said. She made the statement while presiding over Climate Vulnerable Forum Leaders' Dialogue: Forging a CVF- COP26 Climate Emergency Pact at COP26 venue here on Tuesday. Secretary General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres and CVF Thematic Ambassador Saima Wazed Hossain, among others, spoke at the event. 'Faced with the existential threat of climate change, we, the CVF members, at this COP, demand that developed countries provide a Delivery Plan of the total 500 billion dollars for each of the entire 5-year period from 2020 to 2024, with a 50:50 ratio between the adaptation and mitigation,' Hasina said. She said the CVF members are among the countries most affected by the adverse impacts of climate change despite having no historical role or responsibility for this crisis. 'At the same time, we, the most vulnerable countries, do not have either sufficient capability or capacity to overcome these challenges. This unfortunate dilemma, and for survival, we've been swayed to adopt measures on our own to face the devastating consequences of climate change,' she added. Effective climate plans not possible without funds: Hasina The Prime Minister said Bangladesh has launched the 'Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan', named in honour of Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. 'This plan is set to guide our development path through a low-carbon strategy. Other 37 CVF members will likewise, develop their own such plans of climate resilience to achieve climate prosperity,' she said. Sheikh Hasina, also the CVF chair, said the CVF has also come up with a 'Climate Emergency Pact.' This Pact addresses the climate finance Delivery Plan and asks for raising ambition at every single COP, especially from the major pollution emitting nations. 'This will ensure continuous progress so that the temperature rise is contained within 1.5 degree Celsius. We call upon the Presidency of COP26 , and all Members of the UNFCCC, to adopt the Climate Emergency Pact as a part of the COP26 Declaration,' she said. \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 6 -- Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen on Friday expressed optimism about adequate flow of funds to address climate change- related challenges, noting that Bangladesh has taken a very strong leadership role in COP26 . Foreign Secretary Masud Bin Momen and Bangladesh High Commissioner to the UK Saida Muna Tasneem were present, reports UNB. The COP26 The Foreign Minister said Bangladesh needs to work a lot, especially in preparing good proposals, which he sees as a challenge but achievable. "We've a long way to go. We've a challenge but we can manage to get plenty of funds," he said, adding that there is willingness to provide funds. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has been identified as one of the five influential dealmakers at COP26 being held at Glasgow, according to a BBC report that described Hasina as "voice of the vulnerable". The four other influential dealmakers who will have a major influence on the summit's success or failure are China's climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua, Saudi Arabia's Ayman Shasly, UK minister Alok Sharma, Spain's minister for ecological transition Teresa Ribera, and Bangladesh's PM Sheikh Hasina. The Prime Minister spoke on behalf of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a grouping of 48 of the countries most threatened by climate change. The Foreign Minister said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has become a moral voice on climate issues. The Prime Minister told the COP26 that Bangladesh cancelled 10 coal-based power plants involving 12 billion dollars of foreign investment, just to supplement its efforts against the adverse impacts of climate change. "Bangladesh has taken a leadership role and the Prime Minister has made a very decisive action (cancelling coal power plants). We showed the rest of the world," Dr Momen said, adding that their collective aim is to save the planet. Responding to a question on fugitive convicts, the Foreign Minister said he raised it and it will further be discussed in detail in the Home Minister-level meeting. "We want good governance. We want the rule of law. You (UK) should be supportive of us," he conveyed to the British side. Responding to a question on those who are spreading disinformation, Dr Momen said some people do not want to see the development of Bangladesh. "Hopefully, they'll understand their mistakes. False propaganda never sustains." The Foreign Minister said they are working hard under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and a dramatic change is coming in Bangladesh. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina addressed the key segment of the COP26 on November 1. She also attended a joint meeting of the CVF and Commonwealth as the chief guest. At the COP26 Second, Hasina said, developed countries should fulfil their commitments of providing 100 billion dollars annually with a 50:50 balance between adaptation and mitigation. Third, she said, the developed countries should disseminate clean and green technology at affordable costs to the most vulnerable countries. The development needs of the CVF countries also need to be considered. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Dhaka, June 4 -- Bangladesh and the United Kingdom are planning to sign a "climate accord" before COP26 and expressed optimism for a successful outcome of the COP26 with a possible CVF- COP26 event at Glasgow. The two countries agreed to work together to put nature at the heart of their climate action, building on the 2020 Leaders' Pledge for Nature and realising shared commitments towards conservation of biodiversity and ecosystems, as well as those under the Global Ocean Alliance and the Commonwealth Blue Charter. As founding members of the Adaptation Action Coalition, Bangladesh and the UK renewed their commitment to work together with other Coalition members to accelerate adaptation on the ground with a particular emphasis on promoting locally led climate action. The two countries will do more to avert, minimise, and address Loss and Damage, said the joint statement on climate action between the two countries. Bangladesh and the UK will work together to get the network operating, following the UK-led Climate and Development Ministerial and drawing on the expertise in the UK, Bangladesh and internationally. COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma met Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen on June 2 during the visit to Bangladesh on June 2-4. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, during their meeting, said Bangladesh expects the UK to promote the interests and priorities of climate vulnerable countries to international platforms. Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh is going to be the worst affected like some other countries across the globe due to the climate change even though the carbon emission of these countries are very negligible. "We'll be affected massively," she said. She said the government has taken various programmes to increase the renewable energy use in mitigating the demand for power. There are currently some 5.8 million solar power connections in Bangladesh. The Prime Minister said her government and the Awami League as a party are engaged in massive tree plantation to improve the environment of the country. Talking about the Covid-19 pandemic and vaccination, the Prime Minister said the government has adopted various measures to run the economy apart from containing the coronavirus infection although Bangladesh is a densely populated country. COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma has invited the Prime Minister to attend the COP-26 to be held in November next in Glasgow. Alok Sharma hoped that Bangladesh under the leadership of the Prime Minister will play an important role as the current president of Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF). Clean Energy Transition "We can work together to make sure that it is not just the public finance but also private finance that is coming into Bangladesh," he told reporters in a joint media briefing at Foreign Service Academy. Responding to a question, Sharma said he discussed the coal power issue during his meeting with Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen noting that he raised the issue not just in Bangladesh but around the world. He laid emphasis on alternative sources of energy - clean energy - if the dependency on coal power is cut globally. To supplement, Foreign Minister Dr Momen said they are scaling down some of the coal power industries as part of reducing dependency on coal power. "We planned to have around 40 percent renewable energy by 2041. We'll be looking for more renewable energy and we're asking for technology to support renewable energy," he said. Bangladesh is among the fast growing economies with significant renewable energy potential, said the UK government. Responding to a question on US$ 100 billion climate fund for developing countries, Sharma said the donor and developed countries need to step up noting that it is a matter of trust and it is very important they deliver on it. He appreciated Bangladesh's leadership in terms of adaptation and resilience saying they saw a very limited damage during recent cyclones due to Bangladesh's works done to that front. Sharma expressed satisfaction over private sector's interest towards clean energy transition but they want long-term policy and clear regulations from all governments around the world On the Sundarbans, he said they want to see further protection given to areas such as mangroves. Dr Momen said they want to save the planet. "We're capable of doing it if there's strong partnership and collaboration." During his engagements in Dhaka, Sharma discussed shared priorities with Bangladesh which remains a "crucial" partner on the road to COP26 . He discussed the needs of countries most vulnerable to climate change, to ensure they are equipped to deal with its current and damaging effects ahead of COP26 . They agreed to demonstrate sustained leadership to tackle the climate emergency bilaterally and globally. The two countries agreed to exchange expertise, share technology, facilitate partnerships, and identify practical solutions to common climate challenges. Working Together They expressed their resolve to work together to contribute to ensuring all countries meet their commitments under the Paris Agreement, and improve the resilience of those most vulnerable to climate change. The two countries reaffirmed their strong and steadfast commitment to strengthening implementation of UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. They recognized the urgent need to make ambitious and accelerated efforts to limit average temperature rises to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, strengthen adaptation to the impacts of climate change, and scale up finance and support towards these ends. They called for increased climate action in the lead up to the COP26 Summit, which will be held in Glasgow in November keeping in consideration the development needs of individual countries. They highlighted their commitment to achieving an ambitious outcome at COP26 , including through finalising the outstanding mandates of the Paris Rulebook. The COP26 The COP26 President-Designate welcomed the prospect of Bangladesh transitioning away from coal to clean and renewable energy, which will create economic growth and sustainable jobs. The Foreign Minister of Bangladesh underscored the necessity of securing commitments from global leaders, especially the G20, to curb global emissions substantially, arrest global temperature at 1.5 degrees, secure maximal climate finance especially for adaptation and concrete actions on low-carbon technology transfer. Bangladesh is committed to submitting an ambitious updated NDC in coming weeks, with a Net Zero target in the near future. The UK COP26 Presidency and Bangladesh recognise the importance of developed countries delivering their collective climate finance goal to jointly mobilise US$100 billion annually by 2020 through to 2025 from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral and in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation, to address the needs of developing countries. COP26 President-Designate welcomed Bangladesh's proactive leadership as the President of the Climate Vulnerable Forum and voicing the existential threats and extreme climate risks faced by 48 of the most climate vulnerable countries. He welcomed Bangladesh's Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan and Decade 2030 for capturing growth and prosperity through maximal resilience. The Foreign Minister commended the UK's dynamic leadership of COP26 and their special focus on mitigation, adaptation and resilience, climate financing and international cooperation. He also praised the UK for being the first major economy to declare Net Zero emissions by 2050. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Dhaka Courier.

Feb. 15 Tokyo(The Japan News/ANN)- As the COVID-19 pandemic enters its third year, there continue to be concerning issues on a global level, such as the spread of the omicron variant of the novel coronavirus, crises related to energy and climate, and tensions between nations. Can the world solve these issues through diplomatic efforts and international cooperation? The Yomiuri Shimbun conducted an online interview with the World Economic Forum's president, Borge Brende, a former foreign minister of Norway, to find out what he has to say about these issues. For the first time in two years, the WEF plans to organize an in-person version of its annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. Usually held in January, the 2022 Davos annual meeting is scheduled for May. In January, a virtual event called Davos Agenda was held, after which this interview was conducted. The following is excerpted from the interview with Brende, who emphasized that "global challenges need global solutions."  Social market economy [Postponing the annual meeting] was not an easy decision for us. But I believe Davos Agenda was like a curtain-raiser to the important topics at the meeting in May. For instance, in Davos Agenda Prime Minister Fumio Kishida introduced his "new form of capitalism" notion, and Japan can become a role model. I think what Prime Minister Kishida alluded to is a more inclusive market economy, like a social market economy that creates decent jobs and secures wealth that trickles down in accordance with what the planet can take. My view is that this still can lead to substantial economic growth over time, leading to a more sustained economic growth. We will have to come back to Davos in May and focus on economy because we are now seeing a slowing global growth that has impact on the stock markets. We are not out of the woods. We need to know how to balance this continuing need to stimulate the economy while also controlling growing inflation. Even the inflation in Japan is increasing. That hasn't happened for decades, right? So we are moving into new territory.  Common interest For the annual meeting in May, not only economic revival, but also climate, biodiversity, and inclusion will be crucial topics. I think there is that extra responsibility on our shoulders to see a real outcome. Even if we're living in a polarized world where the big nations don't see eye to eye on many issues, we still know that global challenges need global solutions. I'm optimistic that there are areas where we can find agreement because there is so much common interest in finding solutions. In the last minutes [of the U.N. climate change conference COP26 ] in Glasgow, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry came together with Chinese climate envoy [Xie Zhenhua], and they agreed on a text that kept [the target to limit global warming to] 1.5 C alive. Unfortunately, it's easy to use sources that are less environmentally friendly, and I think that's coal. Hopefully, there will be technology breakthroughs in the years to come. It has to be cheaper to carbon capture, storage and utilization. It has to be possible in the future to capture carbon from the air. But about the gap between the developed world and the developing world, there definitely is a gap. I think developing countries are also willing to do their part, provided that there's also financing available for this transition [to renewables] and that's why I thought it was important that we came close to a real commitment [at COP26 ] of implementing the pledges from Copenhagen [2009 summit, when wealthy nations agreed to provide developing nations with] $100 billion a year for climate energy transformation. In May, I would like to see more companies from sectors like aluminum, steel, aviation, shipping, fertilizer take on commitments. If you want to sell to us, you have to have a greener supply chain and you have to have less of a CO2 footprint. This really matters. We have to start to implement the low-hanging fruit and other commitments because in reality climate change is happening. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home \</doc>

Appreciating Bangladesh's adaptation and resilience, COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma on Wednesday pledged to help Bangladesh having a 'clean energy transition'. 'We can work together to make sure that it is not just the public finance but also private finance that is coming into Bangladesh,' he told reporters in a joint media briefing at Foreign Service Academy.

Dr Momen said they want to save the planet. 'We're capable of doing it if there's strong partnership and collaboration.' Sharma arrived here on Wednesday morning on a two-day visit to strengthen support for UK COP26 climate priorities ahead of hosting the crucial UN climate change summit in Glasgow this November. State Minister for Foreign Affairs Md. Shahriar Alam received Sharma at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at 09.20am upon his arrival. Sharma met Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at her official residence Ganobhaban and attended "UK- Bangladesh Climate Partnership Roundtable" Foreign Service Academy before holding the joint briefing. During his engagements in Dhaka, Sharma discussed shared priorities with Bangladesh which remains a "crucial" partner on the road to COP26 . COP26 . Ahead of his visit, Sharma said last week, the G7 made history with a major step forward towards consigning coal to history and moving to a decarbonised power system but tackling the climate crisis must be a global effort, which leaves no one behind.

Nov. 2 Kolkata(The Statesman/ANN)- The world's response to the climate crisis must involve adaptation and not just mitigation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressed at the COP26 summit in the Scottish city of Glasgow on Monday. "Adaptation has not received the kind of importance in global climate debate that mitigation has. This is an injustice to those developing nations that are more impacted by climate change. We will need to make adaptation the key component of our development policies and projects," he said in a 2-minute speech. "Just like in India, climate is a big challenge for the agriculture sector for most developing countries. There are changes in the cropping patterns, untimely rains and floods, or crops are destroyed by regular typhoons," PM Modi said. He listed how the Indian government's projects like Tapwater for All, Clean India Mission and Clean Cooking Fuel for all "have not only provided adaptation benefits to our citizens in need but also improved their quality of life". Earlier in the day PM Modi on Monday met his British counterpart Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the 26th session of the Conference of Parties (COP-26). Modi and his Israeli counterpart Naftali Bennett had their first in-person meet on Monday since the latter took office, on the sidelines of the o He reached Glasgow on Sunday to participate in the COP26 meeting. He met members of the Indian community in Glasgow on Monday to strengthen people-to-people bonds between the two countries ahead of his participation in the 26th session of the Conference of Parties ( COP26 ). At COP26 , the world leaders are expected to work to achieve the completion of Paris Agreement implementation guidelines, mobilisation of climate finance, actions to strengthen climate adaptation, technology development and transfer and keeping in reach the goals of limiting the rise in global temperatures. The high-level segment of COP-26 is titled the World Leaders' Summit (WLS) and the Summit will be attended by heads of state/government of more than 120 countries. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home \</doc>

Nov. 4 Dhaka(The Daily Star/ANN)- The outcomes of the COP26 Summit depend on Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and four other such influential dealmakers, who have been tasked with committing the 197 countries to the changes, according to a BBC report. While Sir David Attenborough, Greta Thunberg, and other popular world leaders gain traction at COP26 For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. According to the BBC report, the four others are China's climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua, Saudi Arabia's Ayman Shasly, UK minister Alok Sharma and Spain's minister for ecological transition Teresa Ribera. The success or failure of the summit depends on these five negotiators, who have a major influence on the outcome. This is mainly because the countries not only have varying national priorities, but nations forge alliances with each other and form negotiating blocs even within the dialogue. Hence, countries can be part of different negotiating groups simultaneously. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina represents the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a group of 48 countries who would be the worst sufferers of climate change. She is the mouthpiece of those who experience climate change firsthand to the COP. Last year, about one-fourth of Bangladesh was hit by floods, leaving millions inundated, the BBC report said. "People like Prime Minister Hasina put a human face on climate change and can help world leaders understand what climate change already looks like," Dr Jen Allan, an expert in international relations from Cardiff University, told BBC. When it comes to negotiations, the Climate Vulnerable Forum and the Least Developed Countries group have had a strong track record, despite not being so economically well-off. "These countries punch above their economic weight, so to speak," said Dr Allan. "Because they are a strong moral voice, and because decisions are taken by consensus, they have been able to get a good deal of progressive decisions through the UN machinery," she added. Bangladeshi negotiator Quamrul Chowdhury, who belongs to Sheikh Hasina's negotiation team, when talking to BBC, said the vulnerable nations are coming to Glasgow with a clear set of goals. "There are over one billion people now on the hook of adverse climate impacts," he told BBC. "We want to get them off the hook by getting the richest countries to steeply cut back emissions, to fix the outstanding Paris rules, to ramp up climate finance and to address loss and damage." China's veteran climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua had a close working partnership with the US climate ambassador Senator John Kerry. Their relationship was crucial in building the 2015 Paris agreement, which made countries commit to reduce emissions. China's importance lies in its size, being the world's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide  and at COP26 it is a key member of several negotiating blocs. Many Arab countries and developing nations follow the lead of Saudi Arabia. A successful outcome will not be possible in the COP26 , without their agreement. Formerly an employee of state oil company Saudi Aramco, in the last decade, Saudi Arabia's Ayman Shasly has been chairman of the Arab group of climate negotiators. The man tasked with bringing the COP26 talks to a successful conclusion is British minister Alok Sharma. Serving as President for COP26 , his words and actions would be subject to intense scrutiny. Spain's minister for the ecological transition Teresa Ribera has been involved in the UN climate negotiations process for decades. During her time in the government, she has helped oversee Spain's transition away from coal, which has been hailed as a model for countries to make the move to renewables without eliminating jobs. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home \</doc>

COP26 President Alok Sharma has announced \£3120 million to support climate action in Bangladesh. The \£3120million new programme for Bangladesh, from 2021 to 2027, will scale up locally-led adaptation, expand renewable energy, tackle pollution and waste, and develop and empower the next generation of climate leaders. The funding for the Bangladesh Climate and Environment Programme will help build resilience, prevent pollution, protect biodiversity, strengthen renewable energy and better manage waste, while also supporting women's access to finance, education and skills in Bangladesh. He also announced how \£3165 million of UK funding will tackle climate change, including by addressing the gender inequalities that make women and girls more vulnerable to climate change, and by empowering women and girls to be leaders in climate action. Speaking from COP26 in Glasgow, Alok Sharma said gender and climate are profoundly intertwined. 'We see that in terms of the impact of climate change, which affects women and girls disproportionately. And we see it in terms of tackling climate change, where we know our efforts are more effective when women and girls are at their hearts.' He said they are committed to women's participation at every level of climate action and to placing gender at the heart of all our efforts. This is why gender cuts across the full COP fortnight. 'And it's why we're hosting Gender Day today.' Through its COP26 \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 5 -- State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Dr Enamur Rahman has said Bangladesh has adopted a 37 billion dollar programme for mitigation of climate change damages in the country's coastal areas. The statement gave the information while addressing a COP26 side event organised by the ministry in Glasgow on Thursday afternoon, according to a UNB report published on Friday. Climate change-related incidents displace about 50,000 people every year in Bangladesh, the minister added. In his speech at the event, Enamur said Bangladesh is widely considered as one of the most vulnerable countries to global climate change. He said 30.7 million people were displaced due to natural disasters in 2020. In 2017, Bangladesh was the 6th most stricken country among 135 countries that experienced displacement due to floods, he said. The World Bank's Groundswell report also estimated that by 2050 19 million people of Bangladesh will be migrating internally due to slow-onset climate change processes such as water scarcity, declining crop productivity and sea-level rise. The Government of Bangladesh (GoB) recognises that displacement has grave implications for the rights and entitlements of individuals and communities. Bangladesh has framed its National Strategy on Internal Displacement Management in January 2021. "I am confident that COP26 will be able to develop a mechanism for institutionalizing loss and damage," he said. "I am also hopeful that COP26 will be able to introduce concessional instruments in case of climate finance," he added.

Dhaka, Nov. 17 -- Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has described the adoption of the "Dhaka-Glasgow Declaration" in the COP26 conference as an outcome of playing a leading role by Bangladesh in climate diplomacy. "I believe that the "Dhaka-Glasgow Declaration" adopted by the heads of the government and state of the most 48 climate-vulnerable countries led by Bangladesh in the just-concluded COP26 Summit (the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties) was an outcome of the leading role played by our country in climate diplomacy," she said. The prime minister came up with the statement while addressing a press conference on Wednesday arranged to brief media about her 14-day official visit to the United Kingdom and France, reports BSS. Journalists from various print and electronic media were present at Ganabhaban and Prime Minister's Office (PMO) in Dhaka. Sheikh Hasina said the major feat of the COP26 is that heads of the state and government of the world agreed to further accelerate the climate funding process including allocation of $100 billion every year keeping consistency with the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). "A total of 141 countries including Bangladesh pledged to check all kinds of deforestation move by 2030," she added. Noting that UK-based news agency - BBC - in its recent report selected her as one of the five deal-makers of COP26 , Sheikh Hasina said: "I feel honour to this end considering the achievements of Bangladesh's growing economic capacity and the people's trust in our Moral Foreign Policy." Highlighting her visit details, the premier said she returned home in the morning on November 14 last after the end of her two-week visit to the United Kingdom, France, and Glasgow, Scotland, the venue of the United Nations COP26 . In different phases of this visit, she said, CVF Thematic Ambassador Saima Wazed, Foreign Minister, Education Minister, Minister for Forests, Environment and Climate Change, State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources, State Minister for Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister's Private Industry and Investment Adviser, Parliament Members and Secretaries and high officials of different ministries of the government, politicians and distinguished personalities were her entourage members. The prime minister said she attended six multilateral and five bilateral meetings in the main part of the COP26 World Leaders' Summit and side events on two days. She said in the post-Covid world, as the incumbent Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum-CVF, an organisation of 48 countries, her participation in the COP26 was very important for protecting the interests of Bangladesh and CVF member countries. On the first day of the conference on November 1, as a CVF-Chair, she joined a function titled 'The CVF-Commonwealth High-Level Panel Discussion' jointly arranged by Bangladesh and Commonwealth as the chief guest. In the afternoon on that day, she delivered a speech at the main event of COP26 World Leaders' Summit presenting the expectations and demands of Bangladesh in the presence of heads of state and government of the world. In her speech, she mentioned that Bangladesh is one of the vulnerable countries due to climate change, although Bangladesh has a liability of only 0.47 per cent in global carbon emission. Besides, she appraised different initiatives of Bangladesh including Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) updated to UNFCCC, Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan and Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund. As the CVF chair, Sheikh Hasina presented the efforts for building a Climate Emergency Pact before the world leaders. In her speech, she placed a five-point proposal urging global leaders to work together. These are-- the major emitters must submit ambitious NDCs, and implement those, developed countries should fulfil their commitments of providing 100 billion dollars annually with a 50:50 balance between adaptation and mitigation, ensuring entrance of most vulnerable countries to eco-friendly advanced technology, the development needs of the CVF countries also need to be considered, the issue of loss and damage must be addressed and working together to resolve the climate refugee problem created due to climate change and building a livable world for the future generation. After the summit, she attended a roundtable titled "Action and Solidarity - The Critical Decade" at the invitation of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The UK premier and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi jointly chaired the meeting. Around 30 heads of the state and government joined the meeting. Sheikh Hasina said she focused on the steps taken by Bangladesh in facing climate change challenges and what kinds of decisions should be taken in the COP26 to implement the goals of the Paris Agreement. In the afternoon, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Co-Chair Bill Gates called on her. The premier urged Bill Gates to utilise Bangladesh's local adaptability model in other climate change vulnerable countries through Gates Foundation. On the second day morning of COP26 , she joined a bilateral meeting with President of the conference Alok Sharma. Alok Sharma hugely praised Bangladesh leadership in the international arena in facing climate change challenges. Later, she joined the "High-Level Panel on Women and Climate Change" arranged by First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon with the cooperation of UN Women. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Barbados Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley joined the event along with Sheikh Hasina. Later, she joined a bilateral meeting with First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon. The First Minister immensely praised Bangladesh bold and time-befitting steps in facing the climate change crisis. She also met Britain's Prince Charles and in the afternoon, the premier called on her UK Counterpart Boris Johnson. During the meeting, the UK Prime Minister hoped that the depth and circumference of friendly ties between Bangladesh and the UK would be further enhanced. Apart from climate issues, other important bilateral issues including trade and investment, vaccine diplomacy and the Rohingya crisis were focused in the meeting. Later, Sheikh Hasina chaired the "CVF COP 26 Leaders' Dialogue". Heads of the governments and states and ministers of CVF member countries, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry, COP 26 President and British MP Alok Sharma and CVF Thematic Ambassador for Vulnerability Saima Wazed and noted personalities joined the dialogue. In the meeting, the UN Secretary-General hugely praised Bangladesh leadership and stressed allocating committed money for climate adaptability. John Kerry pledged to make a framework to provide a committed fund of $100 billion every year from the year 2022 along with Japan and other developed countries. Alok Sharma highlighted that climate-vulnerable countries including Bangladesh have already started facing adverse atmosphere due to climate change. In the conference, the "Dhaka-Glasgow Declaration" was adopted. Sheikh Hasina presented a keynote speech in the Scottish Parliament on "A Bangladesh Vision for Global Climate Prosperity". Besides, she visited Bangladesh Pavilion which was set up at the conference. On November 3, she reached Glasgow from London and on the same day she attended a reception ceremony at an invitation of British parliament members Rushanara Ali and Jitesh Gadhia. She presented a keynote paper titled 'Bangladesh at 50: A Resilient Delta' at the function. where members of both houses of the British Parliament, the invited members of the British Bangladeshi community were present. On November 4, she spoke at the inaugural session of the Bangladesh Investment Summit. The Prime Minister unveiled two books - 'Secret Documents of Intelligence Branch on Father of the Nation of Bangladesh, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman' and 'Mujib: An Introduction' translated into English by London-based publication house Taylor & Francis. Besides, she inaugurated a painting exhibition titled 'Bangabandhu: A Centenary Collection' and inaugurated the extended part of the Chancery Bhaban of the Bangladesh High Commission in London and its Bangabandhu Lounge. When the premier arrived in Paris from London on November 9, she was given a red carpet reception at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. From the airport, she went straightly to the Elysee Palace, the official residence of France President Emmanuel Macron where she held an exclusive meeting with President Emanuel Macron. During the meeting, various international and regional issues, including the development of bilateral relations between Bangladesh and France, the celebration of the golden jubilee of diplomatic relations between the two countries and the Rohingya issue, were discussed. Sheikh Hasina proposed President Emanuel Macron start a regular diplomatic dialogue between Bangladesh and France. He welcomed it. President Macron agreed to increase the two countries' activities in the areas of defence and economy and other sectors and work together to maintain regional peace and stability. On the same day, the Bangladesh premier was conferred with 'the Guard of Honour in the presence of high-ranking French government officials. Later, she held a bilateral meeting with the French prime minister at his Matignon official residence. During her visit to Paris, she joined a meeting with the president of the France National Assembly, Richard Ferron. She invited a parliamentary delegation of France to visit Bangladesh marking the golden jubilee of the diplomatic relations between Bangladesh and France. She visited the French Senate. The President of the Senate Session read out a citation lauding the role of our government and my leadership in the advancement of Bangladesh's development.

Dhaka, Oct. 18 -- A noteworthy victim of climate change, Bangladesh is likely to incur losses worth US$ 2.2 billion on average per year, which is equivalent to 1.5 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP), due to floods, according to a keynote presentation. Besides, global warming will also cause economic losses for the country, as with the current rate, annual average temperature in Bangladesh will increase by 0.94 per cent within 2030. In such circumstances, the upcoming COP26 conference is important for Bangladesh along with other climate vulnerable countries to raise their voice, the keynote said. The paper was presented at CPD-ICCCAD Virtual Dialogue on 'Bangladesh's Expectations from COP26 ' jointly organised by the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) and International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) on Sunday. Special Envoy, Climate Vulnerable Forum Presidency of Bangladesh Md Abul Kalam Azad joined as the special guest, Ambassador and Head to the Delegation of the European Union to Bangladesh Charles Whiteley joined as the guest of honour. The CPD Chairman Professor Rehman Sobhan chaired the dialogue while Development Director, FCDO Bangladesh, British High Commission Judith Herbertson, the ICCCAD Director Dr Saleemul Huq and CPD Trustees Khushi Kabir spoke at the virtual setting, among others. Dr Fahmida Khatun, the CPD executive director and Professor Mizan R Khan, deputy director of the ICCCAD presented the keynote. Professor Rehman Sobhan said Bangladesh is a notable victim of global warming for which the country is not liable, rather many developed countries are. The initiatives taken by Bangladesh alone cannot help improve its climate change impact, he said. Dr Saleemul Huq said what Bangladesh is going to get from COP26 is a burning question. He also said, "The global leaders participating in the imminent COP26 will decide whether they will leave a liveable planet for the future generation". He mentioned along with the government, the country's private sector has a huge role to play for the sake of the environment. According to the keynote, in Bangladesh, annual average temperatures increased by 0.64 per cent in 2018, which was 10.20 times faster than the annual average temperature increase of 0.06 per cent in 1961. "If the trend of increase in annual average temperature continues, then by 2030 annual average temperature in Bangladesh will increase by 0.94 per cent." The paper said Bangladesh along with other climate vulnerable countries has specific agendas that reflect the active interests for the climate vulnerable countries. These countries would try to ensure commitments of major carbon emitting countries to limit carbon emission, and scale up climate funds urgently to support climate vulnerable countries. They will also look to ensure the bigger share of climate funds towards adaptation, finalise the 'Paris Rulebook' to ensure accountability, and establish the mechanism for loss and damage. The 26th Conference of Parties ( COP26 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will begin on October 31 in Scotland's Glasgow. The outcome of the COP26 is critically important for climate vulnerable countries like Bangladesh.

The United Nations COP26 climate action summit scheduled in Glasgow in November is the last chance for the world to limit global warming and stay on track to keep global temperature rises well below 2 degrees, Alok Sharma, the British Indian minister in charge of the meet said recently. The Agra-born president designate of the summit delivered a major speech during a wind farm visit near the city of Glasgow and urged that it was time to move away from coal power towards more renewable sources of power. Sharma outlined the UK's presidency of the summit across four key areas of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees, enabling communities and natural habitats to adapt to the impacts of climate change, mobilizing climate finance, and working together to deliver action. The event will engage the leaders to help shape the global, regional and local agenda in the energy sector including Power, Energy Transition, Oil &amp; Gas, Renewables, Coal, Digital Transformation among others.  Having been born in India, a proud British citizen, and having spent time as Secretary of State for International Development, I am committed that this COP will deliver for the communities most vulnerable to climate change, said Sharma, who holds a Cabinet Office ministerial post. \</doc>

'Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan' which has been presented at the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) will be implemented in 2030 and it needs local and foreign funds. Saima Wazed Hossain Putul, Chairperson of the National Advisory Committee on Autism and Neuro Developmental Disorders and World Health Organization's (WHO) Goodwill Ambassador for Southeast Asia, took part in a discussion on the sidelines of Glasgow Climate Conference on Wednesday (November 3). She briefed the representatives of different countries on the Mujib Climate Action Plan. Saima Wazed said the 'Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan' under the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) will pave the way for tackling climate change and Bangladesh is working to that end. "If we can implement the plan properly, we will be able to solve the problems related to climate," Saima Wazed Putul told reporters. 'We gave much effort while formulating this plan. If other countries follow this, we believe, they will be able to protect themselves from climate change issues. Bangladesh has already been able to successfully demonstrate the action that needs to be taken in tackling climate change.' She added that the 'Mujib Prospective Climate Plan' has already been appreciated by world leaders. 'Once it is implemented, Bangladesh will go a long way in implementing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).' The damage done to our economic growth by Covid-19 can be also offset by the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan, she said. Saima Wazed said, 'We are losing lives, resources, shelters due to climate change. In addition, many are leading their lives as climate refugees after losing their homes and livelihood.' Women, children and people with disabilities are under threat due to climate change. All the solutions are there in the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan to cope with the climate change. 'This flagship project is an important step towards green, nature-based solution and offset the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis,' said Saima Wazed. The 48 countries that are members of the Climate Vulnerable Forum are responsible for only 5 percent of the world's total carbon emissions. 'However, the adverse effects of climate change have posed a fundamental threat to our lives and livelihoods.' Earlier, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina presented the 'Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan' while presiding over Climate Vulnerable Forum Leaders' Dialogue: Forging a CVF- COP26 Climate Emergency Pact at COP26 venue here on Tuesday. The Prime Minister said Bangladesh has launched the 'Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan', named in honour of Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. 'This plan is set to guide our development path through a low-carbon strategy. Other 37 CVF members will likewise, develop their own such plans of climate resilience to achieve climate prosperity,' she said. Sheikh Hasina, also the CVF chair, said the CVF has also come up with a 'Climate Emergency Pact'. This Pact addresses the climate finance Delivery Plan and asks for raising ambition at every single COP, especially from the major pollution emitting nations. 'This will ensure continuous progress so that the temperature rise is contained within 1.5 degree Celsius. We call upon the Presidency of COP26 , and all Members of the UNFCCC, to adopt the Climate Emergency Pact as a part of the COP26 Declaration,' she said. \</doc>

The UK government's COP26 Regional Ambassador to Asia-Pacific and South Asia, Ken O'Flaherty has said Bangladesh, being a key player in the world, has been doing remarkably well in its action against climate change. "The world wants to learn from Bangladesh's experiences in fighting against climate change," he said recently. The ambassador said this in a bilateral discussion meeting with Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Md Shahab Uddin at the ministry's conference room at Secretariat here, said a press release. Ken O'Flaherty said the UK appreciates Bangladesh's role in raising voice for global climate action, including yearly 100 billion dollar assistance, loss and damage and article 6. Britain expects an exemplary declaration from Bangladesh government which will encourage regional countries, he said, adding Britain is working hard for practical solutions to climate change in COP26 . Noting that Bangladesh has drafted the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan 2030, he said the country has submitted updated NDC by increasing its contribution three times to reduce carbon emission than that of its previous one. \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 19 -- Developed countries must fulfill their commitment to meet the hundred-billion-dollar climate finance goal to the vulnerable countries, including Bangladesh. A victim of climate change, Bangladesh is likely to incur losses worth US$ 2.2 billion on average per year. The upcoming conference of the parties ( COP26 ) is important for Bangladesh along with other climate vulnerable countries to raise their voices. The climate vulnerable countries have specific agenda that reflect their interests. These countries would try to ensure commitments of major carbon emitting countries to limit emissions, and scale up climate funds. There is a global call for saying no to any new coal-fired power plants and to join "Powering Past Coal Alliance". The COP26 COP26 summit for rebuilding the confidence in international climate cooperation. It is expected that the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, who is to head the delegate in the COP26 , would consider placing Bangladesh's energy transition plan, particularly in case of phasing out of coal-based power plants. For this, Bangladesh may seek financial and technical support for the early retirement of coal-based power plants. Currently, many coal-based power plants are under construction in the country.

Nov. 4 Singapore(Straits Times/ANN)- GLASGOW  New climate pledges made by China and India  among the top three producers of planet-warming greenhouse gases  have for the first time set the world on a path to reducing planetary heating to under 2 deg C. Research published on Wednesday (Nov 3) by Climate Resource  a Melbourne-based research start-up  showed that if all 194 countries fulfil the pledges they made under the Paris Agreement, the world stands a good chance of limiting warming to 1.9 deg C above pre-industrial levels. This is within the 2 deg C target outlined under the 2015 Paris Agreement, but still falls short of the 1.5 deg C threshold that climate scientists say will help countries avoid experiencing harsher climate impact. Said the researchers in a statement: "The major changes that bring projected warming below the significant benchmark of 2 deg C are China's new (climate pledge) and India's new announcement at COP26 , both featuring net-zero emission targets by 2060 and 2070, respectively." In October, China  the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases  released its national plan detailing how it intended to achieve a peak in carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060. It did so just days before the COP26 climate talks began in Glasgow. As for India, which is the world's third largest emitter after the United States, its Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced during COP26 that the country will become carbon neutral by the year 2070  becoming the last of the world's major carbon polluters to announce a net-zero target. Mr Modi also announced that carbon intensity of India's economy  the amount of goods produced per unit of energy  would be reduced by 45 per cent by 2030. The previous goal was 35 per cent. Added the researchers: "Overall, 11 countries updated their nationally determined contributions since Oct 18, our pre- COP26 comparison point." Nationally determined contributions refer to climate pledges that countries make under the Paris Agreement, which entails new pledges to be submitted every five years. The first round of pledges was made in 2015. In an analysis of submitted NDCs in September, the UN said the pledges still put the world on a path to warming by 2.7 deg C by the end of the century. But the researchers caution that it is still too soon to rejoice. "The temperature projections obviously hinge on the assumption that the pledges are going to be underpinned by respective climate, energy and land use policies and actions," they said, citing Australia's net-zero by 2050 pledge as being "hollow" since there are no clear policies guiding this implementation. "Without climate policies, sectoral targets and a change of course, the 2050 net-zero target won't come about," they said. "And 1.9 deg C won't be achieved without a proper implementation of the pledges." At COP26 , countries will further negotiate on the rules that will guide the implementation of the Paris Agreement , in areas such as climate finance that will help developing countries cut their emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Nov 3 also marked Finance Day at the climate summit, where finance ministers, businesses and investors gathered to discuss how the financial sector could deploy the investment needed to help countries reach their net-zero by 2050 targets. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Dec. 8 Kathmandu(Kathmandu Post/ANN)- India has somehow emerged as the villain of last month's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ), blamed for resisting cuts to coal consumption even as toxic air envelops its capital, New Delhi. The country's supposed crime in Glasgow was to join China in insisting on a last-minute change to the conference's final declaration, in which countries pledged to "phase down" rather than "phase out" coal. For that, India, whose per capita carbon dioxide emissions are a fraction of those of the world's leading emitters, was widely criticised for obstructing the global fight against climate change. The irony is that India has done far less to intensify the planet's greenhouse effect than either China or the developed West. True, the country is a major coal consumer, and derives about 70 percent of its energy from it. But, as recently as 2015, at least a quarter of India's population couldn't take for granted what almost everyone in the developed world can: to flick a switch on a wall and be bathed with light. Worse, Indians are among the biggest victims of climate change, periodically enduring devastating floods and unseasonal droughts, in addition to choking on polluted air. Delhi is a poster child for poor air quality, which hovers between "severe" and "hazardous" for much of the year. The causes include PM 2.5 particles emitted from coal-fired power plants, fumes from dense traffic, industrial pollution, and the burning of crop stubble by farmers in neighbouring states all combined with winter fog. But given India's traditional role as a leading voice of the developing world, it became the face of the last-minute change of language at COP26 . The "phase down" wording regarding coal consumption had already appeared in a US-China bilateral climate agreement signed earlier in the conference. Nevertheless, India became the focus of global opprobrium. India does not deserve to be the fall guy. For starters, the country has 17 percent of the world's population but generates only 7 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. (China, with 18.5 percent of the world's people, generates 27 percent of emissions, and the US, with less than 5 percent of the world's population, accounts for 15 percent.) Whereas wasteful consumption and unsustainable energy-guzzling are rife in the West, most Indians live close to the subsistence level, and many have no access to energy. To expect India to meet the targets that rich countries currently tout is unfair and impractical. Economic development indispensable to pulling millions of Indians out of poverty requires energy. Coal may be polluting, but it is not feasible for any developing country to switch rapidly to cleaner alternatives that need scaling up. Moreover, despite having vast financial resources and access to cleaner fossil fuels such as natural gas (which India must import), Western countries have done little to help. They have failed to keep climate-finance promises to poor countries (notably the $100 billion per year they committed to provide at COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009), and refused to transfer advanced green technologies. And COP26 singled out the coal used by developing countries, not the oil and gas used extensively in the West. India's energy requirements are expected to increase faster than those of any other country in the next two decades. Since COP21 in Paris in 2015, India has announced ambitious plans to scale up its production and use of renewable energy, which currently accounts for only 18 percent of its electricity generation. And at COP26 , India complemented its explicit commitment to phase down coal with a pledge to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. India has also updated its nationally determined contributions, which it must fulfil by 2030. The country is now pledging to increase its installed renewable-energy capacity to 500 gigawatts, and meet 50 percent of its energy requirements from non-fossil-fuel sources. Furthermore, India aims to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by one billion tons and lower its emissions intensity (which measures emissions per unit of economic growth) by 45 percent from 2005 levels. For now, there is no viable alternative to coal. Blessed with abundant sunshine, India has become a solar-power enthusiast and plans to generate 40 GW of green energy from rooftop solar installations by 2022. But it has achieved barely 20 percent of that target so far. Vast amounts of solar energy cannot be generated overnight, and battery storage remains expensive, while green hydrogen technology and facilities are still unavailable in India. Wind energy is minuscule, and the country lacks significant oil and gas reserves. Nuclear power accounts for less than 2 percent of India's electricity, and nuclear plants constantly face opposition from residents of surrounding areas. As a result, India's performance on greenhouse-gas emissions will get worse before it gets better. According to a study by BP, India's share of global emissions will increase to 14 percent by 2040. Coal will by then account for 48 percent of the country's primary energy consumption, and renewable energy only 16 percent. And because of India's high dependence on agriculture, which engages nearly two-thirds of its population, and its vast number of cattle, the country did not sign the global deal announced at COP26 to reduce methane emissions. Of course, reducing emissions is not the only way to combat climate change. India plans to bring one-third of its land area under forest cover, and to plant enough trees by 2030 to absorb an additional 2.5 to 3 billion tons of atmospheric carbon dioxide. It has made a start, with forest cover increasing by 5.2 percent between 2001 and 2019, though progress has been uneven, with the northeast losing forest cover while the south visibly improves. Still, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that achieving global net-zero emissions by 2050 is the minimum needed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Climate Action Tracker calculates that based on countries' current 2030 climate targets the world is heading for a temperature rise of 2.4 degrees Celsius by 2100. Some scientists warn that global warming could eventually exceed 4 degrees Celsius. If this happens, the resulting heat waves, droughts, floods, and rising sea levels would cause devastating loss of human life, mass extinction of animal and plant species, and irreversible damage to our ecosystem. India would be a major victim of such a calamity. The country will therefore make a good-faith effort to help avert climate disaster but only within the limits of what it can feasibly do. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Apr. 18 Jakarta (Jakarta Post/ANN)- As ASEAN economies continue their path to safely reopening and getting back to business, they must also manage growing economic challenges and identify how best to seize new opportunities for a resilient, inclusive, and sustainable recovery. The first challenge is the Russian invasion of Ukraine which has caused tremendous suffering and sent shockwaves across the global economy. ASEAN's direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine through trade and investment appears limited. But with the price of oil surging to its highest levels since 2008, inflation is heating up. ASEAN's net oil importers face substantial challenges with rising import bills. Food security and fragile supply chains are at greater risk too. The second challenge is increasing interest rates in the United States which are complicating the inflation battle amid heightened uncertainties. Widening interest rate differentials between ASEAN economies and the US and a shift in investor confidence could trigger a sudden reversal in capital flows, currency depreciation, and financial instability. To sustain momentum for recovery, the region must stay vigilant and prepare for collective action to avert regional financial instability. In particular, authorities must carefully manage the combined effects of higher oil prices, US interest rate hikes, and the phasing out of fiscal stimulus. Against this backdrop, ASEAN policymakers face three important policy priorities: Strengthening regional cooperation to ensure a strong recovery; enhancing domestic resource mobilization; and scaling up investment for green and inclusive growth. Regional cooperation can pave the path to a sustained and resilient recovery. Strong regional trade and investment gave ASEAN a buffer during the global slowdown in trade and economic activity. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement, which became effective early this year, is expected to expand this buffer. ADB will remain a reliable partner for regional economies in this area by providing trade finance, technical assistance, and knowledge solutions. Deepening our local-currency bond and capital markets is also critical. ADB is supporting this through the ASEAN+3 Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI). The ABMI aims to nurture local currency bond markets as an alternative source of funding to foreign-currency denominated bank loans to alleviate the currency and maturity mismatches in the region's financing for investment and reduce the risk of financial vulnerability. We also support the development and issuance of green, social, and sustainability bonds to help governments invest in environmental sustainability, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and resilience. ASEAN's efforts to strengthen food and energy security through regional cooperation, bolster regional health security, and strengthen disease surveillance mechanisms are crucial to mitigate risks and maintain sustainability. A second priority is efficient domestic resource mobilization. This is important to restore fiscal sustainability to maintain post-pandemic recovery and finance efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. ASEAN has room for improvement here due to its comparatively low tax revenue mobilization. Several ASEAN members have strengthened their tax administration systems through digital solutions. We are working with economies to simplify processes for taxpayers that can enhance voluntary compliance and improve tax policy formulation. We know that international tax cooperation is key to combatting tax avoidance and evasion. To promote this through knowledge sharing and coordination on tax policy and administration, we launched the Asia Pacific Tax Hub. The third priority is scaling up investment in quality, climate-resilient infrastructure. Asia and the Pacific is vulnerable to some of the most destructive effects of climate change, and these are expected to worsen. At the same time, our region is the source of more than 50 percent of annual global greenhouse gas emissions. We need to recognize that the battle against climate change will be won or lost in Asia and the Pacific. ADB's ambition is to deliver US$100 billion in cumulative climate financing from 2019 to 2030, including $34 billion for adaptation projects, to help the region's response to the climate challenge. The ASEAN Catalytic Green Financing (ACGF) Facility, which is owned by all ASEAN members and managed with ADB, is supporting development and financing of green infrastructure projects. It has mobilized $2 billion in public and private resources with support from nine partners, including cofinancing from the European Union, Italy, United Kingdom, and the Green Climate Fund under the Green Recovery Platform launched at the United Nations climate conference in Glasgow ( COP26 ) last year. ACGF helps reduce risks in green investment and attract private capital by providing loans to cover high initial capital costs and grants to support governments as they identify and prepare commercially viable green infrastructure projects. The Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM) is another innovative program launched by Indonesia, the Philippines, and ADB last year. ETM seeks to catalyze private capital and accelerate the transition from coal to clean energy in ASEAN. It aims to retire coal-fired power plants early; to scale up clean, renewable energy solutions; and to ensure that the transition is just and affordable. ETM will provide low-cost financing by combining concessional public finance, private sector investment, and resources from philanthropies. This innovative mechanism has the potential to become the largest carbon reduction model in the world. As ASEAN's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic moves into high gear, regional cooperation initiatives will remain critical to managing growing challenges and seizing new opportunities to build a stronger future. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Nov. 22 Kolkata(The Statesman/ANN)- The 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) ended on 13 November 2021, a day after the scheduled date of closing. This has become almost a regular practice, and the issue that mainly causes this extension is climate finance, the most intractable of all agendas under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The core climate finance issues at this COP, among others, were the delivery of $100 billion yearly fund by 2020, a new quantified goal to mobilise from 2025 taking $100 billion as the floor, adaptation finance, and finance for Loss and Damage. It may be recalled that both under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, developed countries have assumed legally-binding responsibility to support the developing countries in addressing climate change (using the language "shall provide"). Also, more than a decade ago, at COP16 in Cancun, developed countries pledged to deliver $100 billion a year by 2020. The goal has not been met yet  the claimed delivery by the rich countries of about USD 79 billion in 2018-2019 is deflated down more than three times by Oxfam, which estimates that only $19-22 billion can be considered as net climate finance. However, at COP26 , the developed countries expressed "deep regret" in not fulfilling the previous pledges, and now they have pledged again to reach that amount each year through to 2025. About the new quantified goal from 2025, an agreement of establishing a road map for this has been reached. Again, the new pledges from developed countries are plenty: $11.4 billion per year by 2024 will be given by the US, and $3 billion specifically for climate adaptation; the UK will double its climate finance to $11.6 billion between 2020 and 2025; Japan has offered $10 billion over the next five years for reducing emissions in Asia; Canada has announced to double its climate finance contribution to $5.3 billion by 2025; Norway committed to tripling its adaptation finance; Australia said it would double its contribution, too. It is estimated that if all pledges are kept, the total amount of climate finance is likely to reach around $96 billion next year! But will it actually become a reality? The history of climate finance delivery does not evoke much confidence. Adaptation and its financing were of particular importance at COP26 , in view of the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the increasing impacts of climate change, which keeps savagely battering the low-income countries with poor adaptive capacity. The decision established a work programme to define the global goal on adaptation agreed under Article 7 of the Paris Agreement. This is expected to identify collective needs and how they can be met. The deal offered a promise to double adaptation finance by 2025 from the 2019 level, taking it to around $40 billion a year. But there is no guarantee that this goal will be reached. A UN committee will report on progress towards delivering the $100 billion per year, to be discussed again in 2024. However, COP26 The programme will be delivered in partnership with the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, a global network focused on climate action, and the GIZ, the German development agency. However, for the agenda of Loss and Damage under Article 8 of the Paris Agreement, no dedicated financing has been agreed upon, though the developing countries, together with the Climate Vulnerable Forum which is chaired by Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, have been calling for such a funding mechanism. But COP26 As experience has shown, centrally administered adaptation actions have not brought in the desired outcome. As climate impacts happen locally and spatially, it is the local governments and communities which must take the lead in designing and implementing the adaptation projects/programmes. So, a major share of the pledged money is expected to be delivered down for implementing the locally-led adaptation, though only three to four per cent of climate finance now reaches the local level. It may be mentioned that the LDC Vision 2050 has set the target of delivering 70 per cent of climate finance down to local adaptation actions. Finally, we may recall that Lord Nicholas Stern, former chief economist at the World Bank and the doyen of the economics of climate change, has been arguing for years that the alibi that developed countries cannot afford the money as climate finance is simply reckless  this means they don't bother much about climate change, and the red signals of the successive IPCC reports fall on deaf ears. Against this continued paucity in climate finance, developed countries could mobilise over $11 trillion as stimulus packages for saving their economies from the Covid-19 fallout, but just one per cent of it could go well over the $100 billion pledged. They seem to be not caring about the legal obligations agreed under the climate regime, and continue to renege on earlier pledges. Will this deluge of new pledges at COP26 see the light of the day? Is there any chance of winning over the nationalist streaks by a world of rapidly increasing vulnerability interdependence? How long can the disconnect continue between climate science and climate policy? Perhaps the frontline poor victims of climate change will have to wait for Godot  like the tragicomedy of Samuel Beckett! ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 29 -- Countries usually do not act alone at climate negotiations: they act in blocs. These groups present countries' specific interests, and therefore they can be composed of countries from multiple regions. During negotiations, a group of countries will jointly support certain policies, targets or points of view. The blocs often overlap, and their shifting as well as relatively constant positions can be confusing. Almost every country is a member of more than one bloc, and some countries have changed blocs since climate negotiations started in the 1990s. To comprehend the dynamics of negotiations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) it is helpful to understand these blocs ahead of COP26 . This is a group of mostly developed countries, with some middle-income economies. Large industrialised countries that are high carbon emitters like the US, Australia and Canada are an integral part of the Umbrella Group. The group has maintained that the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions needed to keep global temperature rise within two degrees Celsius - preferably within 1.5 degrees - as per the Paris Agreement must come from all countries, including developing countries. Further, the group - which includes the world's second-largest emitter (the US) - maintains that the stringency of reporting and accounting for emissions should be same for all countries. This group does not believe that the difference between Annex I (developed) and Non-Annex I (developing) countries created by the Kyoto Protocol should exist. It holds that responsibility for reducing emissions ought to be determined based on emissions of the day rather than historical levels of emissions. European Union The European Union conducts climate negotiations as a group. It also reports its GHG emissions as a group to the UNFCCC, making the EU the world's third-largest emitter, after China and the US. Through commitments to become climate-neutral by 2050 (the so-called net-zero commitment), the EU has been a leader in many ways when it comes to combating climate change. But its commitment to provide climate finance to developing countries has been muddled due to lack of transparency and alleged counting of aid money as climate finance. The group has maintained that emerging economies should commit to absolute emission reductions. BASIC Group This group was formed as a reaction to the increasing pressure on emerging economies Brazil, South Africa, India and China to control their GHG emissions. The group includes the world's largest emitter (China) and fourth-largest emitter (India). Of the four countries, South Africa has declared 2050 as its net-zero year - the year by which it will not emit more GHGs than it removes from the atmosphere. China has declared 2060 as its net-zero year; Brazil has said it can reach net zero by 2060 if it gets the money it expects from industrialised countries. The pressure is now on India to declare a net-zero year, though it is likely that India will instead declare a goal of generating 450 GW of energy through renewable sources by 2030. The BASIC Group is spearheading the demand for more financial transfers from industrialised countries. It has publicly maintained that the rich nations that have placed over 80% of the extra GHGs in the atmosphere since the start of the Industrial Age must take the lead in emission reductions. The main thrust of the group is to put the issues of equity and access to carbon space for development on the agenda. India, with its low per capita emissions, leads on this demand. But the countries have so far failed to provide any operational guidelines on the equity question. South Africa put forward the idea of an Equity Reference Framework. This is meant to analyse the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of each country relative to the global pledge and to the NDCs of all other countries - in other words, which country is doing better or worse than its fair share. Brazil put forward the idea of concentric circles - with economy-wide absolute emission targets at its core for developed countries, and less stringent ones for developing countries. But these ideas did not get support from China or India, let alone countries outside the BASIC Group. The main force binding the group has been collective defence against the emission-reduction demands of developed countries and some developing country groups. LMDC Group This is a shifting group of more than 20 countries. The Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) Group has been seen as a stumbling block by many others. The main demand of the LMDC Group is to maintain the differentiation between developed and developing countries. It asks developed countries to meet the commitments they have made without necessarily spelling out the actions to be taken by developing countries. China, India and oil-exporting countries like Saudi Arabia are all in the group. Just a few days before COP26 , the LMDC bloc came out openly against the net-zero goal being pushed by rich nations. "Demands for 'Net zero' emissions for all countries by 2050 will exacerbate further the existing inequities between developed and developing countries," it said in a joint statement after a meeting on 18 October chaired by Bolivia. Ministers and officials from China, Cuba, Ecuador, India, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Venezuela and Vietnam attended the virtual meeting. "This new 'goal' which is being advanced runs counter to the Paris Agreement and is anti-equity and against climate justice," the statement added. Interestingly, though, Saudi Arabia almost simultaneously announced its net-zero goal by 2060, indicating that the group may be more internally divided than the statement indicates. Cartagena Dialogue This is a group of countries with representatives from the Umbrella Group, Least Developed Countries (LDC) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Its position is usually a nuanced variant of the EU position, and it does not have a very strong stance on sticky issues such as climate finance and emission-reduction commitments. The Cartagena Dialogue group's main objective over the years has been to propose innovative ideas that sometimes extend the interpretation of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This is seen by observers as a softened position compared with that of the Umbrella Group. In recent years, the group has maintained that emerging economies must make higher emission cuts. Environmental Integrity Group This group contains Mexico, Liechtenstein, Monaco, South Korea, Georgia and Switzerland, which is its most frequent spokesperson. It often takes up positions close to the Umbrella Group; it is strongest when demanding that emission reductions in developing countries must be independently verified by international auditors. This has placed the group in opposition to many developing countries more than once. G-77 and China This is the overall group of all developing countries, and the number of member countries is now well above the original 77. It is a fairly amorphous group with lots of differences among its members. But it has stuck to a common position on critical issues such as the need for climate finance from rich nations. Apart from that, various countries and blocs within the group often articulate differences on specific issues. African Group This is one of the largest blocs within the G-77 and China group. It consists of developing countries from Africa. In recent years, it has played an important role in keeping the two-degree limit in focus, when that was in danger of falling off the table. The bloc is one of the strongest in asking for stringent action from developed countries and seeking finances to combat climate change. This group aligns itself with G-77 and China on most issues. ALBA In many ways, this is the group most stridently opposed to the Umbrella Group. The ALBA group is most vociferous in demanding GHG emission reductions from developed countries while not pledging anything from developing countries. The group - formally called Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America - has nine member countries, though the most vocal during climate negotiations are Venezuela, Bolivia, Cuba and Ecuador, perhaps in that order. During the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit, this group was catalytic in the breakdown of a formal agreement in the wake of backdoor negotiations between the US and the BASIC Group. Its delegates repeatedly pointed out in an open plenary session the weaknesses of the behind-the-scenes agreement. AOSIS and SIDS groups The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) has always had a strong presence in climate negotiations, pointing out that the survival of their countries is at stake, as sea levels rise due to global warming. The group was instrumental in making the 1.5-degree ceiling an aspirational goal in the Paris Agreement. At times the AOSIS group has aligned with EU to push for stronger emissions-reduction action by all countries and has thus found itself opposing the emerging economies in the BASIC Group. The bloc called Small Island Developing States (SIDS) often takes the same position as AOSIS in climate negotiations. LDC Group The 48 countries defined by the UN as Least Developed Countries (LDCs) make up this group, which is now being chaired by Bhutan. This group has been most vocal in seeking capacity building for its people so that they can handle climate change impacts; it has also been vocal in seeking compensation for the loss and damage these countries are suffering due to climate change impacts such as floods, storms and droughts. The LDC Group is part of the larger G-77 and China group, but sometimes takes positions contrary to those of emerging economies and oil-exporting countries. Arab States Oil-exporting countries are often the most vocal members of this 22-nation group. As a result, NGOs and observers often see this group as blocking progress against climate change. With group members such as Dubai moving aggressively towards renewable energy, there are possibilities that the group may alter its stance somewhat.

A new energy economy is emerging around the world as solar, wind, electric vehicles and other low-carbon technologies flourish. But as the pivotal moment of COP26 approaches, the IEA's new World Energy Outlook makes it clear that this clean energy progress is still far too slow to put global emissions into sustained decline towards net zero, highlighting the need for an unmistakeable signal of ambition and action from governments in Glasgow. At a time when policy makers are contending with the impacts of both climate change and volatile energy markets, the World Energy Outlook 2021 (WEO-2021) is designed as a handbook for the COP26 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, which offers a critical opportunity to accelerate climate action and the clean energy transition. The new analysis - which the IEA is making available for free online - delivers stark warnings about the direction in which today's policy settings are taking the world. But it also provides clear-headed analysis of how to move in a well-managed way towards a pathway that would have a good chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 \'b0C and avoiding the worst effects of climate change. The WEO-2021, the IEA's annual flagship publication, shows that even as deployments of solar and wind go from strength to strength, the world's consumption of coal is growing strongly this year, pushing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions towards their second largest annual increase in history. \</doc>

Alternative, clean energy in Bangladesh is an orphan. The Prime Minister often expresses strong desire for such energy, yet her wish is not reflected in the policy formulation and implementation strategy. Now Bangladesh has no option, but to go aggressively for it. Apart from bringing comfort from enormous stress on imported fuel, it would smooth the journey towards Net Zero. In the ultimate analysis, creation of a separate independent enterprise under the line ministry is the demand of the time. Dipal Chandra Barua, President of Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Society, made the observation in an exclusive interview with EP Editor Mollah Amzad Hossain. Bangladesh Prime Minister has expressed a vision for achieving 40% contribution of clean energy in the energy mix by 2041. What is your assessment about achieving this vision? It would not be difficult implementing or achieving the 40% clean energy vision of the PM by 2041. The Prime Minister announced this vision for making Bangladesh a role model as a major climate vulnerable country. It is included as a vision in the yet to be finalized Mujib Climate Perspective Plan. She placed her political pledge to world leaders during the COP26 . But the officials of the Power sector upon return from the COP26 are terming the target as up to 40%. There is a difference between the two. I believe that the PM's declaration is achievable if required initiatives are launched, adopting it as a national pledge and working with total commitment. What plans should the government take for achieving it? Let me consider it clean energy, not merely renewable energy. For clean energy a specific plan and implementation strategy must be announced as soon as possible. We have to finalize what would be the contribution of nuclear, solar, wind, biomass and other clean energy sources in the fuel mix over the next two decades. Action plans for achieving these must also be finalized and announced. On top of it, a high-powered task force under the direct leadership of the Prime Minister for monitoring the implementation process must be set up. At the same time a separate renewable energy development enterprise under power division may be set up. Right now RE development appears to be an orphan. If these cannot be done, at least SREDA must be strengthened with required manpower, resources and authority. EP: Although being in discussion for a long time, yet a business model for solar irrigation could not be made. What should be done? Around 13,000 solar pumps have so far replaced about 25,000 diesel-using shallow irrigation pumps. There exist 16 lakhs more irrigation pumps of which 13 lakhs diesel pumps can be replaced by solar pumps. Cost for solar irrigation is about 40% less than diesel using pumps. 10,000MW capacity solar panels would be necessary for replacing these. 50% of the investment should be given as a grant and soft interest loans should be given for the remainder 50%. Guide book has been published in India giving solar irrigation as priority in seven Indian states. How these would be managed, what benefits these would derive have been enumerated. In some states up to 90% grants have been allocated for solar irrigation. SREDA is preparing a business model in Bangladesh. I suggest that mandatory provision should be created for distribution utilities evacuating the power from irrigation pumps beyond the irrigation season. A carefully negotiated tariff should be decided and purchase of electricity must be made mandatory. If these can be, Bangladesh may not need importing diesel at all for the second largest user of the fuel. This would save drainage of foreign exchange as well as protect the environment. Entire irrigation would be run by green energy. Though it happened a bit late, net metering is a good policy. Positive dividends have started arriving out of it. What are the barriers you think against expediting its expansion? Introduction of Net Metering without any doubt is a good decision. Rooftop solar installation would get momentum if three impediments are resolved. Legal guarantee of recovery of the investment under OPEX model should be ensured. Utilities do not pay in for the electricity generated from solar they purchase. Government must ensure that investors of power get the full contracted amount from companies. There should be a provision that rooftop solar producers would have the right for suspending the supply if they do not get payment from investors. The second is reducing high duty and tax on inverters. Third is doing away with the hassles and delays of BSTI in the name of quality assurance of imported solar panels and inverters. If these can be done, Rooftop solar would achieve success similar to that of Solar Home System (SHS). Modern storage technology is achieving global popularity together with the expansion of solar power development. Bangladesh could not do much yet. What should be done? There is no alternative to embracing modern batteries for making solar power available on a 24/7 basis. Many countries of the world made remarkable advancement. Costs have been reduced significantly. In my opinion, public sector companies must launch piloting without losing any more time. Initiative may be taken for getting finance from Green Climate Fund for this. For a while we are hearing that Renewable Energy Initiatives, more specifically solar energy, is being subjected to tax disparity. What is the actual issue? How can this be resolved? Please note that solar panels used in grid-connected solar plants, rooftop solar and solar irrigation are not manufactured in Bangladesh. Hence there is no justification for giving tax and duty protection to local industry. The 7% Advance Income Tax (AIT) should be withdrawn. 37% tax and duties now are imposed on inverters used in above projects. It was 11% in the previous year. If the government sincerely wants development, import of inverters should be made completely tax free. There is another issue. BSTI undertakes quality control of all imported items related to solar projects. It does not have the required number of qualified human resource and testing laboratories. It takes an extraordinarily long time to get BSTI certificates. This must be resolved. Megawatt scale solar projects are considered as IPP. Hence all the incentives given to IPPs should also be given to such solar projects. Without ensuring all above, the expected development and growth of solar may not be achieved. Provisions of 'Offshore Wind Parks' are said to be included in Mujib Perspective Plan. How optimistic are you about wind energy? What needs to be done? Till now Bangladesh does not have enough bankable data of wind power prospects. Through proper wind mapping a credible data bank of wind energy should be developed. Government should announce an incentive package for prospective investors for offshore wind development. I believe there exist opportunities for getting significant wind power in Bangladesh if all the above are done. The Power Division and SREDA are working on this. Some projects are under execution. Wind mapping is being done in some areas. All these can be expedited. Energy Efficiency (EE) is an effective way for reducing GHG emission. Do you think that Bangladesh is on the right track for EE? Two areas are of significance for achieving EE. One is identifying through energy auditing the energy inefficient equipment and appliances of industries. These must be replaced with modern appliances for reducing energy use. Work is progressing with JICA assistance. Investment for these needed to be increased. The other area is conserving energy through positively motivating consumers about efficient energy use. If possible, increase awareness about efficient use of energy as well. This could not achieve much for COVID-19 pandemic. State-sponsored initiative needs to be launched for creating nationwide awareness development. Do you think that the present policy for integrating the private sector in RE and clean energy development are enough? If not, what needs to be done? The policies and implantation strategies lag sufficiently. RE policy must be updated creating incentives for the private sector. A strategy paper needs to be developed. There is no champion for doing this. The Power Division is not much interested in promoting alternative energy. My specific suggestion is for creation of a separate enterprise for RE and clean energy under the Power Division. Till this is done the Prime Minister can champion this through setting up a task force in her office. We must remember that RE development can reduce dependence on imported fuel. It can also lead Bangladesh effectively towards Net Zero target achievement. \</doc>

Apr. 22 SINGAPORE (The Straits Times/ANN)  In crisis lies opportunity, and this can be seen in the opportunities that could open up as Singapore attempts to wean itself off fossil fuels amid an energy crisis. The opportunities lie not only in the renewable energy sector, but also in areas such as green finance, carbon services and green hydrogen, said panellists at a roundtable organised by The Straits Times which aired on Earth Day on Friday (April 22). One of the panellists, Dr Victor Nian, an adviser at the Centre for Strategic Energy and Resources, said there is potential for Singapore to position itself as a hydrogen hub in the future, and supply the cleaner fuel to the region. For instance, the oil refineries and petrochemical plants in Singapore could in the future be repurposed to produce and store green hydrogen, which refers to hydrogen fuel produced by renewables. "Think back to the 1960s, where our philosophy of having refineries on Bukom Island or Jurong Island in serving the neighbourhood, could be replicated in the hydrogen story, where we, as a country can become a hub for hydrogen production from clean energy sources, and (also) sell them to the region," he said. Green hydrogen, which is produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen by using renewable electricity, emits no carbon dioxide during the production process, making it a cleaner fuel. The other panellists were ST climate change editor David Fogarty; Ms Swati Mandloi, a youth delegate from Singapore for the recent climate change conference in Glasgow ( Cop26 ); and ST environment correspondent Audrey Tan. The roundtable was moderated by Mr Warren Fernandez, ST editor and editor-in-chief of SPH Media Trust's English, Malay and Tamil Media Group. The roundtable  aired on ST's YouTube channel and website on Friday  revolved around the theme of whether surging energy costs would spark a global rethink about the dependence on fossil fuels, and the current challenges of speeding up the adoption of renewables. Last year, oil and fossil fuel prices soared, causing electricity bills to spike and petrol prices to rise. The war in Ukraine then worsened the world's energy crisis. Mr Fogarty said carbon services and trading in Singapore are a growing area since one of the key issues that polluting companies are facing is in reducing their emissions in some parts of their supply chains. Hence, they turn towards carbon offsets, where the companies buy a carbon credit from a renewable energy plant or a forestry restoration project to "offset" their emissions. "The investment around those projects, and the financing (and auditing) of them is a growing area. Executing those projects on the ground also takes time and money." Mr Fogarty added that issuing green bonds  financial instruments used to fund projects with environmental benefits  is an emerging area, and that the nation can also explore novel technologies in extracting carbon dioxide. "Singapore is a great hub for a lot of these things. It's got the finance, it's got the technology, and it can bring in the brains to do it." On Singapore as a hydrogen hub, Ms Tan noted that it is currently challenging to produce green hydrogen here due to the small proportion of the nation's energy mix coming from renewables. By 2030, the aim is to have solar energy  the nation's most viable form of clean energy now  cover 4 per cent of Singapore's total electricity demand. The 4 per cent will comprise at least 2 gigawatt-peak of solar energy or the equivalent of powering about 350,000 households a year. Currently, more than 95 per cent of the country's energy mix comes from natural gas, the cleanest form of fossil fuel. Ms Tan said: "By 2030, 4 per cent (coming from) solar is quite small. For us to harness hydrogen in a larger way, hydrogen has to be imported, and we have to find ways to store hydrogen safely." It was reported last year that Singapore is engaging local and international stakeholders to bring down the cost of hydrogen technology and develop global regulatory standards, to establish global hydrogen supply chains. Dr Nian added that if nuclear energy  which Singapore is looking into  takes off here, it could be used to produce clean hydrogen fuel here. Audience member Jan Holm, 53, executive vice-president of Seaborg Technologies, a cleantech company, asked the panellists where they see the biggest opportunities for Singapore moving forward, as the nation rides the energy crisis wave. Dr Nian said Singapore's rich talent pool can help pave the way for advances in the clean energy and technology sector  from "Generation IV" nuclear technologies to even new industries within the cleantech scene. "Advanced technologies (in the nuclear sector) are still in development. As a newcomer country, we can ramp up our research and development capabilities so that we catch up with this wave, and become one of the leading innovators in these areas," added Dr Nian. "I think that is where the golden opportunity lies with a country that is educated... and is open to new options. We might even be seeing new industries being established. It could be data centres, it could be hydrogen, it could be nuclear." Last month, the Energy Market Authority released its Energy 2050 Committee Report which identified emerging low-carbon sources such as hydrogen, geothermal and nuclear energy as means to bring down the country's emissions to net zero by or around 2050. Ms Tan noted that while the report was commissioned before the surge in energy prices started, and the Ukraine-Russia conflict, EMA still chose to release the report amid the energy crisis. "(EMA) could have chosen to release the report at a later date after prices have stabilised, but the fact that they still chose to release it when we are all suffering from energy price spikes, that seemed like a commitment... that Singapore is committed to tackling this crisis." Singapore's power sector now produces about 40 per cent of the country's emissions, but the sector can realistically reach net zero by 2050, the report said. Ms Swati hopes that the current energy and existing climate crises will allow humankind to explore opportunities for a better future world. She added that through nature-based solutions, for example, individuals' relationships with the natural environment will improve and benefit people, enriching their lives. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home \</doc>

Nov. 15 Manila(Inquirer/ANN)- The Philippines and a new $10-billion global fund are looking into a partnership to finance the country's shift to green and renewable energy sources, the Department of Finance (DOF) said on Friday. In a statement, the DOF said Secretary Carlos Dominguez III had met with Rockefeller Foundation president Rajiv Shah, who was also a pioneer of the private sector-led Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP), on the sidelines of the 26th United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland. Dominguez led the Philippine delegation to COP26 as chair-designate of the Climate Change Commission (CCC). GEAPP, meanwhile, earlier pledged at least $10 billion "to help accelerate the implementation of clean energy projects in developing economies highly vulnerable to climate change," the DOF said. GEAPP also aimed to "deliver transformational programs that will accelerate and scale up an equitable energy transition in developing and emerging economies, while creating millions of jobs in the process," the DOF added. The DOF said Dominguez and Shah "briefly discussed a possible list of projects that the organization can help fund for the Philippines." In particular, Dominguez pitched the Philippines' plan to decommission and repurpose coal-fired power plants in Mindanao. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Dhaka, March 16 -- Bangladesh is a rapidly developing economy facing the challenge of Climate Change. Climate experts have assessed that Bangladesh is among the most vulnerable countries due to Climate Change. With adverse impacts of Climate Change staring in the eye Bangladesh people and its leaders are gearing up to the task. Our Prime Minister, who chairs the Climate Vulnerability Forum (CVF), has made climate resilient strategies in Bangladesh the fulcrum of our development strategies, as prescribed in the 8th Five-Year Plan (8FYP), Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, Perspective Plan 2041, and the forthcoming Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan. Back in 2019, Bangladesh was the first country whose Parliament had declared Climate Change as a "planetary emergency", an idea promoted by the then Bangladeshi President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. It is now established, following in-depth global research on climate and the economy, that we can be 'green' and we can grow. Global research by pioneer climate economist, Sir Nicholas Stern (Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, 2006), has shown that the long-term benefits of eco-friendly economic growth far outweighs the costs. The conclusion: Greening of the economy does not have to be growth reducing. The growth dividends of greening the economy is there. South Korea provides an example of options and best practice in this regard. The country is one of the fastest growing economies of the 20th century that transformed from a low-income country to a high- income country, all in a span of 50 years, Greening of the economy over decades required massive investment that had to be financed out of the growth dividends that the rapidly growing Korean economy enjoyed. South Korea's exemplary strategy of Green Growth presents an excellent example for other rapidly growing economies like Bangladesh to follow. The lesson clearly is that for achieving sustainable and Green Growth Bangladesh will have to resort to Green Financing. Bangladesh cannot be left behind in the fight against the ravages of Climate Change. The country is gearing up on both adaptation and mitigation avenues of the climate resilience strategy, all requiring additional financing for investment. Though a small emitter of GHG Bangladesh expressed solidarity with the world community at COP15/ COP26 to contain GHG emissions to 2030. Though, as a Least Developed Country (LDC), it was not required to make any commitments, it submitted an Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) in 2015 that was recently updated as NDC 2021. Bangladesh takes its commitments seriously as current Chair of the Climate Vulnerability Forum (CVF). The Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan, an aspirational Plan which is about to be launched, shifts Bangladesh's trajectory from one of vulnerability to resilience to prosperity (VRP). One of the overarching goals of MCPP is to strengthen employment in a green economy, that is climate-resilient, low-carbon, resource efficient and socially inclusive for faster job creation. Both market-based and non-market strategies may be adopted to achieve these goals. Rapid growth with low-carbon eco-friendly power generation (shifting to renewable energy), industrial production, transportation, agriculture, and waste management, is possible and realistic for leaving a legacy of sustainable living for our next generation. Bangladesh must set its eyes on a path to net-zero emissions, if not by 2040s, but certainly by 2060s-2070s, in tandem with China and India. Dr Zaidi Sattar is chairman, Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh (PRI). This is his introductory remarks at PRI-WB Webinar on Green Finance and Investment takes place on Wednesday.

Bangladeshi children have urged the country's leaders to address the climate change crisis urgently as a child rights issue and demanded they be involved more in finding solutions to the issue, ahead of the global COP26 meet in Glasgow. The children's calls were captured in the Bangladeshi Children's Climate Declaration that a group of children handed over to Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Shahab Uddin, Speaker Dr Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury and other leaders at an event in Parliament on Wednesday. The children's message to the government's official COP26 delegation was clear: 'Bring our appeal with you when you travel to Glasgow. Climate change is a child rights issue.' The declaration was prepared in November 2020 at the first-ever Children's Climate Summit by engaging over one million Bangladeshi children involved with the UNICEF-supported Generation Parliament initiative by Bangladesh Debate Federation (BDF). The Bangladeshi Children's Climate Declaration calls on the government to protect children against the impacts of climate change, reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, increase investments in education, training and a green economy, and consult children on policies and decisions that impact their future. 'Climate change is threatening our survival, well-being and future. We are asking you to stand up for the children of this country and do more to fight climate change,' said 13-year-old Kaba Kaushin Arisha, who handed over the declaration on behalf of the children who participated in the 2020 Summit. 'Unless we act now and we act together, we will reach a point of no return. This is our call to you, and to COP26 .' Dr. Shirin Sharmin thanked the over one million children who united behind this Declaration, and UNICEF for bringing them - children and decision-makers - together. "It is only by listening to our children that we can shape a better future for all,' she said. The government of Bangladesh is committed to upholding the rights of children and addressing climate change as a child rights issue. "We will continue working -- with and for children -- for a better, safer, greener Bangladesh,' said Shahab Uddin, Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, who is part of the official Bangladesh delegation to COP26 . Although Bangladesh is among the lowest per-capita greenhouse gas emitting countries in the world (bottom 20 percent), it is one of the countries that is most affected by climate change. UNICEF's first-ever Children's Climate Risk Index (CCRI 2021) found that children in Bangladesh are among the world's most vulnerable to climate change. The Index ranked Bangladesh as the 15th country globally in terms of climate change risks and impacts on children. UNICEF estimates that one in three children in Bangladesh, nearly 20 million children, bear the brunt of climate change every day. Children are victims of extreme weather, floods, river erosion, sea level rise, and other environmental shocks driven by climate change. Many end up adrift in city slums, their lives and prospects shattered. Millions of children are trapped in exploitive child labour, child marriage and trafficking. 'Children in Bangladesh are not responsible for the climate crisis, yet they face its most severe impacts, paying the highest price,' said Sheldon Yett, UNICEF Representative to Bangladesh. "UNICEF stands with children in Bangladesh in their appeal for intergenerational solidarity. The needs of children must be at the centre of the climate change response.' \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 2 -- The developed world's $100 billion climate financing target could be met a year earlier than expected, US climate envoy John Kerry said on Tuesday, citing new commitments made earlier in the day by Japan. In 2009, the developed countries most responsible for global warming pledged to provide $100 billion per year by 2020 to help developing nations deal with its consequences. That commitment is currently not expected to be met until 2023. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told the COP26 United Nations climate conference in Glasgow his country would offer up to $10 billion over five years in additional assistance to support decarbonisation in Asia, reports Reuters. Citing that pledge at a separate COP26 event, Kerry said: "It has the ability to leverage and to produce from the World Bank and other sources about another $8.0 billion. "So that will put us over - if that detail gets locked in properly - that would put us over the 100 for next year, not waiting until (20)23. "But as we all know, at these gatherings, it's not over until it's over. It's not done until it's done, but I believe it can (be)."

Apr. 5 Dhaka(The Daily Star/ANN)- While the world was already passing through various challenges including Covid-19 pandemic, climate change that affected food production and supply chains, Ukraine war has further complicated the global situation in the food sector. This is more so as Russia and Ukraine are major food suppliers of the world. The Daily Star reached out to UN Food and Agriculture Organization Director-General Qu Dongyu, who toured Bangladesh early March,via email to understand the crises and ways out. DS: With Russia-Ukraine war, energy supplies are being disrupted and prices are going up. What are its implications and what is FAO's strategy to face this new situation? For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. Dongyu: Russia and Ukraine play a substantial role in global food production and supply. Together, they provide 19 percent of the world's barley supply, 14 percent of wheat, and 4 percent of maize, making up more than one-third of global cereal exports. The global fertilizer supply is also highly concentrated, with Russia as the lead producer. Supply chain and logistical disruptions on Ukrainian and Russian grain and oilseed production and restrictions on Russia's exports will have significant food security repercussions around the world. This is especially true for some 50 countries that depend on Russia and Ukraine for 30 percent or more of their wheat supply. Many of them are least developed countries or low-income, food-deficit countries in Northern Africa, Asia and the Near East. Many European and Central Asian countries rely on Russia for over 50 percent of their fertilizer supply, and shortages there could extend to next year. FAO has five policy recommendations to address this situation: keep global food and fertilizer trade open; find new and more diverse food suppliers; support vulnerable groups, including internally displaced people; avoid ad hoc policy reactions; and strengthen market transparency and dialogue. DS: What is the FAO's strategy for Bangladesh and South Asia, a densely populated region that faces the threats of climate change and decline in farmland amid rapid urbanisation and industrialisation? Dongyu: FAO's mission for the next 10 years is to support the 2030 Agenda through the transformation of agri-food systems and making them more efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable. The approach to agriculture is now not production-oriented approach but much more holistic. While production needs to increase to meet the demands of a growing population, agriculture needs to reduce its carbon footprint, use natural resources optimally and provide decent livelihoods. FAO's updated strategy on climate change takes a sustainable agri-food systems approach and places small holders and family farmers at the centre and promotes country-driven climate actions for sustainable results. DS: With the new farmingtechnologies, food productivity level has almost reached its peak. How far can food productivity increase through use of modern technology to feed the ever increasing population? Dongyu: Many exciting farming systems innovations to increase productivity and technologies such as digitalisation to improve efficiencies have emerged in the last decade. Traditional knowledge such as about good cultural practices, enhancing biodiversity and cropping patterns is contributing to enhancing resilience. FAO promotes both old and new innovations that are relevant to various country contexts and is developing a science and innovation strategy to upscale work in this area. Besides, we can produce more food by using less resources, these innovations can also conserve natural resources and mitigate adverse environmental impacts. No size fits all. Countries with ageing populations will need solutions such as smart farming while those with young populations need more emphasis on skill development and entrepreneurship. DS: How is FAO working and how should the countries work in tackling climate change-related challenges in terms of food production? Dongyu: FAO is developing a five-year Action Plan in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To respond to the growing number of climate and food security challenges, countries need to increase biodiversity, implement actions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions as committed at COP26 and other agreements, improve policy and governance on climate actions and mobilise more funding for climate finance including from the private sector. DS: Bangladesh has significantly increased food production in the last few decades. Do you think that it has equally improved the level of nutrition and food safety? If not, why and what can Bangladesh do? Dongyu: The Asia-Pacific Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition in 2020 showed that more than 40 percent of the population in the region cannot afford a healthy diet. This, in turn, contributes to multiple burdens of malnutrition in a region which otherwise has shown good economic growth even during the Covid-19 pandemic. Countries in the region including Bangladesh need to do more to ensure that all citizens can access healthy diets through a judicious mix of nutritious crops and sources of protein such as meat and fish. Bangladesh should be justifiably proud of having achieved the MDGs and ensuring availability of safe and nutritious diets will be vital to achieve the SDGs. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen on Sunday sought global partnership and collaboration in the areas of technology transfer and investment to help Bangladesh increase its renewable energy share. 'We want to boost renewable energy share. We seek their technology and investment,' he told reporters at a media briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after his meeting with the envoys of European countries. European Union (EU) Ambassador to Bangladesh Charles Whiteley tweeted after the meeting saying the EU head of missions had fruitful exchange with the Foreign Minister and the Environment Minister on preparations for COP26 and their shared approach to many climate concerns. Dr Momen said the government has already concealed the plan of having seven coal-based power plants as it is focusing on more renewable energy. 'Partner countries need to help us with technology and concessional loans. We can expect public-private partnership in this area,' he said. Responding to a question on achieving a net-zero carbon emission target by 2050, Dr Momen said it will be very difficult for Bangladesh to achieve the target as a developing country. Bangladesh, however, recognizes the urgent need to make ambitious and accelerated efforts to limit average temperature rises to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, strengthen adaptation to the impacts of climate change, and scale up finance and support towards these ends. Bangladesh also called for increased climate action in the lead up to the COP26 Summit, which will be held in Glasgow in November keeping in consideration the development needs of individual countries. Bangladesh underscored the necessity of securing commitments from global leaders, especially the G20, to curb global emissions substantially, arrest global temperature at 1.5 degrees, and secure maximal climate finance, especially for adaptation and concrete actions on low-carbon technology transfer. During the meeting with the EU envoys, Bangladesh talked about the importance of developed countries delivering their collective climate finance goal to jointly mobilise US$100 billion annually in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation, to address the needs of developing countries. The Bangladesh side also talked about the possibility of wind power offshore and sought support from the European countries to that end. The UK will host the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow on October 31 to November 12. The COP26 The Prime Minister is likely to leave Dhaka for Glasgow on October 31 and she will visit London before heading for Paris. She is likely to hold a bilateral meeting with her British counterpart Boris Johnson either in Glasgow or in London. The Prime Minister is also expected to hold bilateral talks with French President Emmanuel Macron during her Paris visit. \</doc>

DHAKA, Feb. 13 -- Bangladesh has sought IRENA's technical and financial support in undertaking the feasibility study and mapping of the renewable energy potentials in Bangladesh. Foreign minister AK Abdul Momen discussed the issue during a meeting with Francesco La Camera, director general of International Renewable Energy Agency at its headquarters in Abu Dhabi on Friday. Momen mentioned offshore wind resource assessment with detailed feasibility study and pilot project on Solar-Wind-Storage Hybrid Power System in Bhasan Char Island where a large number of Rohingyas have been relocated. He also mentioned about the Grid Modernisation Strategy and Storage roadmap for Bangladesh to integrate large scale Variable Renewable Energy. Momen reiterated Bangladesh's all out support to encourage innovative and affordable application of renewable technologies. Appreciating the remarkable works done by IRENA under the leadership of the director general in advancing the renewable energy agenda, the foreign minister expressed Bangladesh's full support to IRENA and its works with a view to encouraging innovative and affordable application of renewable technologies. 'Bangladesh has been closely working with IRENA and is fully engaged in IRENA's activities,' he noted. Bangladesh was elected as one of vice-presidents in the twelfth session of the assembly that held in mid-January in 2022 and is also working as facilitator for election/nomination of the council members for the next IRENA Council 2023-2024. Bangladesh also served in the credential committee for the past two consecutive assemblies. Momen highlighted the achievements of Bangladesh in the area of renewable energy. At the COP 26 in Glasgow, being current chair of Climate Vulnerability Forum and Vulnerable 20 Group prime minister Sheikh Hasina announced her vision to develop up to 40 per cent clean energy by 2041 and to gradual reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions by way of NDCs, he said. Bangladesh along with other 49 countries made a commitment to developing climate resilient and low-carbon health systems at COP26 , said the foreign minister. He requested the director general of IRENA for facilitating employment opportunities for Bangladeshi nationals at different capacities in the IRENA secretariat. Both sides expressed satisfaction at the very constructive meeting. The foreign minister extended an invitation to the director general to visit Bangladesh in line with his participation in next month's golden jubilee celebration of the independence of Bangladesh.

Dhaka, Oct. 13 -- Bangladesh, being a key player in the world, has been doing remarkably well in its action against climate change, said UK Regional Ambassador for the Asia Pacific and South Asia Ken O'Flaherty. Recently its submission of an appreciable NDC with enhanced ambitions attracted Britain's attention. He said the world wants to learn from Bangladesh's experiences in fighting against climate action. Mr. Ken said this in a bilateral discussion meeting with Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Md Shahab Uddin held Wednesday at the conference room of the ministry in Bangladesh Secretariat. The British High Commissioner to Bangladesh Robert Chatterton Dickson, Secretary of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Md. Mostafa Kamal was present among others. The UK government's COP26 Regional Ambassador said the UK appreciates Bangladesh's role in raising its voice for global climate action including yearly 100-billion-dollar assistance, loss, and damage as well as article 6. He also said that Britain expects an exemplary declaration from the Bangladesh government which will encourage regional countries. He said Britain is working hard for a practical solution to climate change in COP26 . Ken O'Flaherty said the US will double its contribution to climate assistance. Britain will provide necessary assistance to Bangladesh in the areas of climate change action. The environment minister said Bangladesh is finalising updating BCCSAP and formulating NAP. Bangladesh has drafted the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan 2030. The Minister said Bangladesh has submitted an updated NDC by enhancing its contribution triple to reduce carbon emission than that of its previous one. Bangladesh will enhance its contribution further if it is assisted with necessary sufficient funds and technology. Bangladesh expects an effective outcome from the COP26 , he continued.

Dhaka, Oct. 30 -- The government must announce that no new coal-based power project will be approved and financed after 2021 with a view to achieving the renewable energy target. Besides, developed countries responsible for a lion's share of carbon emissions have to release money to the climate funds, including the Green Climate Fund (GCF), as compensation, not as loan or insurance money. The Bangladesh chapter of Transparency International, TIB made these recommendations at a press conference in Dhaka on Thursday, prior to the upcoming Climate Conference COP26 of the United Nations slated for October 31 to November 12 in Scotland's Glasgow, UK. According to experts, the outcome of the conference is critically important for climate vulnerable countries like Bangladesh. They stressed the need for formulating a clear roadmap nationally for renewable energy so that implementation of the commitments we have made nationally and internationally to move towards renewable power generation can be fulfilled. Although there is a global call for saying no to any new coal-fired power plants, many coal-based power plants are currently under construction, said experts.It is apprehended that Bangladesh, a victim of climate change, is likely to incur losses worth $2.2 billion on average per year because of global warming. The country's annual average temperature has also increased by 0.64 per cent in 2018, which was 10 times higher than the annual average temperature increase in 1961. If the trend continues, by 2030 the annual average temperature will be nearly double. In such circumstances, the upcoming COP26 is important for Bangladesh along with other climate vulnerable countries to raise their voices. Bangladesh along with other climate vulnerable countries has specific agenda that reflect their active interests. They would try to ensure commitments of major carbon emitting countries to limit carbon emissions, and scale up climate funds urgently to support vulnerable countries. Bangladesh, which will lead the Climate Vulnerable Forum at the COP26 in Glasgow with our prime minister as its chairperson, must take serious steps to promote renewable energy such as solar and wind power while phasing out all coal-fired plants. It must serve as an example to the world and prove that it practices what it preaches. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Ahead of this year\' s UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow, the President of the conference, Mr. Alok Sharma, and the President of the UN Climate Change Conference COP25 in Madrid in 2019, Ms. Carolina Schmidt of Chile, have called on all countries to either follow through on commitments made under the Climate Ambition Alliance, or to join the efforts of the Alliance. The Climate Ambition Alliance brings together countries, businesses, investors, cities and regions which are working towards achieving net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, as well as countries committed to updating their national climate action plans under the Paris Agreement - Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Alluding to the analysis of national climate action plans submitted in 2020 and compiled by the UN Climate Change secretariat, the COP Presidents write:  The leadership from governments and non-state actors starts our pathway to net zero. But it is not enough ( ) We are currently a long way off what science tells us is needed over the course of this decade. Together we need to go further and faster to ensure that we build a healthier and more sustainable future, one which respects the natural systems that underpin our existence and delivers dignity for all of humanity. \</doc>

New taxes on air travel and maritime shipping could raise the billions of dollars needed to help the countries suffering most from climate change, a UN expert said Friday. "Such levies, based on the well-established polluter-pays principle, could raise hundreds of billions of dollars annually to assist small island developing states (SIDS) and least developed countries (LDCs) recover and rebuild from the damage caused by climate change," said David Boyd, UN special rapporteur on human rights and the environment. The climate crisis is also a human rights crisis, he said in a message directed at world leaders gathering in the UK's Glasgow for the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) that starts Sunday. "People living on these small islands and at least developed countries are already suffering devastating losses and damage from climate change - more frequent extreme weather events, floods, droughts, rising sea levels, and saltwater contamination of their water supplies and agricultural lands." David Boyd, UN special rapporteur on human rights and the environment In recent years, powerful hurricanes and cyclones have wreaked havoc on the Bahamas, Dominica, Fiji, Vanuatu and other countries, damaging up to 90 per cent of buildings and inflicting losses that sometimes exceeded their annual GDPs. Over the past three decades, wealthy states have failed to provide virtually any funds for vulnerable countries to deal with loss and damage caused by climate change, which will rise to $290 billion to $580 billion every year by 2030. Boyd elaborated his proposals in a brief to the COP26 leaders in which he analysed two innovative financing approaches proposed by the Maldives, the Republic of Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands. Taxes on commercial aviation and maritime shipping would be fair because these sectors are major polluters, with combined emissions larger than some of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, he said. Emissions from these sectors have grown rapidly in recent decades and are projected to more than double by 2050. COP26 should be a turning point in global efforts to develop new and innovative sources of climate finance to address losses, damages, and adaptation, with a particular focus on the needs of the SIDS and LDCs, the UN special rapporteur on human rights and the environment said. "The time for talking about support for climate-vulnerable countries is long past," he added. "Now is the time for urgent action." \</doc>

The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report shows growth in global emissions has slowed over the past decade. But much more needs to be done, including halving global emissions by 2030, to keep the 'goal of 1.5C' within reach and avoid the worst impacts of global warming. The IPCC's independent report highlights the need for urgent action in decarbonising energy, industry, transport and making homes more energy efficient, to achieve the Paris Agreement's central goal of keeping a global temperature rise this century to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5C. The report also shows reasons for optimism with a trend showing a slowing growth of global emissions. It also details how economic growth can be achieved alongside ambitious emissions reductions and the falling costs of renewables. Since 2010, solar energy costs and lithium-ion battery costs have decreased by around 85%, and wind energy by around 55%. The UK is calling on countries to deliver on the Glasgow Climate Pact, in which 197 countries agreed to revisit and strengthen their 2030 emissions reduction commitments (Nationally Determined Contributions) as necessary this year to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal and thereby limit the worst impacts of climate change. Governments from around the world have spent a fortnight at a UK-hosted session examining climate scientists' evidence for this report. The IPCC has concluded that to limit warming to 1.5C, global emissions must peak before 2025, and then be halved by early 2030s - in part by ending the world's reliance on fossil fuels, including reducing use of unabated coal by three quarters by 2030. COP26 President Alok Sharma, said this report makes clear that the window to keep 1.5 degrees alive is closing alarmingly fast. "The warning lights are yet again flashing bright red on the climate dashboard and it is high time for governments to sit up and act before it is too late." That is why it is absolutely vital that as agreed in the Glasgow Climate Pact all countries, especially the G20 nations which are responsible for 80 per cent of global emissions, revisit and strengthen their 2030 emission reduction targets this year as necessary to align with the Paris temperature goal if we are to avoid the catastrophic impacts of climate change. But this report also gives hope that the rate of growth in emissions is slowing and that thanks to the falling cost of renewables and technological innovation it is possible to transition to a cleaner future. The UK has already committed to reducing carbon emissions by 68% by 2030 and by 78% by 2035 compared to 1990 levels, before reaching net zero by 2050 as set out in the UK's comprehensive Net-Zero Strategy. It is calling on the global community to honour the commitment to provide at least $100bn a year to support developing countries take ambitious climate action. UK Minister of State for Energy and Climate Change, Greg Hands, said the report is a reminder to the world of the grave threat of climate change. "There is still a window of opportunity to act to reduce the effects. The UK is going further and faster to generate more cheap and clean renewable power. This will reduce our exposure to expensive global gas prices. The IPCC's last report, published in February, warned that some of the impacts of global warming are 'irreversible', with more than 40% of the world's population now highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather events like floods and heatwaves. Today's report also highlights the economic opportunities from the transition to a net zero economy, with the falling costs of renewable energy, and comes six months after the UK published a comprehensive Net Zero Strategy. This sets out how it will secure 440,000 well-paid jobs and unlock \£390 billion in investment by 2030, by helping British businesses and consumers transition to clean energy and green technology. It included \£31 billion investment in electric vehicles, \£33.9 billion for insulating our homes, along with support for commercialising sustainable aviation fuel and help heavy industry move to hydrogen power. This month the UK is starting to spend its \£3200 million pledged to support developing countries cut emissions through the new extension of the Partnering for Accelerated Climate Transitions (PACT) programme. The funding represents a doubling of support for communities worst affected by global warming. The IPCC provides the most authoritative, cutting-edge, scientific assessment of climate change. Independent of politics, the IPCC provides Governments around the world with a totally impartial scientific evidence base for climate policy and UN climate negotiations. Its scale of global scientific collaboration is unique, bringing together hundreds of world-leading authors from across the world. This Working Group report on mitigation has been developed with 278 scientists from 65 countries, all who have volunteered their time and expertise to produce this report. This latest report is the product of 7 years' work with thousands of contributions from scientists, individuals and countries, through an extensive review and consultation process. \</doc>

Oct. 18 Thimphu (Kuensel/ANN)- Next month in Glasgow, the UK, Bhutan will lead 46 least developed countries (LDC) at the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ). As the chair of the LDC since 2019, the meeting will be the last under Bhutan's chairmanship. But that's not important. What is significant is that Bhutan and the LDCs will take the Thimphu Call for Ambition and Action on Climate Change to COP26 . Chief of LDC Group at the ministerial level, Foreign Minister Dr Tandi Dorji, said that the pandemic has hit everyone around the globe but the one billion people living in the 46 LDCs are the worst hit, facing quadruple crises of climate change, poverty, health, and economic challenges that are outpacing the disease itself. "Climate change, by contrast, has no vaccine and poses a threat that is exponentially larger and far less reversible, and ultimately existential if we do not act now," he said. That's a powerful statement. The irony, though, is that even with all the expertise they have the rich countries continue to contribute significantly to climate change. According to a UN story, the world's wealthiest 1 percent produces more than double the combined carbon emissions of the poorest 50 percent and calls for the world's wealthy to change their lifestyles radically to tackle climate change. The negotiation is not going to be easy going by past experiences but LDCs must mount the pressure, now more than ever. As is spelt out in the Thimphu Call for Ambition and Action the LDCs must call upon parties, in particular the G20 countries, to enhance their nationally determined contributions in line with 1.5\'b0C pathways and consistent with their responsibilities and capabilities to undertake climate action to reduce the emissions gap to 1.5\'b0C. Bhutan submitted its second NDC in June 2021, setting much more ambitious targets without changing the country's carbon-neutral goal. What is obvious is the LDCs face and will continue to confront challenges such as shortage of funds to maintain their determined contributions and mount plans and activities related to fighting climate change. The world will need more than USD 100 billion commitment from the developed countries to address the needs of developing countries. The chair of climate negotiations, Sonam P Wangdi, said that the COP26 must prioritise the issue of loss and damage caused by climate change. "Our people are suffering in a variety of ways as a result of a crisis that they did little to cause...It is now time to discuss how the international community can fairly address the loss and the damage manifesting in developing countries because of climate change." Climate change is a global problem which must be tackled globally. We have heard enough hollow promises from the rich countries. What we must not forget is that the Glasgow meet is perhaps the world's final chance to pause and commit itself to a new and sustainable model of development. If Bhutan can't lead the LDCs to win the deal at COP26 , chances of LDCs ever being heard in such an important global summit is slim. It's a heavy burden on Bhutan and LDCs. That's precisely why the group must do all in their capacity to get a fair deal. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 17 -- Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen on Sunday sought European partnership and collaboration in the areas of technology transfer and investment to help Bangladesh increase its renewable energy share. "We want to boost renewable energy share. We seek their technology and investment," he told reporters at a media briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after his meeting with the envoys of European countries, reports UNB. Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Md Shahab Uddin and Foreign Secretary Masud Bin Momen were, among others present. European Union (EU) Ambassador to Bangladesh Charles Whiteley tweeted after the meeting saying the EU head of missions had fruitful exchange with the Foreign Minister and the Environment Minister on preparations for COP26 and their shared approach to many climate concerns. Dr Momen said the government has already concealed the plan of having seven coal-based power plants as it is focusing on more renewable energy. "Partner countries need to help us with technology and concessional loans. We can expect public-private partnership in this area," he said. Responding to a question on achieving a net-zero carbon emission targets by 2050, Dr Momen said it will be very difficult for Bangladesh to achieve the target as a developing country. Bangladesh, however, recognises the urgent need to make ambitious and accelerated efforts to limit average temperature rises to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, strengthen adaptation to the impacts of climate change, and scale up finance and support towards these ends. Bangladesh also called for increased climate action in the lead up to the COP26 Summit, which will be held in Glasgow in November keeping in consideration the development needs of individual countries. Bangladesh underscored the necessity of securing commitments from global leaders, especially the G20, to curb global emissions substantially, arrest global temperature at 1.5 degrees, and secure maximal climate finance, especially for adaptation and concrete actions on low-carbon technology transfer. During the meeting with the EU envoys, Bangladesh talked about the importance of developed countries delivering their collective climate finance goal to jointly mobilise US$100 billion annually in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation, to address the needs of developing countries. The Bangladesh side also talked about the possibility of wind power offshore and sought support from the European countries to that end. The UK will host the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow from October 31 to November 12. The COP26 The Prime Minister is likely to leave Dhaka for Glasgow on October 31 and she will visit London before heading for Paris. She is likely to hold a bilateral meeting with her British counterpart Boris Johnson either in Glasgow or in London. The Prime Minister is also expected to hold bilateral talks with French President Emmanuel Macron during her Paris visit.

Dhaka, Nov. 12 -- In late October this year, just before the start of COP26 , the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) calculated that the world is on its way to a catastrophic 2.7-degree Celsius temperature rise by the end of this century, even if all countries deliver on their pledges for climate action. Since then, several countries including India and Pakistan have announced new commitments to limit their emissions. But these additional pledges are not enough, UNEP executive director Inger Andersen told delegates at COP26 in Glasgow on 9 November. "Frankly, it's an elephant giving birth to a mouse," she declared at a panel discussion during the ongoing UN climate summit. The difference between the cut in emissions needed to stay on track to the goals of the Paris Agreement on the one hand and the trajectory of emissions cuts based on current pledges on the other is known as the 'emissions gap'. The UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2021 released in October was the 12th annual report that provides an overview of the gap between what the science demands and the current political ambition. As negotiations in Glasgow remain stalled over the question of financing from developed countries for climate action in developing nations, Andersen said there was a "leadership gap on top of the emissions gap". She explained that the pledges made when the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015 would - if delivered upon - shave 7.8% of emissions from the business-as-usual scenario. "Now, it is 8%, whereas we need a 55% reduction by 2030 if we are to keep to the 1.5C goal." The 1.5C goal is the aspirational target of the Paris Agreement, to keep average global temperature rise compared with pre-industrial times within a 1.5C ceiling this century. In her address at Glasgow, Andersen was also strongly critical of the 'net zero' pledges made by 130 countries, which declare a year by which a country's greenhouse gas emissions will be matched by carbon that is removed from the atmosphere. She described the current promises as "generally vague and untransparent - some deal with greenhouse gases, some deal with carbon dioxide only". "What we need to see between now and 2030 is to halve our emissions," said Anderson. "Climate change is here and now - and we're now at 1.2 [degrees Celsius above average global pre-industrial temperatures]. When the IPCC released its report this year, we didn't need graphs - what we saw out of our windows was enough. We're seeing floods and storms already." Anne Olhoff, lead author of the UNEP Emissions Gap Report, said that experts had calculated the impact of the new pledges made since the report's release, and found that they would only limit global temperature rise by 0.1C. "If all the NDCs [Nationally Determined Contributions] - unconditional and those conditional on receiving money from rich nations - are fully implemented, the overall effect will be to hold temperature rise down by 0.5C." Net-zero targets not credible, warn experts The updated NDCs and net-zero pledges presented at COP26 have also been analysed by independent think tanks working under the umbrella of Climate Action Tracker. At a press conference at COP26 , Claire Stockwell, senior climate policy analyst at Climate Analytics - a member of the tracker - said: "India will reduce its emissions a little bit earlier than usual. Australia and Brazil have gone worse in their updates." At the World Leaders Summit that kicked off this UN conference, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged to raise renewable energy installed capacity from 450 to 500 gigawatts by 2030, and to reduce emissions by 1 billion tonnes this decade, among other promises. Overall, "the emissions gap till 2030 is so huge that we don't see any chance of sticking to the 1.5-degree ceiling," veteran analyst Bill Hare said, joining the same press conference. "Net zero is just paying lip service to climate action," Hare added. "Not a single country has short-term policy for net-zero targets," said Niklas Hohne of New Climate Institute, another member of the tracker. "So the net-zero target is not credible. In 2030 we will still emit roughly twice as much as we should if we want to be on the 1.5C pathway. The only way is to go into emergency mode - baby steps will not do." COP26 negotiations still stuck over finance But even baby steps have been missing in the negotiating rooms in Glasgow in recent days, due to the worsening stalemate over finance. Developing countries are already incensed because developed countries have not kept their promise to provide USD 100 billion in climate financing per year by 2020. On top of that, rumours have been circulating in the conference corridors that the European Union is going back on its promise to dedicate 50% of its financial support to help developing countries adapt to the impacts of climate change. The negotiations have now moved from bureaucrats to ministers. In his report on progress, conference president Alok Sharma's statement on Tuesday read: "The time has now come to find political consensus on the areas of divergence and we have only a few days left. What has been collectively committed to goes some way, but certainly not all the way, to keeping 1.5C within reach." Bhupender Yadav, India's environment minister, confirmed that negotiations were stuck over finance. "Developed countries are asking developing countries to come up with climate action plans. How will they do it in the absence of finance? And we're not asking for charity. We're asking developed countries to stick to their pledges under the polluter pays principle, which is fundamental to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change."

Dec. 21\'e2\€  H\'c3\€ N\'e1\'bb I (Vietnam News/ANN) \'e2\€  Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam will not develop coal-fired power plants after 2030 to meet its international commitments on achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Accordingly, the Government has assigned the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) to study and implement the National Power Development Plan for the 2021-30 period with a vision to 2045 (PDP8) so as to make it include measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 as per the Vietnamese Prime Minister Ph\'e1\'ba\£1m Minh Ch\'c3\£dnh's commitments at the COP 26 UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ). Besides, the Government has also required the MoIT to map out incentive policies to encourage the development of offshore wind power sources. It also needs to research policies and solutions for more efficient and rational use of solar energy sources, the Government noted. The MoIT must clearly define the criteria of important projects and investment priorities to ensure the implementation of the PDP8 to be open, transparent and feasible. In addition, it is necessary to propose effective and feasible management mechanisms to ensure the PDP8 succeeds and absolutely avoids a power shortage in the country. The MoIT is streamlining the PDP8, which provides the roadmap for the country's power sector including an exhaustive list of proposed projects. Under the latest version of the plan presented by the MoIT at last month's conference, power generation capacity from new imported LNG will be slashed to 22.4 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 from 40.95GW in the draft published in March. The planned power generation capacity from new LNG by 2045 will also fall to 55.75GW, from 83.55GW in the March draft. However, power generation capacity from domestic natural gas and the conversion of coal-fired plants to LNG will be kept unchanged at 14.78GW by 2030 in the new draft. Coal-fired power generation will be reduced to 39.7GW by 2030 in the latest draft, down from 46.4GW in the March draft. Meanwhile, offshore wind power will be raised to 4GW by 2030 from 3GW in the March draft, while electricity storage capacity will be doubled to 2.4GW from 1.2GW in the March draft. The most significant change in the latest version is the pipeline of new LNG-based power projects being cut by nearly half, dampening expectations that Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam will be the next big market for LNG in Southeast Asia.

Nov. 15 Karachi(Dawn/ANN)- CLIMATE conversations have been taking place since 1995 with limited success. The turning point in the talks took place in 2015 when the historic Paris Agreement was signed by 196 countries. As the French foreign minister and chair of COP21, Laurent Fabius, asserted, "The success in Paris was made possible by a strong process of environmental diplomacy." He said, "This is no time for climate fatalism. We need science, societies and states to be in alignment for our crucial next steps." Sciencehas made progress on many fronts. Scientific reports generated on climate chan\£d\£dge and biodiversity have upped the ante for urgent action. Society has played a vital role in raising social consciousness and increasing the bandwidth of the climate message. State\£dsare lagging behind in meeting commitments because climate negotiations are driven by climate politics in which commitments made by countries are influenced by the limited time horizon of political parties who see the climate agenda more through the prism of electoral politics and not so much as a commitment to global climate stabilisation. COP26 was preceded by the Climate Am\£d\£db\£dition Summit held in December 2020. Despite stronger climate policy and higher ambition in the latest national pledges, there is still a large gap between near-term commitments under the Paris Agreement and what is needed to keep temperature increase within 1.5 degrees Celsius. The other two major pre- COP26 events include the Kunming Conv\£den\£dtion on Biodiversity and the G20 summit in Rome. The outcome of both did not reflect any positive developments. Biodiver\£dsity losses have not decreased and the capacity of forests and oceans to absorb emissions continues to be compromised by unabated marine pollution, and cutting down mature trees that have higher capacity for carbon sequestration. We are left with just nine years to prevent a climate catastrophe. COP26 , postponed by one year due to Covid 19, was held in the backdrop of an escalating global climate crisis and in the wake of one of the most devastating pandemics that exposed the fragility of governance system and societal response to crisis, raising questions about the existing GDP-based economic model for measuring development indicators. It was hoped that this realisation would inject a new approach in addressing threat multiplier factors that threaten the global climate regime responsible for altering Earth's atm\£do\£ds\£d\£dphere since the mid-19th century. Within 100 years the use of fossil fuel has taken the parts per million of carbon-dioxide from 275 ppm to 419 ppm putting at risk the future of all life systems. In this context the success of the Glasgow COP26 depended on: Finalising technical issues carried over from COP25 which include funding for loss and damage and carbon market mechanisms. Delivery of $100 billion finance targets and setting the next target for climate finance by 2025. Galvanising support for common time frames for the Nationally Determined Contri\£dbutions (NDCs) with clear indicators and metrics in order to check real-time progress on commitments. The Glasgow Summit was unsuccessful in reaching consensus on any these critical issues. Meanwhile, the harsh reality remains that the world is left with just nine years and 400 gigatonnes of carbon budget to prevent a climate catastrophe. Unfortunately, govern\£dm\£de\£dnts are directing large public finance for extracting coal, oil and gas since Covid-19 to make up for losses and spur economic recovery. Big emitters like China and India have extended timelines for net zero target beyond 2050 while Australia refuses to cut down on the use of coal. The new pledges are expected to cut glo\£dbal greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 by about 2.9bn tonsof CO2 equivalent. How\£d\£d\£dever, an additional 25-28 GTCO2 is neededto put the world on track by 2100. With conditional and unco\£dnditional NDCs, this goal is fast slipping out of reach. Pakistan presented a revised NDC that balances ambition with conditional and non-conditional commitments. As part of G77, Pakistan's position is aligned with the bloc. The common theme is provision of money to support poorer countries for meeting mitigations and adaptation targets. This means going back to the spirit of the Paris Agreement that was built on a moral mandate leaving no one behind. Without climate justice and with continuing atrophy in international relations, the Paris Agreement runs the risk of unravelling. The announcement by the US and China to collaborate on climate change is a positive development but not enough to avert climate catastrophe. If the success of the Paris Agreement was pegged on environmental diplomacy, then the future of global peace and security will depend on climate diplomacy. It will be in the interest of planetary stabilisation if the Global North accommodates the needs of the Global South and both move in tandem to save the planet.

Nov. 12 Tokyo(The Japan News/ANN)  Japan and about 20 other economies at the U.N. climate talks in Glasgow have compiled an action plan to promote electric and other types of vehicles that do not emit carbon dioxide, sources have said. About 20 participants in the COP26 talks, including Britain, Germany and the United States, will promote investments to encourage companies to set up charging stations for electric vehicles, the sources said Wednesday. These economies have also agreed to consider the establishment of unified standards for such vehicles' operational performance, to allow manufacturers to compete over development and sales on a level playing field. The action plan further includes the creation of standards for evaluating batteries for EVs so they can more easily be bought and sold secondhand. It also stipulates that the participants will cooperate in bolstering supply chains. Electric vehicles can operate for a shorter period of time on one charge than their gasoline-powered counterparts can on a full tank. It also takes at least 30 minutes to charge a battery. As rare materials are vital for enhancing the functionality of batteries, the action plan focuses on establishing a system to ensure stable procurement of these materials from China, Africa and elsewhere. About 20 countries at COP26 , including Britain and Sweden, have committed to ensuring that all newly sold vehicles will be zero-emission by 2040. Japan, Germany and the United States have shied away from this framework, but will extend cooperation with an eye on the expanding market for electric vehicles. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 12 -- China and the United States, the world's two largest emitters of carbon dioxide, unveiled a deal to ramp up cooperation tackling climate change, including by reducing methane emissions, protecting forests and phasing out coal. In a joint statement announced at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, the countries said they had reached an agreement to redouble efforts to fight climate change with "concrete actions". The two biggest carbon-polluting countries said their deal calls for "enhanced climate action in the 2020s" using the 2015 Paris climate deal's guidelines, including a new stronger emission cuts target in 2025, reports Al Jazeera and news agencies. The agreement also calls for "concrete and pragmatic" regulations in decarbonisation, reducing methane emissions and fighting deforestation. "Both sides recognise that there is a gap between the current effort and the Paris Agreement goals so we will jointly strengthen climate action," China's climate envoy Xie Zhenhua said in announcing the agreement on Wednesday. According to Xie, the deal would involve "concrete plans" for enhanced action this decade and both countries were "to work on the finalisation of the Paris Agreement rulebook" at the UN climate summit in Glasgow. Xie said that China and the US had carried out 30 virtual meetings over the course of the last 10 months to come up with the initiative. "As the two major powers in the world, China and the United States have to take on the responsibility to work together with other parties in address climate change," he said. The US and China together account for some 40 percent of all carbon pollution. US climate envoy John Kerry said that the countries also agreed to reduce methane emissions and that the agreement with China was a statement of support for a successful United Nations climate summit. "Together we set out our support for a successful COP26 , including certain elements which will promote ambition, but let me be clear this declaration is a step we can build on in order to close the gap . Every step matters right now and we have a long journey ahead of us," Kerry said at a news conference. 'Good news' Last week US President Joe Biden said Chinese leader Xi Jinping had "walked away" from the climate crisis for skipping the COP26 summit. China hit back at the time, but ties appear to have thawed ahead of long-awaited bilateral talks next week. "The release of this joint declaration shows that cooperation is the only choice for China and the US," said Xie. Al Jazeera's Shihab Rattansi, reporting from Washington, DC, said the countries' pledge to set up a working group to address climate change "in the 2020s" has been welcomed. "This is specifically about the short-term, when action is the most crucial," he said. Rattansi also said the upcoming meeting between Biden and Xi could add to the sense of optimism spurred by Wednesday's climate agreement. Frans Timmermans, the European Commission's executive vice president for the European Green Deal, said the deal "shows that the United States and China can cooperate on issues that transcend other conflicts". "Humanity is faced with the biggest challenge we've had ever, which is the climate crisis, and now China and the US are going to cooperate more closely," Timmermans told Al Jazeera from the conference in Glasgow. "And this is completely in line with what we need to do here at COP, so I really welcome this joint declaration, I think it's good news for us." UN chief Antonio Guterres also said the US-China initiative was an "important step" in the fight against climate change. The news follows the release of a United Nations final draft communique - which while being lauded for highlighting the need to end fossil fuel subsidies for the first time, was criticised for the lack of accountability provisions and vague commitments on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. On Tuesday, the Climate Action Tracker research group noted in a report that under current climate pledges, the average global temperature will warm up to 2.4C by 2100 - a level that would be catastrophic. Britain's Alok Sharma, the COP26 president, acknowledged that "significant issues remain unresolved". "My big, big ask of all of you is to please come armed with the currency of compromise," he told negotiators. "What we agree in Glasgow will set the future for our children and grandchildren, and I know that we will not want to fail them."

Demanding climate justice for all, ActionAid Bangladesh (AAB), in cooperation with Young People, organised the Global Climate Strike on Friday in front of the National Press Club in Dhaka. This Global Climate Strike was attended by more than a hundred representatives of Young People, including 15 transgenders. In addition, youths from nine local rights programmes (LRPs) and two youth platforms (YouthNet for Climate Justice and Bindu) organised the global climate strike on the same date in 19 districts of Bangladesh. In this climate strike, AAB's Resilience and Climate Justice and Young People Strategic Priority reached out to the unheard voices from youth for the upcoming Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ), Youth COP and other relevant events on climate issues. To reinforce "Fridays for Future" and "Global Climate Strike," young people of Bangladesh raised their voices and backed in solidarity with the theme "Uproot the System." In this colourful, sensible and non-violent strike, young activists along with people from across the society demanded climate justice by showing placards and posters titled "There is no planet B;" "Stop! Listen to My Earth;" "Burn Borders, Not Coals" and many more. Referring to the climate scientists, Young People claimed that even half a degree rise in temperature will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat, higher sea levels, causing destruction and poverty for hundreds of millions of people, particularly for the people from the Global South. These effects will impact everyone both rich and poor, and be devastating to our most vulnerable people especially the poorest, youngest, children and women. Farah Kabir, Country Director, ActionAid Bangladesh said in her statement, young people around the globe want to take COP26 as an opportunity to raise their issues on climate to bring to the global leadership. She said many countries of the world have not been able to vaccinate their population, and the majority of those not vaccinated are young people because of age bars and other factors. Farah Kabir also expressed her doubts that the COP26 is not going to be participatory because of the vaccination issue. "This restriction is not supportive of participation, especially of the young people, and COP will not be meaningful if there is no participation of the future generation. Through this climate movement young people around the globe, including Bangladesh, want to take COP26 as an opportunity to raise their issues on climate to bring to the global leadership," she added. \</doc>

Nov. 11 Beijing(China Daily/ANN)- China and the United States have signed a joint declaration to address the global climate crisis during the next decade, marking one of the most significant breakthroughs yet to come out of the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26 , in Glasgow, Scotland. The declaration, which is called the US-China Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s, was announced on Wednesday evening by China's special climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, and US special presidential envoy for climate, John Kerry. The move took many onlookers in Glasgow by surprise, with the media alerted to a joint news conference just an hour before it started. Several world leaders have labelled this year's COP as the most important since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015, and a US-China declaration is sure to send a strong signal to all delegations in attendance. Xie said that the problem of global warming is "increasingly urgent and severe" and that climate change threatens an "existential crisis". "In the area of climate change, there is more agreement between the US and China than divergence, making it an area with huge potential for our cooperation," Xie said. "As two major powers, both China and the US shoulder international responsibilities and obligations. We need to think big." Kerry said the current time represents a "critical decade" in the fight to combat global warming. "The US and China have no shortage of differences, but on climate, cooperation is the only way to get things done," Kerry said. "We cannot reach our goals without countries working together, and China and the US in particular, as the two largest emitters in the world, both have to help show the way." In the joint declaration, both sides reaffirmed their commitment under the Paris Agreement to "hold the global average temperature increase to well below 2 C and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 C". The two countries also agreed to cooperate closely during the next 10 years on a range of climate-related issues, including methane emissions, fossil fuel reduction, and clean energy technologies. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the declaration an "important step in the right direction". "I welcome today's agreement between China and the US to work together to take more ambitious climate action in this decade," Guterres said on Twitter. "Tackling the climate crisis requires international collaboration and solidarity." European Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans said on Twitter that bilateral cooperation between the US and China "should boost negotiations at COP26 ". China and the US said they intend to establish a Working Group on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s, which will meet regularly to "address the climate crisis and advance the multilateral process, focusing on enhancing concrete actions in this decade". In the declaration, the US cited domestic targets to reduce methane emissions, and China announced its own plans for a "comprehensive and ambitious National Action Plan on methane", aiming to achieve significant emissions control and reductions in the 2020s. Also on Wednesday, COP26 President Alok Sharma published a first draft of the proposed Glasgow agreement, which parties will aim to reach at this year's conference, after further negotiations. The draft called on countries to accelerate the phasing out of both coal and fossil fuel subsidies, neither of which has been mentioned in previous COP agreements. The document also included stronger language on the warming target of 2 to 1.5 degrees, which was set in Paris six years ago. The draft "recognizes that the impacts of climate change will be much lower at the temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to 2 degrees, and resolves to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees". Wang Yi, a senior scientific advisor in China's delegation at COP26 , told China Daily on Wednesday that adjusting this target could have a disruptive knock-on effect. "If we decrease the indicator, the target, to 1.5 only, that means we must change the whole Paris Agreement," Wang said. Last week special climate envoy Xie said it is important to honor what was decided on in Paris, calling the agreement "science-based, rule-based, inclusive and realistic". Sharma said that the draft is not offering decisive language on the target. "I also want to be clear we are not seeking to reopen the Paris Agreement," Sharma said on Wednesday. "The Paris Agreement clearly sets out the temperature goal well below 2 C and pursuing efforts towards 1.5 C."

Recently, in the lead up to the 'Global Women's Assembly for Climate Justice,' a six-day virtual forum organized by the Women's Earth and Climate Action Network (WECAN) International, organizers have delivered a detailed Call to Action for climate justice to governments and financial institutions worldwide. The Call to Action was signed by over 120 organizations representing millions of people globally, and was delivered during the UN General Assembly- and will also be presented at COP26 . As climate disasters worsen every day, climate movements around the world are increasing the pressure on governments and financial institutions to take immediate climate action. The 'Global Women's Assembly for Climate Justice: Solutions from the Frontlines and the Protection and Defense of Human Rights and Nature,' started on September 25, and comprised 20 gender-inclusive sessions over six days featuring 100 climate leaders from 40 countries. The Assembly was designed for people to come together and demonstrate what equitable and effective climate action looks like, while building momentum for the crucial United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP26 in November in Glasgow. Event organizers have also released a collection of frameworks and initiatives as recommendations for governments and financial institutions in the run-up to the COP as a complement to the Call to Action. \</doc>

Dhaka, Jan. 27 -- Being the seventh most climate-vulnerable country in the world, Bangladesh is considering adapting its main focus towards addressing climate effects, according to the environment ministry. Bangladesh has increased quantified emission reduction targets to 21.85 per cent below the business-as-usual level by 2030 in the updated NDC, submitted to the UNFCCC on 26 August last year. The country is earnestly striving to ensure low carbon climate resilient sustainable development. The government, also, is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions as part of global efforts, said Deputy Minister for environment Habibun Nahar. She said this while speaking virtually at a ministerial meeting of the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF) hosted by the United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry on Thursday. The deputy minister said following the call of the COP26 , the country already started to consider revisiting its NDC in 2022. The government has already cancelled 10 coal-based power plants worth $12 billion of foreign investment. We have recently drafted a National Solar Energy Roadmap and aim to have 40 per cent of our energy from renewable sources by 2041, she mentioned. In the case of zero emission vehicles, the government has already given incentives to promote Hybrid vehicles, while the country is working on the electric vehicle policy to promote zero emission vehicles in the long run, she added.

Nov. 15 Jakarta(Jakarta Post/ANN)- At the recent COP26 climate conference in the Scottish city of Glasgow, Indonesia was one of more than 40 countries that pledged to transition away from "unabated coal power generation" in the next few decades. Although Indonesia endorsed just three of the pledge's four clauses  excluding Clause 3, related to issuing new permits for coal-fired projects  it was a step in the right direction from the world's biggest coal exporter, and one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases globally, for which coal comprises a significant amount. In its pledge, Indonesia promised to reach net zero by 2060, or sooner with international assistance, and said it would "consider accelerating coal phase out" into the 2040s, on the condition that it receives international financial and technical assistance. The caveat is in many ways a reasonable one. After all, wealthier countries have been the main cause of global emissions, while developing nations have felt the bulk of their impacts. While Indonesia deserves support in these efforts, it also deserves considerable scrutiny. After all, within days of signing onto a pledge to end deforestation by 2030, the first major announcement at COP26 , Indonesia appeared to renege on its commitments, with Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar reportedly calling the pledge "clearly inappropriate and unfair". Yet, between 2001 and 2019, Indonesia lost more than 26 million hectares of forest, a 17 percent decrease in tree cover since the turn of the century, and one of the main drivers of greenhouse gas emissions in Southeast Asia in recent decades. On top of halting deforestation and ending its reliance on coal, there are many other areas where Indonesia can step up its response to the climate crisis. In late September, ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights (APHR) published a report, Building Back Better: Southeast Asia's transition to a green economy after COVID-19, which evaluated whether the recovery measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the region, including Indonesia, promoted a transition to a green economy. Indonesia's performance in almost all areas of the report was deeply disappointing. Of the 11 "green policies" identified as those that can accelerate a green economic transition, Indonesia had adopted just three. This included a US$240 million capital injection into PT Kereta Api Indonesia, the state-owned rail company, supporting clean transport infrastructure, and reducing traffic congestion as part of its National Economic Recovery Program. It also took measures to accelerate solar energy production. In contrast, however, Indonesia had the dubious distinction among the countries of the region of adopting all four negative policies identified as contributing to global emissions. These included providing subsidies for environmentally harmful industries and products such as oil exploitation, deregulating environmental standards, and supporting polluting businesses such as airlines, while providing them with no incentives to adopt more climate-friendly practices. Also in 2020, Indonesia's House of Representatives passed the Mining Law, which allows automatic mining permit extensions of up to 20 years. Mining activities are likely to increase greenhouse gas emissions from land use, which already accounts for almost half of the country's total emissions. There's much that can be done. The measures adopted as part of the COVID-19 economic recovery, and pledges made during COP26 , present a unique opportunity to ensure Indonesia moves away from the current destructive economic model, and instead builds back better. Some progress has been made at COP26 . On the sidelines of the event, Indonesia, as well as the Philippines, signed an agreement with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to establish an Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM), an "ambitious plan that will upgrade Indonesia's energy infrastructure and accelerate the clean energy transition," according to Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati. This builds upon the IEA-Indonesia Energy Transition, which was agreed in March. These are welcome steps that require careful scrutiny, while other steps are also required. This includes encouraging dialogue between constituents and policy makers on the impacts of climate change on their communities, as well as the harms caused by laws such as the Mining Law. The government must also put in place green conditions for supporting large businesses, including state-owned enterprises, as well as promote policies that provide job training in sectors that are positive to the green economy, including renewable energy and energy efficiency. Finally, the Indonesian government must be part of this unprecedented moment in history, and drastically shift away from its reliance on coal, which has done so much to destroy our planet. This means removing fossil fuel subsidies, phasing out coal by 2040, and creating an environment that enables the growth of renewable energy investment. Lawmakers lied at the heart of fulfilling these climate change commitments and as our global leaders met in Scotland, now is the time for us to hold them accountable and ensure they move beyond vague platitudes made in the corridors of power, and toward real policies that improve people's lives, and protect our planet. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Dhaka, June 11 -- The Rt Hon Alok Sharma, MP, UK Cabinet minister and the man presiding over the process leading upto and including annual UN-led talks on climate change, the Conference of the Parties or COP26 , visited the Sundarbans recently. As part of the itinerary, he also visited the WildTeam Conservation Biology Centre (WCBC) in the Sundarbans on the 3rd June, 2021. The British High Commissioner to Bangladesh, Robert Chatterton Dickson, and his other colleagues from the UK accompanied them. It rained all the time in the Sundarbans. While standing on WildTeam's Forest Tiger Response Team boat, Alok Sharma was saying, and he later put it down in a tweet: "Here we are in Bangladesh in the Sundarbans ... and we're just seeing the really positive impact that these mangroves have, both in terms of biodiversity capturing carbon dioxide emissions but also protecting communities the ferocity of typhoons when they come through. And hearing the stories about the work that is being done by the TigerTeam to ensure that tigers are protected at the same time as the humans are protected in the villages. And the aim is to ensure that nature can be at one with humans as well, and it is really quite spectacular - you have to be here to really experience this - we're right in the middle of the mangroves with some rain coming down and seeing the incredibly lush vegetation that is here. It's an absolute honour to be able to visit something like this, and of course we should be doing everything we can to preserve these sort of mangroves and this sort of biodiversity. It's quite remarkable. It's really quite remarkable." During his visit he came to know about WildTeam's pioneering work with the Forest Department in Tiger Conservation through engaging the local communities. The tiger population has rebounded slightly - at least the decline has been halted. The number rose to 114 in 2018, up from 106 recorded in 2015. Mr Sharma met with the Village Tiger Response Team (VTRT) members, and the TigerScouts. In 2007 WildTeam formed the VTRT by engaging the communities for managing human-tiger conflict. WildTeam also formed BangBandhus (tiger ambassadors) to improve community engagement and raise awareness within the community. WildTeam, with the support from USAID's Bagh Activity, started Sundarbans Education Centres in five schools around the Sundarbans. With their support TigerScouts were formed with secondary school students from the Sundarbans villages, to educate school children to build an environment friendly future generation. The VIP guest, along with the TigerScouts, planted a 'sundari' sapling at WCBC's 'mini Sundarbans'. It is believed that Sundarbans has been named after the 'sundari' (Heritiera fomes) tree that propagates through the forest. The British High Commissioner also planted a sapling. WildTeam built WCBC with the support of IUCN-KfW to engage the communities to manage the natural resources in a sustainable way. Due to increasing salinity, there is an acute shortage of drinking water in the area. WildTeam, with the support from a philanthropist, built a desalination plant at WCBC premises. The VIP guest visited the plant, and witnessed how local people left containers to collect sweet water from this plant. During his visit to Bangladesh Mr Sharma met the hon'ble prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, and other government ministers, and youths to discuss climate issues. A joint statement on UK-Bangladesh climate action was signed, which is a foundation for a long-term climate partnership. The UK will host the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow in November 2021. It is understood that the climate talks will be the biggest international summit the UK has ever hosted; bringing together over 30,000 delegates including heads of state, climate experts and campaigners to agree coordinated action to tackle climate change. The COP26 "The next decade will be make, or break, for our planet, and effective global collaboration will be vital to tackling the pressing challenges the world faces. So I am delighted to have witnessed UK-Bangladeshi climate partnership in action, and heard such positive ambition from my Bangladeshi friends."

Apr. 26 Kolkata(The Statesman/ANN)- Satoshi Suzuki has been the Ambassador of Japan to India since October 2019. A post-graduate from the School of Advanced International Studies at the Johns Hop- kins University, he joined Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1984. Since then, Suzuki has served his country in various capacities both in Japan and abroad. He was also the Deputy Minister for Foreign Policy in 2017. In an interview with Ashok Tuteja, Suzuki talked about the takeaways from the recent India-Japan annual Summit and the impact of the Ukraine crisis on the Indo-Pacific, among other issues. Excerpts: Q. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida was in India in March for the 14th India- Japan Summit. What are the major takeaways from the summit? A: We have witnessed the very successful official visit of Prime Minister Kishida to India on March 19. It was Mr Kishida's first bilateral foreign visit since he took office last October, which demonstrates the significance he attaches to the partnership with India. In addition, this year marks the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the diplomatic relationship between Japan and India, making the Summit all the more special. The visit provided an excellent opportunity to review bilateral cooperation in wide-ranging areas, chart the future course of our Special Strategic and Global Partnership and reaffirm our strong commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, free from coercion. One of the major takeaways of the Summit was the announcement made by our two leaders about setting a target of 5 trillion yen (3.4 trillion rupees) of public and private investment and financing from Japan to India in the next five years. In addition to the Joint Statement signed by Mr Kishida and Mr Modi, which contains details of the bilateral cooperation, the two sides also signed and announced seven JICA loan agreements and amendments to the Implementing Agreement of the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) and its Annex, along with documents on issues of contemporary needs such as industrial competitiveness, clean energy, urban development, decentralised domestic wastewater management and the development of connectivity and resilience in the Northeast. As for political and security cooperation, the Memorandum of Cooperation in the Field of Cybersecurity was signed on this occasion to promote collaboration in such areas as information sharing, capacity building as well as research and development. In addition, the Prime Ministers concurred to jointly tackle common issues of economic security, including building safe and secure telecommunication networks and diversification and enhancement of supply chains. These outcomes are good examples of how deep and comprehensive our bilateral relationships are. Q. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had great chemistry with former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. What is the equation between Mr Modi and Mr Kishida? A: Even before assuming office as the Prime Minister, Mr Kishida already had many positive interactions with Prime Minister Modi in his various previous capacities including as Foreign Minister. After his inauguration as Prime Minister, he also had a brief conversation with Mr Modi in Glasgow on the sidelines of the COP26 last October, in addition to a couple of virtual calls. The Summit gave an excellent opportunity to discuss issues of mutual interest in the person and foster personal connection. Further, the two leaders had a t\'eate-\'e0-t\'eate dinner at the Hyder- abad House. They have built a rapport through cordial discussions that lasted far beyond the scheduled time, which both the leaders enjoyed very much. Q. What is your view on the Ukraine crisis and India's response? A: Russia's invasion of Ukraine shakes the foundation of the international order against which a firm stance is needed. Japan is also deeply concerned about the reference to the possible use of Weapons of Mass Destruction. In addition, we are deeply shocked by the killing of innocent civilians as a result of acts of the Russian forces and vehemently condemn the breach of international humanitarian law. Japan has been in constant conversation with India regarding this important issue. During the recent Summit, the two leaders emphasised the need for all countries to seek peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with international law without resorting to threats or use of force or any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo. They also expressed their serious concern about the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and emphasised that global order has been built on the UN Charter, international law, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of states. The two leaders reiterated their call for an immediate cessation of violence and noted that there was no other choice but the path of dialogue and diplomacy for the resolution of the conflict. Q. What is the impact of the Ukraine crisis on the Indo-Pacific and its implication for Quad cooperation? A: As the world witnesses the Ukraine crisis, it has never been clearer that any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo by force, such as this time, must not be tolerated in the Indo- Pacific region. This view was shared by the Quad leaders in their virtual meeting on March 3. Further, it is precisely because of this situation that it is critical to promote efforts toward the realisation of a "Free and Open Indo-Pacific." With this sense of mission, Japan is going to host a Quad summit in Tokyo in the coming months. The leaders of four countries are expected to review their positive initiatives, including those in the areas of vaccines, climate change, critical and emerging technologies along with many others to bolster security and prosperity in the Indo- Pacific and beyond. Q. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was recently in India to mend fences with India in the midst of the Eastern Ladakh military stand-off. What is Japan's view on China's activities in the neighbourhood? A: As I mentioned, our principled view is that we shall not accept any attempts to unilaterally change the status quo and this view prevails anywhere in the world. In Japan's immediate neighbourhood, in the East China Sea, China Coast Guard vessels continue to intrude into the Japanese territorial sea around the Senkaku Islands and the Chinese military has been expanding and increasing its military activities in sea and airspace. Issues with regard to the South China Sea are also important to Japan, as it is crucial for the peace and stability of the region. It is also because Japan depends on sea transport for most of its resources and energy. Not only on seas but anywhere in the world, together with India, Japan is committed to promoting the free, open, rules-based order, respecting international law and undaunted by coercion. Q. To respond to the increasingly fluid situation in the Indo-Pacific, how do you think India and Japan can deepen their defence and security cooperation? A: Defence and security cooperation between our two countries has flourished in recent years as our strategic convergence grows. The 2+2 meeting of our Foreign and Defense Ministers, the first of which took place in November 2019, demonstrates deep and wide-ranging cooperation in this field. One such example is various bilateral and multi-lateral exercises that India and Japan conducted, including the "Dharma Guardian," the "Shinyu Maitri" and the "Malabar." Another significant recent development is the operationalisation of the agreement concerning Recipro- cal Provision of Supplies and Services (RPSS). During the Dharma Guardian 2021 in March of this year, the Indian Navy, under the logistical agreement for RPSS, provided fuel to Japan Air Self-Defense Force aircraft that transported the contingent of Japan Ground Self-Defence Force, thus demonstrating the augmented joint relations between our two countries. Japan and India are also exploring opportunities for collaborations in defence equipment and technology. To further advance overall security cooperation, we are working to hold the second 2+2 meeting at the earliest opportunity. Q. Please also elaborate on infrastructure projects taken up by Japan in India's North-eastern states? A: Japan is implementing a wide range of projects to contribute to the enhancement of connectivity and resilience in the North Eastern Region, not only in hard infrastructure development, such as road network connectivity improvement, electricity, water supply and sewage but also in soft areas of cooperation like people-to-people exchanges and Japanese language education. Japan is also implementing social and environmental sustainability projects, such as forest management and community empowerment. As a good example of our cooperation in hard infrastructure, Japan's assistance in the construction of the Dhubri-Phulbari Bridge will completely change the lives of the people of the North East. This is going to be the longest river bridge in India and is expected to cut short the travel time across the river from more than 8 hours to less than 30 minutes. Furthermore, the bridge will create a corridor stretching from Bhutan, through Assam and Meghalaya, to Bangladesh. Japan places special focus on cooperation in the NER as the region is located where Japan's vision of "Free and Open Indo-Pacific" and India's "Act East Policy" converge and as the region is important in terms of connectivity with South Asia, Southeast Asia and the BIMSTEC countries. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Md. Habibur Rahman, Secretary of Power Division, said this in an exclusive interview with Mollah Amzad Hossain, Editor of Energy and Power magazine. Power to all is a huge achievement. Bangladesh is the first country in South Asia to achieve it. What is your feeling? The Prime Minister has made the announcement while officially inaugurating power generation of Payra coal-fired power plant. Pledge for reaching power to the doorstep of every citizen by 2021 was announced while formulating a power system plan in 2009. The PM has successfully led the implementation of her pledge. Power to all would smoothen the development process. It would create added dynamism to the process of poverty alleviation. Bangabandhu's pledge of establishing the 'right to electricity of all' has been achieved. But the cost of fuel is steadily increasing. What actions are being taken for achieving the SDG target of achieving affordable and sustainable power to all by 2030? Our next target is ensuring quality power supply to all. That is making quality and uninterruptible supply to all at an affordable price. Our efforts are directed towards that. There is no denial that the transmission and distribution system is lagging behind generation. Action programs have been launched for improvement, extension and modernization. Construction of new transmission lines, replacement of old outdated systems is being done. Automation is being introduced. All consumers are being brought under a prepaid metering system. SCADA is being introduced. Modernization would make power transmission and distribution of power supply reliable and sustainable. Within a year and a half, it would be possible to ensure quality power supply to all on an uninterruptible basis. Bangladesh is steadily growing into an imported fuel dependent country. We must diversify primary fuel supply to make it affordable. Our generation system is still mostly dependent on natural gas. There are few coal based generation units. Recognizing the trend of renewables used for managing global warming, works are going on for exploring and developing solar and wind power. Implementation of a nuclear power plant is also advancing. These are the endeavors for making fuel supply affordable. Unit generation cost of power was BDT 2.54 when the Prime Minister had started her second term in office in 2009. It was told that for introduction of liquid fuel-based generation as a contingency plan the cost would increase for a while. But by 2014, it would start going down again. But now the generation cost in FY 2021-22 would be BDT 8.34 per unit. How will the electricity supply become affordable if such a trend continues? We all are aware of the global realities. Cost of fuel started increasing as the world economy started recovering after the COVID-19 pandemic. Now the Ukraine war added a new dimension to it. The price of fuel in the global market reached sky-high and is still increasing. It would definitely go down if the present condition does not persist longer. Prices of all commodities in the world have increased after the previous estimate was made. If we consider the present inflation, the generation cost of BDT 8.34 appears affordable. Government provides subsidies to a large section of users, including lifeline consumers. Subsidy is also given for irrigation. I think the price of power can be kept at an affordable level. But most of the users prefer uninterrupted supply to affordability. Users would accept a marginal higher price if quality supply on an uninterruptible basis can be ensured. Representatives of consumers' association and trade bodies criticize higher capacity charges in generation. Introduction of 2,000-3,000MW additional liquid fuel generation capacity in 2018 exposed the power system to higher capacity charge. This is wastage. Being added to generation cost, it is increasing to a higher level. How would you react to such allegations? Meeting the demand for power to all consumers was a top priority when the decision was taken. It was considered essential to manage power supply to all domestic, commercial and industrial users. But now no new diesel-based power plant is being given approval. Contracts with furnace oil-based power plant owners are being renewed on 'no power no payment basis'. Gradually the capacity charge would cease to exist. In 2018, there was not enough time to develop baseload power plants. Hence the decision taken at that time was possibly appropriate. I do not think that there were other options. Whether in the private or public sector, entrepreneurs need guarantee for return on investment. Capacity charge is the ideal tool in such cases. We had to keep a higher reserve margin for managing the fuel supply deficit. We could not have ensured power supply to all without this. Development of transmission and distribution segments of the power supply chain could not match with generation. What are you doing to overcome the situation? The full capacity of Payra power plant cannot be evacuated to the national power grid for absence of facilities. What are you doing to address this? Construction of transmission lines has a lot of challenges. Thousands of kilometers of transmission lines need to be constructed across farming lands. There are other barriers as well. There are also some court cases. It takes time to resolve all these. One of the major challenges of construction of the power transmission line from Payra power plant is constructing 7 towers on the Padma river. The works for constructing the foundations for the tower has been given to the contractor that constructed Padma Bridge. The transmission line at both ends of the river is already constructed. So far foundation for 3 towers have been completed. The work is extremely complex. The works of 4 outstanding towers would be completed by June 2022. By December 2022, the power transmission line from Payra to Dhaka would be ready for operation. The main focus of power division is now on transmission lines. By 2023 the power supply system would witness major improvement. Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant is a dream project of the Prime Minister. There are concerns that the plant, despite getting ready on time, may not be able to commence generation for expected delays of evacuation facilities (transmission line, grid stability etc.). What are you doing to expedite ongoing construction works? As many as seven transmission lines are being constructed for evacuating power from Rooppur power plant. Matching with the progress of works of the power plant, the construction activities of the transmission pipelines are advancing. We are optimistic about completing work on time. Liquid fuel based generation at 33% now ranks second after natural gas. Cost of liquid fuel increased at an abnormally high level for the Ukraine war. The cost of generation has increased as such. Are you considering any loadshedding plan for managing the situation? We are working out the impacts of the war on Bangladesh's power and energy supply situation, especially on the cost of power generation. Everything would depend on how long the war continues. If peace returns soon there should not be that great impact on us. But long-term war would definitely create major impacts. All out efforts would be directed towards restricting cost of generation below BDT 8.34 per unit. This is our priority now. Bangladesh has moved away from Bangabandhu's energy vision of optimum utilization of its own fuel. Coal exploration is not being done. Required initiatives for increasing own gas supply are not much visible. Why? Why did Bangladesh have to scarp 10 coal-fired power projects in a hurry? China and India have not taken such actions. What necessitated doing that? Our Prime Minister is the Chairperson of the Climate Vulnerable Group. Bangladesh is the 5th most climate vulnerable country in the world. There is significant public pressure for phasing down or phasing out coal use as per COP26 . We have taken the decision not to build any new coal plants as we are among the most vulnerable countries to global warming. We did not announce any date line yet. We would increase solar power use as much as possible. We have opportunities for changing decisions if the situation warrants. Europe created the loudest noise against coal use. But now a phenomenal increase of all other fuel has induced increased use of coal again there. Some countries of Europe have again started switching back to coal power generation. We can generate 10,000MW power utilizing 3 billion tonnes of our coal. Should we leave the coal buried underground forever? In our thickly populated coal region, there exists public sensitivity about coal mining. There is also global commotion against coal use. In such cases we can only look into the future about our coal resource utilization. We are aware of the strong sensitivity of the people. There exist opinions in favor and against it. There is no meeting of mind yet. I do not think any decision on mining coal would be taken soon. The Prime Minister has expressed her desire for witnessing 40% contribution of clean energy by 2041. How is this being incorporated in the under-formulation master plan? The Prime Minister's vision would be given due attention in the integrated master plan. 40% contribution of clean energy would be reflected in the fuel mix. What according to you is the greatest success and failure of your ministry? Our greatest success is making the national dream of power to all come true. Only a handful of countries in the world could ensure power supply to such a huge population in a short time. Other countries in South Asia having a similar economic base could not do that. What actions are you taking to create greater transparency in the power sector? We have intensified focus on transparency and modernization. Initiatives have been taken to bring the entire power sector under ERP. The power supply chain would come under automation. When completed people can check what is happening where, corruption and mismanagement would be gradually reduced to complete elimination. Irregularities would be done away with. Work on making the power sector user friendly is ongoing. Highest priority is being given for ensuring excellence in customer services. \</doc>

Mar. 14 SINGAPORE (The Straits Times/ANN)  Have Housing Board flats become smaller over the years? Will the Merlion statue be flooded by rising sea levels one day? A slate of multimedia projects by The Straits Times, which tackled a diverse range of topics using varied formats, won accolades at a global contest honouring the best in visual journalism. ST won 27 awards at the Best of News Design Digital Competition, its best showing so far at the annual event. In all, it won three silver medals, six bronze medals, and 18 awards of excellence  with some projects bagging multiple awards in different categories. This is a big jump from last year, when it bagged five awards of excellence. The winning works include a 3D visualisation of how the design of HDB homes has evolved; a simulation of the impact of rising sea levels on the Merlion; and a project that uses visuals and illustrations to explain the complex topic of global supply chain disruption. The results were announced at the weekend by the Society for News Design, which organises the event. This year, it drew a record of nearly 2,000 entries. The New York Times, Reuters and The Washington Post were among key winners. Mr Warren Fernandez, editor-in-chief of SPH Media Trust's English, Malay and Tamil Media Group and editor of ST, said: "This is a big boost for our ST newsroom, and our audiences. We were up against the very best newsrooms around the world and came out creditably. "It reflects our ongoing efforts to tell stories and produce content in ways that are more visual and engaging, just as our audiences are demanding." He added: "With the additional resources and support for the newsroom, as we transition to a media trust, we have been able to invest more time and energy into such efforts. The wins encourage us to press ahead, and our audiences are the biggest winners in the process." On the HDB project, which won two silvers and one bronze  the most medals among ST winners  the judging panel said: "It brings in all the different pieces of the story... I learnt so much through the project and I wanted to keep learning." A "climate change trilogy"  on slowing carbon emissions, saving coral reefs and stemming the rising tide of sea levels  won a bronze award. The judges commented: "Really unique way of showing the data. In terms of graphic impact, the rising sea levels piece was really stunning." The winning works showcased the wide range of formats, including 3D and data visualisation, that the newsroom has been experimenting with, said ST interactive graphics editor Rodolfo Pazos.

Dhaka, Oct. 30 -- On the coastline near India's southern tip, workers toil on a pier carrying a conveyor belt that cuts a mile into the Indian Ocean where the azure waters are deep enough for ships to berth and unload huge cargoes of coal. The belt will carry millions of tonnes of coal each year to a giant power plant several kilometres inland that will burn the fuel for at least 30 years to generate power for the more than 70 million people that live in India's Tamil Nadu state. The Udangudi plant is one of nearly 200 coal-fired power stations under construction in Asia, including 95 in China, 28 in India and 23 in Indonesia, according to data from US nonprofit Global Energy Monitor (GEM). Coal use is one of the many issues dividing industrialised and developing countries as they seek to tackle climate change. Many industrialised countries have been shutting down coal plants for years to reduce emissions. The United States alone has retired 301 plants since 2000. But in Asia, home to 60 per cent of the world's population and about half of global manufacturing, coal's use is growing rather than shrinking as rapidly developing countries seek to meet booming demand for power. Tamil Nadu is India's second-most industrialised state and is one of the country's top renewable energy producers. But it is also building the most coal-fired plants in the country. "We cannot depend on just solar and wind," a senior official at Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corp told Reuters. "You can have the cake of coal and an icing of solar," he said, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak to media. HOOKED ON COAL Despite dramatic jumps in renewable energy output, the global economy remains hooked on coal for electricity. In Asia, coal's share of the generation mix is twice the global average - especially in surging economies such as India. In 2020, more than 35 per cent of the world's power came from coal, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy. Roughly 25 per cent came from natural gas, 16 per cent from hydro dams, 10 per cent from nuclear and 12 per cent from renewables like solar and wind. This year, coal demand is set for a new record, driving prices to all-time highs and contributing to a worldwide scramble for fuel. Record coal demand is contributing to a rapid rise in emissions in 2021 after a fall last year, when restrictions on movement for billions of people to slow the pandemic caused fuel use to plummet. While some of the new coal plants under construction will replace older, more polluting stations, together they will add to total emissions. "The completion of the capacity that is already under construction in these countries will drive up coal demand and emissions," said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst with the Centre for Research on Energy and Clear Air. The carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the new plants alone will be close to 28 billion tonnes over their 30-year lifespans, according to GEM. That's not far off the 32 billion tonnes of total worldwide CO2 emissions from all sources in 2020, according to BP, highlighting how tough it will be for leaders gathering in Glasgow - including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi - to make meaningful progress on climate change. India's Environment Secretary Rameshwar Prasad Gupta told Reuters in a recent interview that India was on track to reach its target of cutting back the country's carbon footprint, and with that coal, too, would fall - but it cannot be abolished. "Look, every country has its strengths. We have coal, we have to depend on it," Gupta said. "Our position is once you take up targets of reducing carbon intensity, that will have impact ... Leave it to us whether we do it in coal, or somewhere else." Anil Swarup, a former Coal Secretary, took the same line in an interview. "Renewable energy expansion is critical, but coal will remain India's main energy source for the next 15 years at least, and production needs to be ramped up to address our energy needs," he said. CHINA CRUNCH Across India, 281 coal plants are operating and beyond the 28 being built another 23 are in pre-construction phases, GEM data show. These numbers are dwarfed by China, the top global coal miner, consumer and emitter, whose leader, President Xi Jinping, is not expected to attend COP26 . More than 1,000 coal plants are in operation, almost 240 planned or already under construction. Together, coal plants in the world's second-largest economy will emit 170 billion tonnes of carbon in their lifetime - more than all global CO2 emissions between 2016 and 2020, BP data show. Despite also boasting the world's largest renewables capacity, China is now suffering a major energy crunch and has urged coal miners to raise output. That's likely to boost coal consumption in the near term, even though China plans to reduce coal use from 2026. Even so, total global coal consumption looks set to rise, driven by accelerating use in South and Southeast Asia, where projects under construction will raise coal-burning capacity by 17 percent and 26 percent respectively. Lifetime CO2 emissions from coal plants by country Japan, with its nuclear power industry in crisis since the Fukushima disaster, has turned to coal to fill the gap and is building seven large new coal-fired power stations. Leading generator JERA plans to add clean-burning ammonia to be used with coal to help meet its target to be carbon neutral by 2050, and potentially keep old units operating longer. On a bay near Nagoya, JERA's 30-year-old, 4,100 megawatt Hekinan station - once Asia's largest - supplies electricity to the likes of auto giant Toyota Motor Corp. Like many power plants, Hekinan's boilers rely on fuel from top exporters such as Australia, where coal is both a vital source of revenue - $18 billion in the current financial year - and a bone of contention with allies urging ambitious emissions cuts. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is set to attend the Glasgow talks. But resources minister Keith Pitt has said there would be demand for coal for decades and made it clear the country would not be swayed by pressure from banks, regulators and investors to hobble the industry.

The countries may reach a consensus on the implementation strategy of the Paris Agreement at the COP26 in Glasgow, yet finalizing the strategy would depend on political considerations by individual countries. Geopolitics would play a major role here, but to protect the planet, global warming must be restricted below 2 degrees Celsius. The global communities must come forward to achieve this goal with the developed countries taking the lead. Dr. A. Atiq Rahman, Executive Director at the Centre for Advanced Studies, made the observation in an exclusive interview with Energy and Power Editor Mollah Amzad Hossain. You have been involved in research on the environment for over three decades. The world is now in a crisis of serious nature due to global warming. The progress of implementation of the Paris Agreement for combating global warming is also questionable. How do you evaluate the situation? Please note that the age of industrialization is only 200 years of the 6000 years old mother earth. The amount of primary fuel that was consumed in a year not long ago is now used in a day. Huge fleets of motor vehicles are plying on the roads and the wheels of industries are moving. Global temperature increased by 1.1 degree Celsius in 200 years. But the damage to the atmosphere is enormous. The frequency of floods, droughts and cyclones are increasing. The hydro climate has changed enormously. Floods are taking place in New York. Only 1-2 centimeter rise of seawater level in Bangladesh cause floods in extensive coastal areas with saline water. Apart from causing colossal damage to crops, these are rendering people homeless. Absorbing the temperature in the atmosphere, the Greenhouse Gases (GHG) are causing global warming. These are multiplying manifold the destruction of natural calamities. On that consideration, the Paris Agreement provided for restricting global warming below 2 degrees Celsius by 2100. Some 206 parties (countries plus organizations) attending the COP26 would talk and decide about how to achieve that. But it appears that the Parties despite being hard-pressed would not be able to reach conclusive agreements. However, the progress so far has been made can be termed as satisfactory. In 2018, all out initiative was taken to finalize the Paris Rule Book. On many issues, including article 6, a meeting of minds could be reached. What are the major elements of implementing the Paris Agreement? Can COP26 negotiations arrive at agreements on these issues? The signatory countries to the Paris Agreement are moving very slowly. The principal agenda of COP26 The industrially developed countries should drastically cut down emissions. But the developing countries for achieving their development would increase using fossil fuels. However, we have to ensure that these by no means increase warming above 2 degrees Celsius by 2100. Implementation of the Rule Book has become essential now. We have to decide which countries are industrially developed, which are developing, who should restrict GHG emissions to which levels? The target of Rule Book implementation should not be creating barriers to development, rather keeping emissions restricted as much as possible. There are four issues - mitigation, adaptation meaning adjusting to circumstances, how much money would be required and where from these would come? These latest aspects would be brought under institutional framework. We must bear in mind that developed countries for keeping their development going and developing countries for getting developed would have to keep using fossil fuels. But the challenge is how much of this fuel use can be made carbon neutral. Some US$100 billion was planned to be contributed to the Global Climate Fund (GCF) every year following 2020. But the commitments made so far have not reached that level yet. What actually needs to be done by the world leaders, experts and environmentalists to increase contributions to the GCF? Money has been devalued with time. The value of US$100 billion has by now been devalued by 50%. Yet, deposit to the GCF is not encouraging. It is steadily building though. So far US$80 billion has been accumulated. Now it is being said that no one would contribute if the fund is left idle. A clear policy and management of use must be developed. Developed countries would provide funds and underdeveloped countries using the fund would improve and modernize infrastructure to protect them from environmental degradation. Small Island and Least Developed Countries would get this fund. Developed countries would regularly provide this fund. But the contribution into the GCF would definitely be linked with the local and global geopolitics. The developing countries including Bangladesh did not exclusively rely on global funding for combating environmental impacts. Rather they invested from their own resources. They considered environmental impacts in their ongoing infrastructure development. But global financial assistance is also essential. They are somehow managing environmental impacts, but the development process cannot be kept going without global assistance. The private sector is doing well in Bangladesh as the readymade garment sector is operating with green factories. Bangladesh is almost self-sufficient in food, but the environmental impacts sometimes create issues. The private sector should also be integrated with the public sector in low carbon growth. Private sector in Bangladesh is very vibrant now. Bangladesh has plans for this in the future. Own investment and global funding requirements have been assessed. But capacity needs enhancing for securing global funding and managing that fund efficiently. Countries like India, China, Brazil and Saudi Arabia, apart from the identified major polluting countries, (NX1) are polluting heavily now. There are debates in updating the list of polluters. What are your views? COP26 , this must also be agreed through discussion. It would not be easy. Deciding on the list of polluting countries and assigning them the status would be a very tough task. How much justifiable and realistic do you think the Polluters Pay claim is? Will it be at all possible to make the developed countries agree? Polluters Pay is a reasonable demand. It is like £lways speak the truth', but it would not be easy to realize it. How much pollution is reasonable and how much not? It is not easy to identify and assess real polluters. But the pressure for Polluters Pay must be there. At the same time, the amount of pollution by each country must be measured accurately. How much of this is reasonable and how much not that must also be ascertained. But, there is no second opinion that the pressure must be there. Bangladesh has updated its NDC. What do you say about the updated target and its implementation strategy? What strategy Bangladesh should adopt for getting global funding for reducing emissions? Bangladesh has updated the NDC at an appropriate time. I worked as the team leader. National action plan has also been finalized along with the revised NDC. It is encouraging that the energy sector has actually achieved greater success than what was targeted in the original NDC for achieving through investing from its own resources. But necessary global assistance could not be achieved. Bangladesh has increased its target though having the least carbon footprint. Bangladesh does not have any obligations for reducing the carbon emissions. We are advancing in a planned manner for reducing emissions. But our waste is very high. We must reduce this as quickly as possible. The government has adopted a sector wise plan for reducing the use of fossil fuel and cutting emissions. The NDC has two parts. One is unconditional. This would be implemented using its own fund. The other is conditional where funds from global sources would be utilized. This means, we will act if we get funds. We would need funds for making our transports the least emitting, making industries more efficient and using modern least energy-using technologies for power generation. Not only Bangladesh, the entire developing world is waiting for this global funding. How optimistic are you about achieving Net Zero target by 2050? Net Zero means that there would not be any GHG emission. Some countries claimed that they would reach there by 2040 while others said they would by 2050. But Bangladesh has a different plan. I think some countries would perform better in some areas. But the pressure would be there for achieving the target. I am optimistic about achieving the target. The energy and power sector is still largely dependent on fossil fuel. There are various initiatives for reducing this but achievement is minimum. How do you look at it? Bangladesh has done admirably well with renewable energy. Solar is a great example. Solar is being used as street lights and in many other areas. Around 25 million people are using the Solar Home System (SHS). Using solar pumps for irrigation is also a great success. Bangladesh has performed much better than many developing countries. A second nuclear power plant would further move them ahead. There is huge potential offshore as well. Offshore wind is a future prospect. It is under plan. Non-carbon power and energy generation is a major challenging area. But Bangladesh is advancing in a planned manner. Bangladesh would soon be having 2400MW nuclear power. Political decision has been taken for a second unit. I think a major achievement can be made if Bangladesh can advance according to the plan. What are your expectations from the Glasgow COP26 ? I do not expect that all outstanding matters related to achieving the Paris Agreement would be resolved in COP26 . Political and economic issues come into play in deciding issues of the global interest. If we can achieve collection of funds for 5 years of climate impacts management, it would be a huge achievement. The negotiation has been going on for 38 years. The COP26 would play a big role in advancing towards achieving the target. Discussions are being held at every COP. But final decisions are taken considering regional and global geopolitics. Financing is the major challenge. In the third international conference, it was said that the developed countries together should contribute US$500 billion to the climate fund. If that happens, there would not be any problem in advancing works of environment impacts management. \</doc>

Attending the COP26 in Glasgow, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is likely to visit Paris, France in the second week of November to attend the prize-giving ceremony of 'UNESCO-Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman International Prize for the Creative Economy.' Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen shared the information while talking to reporters at his residence on his recent visits to Romania and Serbia. Asked whether the Prime Minister will hand over the award, Dr Momen said they want the Prime Minister to hand over it. 'We want the Prime Minister to hand over the award. Unicef is hosting the programme.' Tentatively, the event will be held on November 11, said the Foreign Minister about the US $50,000 Prize that will be awarded on a biennial basis, initially for three iterations of the Prize. The first award ceremony will be held on the occasion of UNESCO's 41st General Conference in November 2021 and subsequent award ceremonies will be held on the occasion of the Conference of Parties to the 2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions. The Unesco-Bangladesh Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman International Prize for the creative economy will create a knowledge-sharing mechanism by capturing, celebrating, and communicating best practice in the development of creative entrepreneurship, according to Unesco documents. The objectives of the Unesco-Bangladesh Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman International Prize for the Creative Economy are in line with strategic objective 8 of Unesco's Medium-Term Strategy for 2014-2021 and with the 2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions. The prize will be fully managed and administered by Unesco. Earlier, Foreign Minister Dr Momen said the Unesco-Bangladesh Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman International Award will help spread the ideology of Bangabandhu globally with further internationalisation of his work, life and achievements. "Bangladesh and Bangabandhu are one and unique which was reflected in the name of the award. This award will play a role in branding Bangladesh and boosting its image globally," he said. 'We're all very proud that a UN Agency has introduced an award in the name of Bangabandhu for the first time,' Dr Momen said. The UK will host the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow on October 31 to November 12. The Prime Minister is likely to leave Dhaka for Glasgow on October 31 and she will visit London before heading for Paris. She is likely to hold a bilateral meeting with her British counterpart Boris Johnson either in Glasgow or in London. 'Most likely this important bilateral meeting will be held in London.' The COP26 summit will bring parties together to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. \</doc>

Mar. 10\'e2\€  H\'c3\€ N\'e1\'bb I (Vietnam News/ANN) \'e2\€  Businesses and policymakers from Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam and the US discussed measures to further boost bilateral economic ties, digital economy, energy demand, sustainable development and economic recovery during the Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam-US Business Summit 2022 held in H\'c3\~ N\'e1\'bb i yesterday. Speaking at the summit, Prime Minister Ph\'e1\'ba\£1m Minh Ch\'c3\£dnh said Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam's main priorities in the years to come would include a robust economic recovery post-pandemic, the implementation of greener technologies, development of digital economy and mitigating the adverse effects of climate change. Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam considers the US as an important partner since the normalisation of bilateral relations in 1995, especially in economic cooperation. Since 1995, two-way trade between Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam and the US has increased 250 times, from US$450 million in 1995 to a record $111 billion in 2021 despite the pandemic. The US has become Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam's largest export market and its second-largest trading partner while the South East Asian economy is the US' 9th largest trading partner. The two sides have ratified and implemented a number of key trade agreements including the Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam-US Bilateral Trade Agreement in 2000, Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam's permanent normal trade relations status with the US in 2006, the Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam-US Trade and Investment Framework Agreement in 2007 and the Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam-US Comprehensive Partnership in 2013. The US is among the largest foreign investors (11 out of 141) in Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam with close to 1,150 projects, totalling over $10.3 billion. "I'm hopeful with the result of a 2021 survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in which some 80 per cent of its members show a positive attitude about doing business in Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam in the medium and long term. In recent years, we have seen complementary relations between the two economies as well as the business communities on both sides," said the PM. At the summit, US business leaders voiced their confidence in Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam's potential for growth, especially in digital commerce and the creative economy. Reopening The PM thanked the US for 29 million vaccine doses donated to Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam as well as medical supplies and equipment. Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam appreciates the support given by US businesses as well as the visit by US Vice President Kamala Harris during the pandemic. He said Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam was fully committed to a full reopening and to speed up economic recovery, especially after the country managed to vaccinate a vast majority of the population and acquired valuable lessons in disease control and prevention. The country had seen success during the last quarter of 2021 with a GDP growth of 5.22 per cent after a period of negative growth. The first few months of 2022 have seen robust investment and export activities, stable macroeconomic factors and millions of people returning to work. The virus had been put under control. Despite a rising number of infections due to the Omicron variant, there had been fewer people requiring hospitalisation and significantly lower fatalities. The Government had been working on a support package worth up to VN\'c4350 trillion or $15.32 billion to jumpstart the economy, invest in infrastructure development and provision for potential economic slowdowns. The Prime Minister said Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam and the US shared many of the mentioned above issues. With a strong foundation of bilateral ties, he expressed hope that the two countries would work together to find solutions and to strengthen relations in a manner that is fair and harmonious built on mutual trust and sincerity. US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry and Chairwoman of the American Chamber of Commerce Virginia Foote said the US was impressed with the strong commitment shown at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) and the progress made by Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam. Kerry said Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam had the potential to become a role model in adapting and coping with climate change.

US Ambassador to Bangladesh Earl R Miller has said that the world must put in joint efforts to confront the climate crisis right now instead of leaving the challenge for future generations. 'The climate crisis is here. This is not a challenge for future generations. Together, we must confront it today," he said mentioning that COP26 in Glasgow is a pivotal moment at the start of this decisive decade to tackle the climate crisis. While COP26 US envoy calls for joint action to tackle climate crisis right now Maritime Affairs Unit Secretary Rear Admiral (Retd) Md. Khurshed Alam, EU Ambassador to Bangladesh Charles Whiteley, Japanese Ambassador Ito Naoki, Australian High Commissioner Jeremy Bruer, MoFA Director (Americas) Syed Shah Saad Andalib and Australian First Secretary -- Development Cooperation, Kate Sangster joined. The United States has partnered with Bangladesh on many climate resilience projects in the Cox's Bazar and Teknaf region, said the US Embassy on Tuesday. For example, the U.S. government, through its Agency for International Development (USAID), has donated more than 140 renovated cyclone shelters to the Cox's Bazar district administration, including one on St. Martin's Island, to protect residents from frequent natural disasters. Since 2001, USAID has constructed over 700 multi-purpose cyclone shelters that serve as both safe havens and as schools in Bangladesh, said the US Embassy in Dhaka. Additionally, USAID support has strengthened flood forecasting and early warning systems to provide residents life-saving time to evacuate to shelter. USAID supports the Bangladesh Forest Service and local communities to co-manage forests and wetlands, including the Teknaf Wildlife Sanctuary, thereby protecting more than 1.8 million acres of critical ecosystems across the country. The U.S. government also supports restoration projects for degraded landscapes and ecosystems within the Teknaf Wildlife Sanctuary. Prior to his trip to St. Martin's, Miller visited USAID climate resilience projects where U.S. investments have helped farmers adapt new techniques to overcome soil salinity, use organic pest control, and plant new trees while protecting existing natural resources. \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 3 -- Despite emitting the least amount of carbon, the small-scale farmers of Bangladesh are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, the UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) has said. The observation was made by IFAD while highlighting the impact of climate change on small-scale farmers at the 26th Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change on Wednesday, a press release said. Quoting from the Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina IFAD said: "Bangladesh contributes less than 0.47 per cent of global emissions, yet it is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world," IFAD press release said small-scale farmers, who produce 70-80 per cent of Bangladesh's food, are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change - and, ironically, contribute to it the least. "While progress is being made, the government of Bangladesh- and the people of Bangladesh - need more financial and technical support to mitigate and adapt to climate change," said Donal Brown, Associate Vice-President at IFAD. "Successful projects really need to be scaled-up, and that's why the discussions at COP26 are so important. I am confident that if we all come together and do provide the finance necessary, we will be able to have a successful response to climate change in countries like Bangladesh," he added. In Sunamganj district in Bangladesh's Haor region, participants spoke about how frequent and prolonged flooding would sweep away their homes and cattle, and how it cut off mobility. Meanwhile, in Satkhira district, near the Sunderbans (the world's largest deltaic mangrove forest), participants are taking to crab farming in response to the changing climate in their area. Introducing more saline tolerant species has helped farmers in the area combat the impact of rising sea levels and warming temperatures, according to farmers.

Leaders of civil society organisations (CSOs) from most vulnerable countries (MVCs) Friday called for an end to carbon emission instead of pursuing the "net-zero target by 2050." They also demanded that developed countries ensure adequate finance and appropriate tools that will support effective climate action for MVCs and least developed countries (LDCs). The CSO leaders were speaking at the press conference titled "LDC and MVC Peoples' expectations and COP26 " in Glasgow. Representatives of different CSOs, including Md Ziaul Hoque Mukta of Center for Sustainable Rural Livelihood, Md Shamsuddoha of Centre for Participatory Research and Development, Shamim Arfeen of AOSED from Bangladesh; and Soumya Datta from Peoples Forum from India joined the press conference. "The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) is being held at a transitional stage in the context of past failure of its commitments, but we are hopeful for the future as the developed countries have pledged to keep cutting global warming and supporting MVCs to fight climate change impacts," Aminul Hoque of EquityBD from Bangladesh said while presenting the keynote address on civil society expectations. "Developed countries must change their theory of 'net-zero target. They will have to revise their nationally determined contributions (NDC) to the "zero-carbon emission' target by 2050. Also, the countries will have to ensure adequate climate finance for LDCs and MVCs through Green Climate Fund (GCF) and public sources. And they will need to provide support for the establishment and full operationalisation of the proposed loss and damage mechanism with separate financial allocation," he added. "Net-zero is a phrase that represents magical thinking rooted in our obsession for future technology. Collectively, net-zero climate targets allow developed countries to continue increasing their levels of greenhouse gas emissions instead of cutting them directly," Soumya said. "So, it is a false solution proposal, and all parties must stop the discussion on such vague 'net-zero emission' and start the discussion on 'zero-emission target' through offsetting the use of fossil fuels and ending carbon emissions." "The revised NDCs of developed countries and their full implementation will increase the global temperature above 0.2 degree, which is unacceptable," Shamsuddoha said. "Every year, millions of people are displaced due to the loss of all their livelihood options. Rich countries have the responsibility to address the issue and ensure finance and technology support accordingly," Shamim said. "The proposed mechanism of 'Santiago Network for Loss and Damage' should be supported by them to make it fully operationalise with proper financing." \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 9 -- US Ambassador to Bangladesh Earl R Miller has said the world must put in joint efforts to confront the climate crisis right now instead of leaving the challenge for future generations. "The climate crisis is here. This is not a challenge for future generations. Together, we must confront it today," he said mentioning that COP26 in Glasgow is a pivotal moment at the start of this decisive decade to tackle the climate crisis, according to US Embassy on Tuesday. While COP26 Maritime Affairs Unit Secretary Rear Admiral (Retd) Md Khurshed Alam, EU Ambassador to Bangladesh Charles Whiteley, Japanese Ambassador Ito Naoki, Australian High Commissioner Jeremy Bruer, MoFA Director (Americas) Syed Shah Saad Andalib and Australian First Secretary -- Development Cooperation, Kate Sangster joined. The United States has partnered with Bangladesh on many climate resilience projects in the Cox's Bazar and Teknaf region. For example, the US government, through its Agency for International Development (USAID), has donated more than 140 renovated cyclone shelters to the Cox's Bazar district administration, including one on St Martin's Island, to protect residents from frequent natural disasters. Since 2001, USAID has constructed over 700 multi-purpose cyclone shelters that serve as both safe havens and as schools in Bangladesh, said the US Embassy in Dhaka. Additionally, USAID support has strengthened flood forecasting and early warning systems to provide residents life-saving time to evacuate to shelter. USAID supports the Bangladesh Forest Service and local communities to co-manage forests and wetlands, including the Teknaf Wildlife Sanctuary, thereby protecting more than 1.8 million acres of critical ecosystems across the country. The US government also supports restoration projects for degraded landscapes and ecosystems within the Teknaf Wildlife Sanctuary. Prior to his trip to St Martin's, Miller visited USAID climate resilience projects where US investments have helped farmers adapt new techniques to overcome soil salinity, use organic pest control, and plant new trees while protecting existing natural resources.

State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid has said integrated technical and financial cooperation would contribute a lot in expanding renewable energy massively. 'Developed countries' cooperation is needed in evaluation of renewable energy resources. And it is necessary to increase the capacity of public and private sectors,' he said while speaking at a side event on 'Clean Power and Green Grids' after inauguration of the Third Ministerial Meeting of the COP26 Energy Transition Council ( CoP26 ETC)' recently. Mr. Nasrul joined the ministerial meeting virtually and said Bangladesh wants to work in unison with all to promote clean energy, as coal use in power generation is reducing. 'Meanwhile, Bangladesh government has cancelled 10-coalfired power plants having 8,451 MW generation capacity. Technology requires less use of land for solar power,' he said. The state minister said desired results could be achieved with technical and financial support of experienced countries and the Energy Transition Council to get quality electricity by mapping offshore wind and marine fuels. He further said that research for waste power, wind power and ocean energy by the Energy Transition Council will be welcomed. 'If we get initial investment, huge quantity of electricity will be added to the national grid. At least a project can be taken on a pilot basis,' Nasrul Hamid added. One of the main goals of the COP26 Energy Transition Council ( COP26 ETC) is to accelerate energy transitions by uniting global leadership, and facilitating financing for clean energy. The ETC focus countries are - Bangladesh, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Laos, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Vietnam and South Africa. Chaired by Damilola Ogunbiyi, vice-president of CoP26ETC, the function was attended by, among others, Indonesian Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Arifin Tasrif, Egypt's Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Dr Mohamed Shaker El-Markabi, Nigerian State for Power Goddy Jedy Agba, Laos's Deputy Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Dr Sinava Souphanouvong and delegates from India, Kenya, Pakistan, Philippines, South Africa, Morocco and Vietnam. \</doc>

BNP senior joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi on Monday bemoaned that the major cities in Bangladesh, including Dhaka, have become poisonous-gas chambers due to widespread pollution. "The Prime Minister has gone to Glasgow. Wow! Dhaka has the highest rate of air pollution in South Asia. Dhaka, Chattogram and other cities of Bangladesh are now toxic-gas chambers. In fact, Bangladesh is a poisonous-gas chamber,' he said. Speaking at a human-chain programme, the BNP leader also said the Prime Minister went to the Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26 , after destroying the trees, fish and water of Bangladesh. 'How self-contradictory it can be!' Rizvi said all the opposition parties, environmentalists and civil society organisations opposed coal-fired power station at Rampal Upazila of Bagerhat near the Sundarbans, but the government has given permission to set up it. He said the Prime Minister who is constructing the Rampal power plant to destroy the Sundarbans has gone to the world climate conference in Glasgow. 'It's like that an old woman wants to dance, but she doesn't know there's no rhythm in her performance.' On Sunday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina went to Scotland as she embarked on a two-week visit to the United Kingdom and France to attend the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) and other events. 'Looters' hiking prices Speaking at the same progarmme, BNP standing committee member Gayeshwar Chandra Roy alleged that the prices daily essentials are pushing up by the ruling party-backed plunderers despite having the adequate supply of goods. "The prices of goods usually go up when there's a scarcity or low production and low supply to the market. There's now no shortage of goods and all items are there in the market, but their prices are high. When the supply of goods is sufficient, the prices of essentials are being hiked only in the interest of the Awami-looters syndicate,' he said. The BNP leader said common people are going through serious suffering due to the growing price hike of the daily essentials. He alleged that people of no religion and community is now safe in the country as there is no democracy. 'But the corrupt, bribe-takers and those who go to TVs and tell lies in favour of government are safe.' \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 14 -- UN climate talks in Scotland ended with a global agreement that aimed at least to keep alive hopes of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius, and so maintain some chance of saving the world from catastrophic climate change. Alok Sharma, the conference chairman, was visibly emotional before banging down his gavel in relief to signal that there were no vetoes from the almost 200 national delegations present in Glasgow, ranging from coal- and gas-fuelled superpowers to oil producers and Pacific islands being swallowed by the rise in sea levels. The two-week conference in Glasgow, extended into an extra day of tortuous negotiations, was the 26th of its kind but the first to call for a reduction in fossil fuels, which not only power much of the world's economy but are also the main cause of manmade global warming, reports Reuters. But there was last-minute drama as India, whose energy needs are hugely dependent on the coal it has in abundance - raised last-minute objections to this part of the agreement. The clause was hurriedly amended to accelerating "efforts to phase down unabated coal power, and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies", weakening what had been "efforts to phase out". The change was met with dismay by the rich economies of the European Union and Switzerland as well as the Marshall Islands, one of the small Pacific island states whose existence is under threat from rising sea levels. "The approved texts are a compromise. They reflect the interests, the conditions, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. "They take important steps, but unfortunately the collective political will was not enough to overcome some deep contradictions." 'DEEP DISAPPOINTMENT' Sharma had had the onerous task of balancing the demands of nations, big industrial powers, and those like India and China whose consumption or exports of fossil fuels are vital to their economic development. His voice broke with emotion after he heard vulnerable nations express their anger over the last-minute changes. "May I just say to all delegates I apologise for the way this process has unfolded and I am deeply sorry," he told the assembled delegates. "I also understand the deep disappointment but I think, as you have noted, it's also vital that we protect this package." The overarching aim that he set before the conference was one that climate campaigners and vulnerable countries had found far too modest - namely, to "keep alive" the 2015 Paris Agreement's target to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. The agreement in effect acknowledged that commitments made so far to cut emissions of planet-heating greenhouse gases are nowhere near enough, and asked nations to set tougher climate pledges next year, rather than every five years, as they are currently required to do. Scientists say that to go beyond a rise of 1.5C would unleash extreme sea level rise and catastrophes including crippling droughts, monstrous storms and wildfires far worse than those the world is already suffering. 'THE ERA OF COAL IS ENDING' "They changed a word but they can't change the signal coming out of this COP, that the era of coal is ending," she said. "If you're a coal company executive, this COP saw a bad outcome." Developing countries argue that rich nations, whose historical emissions are largely responsible for heating up the planet, must pay more to help them adapt to its consequences as well as reducing their carbon footprints. The deal gave the poorest nations more promises, but no guarantees, that they would finally get more of the financial help they have long been told they will get. It urged rich countries to double finance for climate adaptation by 2025 from 2019 levels, offering funding that has been a key demand of small island nations at the conference. Adaptation funds primarily go to the very poorest countries and currently take up only a small fraction of climate funding. A UN committee will also report next year on progress towards delivering the $100 billion per year in overall annual climate funding that rich nations had promised by 2020 but failed to deliver. And governments will be summoned to meet in 2022, 2024 and 2026 to discuss climate finance. Yet even $100 billion a year is far short of poorer countries' actual needs, which could hit $300 billion by 2030 in adaptation costs alone, according to the United Nations, in addition to economic losses from crop failure or climate-related disasters.

Dhaka, Oct. 13 -- The Asian Development Bank will boost its climate financing goals by $20 billion to a new target of $100 billion for the 2019-2030 period. The lender also aims to launch its concept for retiring coal-fired power plants at the COP26 climate conference in Scotland next month, reports Reuters. The plans, disclosed by ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa in an interview on Tuesday, increase a 2018 goal for $80 billion in climate financing for developing countries in Asia. "The fight against climate change will be won or lost in Asia and the Pacific, and we are committed to serving as a climate bank and a long term climate partner for our region," Asakawa said. The additional $20 billion in financing support will provide support for climate mitigation efforts including low-carbon energy sources, climate adaptation projects and private sector projects. Asakawa said ADB now plans for $66 billion in financing for climate mitigation financing through 2030, including for new energy storage, energy efficiency and low-carbon transportation investments. The Manila-based lender will plan for climate adaptation financing of $34 billion, including agriculture, urban and water adaptation projects. The bank also plans to boost its private sector operations to attract more private sector capital to finance new climate technologies and innovations, using $12 billion from its balance sheet to attract up to $30 billion in new private capital, due to increased demand for such financing, Asakawa said. The plans were presented on Tuesday to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who had convened a meeting with multilateral development banks, including ADB and the World Bank, to discuss their efforts to boost climate financing in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement. Reuters first reported in August that ADB was working with major financial firms to develop a mechanism to buy up coal-fired power plants in Asia and retire them early to shrink the biggest source of carbon emissions. ADB and its partners, including British insurer Prudential, lenders Citi and HSBC and BlackRock Real Assets, are aiming to complete and launch a pilot investment fund in 2022 and make its initial power plant purchase next year or early 2023. The concept is not included in the ADB's overall climate financing goals, because most of the money will come from private investors and donor sources, including philanthropists, he said. "Even now, some philanthropists have already shown interest in investing in this new initiative. So we plan to launch the ETM at COP26 in Glasgow," Asakawa said. He said he hoped to present the concept at COP26 along with Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati and Philippines finance minister Carlos Dominguez, two of the "pilot countries" in the project. He added that there is interest among other developing countries in Asia to participate in the coal retirement plans, with "more and more" countries likely to join the initiative later.

Dhaka, Aug. 31 -- Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen and British Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs Dominic Raab are scheduled to hold their official meeting in London on Thursday to chart a post-Brexit and post-Covid new strategic partnership vision. "The official bilateral talks will be a historic occasion as the Bangladesh and UK Foreign Ministers will be meeting in London for the first time during the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our two friendly countries," said Bangladesh High Commissioner to the UK and Ireland Saida Muna Tasneem. Britain was one of the first countries in Europe to recognise Bangladesh's independence on Feb 4, 1972. The visit of Dr Momen is also highly significant as it would provide an opportunity to set the tone for Bangladesh CVF Presidency's high-level participation in the upcoming COP26 scheduled in Glasgow in early November under UK's Presidency, said High Commissioner Tasneem. Return of the Rohingya back to Myanmar and regional security issues will also feature in the discussions, said the High Commissioner. The Foreign Minister is due to discuss the entire gamut of bilateral issues with the UK Foreign Secretary from post-Brexit trade relations, Bangladesh-UK new economic partnership vision to post-covid vaccine cooperation and lifting Bangladesh out of UK's travel red list. Bangladeshi-British diaspora and work opportunities of skilled professionals from Bangladesh would also feature high in the talks, said the envoy. On his arrival on Wednesday, the Foreign Minister will be received by High Commissioner Tasneem at the Heathrow Airport, reports UNB. Prior to the bilateral talks with the UK Foreign Minister, Dr Momen will also have a bilateral meeting with COP26 President Alok Sharma at 9 Downing Street to discuss the COP26 agenda for Bangladesh with a particular focus on loss and damage and the proposed CVF- COP26 Leaders' Summit under Bangladesh Presidency. Apart from the official meetings, the Foreign Minister will deliver a climate talk on "Forging a CVF- COP26 Climate Solidarity" at the UK's leading think tank Chatham House, organised jointly by Bangladesh High Commission and Chatham House. The event will also be attended by Maldives Speaker and former President and CVF Thematic Ambassador for Ambition Mohamed Nasheed along with a number of CVF Ambassadors and High Commissioners and climate experts. Bangladesh High Commission in collaboration with British-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BBCCI) is organising the event. Dedicating to the philosophy of peace and non-violence of Bangladesh's Founding Father Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and marking his birth centenary, the Foreign Minister is expected to inaugurate a peace grove in central London. Dr Momen will visit the Bangladesh High Commission when he will officially inaugurate the Bangabandhu Library, the Centennial Portrait of Bangabandhu, the Bangabandhu Consular Week and the extended premises of Bangladesh High Commission at 27 Queens' Gate. He will also participate in an interactive dialogue with Bangladeshi young talented students from UK's eminent universities. During his UK visit, Dr Momen is expected to meet some British MPs and dignitaries at official and civic receptions and join community events, including the NRB Foundation and CAP Foundation programmes, to exchange views with expatriate Bangladeshis from the UK and Europe.

Speakers at a webinar have urged the government to set the renewable energy as a priority sector to scale up its use saying that policy support is instrumental for its development. "There're huge potentials for renewable energy, especially solar power, for different sectors, including irrigation, and motor vehicle recharging," said Munawar Misbah Moin, Vice President of Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association (BSREA). The BSREA, a platform of private operators in solar and renewable energy business, organized the seminar titled "Energy Access and Resilience of Bangladesh - Potentials and Challenges" with its president Dipal Barua in the chair. The organizers said the seminar was arranged in order to send its outcomes to the "Blue Zone", the window and connector of people to COP26 . Chairman of Bangladesh Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (Sreda) Mohammad Aladdin and Energypac CEO and director Nurul Aktar also addressed the seminar. BSREA general secretary Data Magfur conducted the event. Munawar Moin said solar home systems (SHSs) have been the best example of success in renewable energy as it illuminated 6 million homes across the country. Now solar irrigation, solar chilling systems for rural industry, solar recharging stations for electric vehicles have new potential areas for renewable energy where it could be utilized for climate resiliency, he added. \</doc>

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina recently held talks with heir apparent to the British throne Prince Charles and US business magnates and philanthropists Bill Gates and Melinda Gates on climate change and development issues on COP26 sidelines. Briefing newsmen on the premier's engagements, foreign minister Dr AK Abdul Momen said during the talks with the two global figures, she highlighted Bangladesh challenges, initiatives and demands to face the climate change impacts. He said Charles was accompanied by representatives of four major banks including the HSBC while the Prince of Wales, who undertakes official duties on behalf of the Queen, talked about private sector engagements in the climate issues. "They want private sectors to be involved in the climate issues," Momen said, adding that during the meeting the premier gave some proposals seeking investment in renewable energy sector, particularly in offshore wind energy and building embankments and roads along the costal belts and riversides. Sheikh Hasina told the meeting that her government took a bold decision to scrap 10 coal-based power plants involving US$12 billion foreign investment, reflecting Bangladesh's willingness to concentrate on renewable energy in the interest of environment. The Charles-led delegation said they would examine the proposals visiting Bangladesh as they wanted to participate in Bangladesh's development process. \</doc>

Speakers at a webinar here demanded an effective participation of the young people in the climate discussions including COP 26 as the climate change adversely impacts their life, livelihood and health. ActionAid Bangladesh arranged the webinar titled `Climate Justice: Capturing Youth Voice from Global South in the Context of Pandemic' with participation of young people from Asia, Africa, Central Asia and Europe, alongside Bangladeshi youths. Youth climate champions and activists from the various countries raised their voice against the limited or no spaces for them in various global decision-making platforms including COP26 . 'The young people around the globe want to take the COP26 as an opportunity to raise their issues to the global leadership. But the young people are worried that the COP26 is not going to be participatory because of the Covid-19 vaccination issue,' said Farah Kabir, Country Director of ActionAid Bangladesh, at a video message. She said the COP would not be meaningful without participation of the young generation who are the future of the world. Nahim Razzaq MP said now climate change is evident and has emerged as a great problem for the world. Climate change is man-made and the people are responsible for it, he said. The young parliamentarian said all the countries need to follow the Paris Agreement to ensure a decent eco-system for the betterment of the world. Dr. Saleemul Huq, Director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) in Bangladesh, emphasised on action rather than advocacy related to climate issues. 'Advocacy is good, but it is not enough. Advocacy alone no longer can be sufficient,' he said. He said action should be initiated locally first and spread globally. Climate activist Saila Sobnom Richi from `Youth Net for Climate Justice Bangladesh' presented her experiences on the vulnerability of young people amid COVID-19 pandemic with respect to climate change. Young climate Activists Shreya K.C (Nepal), Disha Ravi (India), Eric Damien (Kenya), Neeshad Shafi (Qatar), Jon Bonifacio (Philippines), Manuel V\'e1squez (Guatemala), Maria Reyes (Mexico), Laksh Sharma (India), Khun Thet Paing (Myanmar), Joainta Babirye (Uganda) shared their thoughts and experiences over the climate justice and actions. Rebecca Sultana, founder of Youth Environment and Social Development Society (YESDS) and member of ActionAid International Bangladesh Society (AAIBS) general assembly inaugurated the event as a chair, said a press release. \</doc>

Money allocated for the climate-vulnerable people hardly ends up reaching them due to the absence of capable institutions and proper distribution, speakers said at an event hosted by Brac at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) Saturday. Three big failures are seriously undermining the efforts to tackle the negative impacts of climate change, said Dr Professor Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Dhaka, and one of the world's foremost experts on the climate crisis. The first failure is on the part of the developed countries in releasing the $100 billion they promised in 2009, to channel to vulnerable countries. The second failure, according to Dr Huq, is that they are giving 20 percent of the money for adaptation and 50 percent for mitigation, when the ratio should be 50/50. The third and final failure is that the funds reach only 2 percent of the vulnerable people. Saleemul was addressing the panel discussion "Climate Bridge Fund: An innovative CSO-led financing to build the resilience of climate migrants in Bangladesh" held at the Bangladesh Pavilion at the COP26 in Glasgow, UK. "We are yet to get the $100 billion a year promised to less wealthy nations by 2020 to help them adapt to climate change and mitigate further rises in temperature. The issue has not been resolved up to now. We want the developed countries to start disbursing these funds, and they should start right now," said Md Mostafa Kamal, secretary at the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, while addressing the discussion as chief guest. Brac, the world's largest NGO that fights poverty across the global South from its Bangladeshi base, established the Climate Bridge Fund (CBF) as a trust fund in November 2019, with the support of the German government through KfW, the country's state-owned investment and development bank. The aim of the fund is to support adaptation and risk-reduction measures of people who are displaced or at the risk of being displaced due to the impacts of climate change in Bangladesh. Legally it operates as an endowment fund. CBF invested about pound 10 million (Euros) in treasury bonds. Proceeds are being used to support local organisations to implement adaptation projects. Barbara Schnell, director of KfW, said: "Bangladesh's climate migrants have a very uncertain future. We think the CBF initiatives have four success factors, including capacity building. It has bridged the gaps for vulnerable people." Asif Saleh, executive director of Brac, said: "The CBF model of Brac-KfW can be a unique model to address problems of climate migrants and vulnerable people in the urban areas." "We do not have any master plan to address the climate change issue in the cities. CBF wants to promote locally-led adaptation to avoid climatic risks not only in Bangladesh, but also the other countries in the world." \</doc>

Power Cell director general Mohammad Hossain has said that Bangladesh is trying to import 500 MW of hydro-electricity from Nepal. COP26 Outcome and Its Implication on energy sector transition for Bangladesh' organized by Energy and Power magazine. Abul Kalam Azad, Special Envoy to CVF Presidency and President, Bangladesh Energy Forum, Mohammad Alauddin, Chairman, Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA), Dr. Nurul Quadir, Former Additional Secretary and Faculty Member of North South University, Md. Ziaul Haque, Director, Department of Environment, Dr. Mizan R Khan, Deputy Director, International Centre for Climate Change and Development, Independent University, Engr. Al Mudabbir Bin Anam, Programme Coordinator, Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Programme, GIZ Bangladesh also spoke on the occasion. Mohammad Hossain said Indian company GMR is developing a 1,300 MW power plant in Nepal and Bangladesh is working on to import 500 MW from that plant. He noted that Bangladesh needs extra power to meet the peak demands in the summer between April and August. He said the country has to increase its generation capacity by 40 percent to meet this peak demand which stays for only 4-5 hours in the day time. 'This extra generation is not cost effective. If we go for regional energy cooperation to develop power exchange market, it will be helpful for us to import such extra power from the regional sources', he added. Dr. Mizan R Khan said India has been stumbling block for regional energy cooperation because of its nationalistic attitude not to allow multinational diplomacy with smaller country. He alleged that Indian current political authority is trying to revive their founding fathers' India-Pakistan centric two-nation theory. He observed that there is 70,000 MW hydro power generation potential in Nepal and Bhutan. \</doc>

Queen Elizabeth II tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday and is experiencing mild, cold-like symptoms, Buckingham Palace said, adding that the famously stoic 95-year-old monarch plans to carry on working. The palace said the queen would continue with 'light' duties at Windsor Castle over the coming week. 'She will continue to receive medical attention and will follow all the appropriate guidelines,' the palace said in a statement. People in the U.K. who test positive for COVID-19 are required to self-isolate for at least five days, although the British government says it plans to lift that requirement for England this week. The queen has received three doses of coronavirus vaccine. Both her eldest son Prince Charles, 73, and her 74-year-old daughter-in-law Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall both contracted COVID-19 earlier this month. Charles has since returned to work. There are also thought to be several recent virus cases among staff at Windsor Castle, where the queen is staying. Senior British politicians sent get-well messages. Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted: 'I'm sure I speak for everyone in wishing Her Majesty The Queen a swift recovery from COVID and a rapid return to vibrant good health.' Health Secretary Sajid Javid wrote that he was 'Wishing Her Majesty The Queen a quick recovery,' while opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer wished the queen 'good health and a speedy recovery. Get well soon, Ma£m.' Britain's longest-reigning monarch, the queen reached the milestone of 70 years on the throne on Feb. 6, the anniversary of the death in 1952 of her father King George VI. A fixture in the life of the nation, Elizabeth has been in robust health for most of her reign and has been photographed riding a horse as recently as 2020. In the past year she has been seen using a walking stick, and in October she spent a night in a London hospital for unspecified tests. The queen's doctors ordered her to rest after that and she was forced to cancel appearances at several key events, including Remembrance Sunday services and the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland in November. This month she returned to public duties and has held audiences both virtually and in person with diplomats, politicians and senior military officers. During one exchange caught on camera last week, she walked slowly with a stick and said £s you can see I can't move' in apparent reference to her leg. Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine, said members of the royal family would be concerned by the COVID-19 diagnosis, given the queen's age. She turns 96 on April 21. 'In the coming days a very close eye will be kept on her and the indications are that, all being well, it's nothing more than a minor inconvenience,' he said. The queen has a busy schedule over the next few months of her Platinum Jubilee year, and is scheduled to attend in-person public engagements in the coming weeks, including a diplomatic reception at Windsor on March 2 and the Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey on March 14. On March 29, she has a remembrance service at Westminster Abbey for her husband Prince Philip, who died in April 2021 at the age of 99. Public celebrations of the Platinum Jubilee are scheduled for June, with festivities including a military parade, a day of horse-racing and neighborhood parties over a June 2-5 long weekend. The queen is the latest monarch from around the world to catch COVID-19. Queen Margrethe of Denmark, 82, and Spain's King Felipe VI, 54, both tested positive for the illness earlier in February and had mild symptoms. On Tuesday the queen's second son, Prince Andrew, settled a U.S. lawsuit brought by a woman who claimed he had sexually abused with her when she was 17 and traveling with the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew strenuously denied the claim by Virginia Giuffre. He agreed in a settlement to make a substantial donation to his accuser's charity. On Wednesday, London's Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into allegations that people associated with one of Prince Charles' charities offered to help a Saudi billionaire secure honors and citizenship in return for donations. \</doc>

The nations have stricken the Glasgow Climate Pact, aimed at fighting climate change, after more than two weeks of hectic negotiations. The COP26 had to go into overtime for the deal to be agreed. It would be the first ever deal to cut use of coal, which is most responsible for emitting greenhouse gases. It also committed to providing more money for the developing countries to help stave off the climate impacts. The much-awaited Rule Book for starting implementation of the Paris Agreement has also been finalized, among other developments in the conference where around 200 countries attended. There were disappointments about the outcome that fell far short of expectations of many countries, different civil society organizations and climate activists. They expressed resentment over China and India's role in weakening the language on coal from 'Phase out' to 'Phase down'. Some observers and delegates also thought that the financing pledges were also not enough to fight the danger of warming while some countries, especially the most vulnerable poorer ones, were unhappy over the not-so-mentionable advances in Loss and Damage negotiations. While there is no lack of sincerity among the nations to collectively fight against the looming dangers, it is very unlikely that the hectic efforts would yield a success if the very good causes of some poorer or developing countries are overlooked. \</doc>

On this day, 50 years ago, the UK and Bangladesh established our diplomatic relationship. On behalf of the UK, I congratulate the people and the government of Bangladesh on this historic anniversary of a new era of Brit Bangla Bondhon. As British High commissioner in Bangladesh, I am proud that the UK played such a key role in Bangladesh's founding story. Before Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman set foot in his liberated homeland, his historic trip to the UK in January 1972 and his meeting with UK PM Edward Heath forged a new friendship and accelerated the recognition of Bangladesh as an independent nation. This historic moment encouraged Commonwealth countries to recognise Bangladesh. I also recall Her Majesty's Government's humanitarian relief contributions to a rising Bangladesh before, during and after the liberation war. In fact, The UK was one of the largest donors for humanitarian relief support to the people of Bangladesh in 1971, reflecting strong public support in the UK for the liberation cause. All this laid the foundations for a unique and lasting relationship between the UK and Bangladesh. With the establishment of a British High Commission in Dhaka, the then UK Foreign Secretary Sir Alec Douglas-Home visited Bangladesh in 1972. Since then, the UK has been a committed partner of this country in research, health services and community development, disaster risk reduction, poverty alleviation, improving education, increasing life expectancy for women and children, and womens' empowerment. And all this has helped the country's remarkable progress over the last 50 years. As Bangladesh continued to grow as an independent nation through the mid-1970s, the UK began to diversify its cooperation. We helped with capacity building for Bangladesh military staff, police, and government officials. In 1977, the UK supported Bangladesh in setting up a Military Staff College at Savar. In 1978, the then UK Prime Minister James Callaghan visited Bangladesh. Many Bangladeshis made the UK their home, and after five decades, with around 600,000 people of Bangladeshi origin living in the UK, the relationship between the British and Bangladeshi peoples is deeper and stronger than ever. Her Majesty the Queen Elizabeth II came to Bangladesh in 1983, when she travelled by train to visit a model village 35 miles south of Dhaka. Since that event, several Royal family members including HRH The Prince of Wales, HRH The Princess Royal, and Prime Ministers including John Major, Tony Blair and David Cameron have visited Bangladesh to witness a rising country. Through this time, the relationship has deepened, reflecting keen UK interest as Bangladesh has pursued recovery from poverty, floods, and devastating cyclones. The country has moved forward, a role model of positive transformation while continuing to grapple with political and governance challenges as a vibrant, independent nation. I am happy to reflect on Bangladesh's transformation from 'one of the world's poorest countries' into 'one of the world's fastest-growing economies' and the UK's part in that story. Today, the world looks with admiration at what Bangladesh has achieved in its first half century: an RMG powerhouse; a leading contributor to peace and security, especially as a provider of troops to UN peacekeeping missions, and one of the most influential global voices on climate change, as we have just seen at COP26 in Glasgow. The UK is proud to be a friend of Bangladesh through all this. Modern links between the UK and Bangladesh include trade and investment, the British Bangladeshi contribution to the UK National Health Service, education, development, defence, culture, cricket and curry! We share a mutual vision of a modern 21st century partnership bound by strong historical ties. We look forward to strengthening these bonds of kinship and culture through the dynamism of our strong people to people links, for the next 50 years and beyond. \</doc>

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has urged the developed countries to submit their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in line with their obligations under the 2015 Paris Agreement and implement those to cut carbon emissions to negate climate change impacts. 'The major emitters must submit ambitious NDCs, and implement those,' she said in her first proposal, out of four, while giving the national statement at the 26th Session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) joined by some 120 leaders of developed and developing countries. She said compromising its development needs Bangladesh updated its NDC, scrapping 10 coal-based power plants projects involving US$12 billion foreign investment and setting a roadmap to have 40 percent of the country's energy from renewable sources by 2041 alongside various other measures. Sheikh Hasina, also chair of the 48-nation Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) and V20 (The Vulnerable20), demanded developed countries fulfil their commitments of providing US$100 billion annually with a 50:50 balance between adaptation and mitigation. The Bangladesh premier's third proposal sought transfer of developed world's clean and green technology at affordable costs to the most vulnerable countries reminding the developed nations that CVF countries also need development. 'The issue of loss and damage must be addressed, including global sharing of responsibility for climate migrants displaced by sea-level rise, salinity increase, river erosion, floods, and draughts,' she said in her fourth proposal. \</doc>

The fashion industry could become 80 percent circular by 2030 if there is an increased investment in the existing recycling technologies and infrastructures, said a new report on Monday. The findings are based on an independent analysis and learning from the Circular Fashion Partnership in Bangladesh - a cross-sectoral project to scale post-industrial recycling and capture textile value domestically in Bangladesh - one of the largest garment producing countries in the world. In order to deliver the 2030 scenario, it estimated that US$ 5-7 billion investment is needed by 2026. The shift also requires increased confidence in the business case, calling for greater transparency of the demand for recycled output and the consistent supply of traceable high-quality feedstock. In the wake of COP26 , Global Fashion Agenda (GFA) , the leading non-profit for industry collaboration on sustainability in fashion, and its Strategic Knowledge Partner, McKinsey and Company, have published the new report - Scaling Circularity - which reveals the opportunities and investment required to scale circular fashion systems. The clothing and textile industry accounts for 4% of global CO2eq emissions, equivalent to the emissions of France, Germany and UK combined, and material production is the largest polluter within the value chain - accounting for 70% of fashion's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Yet currently, less than 1% of material used to produce clothing is recycled into new clothing, representing a loss of more than 100 billion USD worth of materials each year. Therefore, the report says, scaling circularity is crucial to deliver the radical emissions reduction needed to meet the Paris Agreement's 1.5 degree pathway and the other ambitious climate targets that were recently announced at COP26 . This analysis suggests current technologies have the potential to deliver 75% textile-to-textile recycling into the fashion system, and a further 5% recycled feedstock from other industries. The analysis also indicated that major recycling technologies deliver better environmental outcomes across GHG emissions, water depletion and land use. Plus, all technologies have the potential to be more cost effective than using corresponding virgin materials if they are scaled. Federica Marchionni, CEO, Global Fashion Agenda, said the research proves that the necessary recycling technologies exist, deliver huge improvements in environmental impact and that the economics work at scale. The report was made possible through the concerted and dedicated efforts of the GFA and McKinsey teams -particularly Holly Syrett, GFA's Impact Programmes and Sustainability Director and Corinne Sawers, McKinsey's Associate Partner. Putting circularity into practice in Bangladesh the report highlighted learning from the Circular Fashion Partnership in Bangladesh. Since its launch in October 2020, the partnership has mapped and traced over 1000 tonnes of textile waste in Bangladesh and is expected to reach over 200 tonnes a month by the end of 2021 - a significant achievement in the context of the global pandemic. The analysis showcases the strong case for scaling this model to other markets including Vietnam, Turkey, India, Malaysia, Indonesia and Bangladesh, claiming there is a US$ 4.5 billion opportunity. The case study also illuminates the critical actions needed to overcome the barriers to scaling systems including: formalising the informal waste management sector, providing alternatives to current use-cases for textile waste and assuring supply of quality feedstock and demand for recycling output. \</doc>

Dhaka, Jan. 13 -- Speakers at a seminar on Wednesday underscored the need for building resilient infrastructure in the country as the climate change impact affects Bangladesh's overall socio-economic development seriously. Highlighting on the financing gap between the funds mobilised and required every year, they also said public-private partnership model could play a vital role in this regard. They made the views at a seminar on 'Scope of Climate Smart PPP in Bangladesh and Post- COP26 Discussion'. Public-Private Partnership Authority (PPPA) in association with United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Bangladesh organised the event at a city hotel. State Minister for Public Administration Farhad Hossain attended the programme as the chief guest while Secretary to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Md Mostafa Kamal and UNDP Resident Representative Sudipto Mukerjee as the special guests and British High Commissioner to Bangladesh Robert Chatterton Dickson as a guest of honour. Chaired by Chief Executive Officer of PPPA Sultana Afroz, it was also addressed, among others, by Danish Ambassador to Dhaka Winnie Estrup Petersen and Turkish Ambassador Mustafa Osman Turan. In his speech, State Minister Farhad Hossain said Bangladesh is implementing various climate change related projects like power generation from renewable sources. "This is the time we need to place emphasis on climate smart PPP projects," he said, highlighting the need for global awareness and greater coordination among stakeholders to address the climate change impacts. Energy efficiency, clean energy, economic and social infrastructure, solid waste management, and pollution prevention are some of the areas those need finance for which PPP model could be used, he said. A move is underway to launch a partnership between Bangladesh and United Kingdom to mobilize 120 million pound climate change partnership, he added. Ms Sultana Afroz highlighted on the role and development initiatives taken by PPPA and its achievements. "Some 79 projects are in the pipeline, representing various sectors including transport, health and housing worth estimated total investment of $29.23 billion," she said. Climate Change Specialist of UNDP Bangladesh A.K.M Mamunur Rashid, Senior Assistant Secretary to PPPA Mohsina Akter Banu, and Founding President and board member of BUILD Bangladesh Farhadur Reza made three presentations on relevant issues. Mr Mamunur Rashid made the presentation on Bangladesh's climate ambitions, fiscal framework and innovative finance landscape.

Dhaka, Nov. 12 -- Bangladesh has signed the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use in the COP26 , pledging to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. Mostafa Kamal, a member of the Bangladesh delegation and secretary of the ministry of environment, forests and climate change, confirmed this to UNB. Mostafa said that NDC had uploaded a letter of consent from Bangladesh on the website of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) on August 26 stating its commitment to forest protection, afforestation, and forest expansion by 2030. However, as it was not uploaded timely, it was reported that Bangladesh is not with the global initiative of ending deforestation process- which was inaccurate. The secretary added that Bangladesh has reached an agreement in this regard. "As other countries have reached a consensus, Bangladesh has also expressed solidarity with this consensus. But because of the system error, the name of Bangladesh was not in the first list on the UNFCC web site. Later on Sunday, the name of Bangladesh was added and published. In this way, the names of more countries can be added and the list can be published in stages, the secretary said. He said that Bangladesh is ahead of many other countries in the world in protecting forest lands. And the consensus target is to protect existing forest lands in their respective countries by 2030 as well as create new forests. He added that not only the protection of natural forests, but also the proposal to increase green coverage in the cities to address the climate change has been proposed at the conference. Another member of Bangladesh delegation Chief Conservator of Forests Md Amir Hossain told UNB that a master plan has been taken to increase forest cover from 16 per cent to 20 per cent and afforestation from 22 per cent to 25 per cent by 2030. At the same time, local people are being worked together to protect the forest and create new forests. "We are constantly protecting the forest," he said. On the contrary, the number of forests in different areas is increasing. Amir said that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG-15) also speak of sustainable management of forests, prevention of deforestation, restoration of forests and conservation of biodiversity. For this, Bangladesh has taken various steps to conserve forests and forest resources. Article 18 (A) of the Constitution of the country states the specific constitutional obligation to provide for the protection and security of the state's environment and natural resources, biodiversity, forests, forests and wildlife. Moreover, the Social Forestry Rules formulated in 2004 and the latest 'National Forest Policy 2016' emphasize on forest conservation and expansion of forest areas, wildlife management and tackling the effects of climate change on the ecosystem. Dr Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad, another Bangladeshi delegate, said that the importance of forest protection has been highlighted in the constitution of the country. In that light, the government has specific policies. At the COP26 Conference, 134 countries, including Bangladesh, came together to protect the world's forests and protect the world's forests from adverse effects of climate change.

Mixed Plastic Wastes (PWs) have been revealed as the most valuable source of diesel fuel, syngas and many valuable products in most of the developed and developing countries. In Sweden, PWs are called 'Gold' as recovered from mining old landfill sites with gold plated electronics. An integrated research, lab tests and 4R methods (recycle, re-use, reduce and recover) and its products have been contributing to reductions in environmental health hazards, GHG emissions and climate change and meet 'Net Zero 2050' of the UNFCCC. The most innovative 4R method is 'Pyrolysis' producing fuels from condensed syngas, and solid charcoal. This research paper focuses on the 'Pyrolysis' process to transfer 'PW to Fuel' based on outputs of a 'Feasibility Study on Waste to Energy in 6 Municipalities' (UNDP Report, 2017). Introduction Global lives and ecosystems are being severely threatened due to dumping of plastic wastes mixed with organic, combustible, non-combustible solids, and e-waste such as electronic equipment, metals, glass, pet bottles, polybags, containers, tires, plastic furniture and utensils etc. Uncontrolled dumping of those plastic wastes clogging the city drains, canals, ponds, lakes, rivers and sea shores threatening fish population, aquatic animals and plants Mixed Plastic Waste Collection and Manual Processing system in Bangladesh. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres (Tweet, Nov. 5, 2021) said: 'How we produce and use energy is the main cause of the climate crisis. Ensuring that everyone can access clean and affordable energy will fast-track the transition to net-zero emission, and the achievement of Global Goals (2021).' According to a quote from the COP26 : 'Negotiations in Glasgow have delivered top-up that should lift to US$100 billion the annual flow of capital to developing countries - a commitment made in Copenhagen in 2009. While the details have yet to be clarified, US proposals to write off legacy debt to developing countries in return for climate pledges is one of the innovative financing solutions starting to come through. Developing countries themselves have levers they can pull to improve the flow of private capital for green projects, including fiscal incentives (Wood Mackenzie, 2021)'. A Source of Green Energy Plastic waste is a widely used item in everyday life and its importance is increasing in the present day world. Because of the growing use and importance of plastic, waste management has become a major headache for developing South Asian countries like Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In Bangladesh, the greatest constraint is to sort out plastic items from garbage collected from all over the municipalities by van drivers or the vendors selling mixed plastics with solid waste (known as Bhangri). In absence of street side collection boxes, most household wastes are dropped at the designated collection centers of the municipal wards. Prior to loading waste in dumping trucks, most of the valuable PWs and metals are separated from organic wastes except polybags in organic waste (Star, 2020) Waste Management Problems Currently, most of the municipal waste management is controlled by syndicates of the city conservancy department and the ward commissioners. Plastic waste collection, recovery and recycling businesses are limited to processes of shredding, cutting to granules and selling to plastic recycling factories and industries making kitchen pots, buckets, tables, chairs, furniture and utensils. The largest plastic recycling industry is PRAN-RFL which is selling many fancy plastic items at home and abroad. Nevertheless, the percentage recycling plastic waste is less than 8% in Bangladesh (Sun, 2020), 9% in Canada (ECA, 2020) and 10.5% in Australia (Rasul, 2021). Those data reveals that there are high potentials to monetize over 92% of plastic waste to fuel and many high value 4R products with application of appropriate technologies. Successful PW Projects In Bangladesh and most other countries in the world, fossil fuels are predominantly distilled from imported oil, which creates an economic and political dependence on foreign supplies. Recently, gasoline and diesel have been subject to a large price hike which has badly affected the regional budget planning in industrial and transportation fuels. Combined impact of economic, political, and environmental pressure provides the motivation to reduce the use of conventional transportation fuels. In urban areas of the United States, vehicle emissions are the largest single source of air pollution and greenhouse gases. Emissions from gasoline cars include unburned hydrocarbons, which are responsible for ground-level ozone and smog; nitrogen oxides (NOx), which contribute to ozone, carbon monoxide (CO), a toxic byproduct of incomplete combustion and a health hazard; sulfur dioxide (SO2), which contributes to acid rain and carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. The exhaust from gasoline vehicles or from evaporative emissions include many other harmful compounds, including benzene, toluene, xylenes, styrene, 1,3-butadiene, aldehydes, ketones, phenols, halogenated hydrocarbons, and trace metals (Sattar, Mh, 2017). Elective powers created from PW source can possibly conquer numerous financial and ecological issues, by giving a consistent, minimal expense wellspring of fuel, by giving nearby work in energy creation, and by giving fuel types that are cleaner and produce less hurtful emanations. A lot of innovative work in elective energizes has zeroed in on biomass, for instance, making cellulosic ethanol from non-palatable biomass sources. Nonetheless, biomass energy requires enormous measure of arable land to be given to the development of plant sources. Elective fills produced from homegrown sources have been proposed as an answer for power age, and numerous elective powers are being created dependent on sun based, wind, and biomass. In the USA, National State Research Inc. (NSR) has developed a different alternative hydrocarbon fuel which is produced from abundant solid waste plastic materials (some research outputs of Waste Technology Inc. at NSR Inc. quoted: 'The NSR research yield as fuel contains extra hydrocarbons when contrasted with business gas with an octane rating of 87 (gasoline-87)." There are likewise different advantages in getting fills from squander plastic materials. Squander plastic is bountiful and its removal establishes enormous issues for the climate. Plastic doesn't separate in landfills, it isn't handily reused, and it corrupts in quality during the reusing system. In any case, compound cycles, for example, pyrolysis and de-polymerization can be utilized to securely change over plastics into hydrocarbon powers that can be utilized for transportation, weighty industries and power generators. The United States produces 30 million huge loads of plastic waste each year, and since one tonne of plastic can be changed over into 420 gallons of fuel, there is the possibility to make 12.6 billion gallons of fuel cross country yearly from squander plastic. This could supplant up to 9% of U.S. fuel utilization. The transformation interaction of changing waste plastic materials over to fluid hydrocarbon fuel has been effectively exhibited in a lab scale. The upsides of NSRs method are its effortlessness, which would permit districts to build nearby fuel creation plants; its capacity to deal with numerous plastic sorts; and its capacity to deliver an assortment of fuel types for various Industries and transportation needs, e.g., for gas, diesel, or aeronautics motors (Dr. Sarker, 2021). Pyrolysis Process The Pyrolysis process involves heating the plastic to form liquid slurry (thermal liquefaction in the range 670\'b0-820\'b0C), partial cooling of the slurry, distilling the slurry in the presence of a cracking catalyst, condensing the distillate to recover the liquid hydrocarbon fuel, and routing the remaining slurry residue back into fresh slurry to undergo another catalyzed distillation/condensation process. No additional chemicals are used in the pyrolysis process, and it is 99% leak-proof and pollution-free. Outputs and Monetization In Bangladesh, mixed plastic waste generates about 70-80% crude oil which may undergo further distillation process to produce diesel and solvent to be used as fuels for power generator and transportation (ASPM, 2015). Fortan pyrolysis machine: Small capacity pre-fabricated machines are found feasible because it operates at the lowest cost, potable and easy to install in 7-10 days. Technology of Distillation Furnace has heat rating of 100 kW. Type of fuel -any solid furnace fuel. On customer request, the plant can be provided with liquid-fuel burner and gas burner. The pot is a horizontal cylindrical tank placed directly on the furnace. There are gas pipes inside the pot. Hot gases from the furnace get to the pipes; make two turns, giving the heat to the raw material in the pot. The pot is equipped with level indicators to control the level of liquid in the pot. There is a pressure-gauge on the top equipped with pump and valves to pump the raw material in from the pipes and tanks. Distillation column (3) consists of several side-bars (sections). There are retaining plates inside of each section. Space between plates 250 mm, diameter of the column is 400 mm. Sections are insulated with mineral wool (Sattar, 2019). The condenser (4) locates at the top of the column. It is a horizontal shell-and-tube heat exchanger with two distribution chambers at the ends, connected with pipelines. Cooling water moves in the space between the pipes. Vapors from the top of the column get through pipelines to the distribution chamber, then to the pipe space, where they are condensed and overcooled. The condensate flows in the opposite distribution chamber, then to the reflux divider (5). For heavy fractions temperature can exceed 300C, so the distillate goes from the divider through pipelines to the distillate cooler (7). Further, the condensate is turned to the overflow device that turns condensate to the appropriate tank. Residue in the pot with the temperature up to 380C is turned through the cooler of residue to the storage tank of residue. The residue must be poured out in such temp to keep safe temperature of it. The temperature should be around 60 - 80C. There are four storage tanks. Those are vertical cylindrical tanks with capacity of about 1 m3 each. They are equipped with pumps to pump distillates out (SGS Lab, 2018). A simple catalytic process for de-polymerizing waste plastic to synthetic crude oil has been developed and further refined using a laboratory scale double condensation process. Characterization studies by GC and GC-MS indicate the de-polymerization product is essentially all straight chain hydrocarbons when linear thermoplastic polymers are used as the feed. Further testing is in progress with high-fuel-efficient automobile engine in our laboratory (SGS, 2020). To end this article, an alarming message to the global community is quoted ( COP26 ): 'Nature knows no political boundaries. The triple planetary crises of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution affect everyone, everywhere. Negotiators at the COP26 must show ambition and solidarity to avert conflicts, save the planet and our future ..." Conclusion A simple catalytic process for de-polymerizing waste plastic to synthetic crude oil has been developed and further refined using a laboratory scale double condensation process. Characterization studies by GC and GC-MS indicate the de-polymerization product is essentially all straight chain hydrocarbons when linear thermoplastic polymers are used as the feed. Both GC and DSC studies indicate the product includes hydrocarbons ranging from C3 to C27, a range that includes commercial gasoline-87 and diesel fuel. Initial analyses of PW NRC fuel indicate a low research octane rating of 79.2 and a motor octane rating of 72.6, which is lower than commercial gasoline. Higher octane rating is expected with appropriate fractionation which will be confirmed in the future per the ASTM specifications. In contrast, an automobile test driving with PW NRC fuel shows competitive advantage in mileage over commercial gasoline-87 while using a low-fuel-efficient engine. A calculated 16.7% higher mpg is observed with PW NRC fuel when compared to gasoline-87. Further testing is in progress with high-fuel-efficient automobile engine. In Bangladesh, prospects of PW to fuel and many valuable products through 4R process is phenomenal. In this country, only small and low-cost pyrolysis machines are applicable. Unfortunately, most investors, banks, finance companies and quick money makers failed in the past 20 years in absence of skills, institutional R and D but syndicated corruption. Those syndicates deliberately misused public money in attempts to large-scale plants but failed. If 3M Energy Limited get any opportunity from Bangladesh government to implement PW to energy, we are struggling to demonstrate that recycling PW in small capacity machine.

Dhaka, Oct. 19 -- Indonesia is urging developed countries to commit to their pledge to provide financing for poorer countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at this month's UN climate conference, President Joko Widodo said on Tuesday. Rich countries have missed a target to raise $100 billion a year to support developing countries in their climate action projects, which experts say could break down trust at the Oct 31 - Nov 12 COP26 conference in the Scottish city of Glasgow, reports Reuters. "It's impossible if we don't get funding help. If we don't have the technology, it's also difficult," the president, who is popularly known as Jokowi, told Reuters on Tuesday after planting a patch of mangrove in the village of Bebatu on Borneo island. Indonesia, the world's eighth-biggest greenhouse gas emitter, has pledged to cut back its carbon emissions to 29 per cent below business-as-usual by its own efforts, but with the help of international funding and transfer of technology, it believes it could increase the reduction to up to 41 per cent. The country earlier this year brought forward its long-term target to reach carbon neutrality to 2060 or sooner, from 2070 initially, which includes plans to phase out the use of coal-fired plants. Jokowi said Indonesia wants to invest in renewable projects to capitalise on its potential in hydropower, the geothermal, wind, solar and marine current and this will require billions of dollars of funding. A government study has shown the Southeast Asian country needs $150 billion to $200 billion per year in investment in low carbon programmes over the next nine years to meet its net-zero emission goal. "This is a big work. It needs investment, it needs technologies," Jokowi said, adding that he did not want "just talk" at COP26 . The president said Indonesia would also promote sustainable economic growth when it takes over the G20 presidency in December, alongside an even economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. "We want to fight for the chance for poor countries, developing countries, vulnerable groups, to get back on their feet and not get left behind by developed countries," he said.

Dhaka, Sept. 8 -- A coalition of environmental groups has called for a pivotal climate conference to be postponed amid concern that many of those most affected by global warming won't be able to attend because of the continuing threat from COVID-19. Campaigners said Tuesday that organizers hadn't done enough to ensure broad participation in the event by providing access to vaccines and defraying the rising cost of travel for people from developing nations, many of which are subject to British government travel restrictions. The UN climate summit, known as COP26 , is scheduled for Oct. 31-Nov. 12 in Scotland, reports the Associated Press. "Our concern is that those countries most deeply affected by the climate crisis and those countries suffering from the lack of support by rich nations in providing vaccines will be left out of the talks,'' said Tasneem Essop, executive director of Climate Action Network, which includes 1,500 groups in 130 countries. "There has always been an inherent power imbalance within the UN climate talks and this is now compounded by the health crisis.'' But the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a group of 48 countries that are most at risk from climate change, later said an in-person summit must take place as scheduled to ensure the world responds to a threat "unparalleled in human history." The tussle over postponement comes just weeks after an international panel of climate scientists issued a stark warning to world leaders, saying time was running out to avert the worst effects of climate change. COP26 is seen as a critical step in the drive to persuade governments, industry and investors around the world to make binding commitments on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The meeting was originally scheduled to be held last year, but it was postponed due to the pandemic. "Clearly, every country needs to be given the opportunity to participate in COP26 , but a further postponement at this stage could have very serious consequences by undermining the momentum for action on climate change," said Bob Ward, policy director for the Grantham Institute on Climate Change and the Environment in London. The Climate Action Network, which includes groups such as Friends of the Earth and Amnesty International, called for postponement, saying organizers haven't done enough to ensure broad participation. Many of those countries are subject to British government restrictions that require travelers to undergo expensive testing and quarantines before entering the country. But the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a grouping of the countries that are most at risk from climate change, said the summit should go ahead as planned in hopes of rebuilding international cooperating on combatting climate change. " COP26 The British government which is hosting the event rejected calls for postponement, saying leaders must tackle the issue of climate change without further delay. "We are working tirelessly with all our partners, including the Scottish government and the UN, to ensure an inclusive, accessible and safe summit in Glasgow with a comprehensive set of COVID mitigation measures,'' COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma said in a statement. World leaders, climate campaigners and activists from around the globe are due to attend the conference, which is expected to attract more than 20,000 people from almost 200 countries. Queen Elizabeth II and Pope Francis are among those expected to attend in person. British officials are working on COVID-19 protocols for the conference that would ease travel restrictions for some delegates. The rules may let both vaccinated and unvaccinated delegates from so-called red list countries enter the UK after a five-day period of self-isolation. More than 60 countries are currently on the government's red list because of concerns about infection levels. Most travel from these countries is banned, and those who do enter the UK are required to spend 10 days in a government-approved hotel at their own expense. The discussion came on the day the European Union's climate monitoring service said average temperatures across the continent this summer were the warmest on record. Measurements by the EU's Copernicus satellite monitoring program showed that June to August temperatures across Europe were about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than the 1991-2020 average, and 0.1 C warmer than the previous record recorded during the summers of 2010 and 2018. Mediterranean countries in particular saw record-breaking temperatures this summer, along with devastating wildfires that prompted Greece this week to appoint a new minister of climate crisis and civil protection.

Dhaka, Oct. 30 -- Inter Press Service It is well-known that all the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) added together, even those that have been updated, will not help to place the world on a 1.5 degree C pathway. The latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the 'Physical Science' shows that for a 50% probability of limiting temperature rise to a 1.5 degree pathway, taking into account the historical and cumulative emissions, there is a remaining carbon budget of 500 gigatons of CO2 left and the world emits about 42 gigatons of CO2 per year. Which means that within a decade, this budget would be exhausted, leading to difficulty in limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degree C. Hence, it is important to recognise and acknowledge that the developed countries in particular, have not shown their leadership in taking on their fair share of the emission cuts needed. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and COP 16 in 2010 in Cancun, acknowledged that the largest share of historical global emissions of greenhouse gases originated in developed countries and that, owing to this historical responsibility, developed country Parties must take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof. We do need to understand that under the UNFCC and the Paris Agreement, the principles of equity and 'common-but-differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities' (CBDRRC) are fundamental in understanding the differentiated obligations between developed and developing countries. Moreover, developed countries have failed to reduce their emissions despite the decisions taken. Failure by developed countries to deliver on promised emissions reductions First commitment period (1CP) under the Kyoto Protocol from 2008 to 2012 only saw aggregate emissions of Annex 1 countries to be cut by 5% compared to 1990 levels. Despite this very low ambition, the United States (US) left the Protocol. Promise in 2012 by developed countries in the 2nd commitment period to revisit their emission reduction targets by 2014 from 18 per cent by 2020 to at least 25-40 per cent was never realized. The goal post shifted by developed countries calling all countries to plug the emissions gap -which turns the CBDR-RC principle on its head to 'common and shared responsibilities', with no reference to historical responsibility or equity between the North and South. In fact, between 1990 and 2018, developed countries on aggregate achieved only 13% emissions reductions between 1990 and 2018. Countries in Western Europe, United States, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada have not managed to reduce their aggregate emissions between 1990 and 2020. Instead, their aggregate emissions slightly increased from 13,227.97 MTCO2eq in 1990 to 13,331.23 MTCO2eq in 2020. So, instead of undertaking real deep emissions cuts to real zero by now, developed countries are announcing distant net-zero targets with 2050 as the target year, which again reflect reductions which are too little too late and that will exhaust the remaining carbon budget very soon. Hence, we must demand real and rapid zero from developed countries, not distant targets. Moreover, net zero targets mean that there will be reliance on carbon-offsets, where developed countries will pay developing countries to do the emission removals, which will then go to the credit of developed countries. This will mean that developing countries will have to do even more emissions cuts in their countries, as the offset credits sold to developed countries cannot be counted as part of their NDCs, as there cannot be double-counting and double-claiming of carbon credits. There is no more room for offsetting, and what needs to happen urgently in the rich world is for very deep and rapid de-carbonisation. Then, there is the much-needed finance and technology transfer that has to be delivered to developing countries to enable their transition to low-carbon pathways as soon as possible. The USD 100 billion per year by 2020 which was promised by developed countries has fallen short and Glasgow has to see actual delivery and timelines for this goal to be realised. Even this USD 100 billion per year target is a far cry from what is needed by developing countries, who have indicated the need for USD 5.8-5.9 trillion to implement their NDCs up to 2030. As has been pointed out earlier, the G20 as a group is not recognised under the UNFCCC and the PA but what is recognised is developed and developing countries. It is not the leadership of the G20 that is needed but the leadership of the G7 - as per the Convention and the PA. The developed and developing countries in the G20 cannot be viewed as having the same responsibility, leadership ability and capabilities. That will be contrary to the equity and CBDRRC principles of the UNFCCC and PA. Also, we have to remember that it is not only emissions reductions or mitigation that are important. Also critical is adaptation and addressing loss and damage (which goes beyond adaptation, as in for e.g. an extreme weather event that wipes out an economy of a country). These are critical issues for developing countries, where real action on adaptation and loss and damage are enabled on the ground, including in scaling up finance in this regard. China has announced a carbon-neutrality target of 2060. India is expected to announce an updated NDC. We cannot put China and India on the same footing as the developed world. China's and India's emissions are large due to their population. On a per capita basis, they are still much less than the developed countries. We do not know about Australia and Russia. It is quite clear that these countries are not going to phase out from their dependence on fossil fuels anytime soon. In fact, instead of the rich developed countries phasing out fossil fuels, what we see is the continued production and expansion of fossil fuels, as made clear by the UNEP Production Gap report. This is indeed worrying, as the developed world has no excuse to delay action. It is their delayed action mainly that is responsible for the current global warming, as made clear by their historical overuse of the carbon budget, as shown by the AR 6 of the IPCC.

Dhaka, Oct. 19 -- Sheikh Hasina, prime minister of Bangladesh, has argued that if the developed nations really want to address the mounting challenges that originated from the global climate change, they will have to be engaged and act decisively. In an article, published in the Financial Times (FT) on Monday, Hasina also said: "My country is investing for a zero-carbon future, but the world must commit at COP26 to make efforts like ours a success." In the article, titled as "A global 'climate prosperity plan' not empty pledges," she also wrote that only a tiny fraction of global warming can be attributed to Bangladesh's carbon emissions. "Even so, we are committed to leading the path to a solution," she added. "This is not only because we wish to avert the worst of climate change; it also makes economic sense." According to Hasina, "Investing in zero-carbon growth is the best way to create jobs across the economy and ensure that our nation becomes more prosperous." Hasina also wrote: "The inconvenient truth of our times is that while action on climate change has never been more urgent and achievable, governments are not cutting emissions fast enough to keep nations such as mine safe." In this connection, she mentioned that in the north of Bangladesh, millions of people depend on freshwater stored every year in the Himalayan ice fields, which warming air is now destabilising. "In the south, sea level rise is exacerbating the threat from coastal flooding. Falling crop yields are another destructive change we can anticipate," she said in the FT piece. Hasina also mentioned that earlier this, her government cancelled plans for 10 coal-fired power plants. "But that was a relatively small step," she added. "Subsequently, with COP26 in view, we developed the world's first national 'climate prosperity plan' - a vision under which we will enhance resilience, grow our economy, create jobs and expand opportunities for our citizens, using the action on climate change as the catalyst." She also added that under the plan, Bangladesh would obtain 30 per cent of the energy from renewables by the end of the decade. "We believe that developing wind farms along the coast will revitalise the mangrove forests that help stabilise our shifting shores, protecting against storms and flooding," she mentioned. "We will empower banks to offer favourable terms to fossil-fuel-free infrastructure projects, and pursue co-operation with developed nations in areas such as green hydrogen." The prime minister of Bangladesh also pointed out that by investing in resilience and zero-carbon development, the country is likely to create about 4.1 million additional jobs this decade than under business-as-usual. Hasina further added that the benefit to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated at over $850 billion. "I believe more developing nations will adopt such plans in the coming months and years, led by members of the Climate Vulnerable Forum," she further added. Hasina mentioned that Bangladesh could implement this plan independently but international climate finance would speed the things. "But what the world needs if we are to meet the Paris agreement goal to keep warming to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, is a global version of our climate prosperity plan," she argued strongly. "This year's COP26 summit in Glasgow is the best opportunity we will ever have to make one." She, however, cautioned that failure is a distinct possibility. "Having pledged three decades ago at the Rio Earth Summit to lead the world out of the climate and nature crises, developed nations have cut their combined greenhouse gas emissions by less than one-seventh, she mentioned adding that the failure 'is not leadership'. "Nor is their repeated refusal to take seriously the needs of those nations most immediately affected," she continued. "Agreement to support the poorest in dealing with the losses and damages caused by climate change is far removed from implementation." The article also mentioned that although recent net zero pledges from the European Union (EU), United States (US) and others are welcome, they are largely not accompanied by policies that give confidence. "The $100b per year finance pledge made 12 years ago remains unfulfilled," she pointed out adding that the amount is tiny compared with what developing nations will need in order to build a zero-carbon future. "Both governments and private institutions want to invest but we face the stark burden of a high cost of capital, exacerbated now by Covid-related debt," she asserted. Hasina mentioned in the FT article that if developed nations wish to help, they must address this. "Cutting the cost of capital will substantially accelerate decarbonisation across the global south, yielding worldwide benefits," she added. Hasina also questioned: "If western leaders cannot see the logic of this, perhaps recent events in their own backyards will help - for what were the extreme forest fires seen in North America and Australia or Germany's recent lethal floods, if not alarm bells clanging in regions of the world most responsible for climate change?" The PM, in her concluding note, wrote: "Bangladesh was born 50 years ago this year, a birth shrouded in blood and pain. My father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, inspired and led our struggle for independence. It is in his memory that we have named our climate prosperity plan the Mujib Plan." "Climate change is a very different foe from those he faced, but dealing with it, we require a great deal of fortitude, imagination, hope and leadership," she added. "If western leaders listen, engage and act decisively on what science demands of them, there is still time to make COP26 the success it desperately needs to be," Hasina expressed optimism at the end of the article.

Many Asian countries made net-zero pledges at COP26 in Glasgow last month, but most were vague and opaque. The big question is: what now? What will countries have to do to fulfil their climate pledges and what should their governments focus on for climate action in Asia in 2022? On 14 December, The Third Pole and Earth Journalism Network organised a webinar, bringing together a panel of climate experts to discuss these questions. India: 'The Government will Show Direction of Travel and Lay Foundations' Ulka Kelkar, Director of Climate Programme, World Resources Institute India A regional energy grid will be the key to unlocking the potential of renewable energy and using it to generate electricity. For all countries blessed with solar power, regional electricity should be the focus of 2022. A just transition is the second issue, and it plays out differently in our part of the world. Livelihoods are linked to caste, there is limited mobility and literacy, there are issues with women in the workforce - this is a far more complicated scenario than examples from other parts of the world. We have to come up with our own unique customised solutions [for a] just transition. Third, we need to learn from our own failures, such as Sri Lanka rolling back on banning imported fertiliser when yields fell and food prices became high. We need to learn from failed experiments in 2022. Fourth, local planning needs to be at the heart of adaptation planning. When it comes to climate action at this massive scale, it's bound to have a more positive impact in the aggregate. But at the local level, if there are maladaptive practices, there may be impacts on livelihoods, such as land-based and nature-based livelihoods. We need checks and balances, we need to prevent maladaptive consequences, learn from each other and cooperate with each other. In India, there is an entire spectrum of carbon-neutral plans being made but there is no role model or template. For example, the city of Mumbai has a climate action plan underway looking at a carbon-neutral future. Bihar state, which has a low carbon footprint, is stepping up and saying, 'We would like a low-carbon development pathway.' The national government can foster open discussions so we can mainstream climate considerations into state action plans. Industry will lead the response by [making] investments and working on supply chains. But the government will have to [ensure] regulatory certainty for industry. This may mean more renewable energy mandates, green hydrogen mandates etc. These are the kinds of signals the government will have to give, because at the scale at which we are talking about these targets, market forces alone will not get us there. Even though renewable energy is becoming more competitive than coal, things such as land will be a big constraint, as will mineral security for battery storage. Finance, too, will be a big constraint. Central Asia 'Civil Society and Media Key to Making Countries Stick to Commitments' Olha Boiko, Coordinator, Climate Action Network, Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia Kazakhstan has not updated its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) since 2016, though it plans to go climate neutral by 2060. As far as expectations for Kazakhstan go, an updated NDC is highly unlikely but at least there is an announcement for an action plan for a climate-neutrality strategy by 2060. We really need to focus on civil society participation and local level participation because it's impossible to create a just transition strategy without consulting stakeholders. Kyrgyzstan has been quite ambitious compared with other countries in Central Asia. Its emissions are ridiculously small, so the country is mostly focused on vulnerability and adaptation. However, it uses coal to heat houses. It updated its NDC, and the process was coordinated with civil society organisations who gathered information from local communities and passed it on to committees. Research station at the Adygine glacier complex in the Tien-Shan mountain range, Kyrgyzstan, Kyrgyzstan cautiously mentioned climate neutrality by 2050 during COP26 , but it's significant it did mention it. We expect new NDC implementation, more action on the international level as civil society grows stronger, more studies on alternatives to burning coal in homes, and for Kyrgyzstan to join the Climate Vulnerable Forum - which is a good way of teaming up with similar countries who are vulnerable and raising their voices. Tajikistan has weak civil society influence and is highly vulnerable to climate change, especially when it comes to water. The focus is on hydropower as the main renewable - a dangerous situation as Tajikistan already lacks water. We expect more action at the local level, more local communities using sustainable solutions and stronger communication from civil society. The government will engage on the regional level, with new capacity building and adaptation projects from international donors. Uzbekistan updated its NDC, which has good content and good suggestions. A carbon tax will be introduced. It is difficult for civil society to function and influence processes here. What to expect: NDC implementation, including supporting civil society and improving journalists' capacity to write independently about what is happening. Our role is to ensure there is a civil society presence and independent media so countries deliver what they promised. Nepal 'Despite Our Low Emissions, We want to be Part of the Solution' Manjeet Dhakal, South Asia lead, Climate Analytics Nepal The year 2022 will be crucial for Nepal. Nepal will graduate from LDC status [with the preparatory period of five years, Nepal will graduate to a developing country by December 2026] without meeting the income criteria. However, there is a challenge to retain this status because of the extreme effects of climate change and economic vulnerability. 2022 will be important for Nepal to prepare a smooth transition for graduation while addressing the compounding crisis that the country has faced in terms of Covid-19 and climate disasters. In our updated NDC, we have included a quantitative greenhouse gas reduction target on the energy sector and other sectors; we have also included the total cost of implementing the NDC, which amounts to USD 28 billion in 10 years. The country has pledged to mobilise USD 3 billion. This shows that despite low emissions we want to be part of the solution. The year 2022 will be important to build infrastructure for this transition and work needs to be done for technological breakthroughs and subsidies. Pakistan 'Holistic Implementation Contingent on Climate Awareness' Sara Hayat, Climate Lawyer and Consultant Pakistan has taken an ambitious pledge. It did not pledge net zero but planned to curb emissions by 50% by 2030, with 15% of this through internal efforts and the remainder contingent on international funding. With regard to implementation, the government has taken it head on, as it is holding various workshops in the country and inviting members of civil society to work alongside government officials. In the short term, the government hopes to shift to 60% renewable energy by 2030, put a moratorium on new coal plants and allow no generation through imported coal. Still, Pakistan hasn't let go of coal power, but does intend to by shifting to hydro and solar. It's strongly focusing on the electric vehicle policy, pledging to shift to about 30% electric vehicles by 2030. It's preparing its national adaptation plan, which promises to be gender-sensitive, youth-focused - a big leap forward. Though the Ten Billion Trees Tsunami [an afforestation programme] is making waves and the government is focused on channelling funding for it, one would hope that there is more work on the mitigation side as well. Small measures are being taken to tackle smog, for example, giving subsidies to farmers so they don't burn crops[sic], or shifting brick kilns to zigzag technology so there are less emissions or buffered emissions. On Mondays, schools and private offices are closed to reduce vehicular emissions, and the government is shifting to Euro V petrol which reduces pollution. Whether these efforts come together holistically is contingent upon whether there is enough climate awareness. Policies lose impact if awareness does not take place. In Pakistan, this awareness is devolved to civil society and NGOs. Overall, given other strains on the economy and post-pandemic effect, as well as large and uneducated population, making climate change a priority is a big thing for this government. Indonesia 'Green Recovery Needed After Covid-19' Agus Sari, Chief Executive, Landscape Indonesia We do have a strong NDC, which offers a detailed roadmap on how to get there. From about 2.8 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions, we have to limit it to 2 gigatonnes with our own resources and to 1.8 gigatonnes with international support. We are doing a lot with our own resources. On average, USD 800-900 million per year is spent on climate change out of the national budget. We have a net-zero pledge, by 2060 or earlier. Indonesia has committed to making the forestry sector a net carbon sink by 2030. In 2022, Indonesia will chair the G20, so there is pressure on it to perform on commitments and show progress. Climate ambitions will be reviewed - that was one of the decisions of COP26 . The energy sector is more difficult to deal with as we are very coal-intensive: 66% of our electricity generation comes from coal, 30% or less from oil and a tiny 10% from renewable energy. This needs to be increased. We have the target to increase renewable energy to 21% by 2050 which doesn't sound like much unless you see where we are starting from. The president wants a roadmap for energy transition, he has made it sound like we are in urgent need of a good transition plan. He has talked to two of the largest state-owned electricity and oil companies to abandon coal and carbon-intensive technologies and embrace RE. There is now a dual mandate of increasing production and decreasing emissions. Bangladesh 'Government is Guided by the Scientific Community' Dr Atiq Rahman, executive director, Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies The Bangladesh government has been quite open, progressive and interactive in terms of decisions for climate action. The local scientific community is interacting with the international scientific community, and NGOs and civil society groups are strong. The government has various committees in which many of these people are represented. Of course, the government has the last word, but it is often the language of this scientific community that is reflected in decisions. With a rapidly growing population, the demand for crop production is growing. Food self-sufficiency is the national target and we have more or less achieved that with respect to rice, which is the main food. The threat of starvation isn't there. Our forecast and prediction of extreme events has improved. \</doc>

COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma has highlighted the importance of the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest, saying that it plays a significant role as a carbon sink. During his recent visit to Bangladesh, Sharma travelled to the Sundarbans and saw how the natural defences of the Sundarbans can protect villages from high wind speed and storm surges. "I learnt more about how this vital carbon sink protects local communities from cyclones and storm surges. Nature is the key in order to keep 1.5C in reach. Preserving it must be a priority for all," he said. Also read: Dhaka, London hopeful of signing climate accord before COP26 Sharma welcomed Bangladesh climate leadership and ambition ahead of COP26 . COP26 President's visit. The COP26 President-Designate welcomed strong climate commitments from Bangladesh. 'The next decade will be make, or break, for our planet, and effective global collaboration will be vital to tackling the pressing challenges the world faces. So I am delighted to have witnessed UK-Bangladeshi climate partnership in action, and heard such positive ambition from my Bangladeshi friends," he said. Also read: COP26 'I am inspired by the innovative work I have seen here to address some of the worst effects of climate change, and hope that Bangladesh will continue to lead by example ahead of COP26 which is our best hope of building a brighter future.' \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 2 -- Nearly 90 countries have joined a US- and EU-led effort to slash emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane 30 per cent by 2030 from 2020 levels, a pact aimed at tackling one of the main causes of climate change, a senior Biden administration official said. The partnership will be formally launched later on Tuesday. Methane is the main greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. It has a higher heat-trapping potential than CO2 but breaks down in the atmosphere faster - meaning that cutting methane emissions can have a rapid impact on reining in global warming. The Global Methane Pledge, which was first announced in September, now includes half of the top 30 methane emitters accounting for two-thirds of the global economy, according to the Biden administration official. China, Russia and India, also top-five methane emitters, have not signed on to the pledge. Those countries were all included on a list identified as targets to join the pledge, previously reported. Since it was first announced in September with a handful of signatories, the United States and European Union have worked to get the world's biggest methane emitters to join the partnership, reports Reuters. There were roughly 60 countries signed up only last week, after a final diplomatic push from the United States and EU ahead of the COP26 summit. While it is not part of the formal UN negotiations, the methane pledge could rank among the most significant outcomes from the COP26 conference, given its potential impact in holding off disastrous climate change. A UN report in May said steep cuts in methane emissions this decade could avoid nearly 0.3 degree Celsius of global warming by the 2040s. Failing to tackle methane, however, would push out of reach the Paris Agreement's aim to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 C above preindustrial levels and avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The 30 percent methane cut would be jointly achieved by the signatories, and cover all sectors. Key sources of methane emissions include leaky oil and gas infrastructure, old coal mines, agriculture and landfill sites. The United States is the world's biggest oil and gas producer, while the EU is the biggest importer of gas. The United States is due to release oil and gas methane regulations this week. The EU and Canada both plan to unveil methane legislation addressing the energy sector later this year. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Oct. 13 MANILA(Inquirer/ANN)  The World Health Organization (WHO) is calling climate change the "single biggest threat facing humanity," as it urged governments to take swift action to respond to the unfolding global crisis. In a report released weeks ahead of the United Nations climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland, the WHO governments should not only commit to a healthy and green recovery from the coronavirus pandemic but also to place health and social justice at the heart of the climate talks. "The next few years present a crucial window for governments to integrate health and climate policies in their COVID-19 recovery packages," read the report, which outlined recommendations developed in consultation with over 400 experts and health professionals and 150 organizations. "While near-term pandemic responses will largely set the pace and direction of health and climate goals, ambitious national climate commitments will be crucial to sustain a healthy recovery in the mid- to long-term," it added. Intimate, delicate links Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, said the pandemic had shone a light on the "intimate and delicate links" between humans and the environment, and that the same unsustainable choices killing the planet were also killing people. "WHO calls on all countries to commit to decisive action at COP26 to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius-not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it's in our own interests," he said. COP26 refers to the 26th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, where world officials will gather in November to discuss the way forward in stemming the worst impacts of the climate crisis. The 82-page report stressed that climate change is already affecting health in many ways, like in the deaths and illnesses attributable to increasingly frequent extreme weather such as storms and heatwaves, as well as the rise in zoonotic and vector-borne diseases, disruption in food systems, and mental health issues. "Strengthening resilience and building adaptive capacity to climate change... can also lead to health benefits," it said. "The public health benefits resulting from ambitious mitigation efforts would far outweigh their cost." Transition to renewables Among the report's recommendations is a just transition to renewable energy sources and moving away from the use of fossil fuels, such as coal. "The burning of fossil fuels is killing us, causing millions of premature deaths every year through air pollutants, costing the global economy billions of dollars annually, and fueling the climate crisis," the report read. "Governments and the private sector can support a green and healthy recovery from COVID-19 by reforming energy subsidies so no public money goes to fossil fuel production." WHO also called on governments to reimagine urban environments, transport and mobility by promoting sustainable and healthy urban designs, increasing access to green and blue public spaces, and prioritizing walking, cycling and public transport. 45M signatures Alongside the release of the report was an open letter calling for national leaders and COP26 country delegations to step up climate action, signed by at least 45 million doctors, nurses and health professionals worldwide, representing over two-thirds of the global health workforce. In the letter, the health workers said the "rapidly growing" climate crisis could be "far more catastrophic and enduring" than the COVID-19 pandemic. "Integrating health and equity into climate policy will protect peoples' health, maximize returns on investments and build public support for the urgently needed climate actions," the letter read. "These climate actions must be taken now to protect the planet, and the health, well-being and prosperity of all people alive today and for generations to come." ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

British High Commissioner to Bangladesh Robert Chatterton Dickson has said the world, today, looks with admiration at what Bangladesh has achieved in its first half century. The country has moved forward, a role model of positive transformation while continuing to grapple with political and governance challenges as a vibrant, independent nation, he said. "I am happy to reflect on Bangladesh's transformation from 'one of the world's poorest countries' into 'one of the world's fastest-growing economies' and the UK's part in that story," said the High Commissioner highlighting a new era of "Brit Bangla Bondhon". He mentioned RMG powerhouse, a leading contributor to peace and security, especially as a provider of troops to UN peacekeeping missions, and one of the most influential global voices on climate change, as they have just seen at COP26 in Glasgow as some of the few achievements. "The UK is proud to be a friend of Bangladesh through all this. We look forward to strengthening these bonds of kinship and culture through the dynamism of our strong people to people links, for the next 50 years and beyond," Dickson said in a message on the 50th anniversary of the Bangladesh-UK's diplomatic relationship on Friday. Modern links between the UK and Bangladesh include trade and investment, the British Bangladeshi contribution to the UK National Health Service, education, development, defence, culture, cricket and curry, he said, adding that they share a mutual vision of a modern 21st century partnership bound by strong historical ties. On this day, 50 years ago, the UK and Bangladesh established the diplomatic relationship. On behalf of the UK, High Commissioner Dickson congratulated the people and the government of Bangladesh on this historic anniversary of a new era of "Brit-Bangla Bondhon". As British High commissioner in Bangladesh, he feels proud that the UK played such a key role in Bangladesh's founding story. Before Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman set foot in his liberated homeland, his historic trip to the UK in January 1972 and his meeting with UK Prime Minister Edward Heath forged a new friendship and accelerated the recognition of Bangladesh as an independent nation. This historic moment encouraged Commonwealth countries to recognise Bangladesh. "I also recall Her Majesty's Government's humanitarian relief contributions to a rising Bangladesh before, during and after the liberation war," said the High Commissioner. In fact, the UK was one of the largest donors for humanitarian relief support to the people of Bangladesh in 1971, reflecting strong public support in the UK for the liberation cause, he said. "All this laid the foundations for a unique and lasting relationship between the UK and Bangladesh." With the establishment of a British High Commission in Dhaka, the then UK Foreign Secretary Sir Alec Douglas-Home visited Bangladesh in 1972. Since then, the UK has been a committed partner of this country in research, health services and community development, disaster risk reduction, poverty alleviation, improving education, increasing life expectancy for women and children, and womens' empowerment. "And all this has helped the country's remarkable progress over the last 50 years," said the High Commissioner. As Bangladesh continued to grow as an independent nation through the mid-1970s, the UK began to diversify its cooperation. "We helped with capacity building for Bangladesh military staff, police, and government officials. In 1977, the UK supported Bangladesh in setting up a Military Staff College at Savar. In 1978, the then UK Prime Minister James Callaghan visited Bangladesh," Dickson said. Many Bangladeshis made the UK their home, and after five decades, with around 600,000 people of Bangladeshi origin living in the UK, the relationship between the British and Bangladeshi peoples is deeper and stronger than ever, he said. Queen Elizabeth II came to Bangladesh in 1983, when she travelled by train to visit a model village 35 miles south of Dhaka. Since that event, several Royal family members including the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal, and Prime Ministers including John Major, Tony Blair and David Cameron have visited Bangladesh to witness a rising country. "Through this time, the relationship has deepened, reflecting keen UK interest as Bangladesh has pursued recovery from poverty, floods, and devastating cyclones," said the High Commissioner. \</doc>

Feb. 11\'e2\€  Ho Chi Minh City(Vietnam News/ANN) \'e2\€  Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam, together with Australia, officially took the charge as the co-chair of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)-run Southeast Asia Regional Programme (SEARP) for 2022-2025 during the second Ministerial Conference of the SEARP in Seoul on Wednesday. Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam and Australia succeeded Thailand and the Republic of Korea (RoK) for the position. Addressing the conference, which gathered ministers and heads of delegations from 38 OECD member economies and ASEAN member countries, as well as the OECD Secretary General, the ASEAN Secretary General and leaders of many international organisations, RoK Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong stressed that ASEAN is one of the focuses of his country's New Southern Policy. The RoK will continue to strengthen cooperation with the bloc to make more contributions to the building of a greener, smarter and more inclusive ASEAN, he stated. OECD Secretary General Mathias Cormann affirmed that ASEAN is a strategic priority area, underlining that the organisation hopes to promote cooperation with and support for ASEAN member countries in economic reform and getting closer to OECD standards. As part of the conference, the leaders of ASEAN and OECD signed a memorandum of understanding on cooperation across 31 areas. The deal creates an important framework for elevating the partnership between the two organisations. During the conference, participants discussed the building of a greener, smarter ASEAN for an inclusive future, and the ensuring of green recovery towards a more self-resilient ASEAN. Addressing the event, Vietnamese Foreign Minister B\'c3\'b9i Thanh S\'c6\£1n proposed three cooperation areas to further strengthen the OECD-ASEAN partnership. He suggested that the OECD continue to support and give policy consultations to ASEAN and regional countries in digital transformation. He said that the OECD and its members should increase assistance to ASEAN in implementing the ASEAN Comprehensive Recovery Framework, the ASEAN Industry 4.0 Strategy, and the ASEAN Digital Masterplan 2025 and other action programmes related to digital transformation. S\'c6\£1n underlined the need to ensure all people benefit from digitalisation, are trained and gain access to digital technologies. He also expressed a hope that the OECD will assist ASEAN in developing a low-carbon economy and implementing commitments made at the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ), heading to a greener and more sustainable future. The Vietnamese diplomat also proposed that the OECD and its members help Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam in developing digital economy and realising the National Programme on Digital Transformation to 2030 and reaching the target of digital economy contributing 20 per cent of GDP in 2025 and 30 per cent in 2030. Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam also hopes to receive support in transforming the growth model and investing more in renewable energy, high technology and high-quality human resources training. The ministers adopted a joint statement on the people-oriented future \'e2\€  partnership for a smarter, greener and more inclusive ASEAN. Speaking after the ceremony to take over the position of the SEARP co-chair, S\'c6\£1n pledged that Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam will work closely with Australia, the OECD and other members to continue promoting SEARP operations to make more contributions to regional economic recovery and development with a consistent policy of placing the people at the centre of the process. On the sidelines of the conference, S\'c6\£1n had meetings with OECD Secretary General Mathias Cormann and State Secretary and Acting Minister for Development Cooperation of Slovenia Stanislav Rascan. Cormann congratulated Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam on the country's socio-economic achievements. He expressed his belief that with its role and position in the region, Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam, together with Australia, will make contributions to the promotion of SEARP operations. He vowed that the OECD and its members will accompany Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam in efforts to recover the economy, transform the growth model and speed up digital transformation, reaching the goal of fast and sustainable development. Meanwhile, at their meeting, S\'c6\£1n and Rascan pledged to promote the practical and all-round partnership between Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam and Slovenia, especially in trade and investment, while strengthening coordination and mutual support at multilateral forums and mechanisms. \'e2\€  VNS ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 5 -- Speakers at a webinar have urged the government to set the renewable energy as a priority sector to scale up its use saying that policy support is instrumental for its development. "There're huge potentials for renewable energy, especially solar power, for different sectors, including irrigation, and motor vehicle recharging," said Munawar Misbah Moin, Vice President of Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association (BSREA). The BSREA, a platform of private operators in solar and renewable energy business, organised the seminar titled "Energy Access & Resilience of Bangladesh - Potentials and Challenges" with its president Dipal Barua in the chair. The organizers said the seminar was arranged in order to send its outcomes to the "Blue Zone", the window and connector of people to COP26 . Chairman of Bangladesh Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (Sreda) Mohammad Aladdin and Energypac CEO and director Nurul Aktar also addressed the seminar. BSREA general secretary Data Magfur conducted the event. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

The expectations from the just concluded COP26 were sky high. In my opinion, however, it was neither a success nor a failure and concluded somewhere in between. All countries have agreed that restricting global warming below 1.5 degrees C was the main focus of the conference in Glasgow, yet the 20 main polluters did not announce any definite plan for reducing emissions. These countries contribute around 80% of the global emission. There is no alternative to adoption of an ambitious emission reduction plan by G20 countries for achieving the global emission cut target - from 50 giga tonnes to 32 giga tonnes by 2030. This commitment was absent in COP26 . The Glasgow climate conference has just concluded. How would you evaluate its achievements or failures? Mixed reactions and observations have been sounded since the conclusion of the COP26 . Few found some achievements, but others termed it non-conclusive and a failure. From my past 20 years of experience as a negotiator, I can term it at best something between success and failure. Success is very limited in agreed actions for reducing global GHG emissions. I expected an ambitious program for mitigation, but it was not reflected in the NDCs submitted by the countries. Based on the decisions, it would not be possible to restrict global warming below 1.5 degrees C. The increase has already reached 1.1 degrees C. The warming would reach 2.7 degrees C even if it is possible to implement all the NDCs submitted to the UNFCCC. This is a global average. Catastrophic disasters would be triggered if temperature increases further in the tropical countries. There is nothing to mention about climate finance at all. However, some better commitments have been tabled. The G20 countries who are major contributors to global emission did not come up with ambitious plans. Two fast growing economies - China and India - mentioned that they would endeavor to reach Net Zero by 2060 and 2070 respectively. The Paris Rule Book could be finalized with Carbon Market Mechanism. There is no barrier now to implement the Paris Agreement. What are your views? Finally, the Paris Rule Book could be completed after 5 years of protracted discussion through finalization of the article 6. It is undoubtedly a major milestone achievement. Developed countries earlier did not show any positive interest about discussing the loss and damage issue. But this time under the Santiago Network, some positive discussions could be held. How do you look at it? Commitments for US$ 4.0 million have been achieved to start works on loss and damage under the Santiago Network. I believe more funds would come. Loss and Damage would get stronger support in COP27. This time all agreed that this is not a problem which is unique to the developing world only, it is also a threat for the developed world as well. In the earlier COP, the IPCC reports were not taken into cognizance, but this time the reports were taken into active consideration. That is why limiting global warming below 1.5 Degrees C received prime importance. It is a positive development, according to most. What is your opinion? Yes, positive discussions have been initiated. The IPCC report has elaborately discussed and put forward the consequent impacts of global warming if it goes unrestricted. That is why Loss and Damage came as an important agenda. Phase Down has been agreed about coal use. Though Phase Out was originally proposed. It is a very difficult position in environmental diplomacy. On one side you have low-income countries and on the other the largest economies. India said they would Phase Down as they need to continue using coal. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia is mainly an oil-using economy. Nothing much has been talked about natural gas. That is why all arguments were made as to why coal should be the only target among all fossil fuels. Why would oil and natural gas not also come under discussions? Saudi Arabia is happier than others sensing that coal could be targeted. Gas and oil remained untouched. These two fossil fuels must also come under discussion. Inefficient subsidy on fossil fuel must also be stopped. Discussions were extensive but no action plans could be worked out. Hence, I am not very optimistic about the success as I mentioned earlier as well. Ambitious NDCs required for reducing emissions by 45% in 2030 were not received. Are you optimistic about it? Funding inefficiency of fossil fuel means funding problems, not solutions. In future COPs, more stresses would be there for reducing fossil fuel use. Developed and underdeveloped countries provide subsidies. Total amount of subsidy is over US$ 0.5 trillion. Both developed and underdeveloped countries have fossil fuel based power generation. Fossil fuel lobbies are also very influential. Still some strong lobbies are active against ambitious mitigation plans. But stronger pressures can be created if environment activists, civil societies and youth movements can actively channelize their programs. The IPCC is stressing upon reducing emissions by 45% by 2030. The present total global emission is 50 giga tonnes. By any means it needs to be brought below 32 giga tonnes. 197 countries have agreed but 20 major polluters have to take the main initiatives. These countries together contribute around 80% of the global emissions. The main challenge is making them agree. I am not much hopeful at this stage. Bangladesh has no obligation for reducing carbon emission. Even then it has submitted NDC for reducing carbon emission by 90 million tonnes from 2012 level by 2030. This has created an obligation for implementing it. How would you evaluate it? Bangladesh desires to lead climate negotiation. Hence such plan is courageous despite of not having obligation. We can request other countries to replicate this. If proceeded in a planned manner, it is achievable without much difficulty. Energy and power are the main focus areas for implementation of the NDC targets. But cost of energy would increase for non-carbonized energy use. What kind of impediments the higher energy price may create in transition to developed economy? I do not believe that higher energy cost would impede development. If we can ensure Energy Efficiency and Conservation by adopting advanced technologies, we can achieve up to 6.73% or more of the unconditional reduction commitment. The target set in the Bangladesh's NDC is very much pragmatic. We can achieve even higher if all stakeholders remain committed for it. But much would depend on all out implementation success of the government. We can become a reduction model as we actually do not have obligation for it. We have to focus on non-carbon energy. We could not achieve much in Renewable Energy. RE contributes about 3% of our total generation capacity now. In a country like Bangladesh where competing priorities, huge unmet demand exist, higher targets for RE must be set and focus must be diverted. The Mujib perspective plan has a target of 40% by 2041. I am not sure whether achieving 40% by 2041 would be possible. But we must keep plugging away. Nuclear energy is definitely costlier than RE, the cost of which has become lower than fossil fuel these days. Of course, nuclear is an option for Bangladesh. If we think about 8-9% sustainable GDP growth, demand growth of energy would also commensurate with it. In Bangladesh, truly speaking, very few major options are available than nuclear power. But the cost of power would increase. The impacts need to be kept under control through ensuring efficiency at all segments of the value chain. What is your opinion about Bangladesh's moving out of coal? The world did not agree to phasing out, rather it said phasing down. This means coal use would continue. What is your opinion? It would not be a wise decision for Bangladesh moving out of coal too soon. Coal producing and coal using countries are caring less about global concerns. Our coal use only marginal not even at Nano level. We must not compromise our growth. Huge number of population is still not satisfied with energy supply scenario. We must adopt options which would ensure supplying power and energy at affordable cost. We cannot yet rule out coal use completely. Even if Bangladesh cannot use any coal annually, it would make no visible impact on global emission. How would you evaluate Glasgow Climate Pact? What preparations should be taken for encountering challenges in COP27? We need to do much better homework for COP27. We negotiate among LDCs. African groups undertake better homework. But they do less intellectual exercise. We cannot dictate negotiation. Our only power is intellectual power. We only carry out 1-2 meetings before negotiation. We prepare traditional country paper. We need analytical exercise. We can propose idea. Innovation of ideas comes in the first session. We can propose new and innovative ideas there. Financing is a major issue for achieving climate targets. But US$100 billion target could not be achieved in COP26 . Will it be achieved by 2023? What would be the situation by 2025? I am not much optimistic. Per Copenhagen Commitment, we should have had US$100 billion by 2020. There is a promise that by 2023 it would happen. The Glasgow Pact provides for setting target of additional fund by 2025. Discussion for charting out new road map beyond 2025 would be discussed at COP27. I have reasonable doubt whether US$100 billion would be accumulated by 2023. Again this fund has to be outside the commitments of developed countries. The main issues are how much fund is coming? How and to whom these are being disbursed? OECD claims US$79 billion has been provided in 2018. OXFAM report mentioned about US$19-22 billion. Will the climate fund turn into an instrument to control developing countries? We cannot completely rule out such possibility. But I am optimistic about Bangladesh handling it properly. Only 15% for us come from external sources. Internal resources contribute about 85%. More than 85% is allocated in ADP. Voice of Bangladesh must grow louder. It is possible. We do not need depending much on international support. For this our voice needs growing louder. Foreign assistance now contributes a mere 1% now in national development. We do not need it even if we can control wastages. We have to plug leakages and corruptions. Our per capita income is growing. CVF was the driver of the pressure group this time. Many thought the dynamic diplomatic acumen of Bangladesh Prime Minister was instrumental for this. What are your views? Of course, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina played a major role. Her leadership was exemplary and encouraging. Whatever achievement has been made in Loss and Damage is mainly due to initiatives of CVF. PM's leadership has given CVF a huge boost. It has to be further strengthened. What kind of preparations Bangladesh should take for getting finance from Green Climate Fund and other sources for mitigation? Unfortunately, we could not make much headway yet. Building capacity is our dedicated mission. Business as usual strategy would not work. We must focus on target. There is no dearth of international fund. We have to prepare bankable projects and approach with positive initiatives. \</doc>

Dhaka, Feb. 5 -- British High Commissioner to Bangladesh Robert Chatterton Dickson has said the world, today, looks with admiration at what Bangladesh has achieved in its first half century. The country has moved forward, a role model of positive transformation while continuing to grapple with political and governance challenges as a vibrant, independent nation, he said, reports UNB. "I am happy to reflect on Bangladesh's transformation from "one of the world's poorest countries" into "one of the world's fastest-growing economies" and the UK's part in that story," said the High Commissioner highlighting a new era of "Brit Bangla Bondhon". He mentioned RMG powerhouse, a leading contributor to peace and security, especially as a provider of troops to UN peacekeeping missions, and one of the most influential global voices on climate change, as they have just seen at COP26 in Glasgow as some of the few achievements. "The UK is proud to be a friend of Bangladesh through all this. We look forward to strengthening these bonds of kinship and culture through the dynamism of our strong people to people links, for the next 50 years and beyond," Dickson said in a message on the 50th anniversary of the Bangladesh-UK's diplomatic relationship on Friday. Modern links between the UK and Bangladesh include trade and investment, the British Bangladeshi contribution to the UK National Health Service, education, development, defence, culture, cricket and curry, he said, adding that they share a mutual vision of a modern 21st century partnership bound by strong historical ties. On this day, 50 years ago, the UK and Bangladesh established the diplomatic relationship. On behalf of the UK, High Commissioner Dickson congratulated the people and the government of Bangladesh on this historic anniversary of a new era of "Brit-Bangla Bondhon". As British High commissioner in Bangladesh, he feels proud that the UK played such a key role in Bangladesh's founding story. Before Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman set foot in his liberated homeland, his historic trip to the UK in January 1972 and his meeting with UK Prime Minister Edward Heath forged a new friendship and accelerated the recognition of Bangladesh as an independent nation. This historic moment encouraged Commonwealth countries to recognise Bangladesh. "I also recall Her Majesty's Government's humanitarian relief contributions to a rising Bangladesh before, during and after the liberation war," said the High Commissioner. In fact, the UK was one of the largest donors for humanitarian relief support to the people of Bangladesh in 1971, reflecting strong public support in the UK for the liberation cause, he said. "All this laid the foundations for a unique and lasting relationship between the UK and Bangladesh." With the establishment of a British High Commission in Dhaka, the then UK Foreign Secretary Sir Alec Douglas-Home visited Bangladesh in 1972. Since then, the UK has been a committed partner of this country in research, health services and community development, disaster risk reduction, poverty alleviation, improving education, increasing life expectancy for women and children, and womens' empowerment. "And all this has helped the country's remarkable progress over the last 50 years," said the High Commissioner. As Bangladesh continued to grow as an independent nation through the mid-1970s, the UK began to diversify its cooperation. "We helped with capacity building for Bangladesh military staff, police, and government officials. In 1977, the UK supported Bangladesh in setting up a Military Staff College at Savar. In 1978, the then UK Prime Minister James Callaghan visited Bangladesh," Dickson said. Many Bangladeshis made the UK their home, and after five decades, with around 600,000 people of Bangladeshi origin living in the UK, the relationship between the British and Bangladeshi peoples is deeper and stronger than ever, he said. Queen Elizabeth II came to Bangladesh in 1983, when she travelled by train to visit a model village 35 miles south of Dhaka. Since that event, several Royal family members including the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal, and Prime Ministers including John Major, Tony Blair and David Cameron have visited Bangladesh to witness a rising country. "Through this time, the relationship has deepened, reflecting keen UK interest as Bangladesh has pursued recovery from poverty, floods, and devastating cyclones," said the High Commissioner.

Dhaka, Nov. 25 -- The planet is already 1.1degC warmer than in pre-industrial times. July 2021 was the hottest month ever recorded in 142 years. Despite the pandemic slowdown, 2020 was the hottest year so far, ending the warmest decade (2011-2020) ever. Betrayal in Glasgow Summing up widespread views of the recently concluded Glasgow climate summit, former Irish President Mary Robinson observed, "People will see this as a historically shameful dereliction of duty,. nowhere near enough to avoid climate disaster". A hundred civil society groups lambasted the Glasgow outcome: "Instead of a multilateral agreement that puts forward a clear path to address the climate crisis, we are left with a document that takes us further down the path of climate injustice." Even if countries fulfil their Paris Agreement pledges, global warming is now expected to rise by 2.7degC from pre-industrial levels by century's end. Authoritative projections suggest that if all COP26 long-term pledges and targets are met, the planet will still warm by 2.1? by 2100. The United Nations Environment Programme suggests a strong chance of global warming disastrously rising over 1.5degC in the next two decades. Earlier policy targets - to halve global carbon emissions by 2030, and reach 'net-zero' emissions by 2050 - are now recognized as inadequate. The Glasgow UN Framework Convention on Climate Change 26th Conference of Parties ( COP26 ) was touted as the world's 'last best hope' to save the planet. Many speeches cited disturbing trends, but national leaders most responsible for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions offered little. Thus, developing countries were betrayed yet again. Despite contributing less to accelerating global warming, they are suffering its worst consequences. They have been left to pay most bills for 'losses and damages', adaptation and mitigation. Glasgow setbacks Glasgow's two biggest hopes were not realized: renewing targets for 2030 aligned with limiting warming to 1.5?, and a clear strategy to mobilize the grossly inadequate US$100bn yearly - promised by rich country leaders before the Copenhagen COP in 2009 - to help finance developing countries' efforts. An exasperated African legislator dismissed the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use as an "empty pledge", as "yet another example of Western disingenuousness . taking on the role of 'white saviour'" while exploiting the African rain forest. Meanwhile, far too many loopholes open to abuse remain, undermining efforts to reduce emissions. Further, no commitment to end fossil fuel subsidies globally - at US$11 million every minute, i.e., around US$6 trillion annually - was forthcoming. No new oil and gas fields should be developed for the world to have a chance of getting to net-zero by 2050. Nevertheless, governments are still approving such projects, typically involving transnational corporate giants. Various measures - e.g., 'carbon capture and storage' and 'offsetting' - have been touted as solutions. But carbon capture and storage technologies remain controversial, unproven at scale, expensive and rarely cost-competitive. The Glasgow outcome did not include any commitment to fully phase out oil and gas. Meanwhile, the language on coal has been diluted to become virtually toothless: coal-powered plants will now be 'phased down', instead of 'phased out'. Offsets off track Offset market advocates claim to reduce emissions or remove GHGs from the atmosphere by some to 'off-set' emissions by others. Thus, offsetting often means paying someone poor to cut GHG emissions or forcing them to pay someone else to do so. With more means, big business can more easily afford to 'greenwash'. Carbon offset markets have long overpromised, but underdelivered. As they typically exaggerate GHG emission reduction claims, offsetting is a poor substitute for actually cutting fossil fuel use. Meanwhile, disagreements over offset rules have long stalled international climate change negotiations. Buying offsets allows GHG emitters "to keep polluting", albeit for a fee. Highly GHG emitting activities by wealthier individuals, companies and nations can thus continue, after "transferring the burden of action and sacrifice to others" - typically to those in poorer nations - via the market. For Tariq Fancy - who managed 'sustainable investing' at BlackRock, the world's largest fund manager - the market for offsets is a "deadly distraction", "leading the world into a dangerous mirage, . burning valuable time". Meanwhile, most established offset programmes - e.g., the United Nations' REDD+ programme or the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism - have clearly failed to meaningfully reduce GHG emissions. More than 130 countries have committed to achieve net-zero by 2050. But net-zero targeting has actually allowed the world to continue kicking the can down the road, instead of acting decisively and urgently to verifiably cut GHG emissions. Hence, it is seen as a cynical "scam", "nothing more than an expensive cover-up for continued toxic emissions". Trading non-verifiable offsets - supposedly to achieve net-zero - allows continuing GHG emissions with business almost as usual. Loss and damage? Vulnerable and poor nations have argued for decades that rich countries owe them compensation for irreversible damage from global warming. In fact, no UN climate conference has delivered any funding for losses and damages to countries affected. Rich countries agreed to begin a 'dialogue' to discuss "arrangements for the funding of activities to avert, minimize and address loss and damage". Representing developing nations, Guinea expressed "extreme disappointment" at this ruse to delay progress on financing recovery from and rebuilding after climate disasters. Developed nations account for two-thirds of cumulative emissions compared to only 3% from Africa. Carbon emissions by the wealthiest 1% of the world's population were more than twice those of the bottom half between 1990 and 2015! Low-lying small island nations - from the Marshall Islands to Fiji and Antigua - fear losing much of their land to rising sea levels. But their longstanding call to create a 'loss and damage' fund was rejected yet again. South Pacific island representatives have expressed disappointment at lack of funding for losses and damages, and the watered down language on coal. For them, COP26 was a 'monumental failure', leaving them in existential peril. Although historical responsibility for GHG emissions lies primarily with the wealthy countries, especially the US and the European Union, once again, they have successfully evaded serious commitments to address such longstanding problems due to global warming. Climate injustice For the UN Secretary-General, "[o]ver the past 25 years, the richest 10% of the global population has been responsible for more than half of all carbon emissions, and the poorest 50% were responsible for just 7% of emissions". The World Bank estimates that, if left unchecked, climate change will condemn 132 million more people into poverty over the next decade, while displacing more than 216 million from their homes and land by 2050.

Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen has called upon the UK government to review the red-listing travel restrictions on Bangladesh and remove it from the red list. 'Given Bangladesh's robust vaccine rollout and significant reductions in covid infection to 9.82% and sufferings of more than 7,000 British-Bangladeshis currently stranded in Bangladesh, the UK should consider removing Bangladesh from the covid red-list countries," he said. The Foreign Minister made the call during a bilateral meeting with his British counterpart Dominic Raab on Monday. Bangladesh High Commissioner to the UK Saida Muna Tasneem joined the meeting which was earlier rescheduled due to Foreign Secretary Raab's emergency visit to Qatar in the wake of the Afghan crisis. British Secretary of State Raab assured the Bangladesh Foreign Minister that Britain does appreciate politically the overall pressure on the government regarding red-listing and remains well aware of the decreasing covid infections in Bangladesh. Such decisions are, however, reviewed by the Public Health Experts on a regular basis. "I would like to assure that given the long-standing friendship between our two countries, and based on more frequent genomic sequencing data-uploading by Bangladesh, the British government will review Bangladesh red list," Raab was quoted as saying. During their first official bilateral meeting, the two Foreign Ministers reaffirmed the historic and value-based relations between Bangladesh and the UK since Bangladesh's Liberation War in 1971. They agreed to jointly celebrate the 50th anniversary of Bangladesh-UK diplomatic relations through exchange of high-level visits and charting an ambitious and ever-expanding Bangladesh-UK post-Brexit strategic partnership. Discussing the protracted Rohingya crisis and stalemate in the process of safe and sustainable returns, Foreign Minister Momen gave historic references to earlier repatriation of Rohingyas by Myanmar. He urged the British Foreign Secretary to create pressure on Myanmar for immediate repatriation of their Rohingyas from Bangladesh. Mentioning the concern of the British government on the current political turmoil in Myanmar, Dominic Raab reiterated UK's continued commitment to resolve the Rohingya crisis and that together with the Asean and fellow G7 countries, the UK would put increased pressure on Myanmar for a sustainable resolution of the Rohingya crisis. Both the ministers expressed deep concern at the current Afghan situation and agreed to work closely to restore regional peace, security and stability. Dr Momen said Bangladesh remains deeply committed to maintaining regional peace and security and would continue to stand next to the people of Afghanistan whose voice should be heard for a sustainable future of their country. Dhaka urges London to remove Bangladesh from red-list countries On post-Brexit trade relations with the UK, one of Bangladesh's largest trade and investment partners, Foreign Minister Momen sought an extension of the UK's zero-duty GSP facility until 2029, especially given the losses suffered by Bangladesh apparel industry owing to post-pandemic cancellations and non-payments by UK retailers. Citing countries which have already taken dedicated SEZs in Bangladesh, including Saudi Arabia, Japan, India, China and South Korea, the Foreign Minister offered a dedicated SEZ for British investors. He invited fresh investments in the IT and green RMG and apparel industry, as well as offshore solar and wind power plants, electric vehicles and batteries, electric public transport and railway sectors. Dhaka urges London to remove Bangladesh from red-list countries On climate change, Dr Momen recalled his recent meeting with COP26 President Alok Sharma and reiterated Bangladesh's request as the CVF President participation of Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the CVF- COP26 Leaders Dialogue during the COP26 Leaders' Summit in Glasgow. The Foreign Minister briefed Secretary Raab on Bangladesh and CVF's priorities and expectations at the COP26 and praised UK leadership for duly addressing the important issue of loss and damage at Glasgow. Commending Bangladesh as a climate leader and its proactive CVF Presidency role, the British Foreign Secretary called upon Bangladesh to declare a net-zero by 2050 and a transition to clean energy. Foreign Minister Momen called for immediate transfer of appropriate technologies, large investments and financing from developed countries, especially the UK, for Bangladesh's transition to a low carbon economy by 2050. \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 10 -- Global carbon emissions have rapidly rebounded, with economic recovery following pandemic shutdowns, and are already close to pre-Covid levels. As climate meetings continue at COP26 Glasgow, a report from the Global Carbon Project finds emissions from coal and gas use have grown more in 2021 than they fell in 2020. Meanwhile carbon pricing has been promoted as one of the principal, one-size-fits-all, means to address CO2 emissions. The European Union (EU) President urged at COP26 , "Put a price on carbon, nature cannot pay". Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined forces at COP26 to advocate for a global minimum carbon tax. Businesses are also rallying behind carbon pricing at the COP26 summit to agree on a "effective and fair" level for carbon pricing. However, none says how the revenues raised through such a global minimum carbon tax would be distributed between countries, or to support poorer countries' adaptation and mitigation efforts. Therefore, poorer countries can be justifiably sceptical, especially when rich countries have already failed to fulfil their promise of US$100 billion a year climate financing support, and such a uniform tax is likely to affect them disproportionately. CARBON PRICING SILVER BULLET: Carbon pricing currently covers about 22 per cent of greenhouse gases produced globally. In theory, carbon pricing works by capturing the external costs of emitting carbon -- i.e., the costs that the public pays, such as loss of property due to rising sea levels, the damage to crops caused by changing rainfall patterns, or the health care costs associated with heat waves and droughts -- and forcing the polluter to pay. It is claimed that this market solution is "the most powerful tool" in the climate policy arsenal. It creates a strong price signal that reduces, or regulates, green house gas (GHG) emissions and at the same time provides a robust incentive for shifting investments away from high-emission fossil-fuels based technology towards cleaner technology. However, in practice, the impact is marginal - generally between 0 and 2 per cent reduction in emissions per year. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that emissions must fall by 45 per cent below 2010 levels by 2030 in order to limit warming to 1.5 degC-the goal set by the Paris Agreement. One of the reasons for such marginal impacts is that polluters hardly pay; they easily pass on the cost to users or consumers of energy who must use certain amount of energy regardless of price (in technical terms, "inelastic demand"). Therefore, price incentives alone cannot be relied on to spark the creation of new low-carbon technologies. SYSTEM FAILURE, NOT MARKET FAILURE: Carbon pricing faces five major issues that limit its use for accelerating deep decarbonisation. First, carbon pricing frames climate change as a market failure rather than as a fundamental system problem. Second, it places particular weight on efficiency as opposed to effectiveness, and thus ignores the urgency of the matter. Third, it tends to stimulate the optimisation of existing systems rather than transformation. Fourth, it suggests a universal instead of context-sensitive policy approach. Fifth, it fails to reflect political realities. Research finds that the consumer cost of carbon pricing is globally regressive-it disproportionally affects poorer consumers-and more so in poorer countries. That is, it falls harder on average consumers in poor countries than on poor consumers in average countries. REGRESSIVE FOR POOR COUNTRIES AND THE POOR: The United Nations World Economic and Social Survey (WESS) 2009 argued that a uniform global carbon price, even if it were to be introduced gradually, would be the taxation of developing countries at several times the rate of industrialised countries, measured as a proportion of GDP. Although per capita emissions in developing countries are far low compared with those in industrialised ones, a global uniform carbon price would impose a disproportionate burden of adjustment on developing countries. Moreover, carbon pricing will affect the level and distribution of real household income, both directly through a household's use of fossil fuels and indirectly through the prices of other commodities. A carbon tax has been found to place a disproportionately heavy burden on low-income groups, by raising not only the direct cost of energy, but also prices of all goods in which energy is used. Thus, lower-income households would pay disproportionately more in environmental compliance costs. It is suggested that undesired distributional effects can be avoided by either introducing differentiated pricing by, for example, increasing prices commensurate with the amount of energy used (like progressive taxation), or by compensatory mechanisms, such as subsidies for lower-income groups or cash transfers. However, such compensatory mechanisms can be administratively burdensome for poorer countries, especially in countries with weak taxation and rudimentary social assistance or protection systems. Targeting particular segments of the population has proven to be challenging, and administrative progress is needed in building social assistance programmes covering the entire poor and vulnerable population. TRANSITING TO RENEWABLE ENERGY: A more credible solution to cutting carbon emissions remained in government investment and "old fashioned industrial policy" that promoted clean energy. This means huge investments in solar, hydro and wind energy as well as public transportation. Given the initial high cost and low return, public investment has to play the leading role. Most developing countries lack the fiscal capacity to undertake such huge public investment programmes. Therefore, substantial increases in compensatory financing, official development lending and assistance are needed for developing countries to increase their fiscal space. Carbon taxation would therefore need to be in the first instance an instrument for providing incentives towards mitigation in advanced countries and a source of financing of climate-related programmes of action, including in developing countries. Potentially, carbon tax could yield significant resources to cover international funding requirements. The World Bank's former chief economist, Nicholas Stern, estimated that with a carbon price of US$50 per ton of CO2, renewable energy like onshore wind would be roughly competitive with dirty coal; and without a carbon price, wind would be competitive with coal and gas if oil prices were US$150 a barrel. Even without a market-determined carbon price, taxing GHG emitting sources of energy would help make renewable sources economically more attractive. A tax of US$50 per ton, through which many renewables would become economically viable, could mobilise US$500 billion in resources annually and suffice to cover part of the mitigation costs. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates a fund of US$10 billion a year - equivalent to about 01 per cent of the revenues from a US$50 price on G20 carbon emissions. The IMF further estimates that the global carbon price of about US$75 a ton would be needed to reduce emissions enough to keep global warming below 2degC. However, only about one-fifth of global emissions are covered by pricing programmes, and the global average price is only US$3 a ton. There are powerful fossil-fuel corporate interests who make sure that the price is not high enough that may force users find alternative cheaper sources of energy. Thus, the price signals to the market from existing carbon pricing policies are "modest and less ambitious" than they could be. Carbon taxes will not provide an unlimited source of funding and will drop off as GHG emissions are effectively reduced to low levels. Nevertheless, in the initial stages, they may play an important role in sourcing a substantial part of the investment costs of the big push that needs to be accomplished in the coming decades. ONE-SIZE WILL NOT FIT ALL: Much of the discussion of the climate challenge in developed countries is focused on the relative efficacy of alternative ways of establishing a carbon price. The mix in developing countries is likely to be different, with a much larger role for public investment and targeted industrial policies. All policy instruments, ranging from price incentives, taxes and subsidies to regulation, and encompassing fiscal, monetary and financial measures as well, should be fully used as part of the tool kit to meet climate change challenges. Given the complexities of the issue alternative approaches that target fundamental transformations of existing socio-technical systems, such as energy, mobility, or food (i.e., "sustainability transitions") need to be explored. This may entail a mix of contextually and politically sensitive policies that simultaneously drive low-carbon innovation and the decline of fossil fuels. It is of utmost importance to take into account the institutional limitations of developing, especially least developed countries (LDCs) when considering introducing carbon pricing and revenue recycling from carbon tax. Bilateral and multilateral development cooperation are critical if the international community wants to include more poorer countries or LDCs in the worldwide effort to limit global warming. Unfortunately, the international community has so far failed to adequately support developing countries.

<doc ID="COP26_Bangladesh196" COP="COP26" country="Bangladesh" date="November 4, 2021 Thursday"source="The Financial Express (Bangladesh)" >
Dhaka, Nov. 4 -- With little progress made so far since 2015's Paris Agreement towards cutting carbon emissions, it cannot be said that the ongoing Glasgow climate summit, COP26 , did begin with high hopes. Even so, more than 100 world leaders on the third day of the climate summit reached an agreement to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. Also, in another event, 105 nations made a Global Methane Pledge whereby by 2030 the signatories would reduce their methane emissions by 30 per cent. If implemented as pledged, these two climate actions have the potential to have a cooling effect on the fast rising trend in global warming. But sceptics are not convinced for the simple reason that the world's leading contributors to the global warming have never delivered on their previous commitments. They did not even honour the legally binding Paris Agreement which required its 196 signatory nations to limit global rise in temperature below 2.0 degree Celsius, preferably at 1.5 degrees Celsius, above the pre-industrial level. To achieve this long-term temperature goal, nations would have to make the effort to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as soon as possible in order to achieve a climate neutral world by the middle of 21st century. Unfortunately, the nations remained oblivious of the Paris treaty over the last six years. So, what can one expect from the agreement to 'halt and reverse deforestation' reached by the nations that are home to 85 per cent of the world's forests? The question arises because the fate of a similar commitment made under the 'New York Declaration on Forests (NYDF)' at the 2014's UN climate summit in New York is still fresh in memory. In fact, seven years on since the declaration was made, none of the governments endorsing it has been found to have fulfilled their responsibilities. Against this backdrop, it is hard to blame those who might take these two climate action pledges in question with a grain of salt. Interestingly, of the nations endorsing such climate deals, the developing and the least developed ones are in the majority. And for any failure of such climate deals, they have also to shoulder the responsibility, though their share of GHG emissions is negligible. Obviously, the onus of implementing the agreements lies mainly on the rich, industrialised nations. Thankfully, in recognition of the developing nations' climate vulnerability, the rich nations at the 2009's Copenhagen climate summit pledged for them US$100 billion every year by 2020. As expected, the fund was meant to help the developing nations so they may adapt to climate change and mitigate further rise in temperature. But again, the rich nations during the last 12 years have shown no progress on delivering on the promised climate finance. Now that the world leaders have left the venue, the tasks of addressing the issue of unmet climate finance promise, the various other lacunae of the Paris agreement and so on fall on the negotiating teams. Needless to say, a developing nation like Bangladesh, which is exposed to the worst effects of the climate change, has a huge stake in these negotiations. As the current chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), Bangladesh has a responsibility to see to it that that the rich nations fulfil their climate-specific pledges. For example, Bangladeshis are in urgent need of the rich nations' support in terms of finance and green technology so that the people of the southern coastal districts may adapt to climate change impacts and survive. Hopefully, Bangladesh's negotiating team at COP26 are up to the challenge. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

<doc ID="COP26_Bangladesh197" COP="COP26" country="Bangladesh" date="Energy & Power"source=" " >
Bangladesh's economy is booming, and it was one of the countries with the fastest GDP growth in the world in 2019. Bangladesh is on its way to becoming a middle-income country, with the goal of being a developed country by 2041. Even the COVID-19 pandemic did not affect Bangladesh as much as it did in neighboring countries and similar economies. Bangladesh has weathered the worst fallout of the pandemic in 2020 and is well on its way to recover by 2022. According to the 2016 Power Sector Master Plan (PSMP)[1], total new installation capacity would reach 55,138 MW by 2041. This indicates that an average of more than 2000 MW of capacity will have to be added annually over the next 20 years to meet the expected demand until 2041. Due to the tonal shifts in the global economy in a post COVID-19 world and the gradual decline of the fossil fuel industry, including a shift away from coal all around the world, Bangladesh also changed its stance by canceling major coal power projects in favor of Renewable Energy (RE)[2] and Cross-Border power trading. Bangladesh will diversify its power mix, lower the risks associated with variable fossil fuel prices, reduce the negative environmental impacts of fossil-fuel-powered generation, and remain competitive in global markets by switching to clean energy. According to the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) and Power Cell, Bangladesh had 22,391 MW of mostly grid-connected and some off-grid RE installed capacity as of September 15, 2021,[3] with natural gas accounting for 50.7%, diesel and furnace oil accounting for 32.8%, coal accounting for 7.9% and renewable accounting for 3.5% of installed capacity.[4] It is worth pointing out that there is more than 3,000 MW of gas-based auto generation in industries known as 'Captive Generation'. These are not connected to the grid and are operated by the industries because they consider grid power to be unreliable. The government has a long-term plan to stop captive power generation and bring these industries to the grid. SREDA had originally included captive power to total 11% of the total power capacity mix, which was not considered in this study. At 3.5%, RE consisted of the entire (both grid and off-grid) installed capacity of the Bangladesh power sector, but the fact that 1.1% is hydropower, which has remained static in generation since 1967, there has been very little actual progress. In addition, of the claimed 542 MW in solar power, grid-tied solar parks only contribute 195 MW (see Figure 2). Thus, of the target Bangladesh set itself for 2021 to install 10% of electricity capacity to be renewable, the country could only achieve 3.5%, majority of which is off-grid RE in that mix. Needless to say, Bangladesh has a huge challenge to increase its RE share. RE in Bangladesh is dominated by solar and the 230 MW hydro with other sources being very small in comparison, as shown in Figure 2. In the case of renewable energy, we see that the majority of the country's renewable energy portfolio currently comes from off-grid solar, by virtue of around 6 million solar home systems installed in Bangladeshi households, mostly in rural areas, and the 230 MW Kaptai Hydropower Plant. The true picture of the current state of renewable energy adoption in Bangladesh cannot be ascertained because it is hard to document how many of the solar home systems are currently functional. This puts the 350 MW off-grid renewable energy claim into question. The Kaptai Hydropower Plant which has been around since 1967, is probably the last major hydroelectric source for Bangladesh with virtually no hydro potential of that magnitude available anywhere else. Current Status of Renewable Energy Policies in Bangladesh In recent years, RE has become a key source of new worldwide generation capacity. In the last decade, installed capacity has risen fast, from 1,223 GW in 2010 to 2,799 GW in 2020[1]. In-fact, RE consisted of about 60% of the new power additions in the world in 2020. It is safe to say that globally, research, development, and financial support will come to RE in the coming decades. Bangladesh focused heavily on RE from the first Renewable Energy Policy in 2008. There are two contributing factors to that focus. The first is that Bangladesh is one of the countries that will suffer heavily if international efforts to combat climate change fail; the country is primarily low-lying and flat territory, with around 10% of the area being one meter above mean sea level.[1] Bangladesh has pledged under the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 7% below 'business as usual' levels by 2030, and 17% below 'business as usual' levels if international assistance is available. The second is that Bangladesh also took seriously the effort to diversify its fuel mix moving away from a power system heavy on gas. Although energy diversification at that time focused more on adding baseload power such as coal according to the Power Sector Master Plan PSMP-2010; subsequent revision in PSMP-2016 focused on LNG and cross-border power trading. Private sector interest to invest in RE did not take off until 2011-2012 when the government included utility scale solar park bids under Unsolicited Proposal Policy as part of the Special Act and opened the door for a negotiated tariff. The 2009-2012 period can be considered as the inception phase in the policy landscape of RE development in Bangladesh. The major policies were conceived in the timeline, but the sector did not have any strategic focus. Therefore, private sector participation was scattered and many non-RE and non-power entities showed interest to build solar parks. Eventually, more than 50 Independent Power Producers (IPPs) received the letter of intent (LOI) in utility scale solar plants but they failed to bring most of them to commercial operation. Due to several institutional restrictions in the electricity sector, large-scale RE growth in Bangladesh has been very slow. These restrictions are mainly at the policy level, which makes it very difficult for serious players in the global renewable energy arena to invest in the RE Sector of Bangladesh. Investing in RE in Bangladesh is challenging as is, due to several geographical, economic, institutional, technical and socio-cultural barriers. To ensure a sustainable energy future for the country, it is essential that the sector be accorded a high level of importance and priority by the government with favorable policies and incentives. Leading renewable energy countries like China, India, Germany, and the United States have already undergone a major shift from tax-credit driven investment to mainstream IPPs. For example, in India tax benefit in terms of accelerated depreciation for wind and solar power projects (~100-80% p.a. on the written down value) allowed private sector to enjoy large adjusted gross income and acquiring valuable assets in India.[2] Similarly, governments in Middle Eastern countries, especially in UAE, allocated large amounts of land in their arid region for large scale RE projects, making electricity prices from solar come down to approximately 2 cents per kWh. However, the implications of such drastic cost regimes are not applicable in Bangladesh, where the RE IPPs are required to invest in the entire value chain of RE development, including building and maintaining the transmission line and access. Despite the favorable investment environment, private sector enterprises who were the early adopters in the sector faced several challenges. As a result, the sector achieved slow growth and is still stuck in its nascent stage. The total accumulated investment by 2021 is estimated to be around $100 million[3], which is far below what is required to reach the target planned by the government. So far, most of the projects are IPP-driven, however, there is a trend that government power production companies such as BPDB, EGCB, CPGCBL, and NWPGCL are moving to develop their own solar projects. Table 2 enumerates the few successfully installed and operating projects. The study has revealed numerous obstacles for RE companies in the Private Sector. These challenges pertain more to companies who have submitted a proposal, got an LOI and are waiting for approval. Besides that, acute challenges exist for projects which are currently under development or even running. Some of the major challenges are enumerated in Table 3. SUMMARY of CHALLENGES: Policy Gaps Summarized version of challenges in private sector renewable energy development from a policy lens is provided below - 1. Lack of Strategic Direction: The RE sector in Bangladesh lacks a clear strategic direction in terms of setting targets from specific technologies. Shifting government priorities have seen some technologies (Solar Home Systems, Mini-grid) being hamstrung. Different competing energy sources and power systems are also shifting the government's focus from RE. Fuel Oil-based Quick Rental Power Plants from Small Independent Power Producers are still a major and costly portion of the power mix, and these need to be gradually phased out to make room for RE. 2. Failure of the early unsolicited utility-scale solar projects: Many large utility-scale power projects have failed to come on-stream in time, and the government had to extend the Commercial Operating Date, or allow change of partners, or allow change of locations, etc., to keep the projects alive. Failures of the early unsolicited solar projects have had a negative effect on the government to promote RE. A few bad actors from the early-stage utility-scale projects have deterred the government and private sector investors. Analyses of these failures revealed that the major points of contention were land availability and land acquisition, securing the ROW, and challenges surrounding grid-interconnection. 3. Lack of proper studies, Bankable Data, Regulatory Checklist in the Wind Energy Sector: The Private sector is exposed to a lot of risk in terms of acquiring reliable and authenticated data. There is a dearth of data in terms of land availability, substation load capacity, site specific data, etc. Although the wind energy sector has considerable potential in Bangladesh with a NDC target of almost 600 MW (see Figure 4), without proper policies and guidance in place, the sector remains at risk and untapped. 4. Investor/Lender interest surrounding uncertainties: In Bangladesh, to develop utility scale RE projects, Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) are created with a partnership between a foreign company which typically brings technical expertise and global, low-cost finance and a local company which brings regulatory navigation and local logistics support. The way SPVs are designed, foreign investors/lenders are deterred over project timelines, interagency navigation, contract lock-ins (e.g., a local partner and their foreign partner need to be a part of the project for at least 6 years), lack of clarity over various regulations, etc. Research into the issue revealed that though a lot of local players received interests from reputed international developers/lenders, they ultimately shied away over delayed timelines and conflicting contracts. Local lenders were not equipped with proper lending mechanisms for utility-scale RE projects. The private sector feels the need for a guarantee mechanism to attract lenders. 5. Utility Distribution Companies Upgradation: The distribution utilities in its current state are inadequate to support mass RE adoption to serve the local electricity market. The underlying problems are two-fold; first, in the infrastructure readiness and planning level, and second, in terms of capacity and preparedness of many local level offices. For mass renewable adoption at the Upazila level, the key utility agency is the Rural Electrification Board (REB). The 33 kV lines maintained under REB are prone to frequent outages. The distribution utilities are also currently ill-equipped to adopt net-metered solar rooftop systems, making the incentives hard to avail. IMPLICATIONS of COP26 OUTCOMES This year's event of COP26 was a landmark in the fight against climate change. Following the UN's IPCC[2] report, the 200-country delegation unanimously named fossil fuels as the primary reason for climate change. As such, all the major development banks are now shying away from coal[3], and Bangladesh could soon be ostracized if coal remains a major part of its fuel mix. Bangladesh has announced bold plans around renewable energy adoption in COP26 . The Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) talks about a target of 4,100 MW renewable energy by 2030. The initial plan has laid out a strategy of including renewable energy sources disaggregated by technology. The plan laid out is shown in Figure 4. However, these plans would be hard to mobilize from a private sector perspective if incentives are not provided to reduce consumption by the end-user and regulatory reforms are not implemented.

Dhaka, Oct. 21 -- Sweden will help Bangladesh on issues related to renewable energy, reduction of greenhouse gas, salinity intrusion, development activities and climate change adaptation, and mitigation efforts. Swedish Ambassador to Bangladesh Alexander Berg von Linde made the assurance on Thursday. She expressed her firm commitment to work together on these issues at a bilateral meeting held at the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change with the Environment Minister Md Shahab Uddin in the chair. They also discussed cooperation with Bangladesh in some other areas, including ecosystem management, sustainable environment, and conservation of biodiversity and tackling the effects of climate change in Bangladesh. He also said Bangladesh is doing its best to make COP26 a success. Bangladesh will raise its voice to provide US$100 billion to developing countries annually by the rich countries.

Dhaka, Nov. 2 -- More than 100 global leaders late on Monday pledged to halt and reverse deforestation and land degradation by the end of the decade, underpinned by $19 billion in public and private funds to invest in protecting and restoring forests. The joint statement at the COP26 climate talks HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/business/cop https://www.reuters.com/business/cop The Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forest and Land Use will cover forests totaling more than 13 million square miles, according to a statement from the UK prime minister's office on behalf of the leaders. "We will have a chance to end humanity's long history as nature's conqueror, and instead become its custodian," said British leader Boris Johnson, calling it an unprecedented agreement. A slew of additional government and private initiatives were launched on Tuesday to help reach that goal, including billions in pledges for indigenous guardians of the forest and sustainable agriculture. Forests absorb roughly 30 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions, according to the nonprofit World Resources Institute. The forests take the emissions out of the atmosphere and prevent them from warming the climate. Monday's agreement vastly expands a similar commitment made by 40 countries as part of the 2014 New York Declaration of Forests and goes further than ever before in laying out the resources to reach that goal. At least a further 5.3 billion pounds would be provided by more than 30 private sector investors including Aviva, Schroders and AXA. The investors, representing $8.7 trillion in assets under management, also pledged to stop investing in activities linked to deforestation by 2025. Five countries, including the Britain and United States, and a group of global charities on Tuesday also pledged to provide $1.7 billion in financing to support indigenous people's conservation of forests and to strengthen their land rights. Environmentalists say that indigenous communities are the best protectors of the forest, often against violent encroachment of loggers and land grabbers. More than 30 financial institutions with more than $8.7 trillion in assets under management also said they would make "best efforts" to eliminate deforestation related to cattle, palm oil, soy and pulp production by 2025. COP26 aims to keep alive a target of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. Scientists say forests and so-called nature-based solutions will be vital to reaching that goal. Woodlands have removed about 760 million tonnes of carbon every year since 2011, offsetting about 8 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and cement, according to the Biomass Carbon Monitor project backed by data analytics firm Kayrros and French research institutions. "Our biosphere is really helping bail us out for the time being, but there is no guarantee those processes will continue," said Oliver Phillips, an ecologist at the United Kingdom's University of Leeds.

Dhaka, Feb. 13 -- The recent COP26 summit in Glasgow brought together coalitions and alliance that vowed to act on climate change by putting into effect the Paris Accord. A crucial part of this commitment is to implement policies that rectify the carbon price signal. Yet, macroeconomic models have shown that carbon taxes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would lead to modest reductions in GDP, making countries and businesses reluctant to embrace such policies. A new study, however, makes a fundamental shift in our thinking on the consequences of carbon taxes. The NBER paper by two professors at Tufts University, Alan Shapiro and Gilbert Metcalf, demonstrates that, far from curbing economic growth, carbon taxes can deliver positive consumption and output effects in the long run. So, how do we reconcile their findings with the past evidence? Well, their research considers micro channels of adjustment among firms. When faced with carbon taxes, firms can adjust on both the intensive and the extensive margin. The regulatory costs associated with environmental policy not only change firms' input choices and their decisions to abate emissions (intensive margin), but they also shift the incentive for companies to enter the market in the first place, as well as their decisions to adopt technology (extensive margin). The consideration of the extensive margin of firm adjustment in Shapiro and Metcalf plays a decisive role in limiting the adverse labor-market effects of carbon taxes, along with expansion in output and consumption. With carbon taxes in place, the benefits of entering and operating as a brown firm falls, making it relatively more attractive to adopt greener technology or not enter a market at all. Without understanding these micro-level margins of adjustment by firms, increasing carbon taxes entails both short- and long-term consumption and output costs. Environmental policies solely informed by macro models may miss the micro-level implementation details. Macro models involve general equilibrium principles. Yet firm-level data suggest that the adjustment process from one point of equilibrium to the next matters a great deal to the way firms respond. So do the specifics of policy implementation. Firms that experience higher energy prices may seek alternatives to costly technology adoption. These choices are articulated in two competing theories: The pollution haven hypothesis predicts that stringent environmental policies that increase compliance costs shift emissions-intensive production toward firms, regions or countries with lower abatement costs, causing emissions leakage. By comparison, the Porter hypothesis argues that such policies foster innovation and adoption of technologies that enhance competitiveness. If environmental policies are asymmetric, which is often the case, their effects will vary by types of firms, regions and countries. Such specificities in implementation of environmental policies determine firms' responses on emissions displacement versus innovation. While the EU ETS did not induce leakage across firms within countries, a tightening of U.S. air-quality standards increased the relocation of battery recycling to Mexico. In China, evidence supports an "internal" variant of pollution havens: market shares of firms in cities with more stringent environmental regulations declined compared with those with weaker regulations. The Porter hypothesis does not seem to have played out the way climate policy enthusiasts envisaged. While environmental policies such as the climate change levy in the UK, the EU ETS and the withdrawal of fossil fuel subsidies in Indonesia led to a decline in energy use and emissions, they had no effect on the productivity of plants or competitiveness of firms. In Germany, manufacturing firms passed on their carbon costs to insulate from profit losses. The U.S. Clean Air Act amendments (CAAA) had a negative impact on plant-level productivity in regulated counties relative to others. In China, environmental regulations had a negative effect on firm performance including profits, capital, labor and market share across all industries. The presence of so-called threshold effects implies that unless firms realize productivity benefits from better management, incentives to invest in greening will be muted. Even in advanced economies, the impact of environmental policies on innovation is not impressive and favoured the adoption of off-the-shelf abatement technologies. It is not easy to change the historical patterns of innovation in clean technologies among firms; there is significant path dependence. Today, most climate policies do not adequately address the micro-level market failures preventing firms from adopting green management practices or technology. Decarbonization will require massive upgrading of firm capabilities, yet such opportunities are weaker in developing countries. Ultimately, transitioning to net-zero emissions will entail structural transformation that goes beyond the climate policy toolbox. Horizontal policies that foster competition, reduce distortions in factor and product markets, encourage innovation, and firm growth will ease the transition to net-zero. It will reduce the societal burden to subsidize the adoption of green management practices and low-carbon technologies. The effectiveness of policies for decarbonization will rest heavily on the capabilities of governments to implement these policies, maintain competitive neutrality and enact complementary reforms and targeted firm-level support.

Dhaka, Dec. 11 -- World Bank Vice-President for South Asia Hartwig Schafer reaffirmed the bank's commitment to the country's resilient and inclusive recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic as he concluded a week-long visit to the South Asian nation on Friday. Schafer met Finance Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal and lauded the government's measures to contain the Covid pandemic, and its focus on an inclusive economic recovery, a press release said. He also noted the strong role Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina played at the recent COP26 meeting. "The resilience of Bangladesh's people and the economy is striking. The COVID-19 pandemic hit the country hard, but the government's proactive measures have largely contained the virus and the economy has started to turn around," said Schafer. "The World Bank is committed to helping Bangladesh remain on a sustainable growth path, which will require timely policy actions to build strong public institutions, a robust private sector and conducive business climate, and a skilled labor force, and at the same time focus on climate resilience." During the visit, Schafer also met Prime Minister's Private Industry and Investment Adviser Salman Fazlur Rahman, Bangladesh Bank Governor Fazle Kabir, and National Board of Revenue Chairman Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem as well as senior government officials, representatives from the private sector, and development partners. The World Bank Group is beginning the preparation of its new Country Partnership Framework for Bangladesh, which will guide its support to the country from 2023-2027. This entails a robust consultation process with a broad range of stakeholders in government, the private sector, and civil society, and with development partners, read the release. In his meetings with government and other stakeholders, Schafer discussed their perspectives on Bangladesh's development priorities and how the World Bank can support these in a sustainable way. "Bangladesh is an inspiring development success story," Schafer said, adding, "As the country works to become an upper-middle-income country by 2031, the World Bank will be there every step of the way on a path to economic growth that is greener, more resilient, and more inclusive for the people of Bangladesh."

Reiterating the need for reducing global carbon emissions, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has called on world leaders "to turn pledges into action" to stave off the worst consequences of climate change. Showcasing Bangladesh's efforts in the fight against climate change, Hasina has urged world leaders to join her in fixing the global problem that "requires a great deal of fortitude, imagination, hope and leadership". "If western leaders listen, engage and act decisively on what science demands of them, there is still time to make COP26 the success it desperately needs to be," she wrote in an article published by leading British daily 'Financial Times'. "Bangladesh was born 50 years ago this year, a birth shrouded in blood and pain. My father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, inspired and led our independence struggle. It is in his memory that we have named our climate prosperity plan the Mujib Plan," she wrote. 'Climate change is a very different foe from those he faced, but dealing with it requires a great deal of fortitude, imagination, hope and leadership. "The inconvenient truth of our times is that while action on climate change has never been more urgent and achievable, governments are not cutting emissions fast enough to keep nations such as mine safe," Hasina wrote. In the north of Bangladesh, millions depend on fresh water stored every year in the Himalayan ice fields, "which warming air is now destabilising". In the south, sea level rise is exacerbating the threat from coastal flooding. Falling crop yields are another destructive change "we can anticipate". Only a tiny fraction of global warming can be attributed to Bangladesh's carbon emissions, according to the Prime Minister. "Even so, we are committed to leading the path to a solution. This is not only because we wish to avert the worst of climate change; it also makes economic sense. Investing in zero-carbon growth is the best way to create jobs across the economy and ensure that our nation becomes more prosperous." Earlier this year, Hasina said that her government cancelled plans for 10 coal-fired power plants but that was a relatively small step. "Subsequently, with COP26 in view, we developed the world's first national 'climate prosperity plan' - a vision under which we will enhance resilience, grow our economy, create jobs and expand opportunities for our citizens, using action on climate change as the catalyst." Under the plan, she said, they will obtain 30 percent of energy from renewables by the end of the decade. "We believe that developing wind farms along the coast will revitalise the mangrove forests that help stabilise our shifting shores, protecting against storms and flooding. We will empower banks to offer favourable terms to fossil fuel-free infrastructure projects, and pursue co-operation with developed nations in areas such as green hydrogen," she wrote. "By investing in resilience and zero-carbon development, we will create about 4.1m more jobs this decade than under business-as-usual. "The plan will simultaneously prevent up to 6.8 per cent of the economic damage that would otherwise come not only from climate change but also increasingly uneconomic fossil fuel infrastructure. "We calculate the benefit to our GDP at over $850bn. I believe more developing nations will adopt such plans in the coming months and years, led by members of the Climate Vulnerable Forum," Hasina wrote. Bangladesh can implement this plan independent of other countries, although international climate finance would speed things along. "But what the world needs if they are to meet the Paris agreement goal to keep warming to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, is a global version of our climate prosperity plan," she claimed. "This year's COP26 "Having pledged three decades ago at the Rio Earth Summit to lead the world out of the climate and nature crises, developed nations have cut their combined greenhouse gas emissions by less than one-seventh. That is not leadership. "Although recent net zero pledges from the EU, US and others are welcome, they are largely not accompanied by policies that give confidence that they will be delivered. The $100bn per year finance pledge made 12 years ago remains unfulfilled," Hasina mentioned in her article. However, according to the PM, this $100bn is tiny compared with what developing nations will need in order to build a zero-carbon future. "Both governments and private institutions want to invest but we face the stark burden of a high cost of capital, exacerbated now by Covid-related debt. "If developed nations wish to help they must address this. Cutting the cost of capital will substantially accelerate decarbonisation across the global south, yielding worldwide benefits," she wrote. If western leaders cannot see the logic of this, Hasina said, "perhaps recent events in their own backyards will help - for what were the extreme forest fires seen in North America and Australia or Germany's recent lethal floods, if not alarm bells clanging in regions of the world most responsible for climate change?" \</doc>

Bangladesh has called upon the developed countries -- responsible for the highest rates of global carbon emissions -- to pay compensation to the poorer nations for the losses and damages incurred through climate change. In an interview with ITV News, Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen said it is fair and just for these bigger countries to pay compensation because they are the ones that abuse the resources and spoil planet Earth. Meanwhile, developing countries like Bangladesh often emit the lowest amounts of global emissions but are forced to endure the disproportionate wrath of climate change. Bangladesh is only responsible for 0.4% of the planet's total carbon discharge yet loses around 2% of its GDP yearly to extreme climate events, says the ITV News. Six million Bangladeshis have so far got displaced as a consequence of climate change and by 2050, the country fears 17% of its coastline will vanish underwater creating 30 million climate refugees. 'This is an existential problem for Bangladesh,' Momen said, adding that the climate change issue is not a national issue, not a regional issue, it is a global issue. "We all have to work together in collaboration and partnership to save this planet." Bangladesh is currently presiding over the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), a global partnership of 48 countries disproportionately impacted by the consequences of global warming. The group was formed partly to hold industrialised countries to account for their contributions towards climate change. The Foreign Minister explained the CVF, under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, will be pushing for a number of policy commitments at the UN climate summit which is now less than two months away. The issue of 'losses and damages' will be high on the agenda for the CVF at the Summit. Although lacking a clear definition, this generally refers to the negative impacts of climate change often felt by developing countries. The Climate Summit -- COP26 -- is scheduled to take place in Glasgow in November. Professor Saleemul Huq, Director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Dhaka, told ITV News that although the losses and damages have been felt by developing countries for decades, the issue is only now slowly starting to be talked about. 'Countries like Bangladesh and other developing nations have been hit with extreme weather, no doubt influenced by climate change for years and no one seemed to care," he said. The UK became the first G7 country to enshrine in law a commitment to reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma is urging other countries to follow suit, but Bangladesh says unless the UK and other developed nations can provide the relevant technological and financial support required, they won't be able to make the commitment to achieving net zero by the middle of the century. Sharma said: ' COP26 is our last best hope of avoiding the worst effects of climate change, and we cannot afford to fail.' Dr Momen told ITV News that the summit was an opportunity to 'help save this planet.' \</doc>

Jan. 6 Tokyo(The Yomiuri Shimbun/ANN)- Aiming to lead the global decarbonization movement and helping Japan decarbonize, the government plans to expand greenhouse gas emissions trading by increasing the nations covered by a so-called joint collaboration plan, which will be drawn up together with developing countries. Vietnam has already drawn up the plan with Japan, and the government hopes to expand it to other Southeast Asian nations, with a view to working with African countries as well. Under the Joint Crediting Mechanism, the government and private companies provide technologies for decarbonization, such as the introduction of solar and wind power generation, to partner countries. Based on the amount of reduction in emissions in the partner countries, Japan can receive some of the emissions credits from those nations. The government plans to compile the collaboration plan with countries that have already signed the mechanism, a framework that originated in 2013 between Japan and developing countries. During the COP26 U.N. climate summit held in Britain in November last year, emissions trading through the mechanism was internationally recognized. Currently, the Japanese government has signed the mechanism with 17 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. In November last year, Japan and Vietnam signed the joint collaboration plan that covers concrete measures such as technical assistance and reduction targets. As decarbonization technology has yet to be widely used in many countries, the government hopes to increase the nations that draw up collaboration plans, hoping to make the cooperation effective in the fight against global warming. In some developing countries, there is room for Japanese assistance in calculating the current greenhouse gas emission level and future estimates. To this end, the plan is expected to include exports of a system for predicting future greenhouse gas emissions and support for developing a national strategy for decarbonization for each country. The government also plans to set up a joint working group to confirm progress on the reduction target on a regular basis. For the time being, the government plans to prioritize drawing up plans with Indonesia and Thailand to counter China's growing influence in Southeast Asia. In the future, the government hopes to draw up plans with African countries that have signed the mechanism with Japan, such as Kenya and Ethiopia. The government has set a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 46% from fiscal 2013 levels by fiscal 2030. It is expected that 100 million tons of emissions will be reduced through the mechanism, which is equivalent to about 8% of Japan's total emissions in fiscal 2019. At present, however, the forecast is only for a reduction of 19.2 million tons. The government hopes to expand the number of countries compiling the collaboration plan, aiming at steady progress on the reduction target. A senior official of the Environment Ministry said, "We would like to make our contribution to the global trend of decarbonization by increasing the number of countries signing the mechanism and compiling the collaboration plan." ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

'Nonajoler Kabbo' (The Salt in Our Waters), a much acclaimed film by young writer-director Rezwan Shahriar Sumit which received awards at numerous international film festivals last year, will have its theatrical release in Bangladesh on November 26. The date for the theatrical release of the film was revealed at a press conference on Saturday noon at the Dhaka Club in the capital, joined by the cast and crew members of the film. Actors including Titas Zia, Fazlur Rahman Babu, and Tasnova Tamanna joined the press conference alongside director-producer Sumit, noted film director Amitabh Reza, Star Cineplex chairman Mahboob Rahman Ruhel and the music director for the film Arnob. 'Nonajoler Kabbo' has performed at major festivals in London, Busan, G\'f6teborg, Seattle, S\'e3o Paulo, Torino, and Singapore. The film is now making its way beyond the festival circuit, to the upcoming United Nations Climate Conference COP26 this year in Glasgow, Scotland. At the UN Climate Conference of Youth COY16, the first screening of 'Nonajoler Kabbo' will take place in front of young climate leaders from all across the world. The second showing will take place at the Cinema Auditorium (IMAX theater) in the official COP26 Green Zone. This summit is expected to attract a majority of international leaders including Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The critically acclaimed film depicts an epic cultural confrontation in Bangladesh's climate frontlines, with the elemental battle of land and sea, man and nature functioning as an interactive setting for a dramatic meditation on tradition and modernity. "I traveled to a remote fishing community in Patuakhali three years ago to make this film, and I'm sorry to inform you that the coastal village where we shot 'Nonajoler Kabbo' no longer exists. For 1.5 years, I was unable to return to the location due to the pandemic and when I returned to that beloved place and those beloved people, all I found were some broken tree branches and the rising tide,' Sumit said at the event. The sea level in this area has risen dramatically in the last 2-3 years, according to Sumit, and the high tide is regularly eroding the land, and Cyclone Amphan last year wreaked havoc. "I met some of the fishing village brothers and sisters who acted in Nonajoler Kabbo," Sumit tells UNB, 'Even Hilsa, they said, isn't as plentiful as it once was. I realized that their lives are far more horrific than the story in my film, thus I applied for the United Nations Climate Conference because I want to tell the world about these people's sufferings." 'Nonajoler Kabbo' was co-produced by Rezwan Shahriar Sumit and French producer Ilann Girard. The film features stunning visuals shot by award-winning Thai cinematographer Chananun Chotrungroj. The film's editor, Academy Member Kristan Sprague, was nominated for six Oscars, including Best Picture this year, for her recent film 'Judas and the Black Messiah.' Rezwan Shahriar Sumit, the film's Bangladeshi writer and director, was awarded a writing grant by Spike Lee, who also mentored him at NYU Tisch's Grad Film Program. 'Nonajoler Kabbo' has won several national-international awards and grants, including the NETPAC Award (Best Asian Feature) at 26th Kolkata International Film Festival in 2021, TFL Audience Design Fund 2020, Bangladesh's National Film Grant in 2017, CNC Aide aux cin\'e9mas du monde 2018, and Spike Lee Writing Grant 2016, to name a few. \</doc>

Nov. 30 Dhaka(The Daily Star/ANN)- In the leadup to COP26 in Glasgow, the first in two years, there was much talk about how this COP would make or break the collective global target to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. It was deemed as the "one last chance" to avert climate catastrophe by a plethora of global talking heads. What Glasgow delivered, was instead, as Greta Thunberg put it, "blah blah blah". There were several key points that Glasgow promised significant progress on. This was to be the COP where loss and damage would be operationalised carrying on from Madrid in 2019, where we would see adaptation come into focus and climate finance finally ironed out, even if the existing pledges remain woefully inadequate. Ambition was a key word, as countries were appealed to return with newer, better, and more urgent Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Alok Sharma, the COP26 President, promised this would be the COP that would consign coal to history, and explicit action on fossil fuels was what many hoped for. Of course, no one realistically expected Glasgow to deliver on everything, but as it quickly emerged within the first week of November, the struggle would rather be to get Glasgow to deliver on anything. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. The warning signs were evident. The UK is said to have hosted the least inclusive, whitest and most Global North-centric COP. A British visa is an ordeal in the best of times for those of us with weak passports, but the added requirements around the UK's Red List Covid travel restrictions made travelling to Glasgow out of reach for many. Any sane person would balk at the idea of quarantining in a Heathrow hotel out-of-pocket. The lack of access to Covid vaccines in many parts of the world added an extra obstacle. While the UK government had a scheme for vaccinating COP participants, the programme was limited in scale. A much better faith policy would have been to ensure the spread of vaccines to the Global South rather than being hoarded in developed nations. Within the COP Venue, the SEC, civil society access to the plenary rooms where negotiations took place was severely limited, as were meeting spaces due to so-called Covid restrictions. As a result, many observers were shepherded into the expo-style pavilion area. It is no surprise then when climate justice activists were outraged at the news that while they were being excluded, the fossil fuel lobby had a larger combined delegation at COP than any country. There were pushes for the outcomes necessary to call COP26 a success. The Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), presided by Bangladesh, pushed for the adoption of the Glasgow Emergency Pact, an acknowledgement of the short-term action required to stave off climate collapse rather than vague 2050 targets. But often proposals such as these, and discussions on loss and damage, climate finance, and fossil fuels (not just coal, but also oil and gas), were met by stern opposition by a variety of actors, including developed states such as the US, Australia and Norway, as well as certain non-Western states like Saudi Arabia. The Glasgow Facility on Loss and Damage pushed by developing countries was similarly scrapped. Meanwhile, developed states diverted negotiations primarily toward carbon markets, nature-based solutions and offsets. There are several reasons why it was highly problematic that negotiations got bogged down on offsets rather than meaningful action on loss and damage, adaptation or strong language on fossil fuels. The first and foremost is that offsets aren't proven to work as effective climate action and at a time when ambition and urgency is needed for action in the near term, they provide excuses and loopholes for the polluters that landed us in this mess to continue polluting. Carbon markets have never been proven to reduce emissions and the pricing of carbon remains a sticking point. In theory, carbon markets could work as effective offsets, but in practice, the pricing of carbon has remained far too low in an unequal market to be anything more than a loophole for big polluters. Similarly, nature-based solutions are iffy when it comes to efficacy. Net zero targets (rather than absolute reductions) are an easy get-out clause. By 2050, for most of these geriatric world leaders, it will be someone else's problem. In addition, they rely on projections based on unproven, or in some cases, non-existent technologies. Carbon capture and storage, green hydrogen, molten salt reactors, nuclear fission, etc all sound really nice but none of them are ready for deployment on the scale we need in the timeframe that is necessary. All in all, as environmental group Friends of the Earth International put it, no deal would have been preferable to the one we got. The reason why this feels like a betrayal is that, while rich countries look for ways to continue their business-as-usual approach, the climate catastrophe is no longer a future possibility for vulnerable countries. We simply do not have time Bangladesh loses around 30m of coastline every year and will face a displacement crisis of unimaginable proportions if sea level rise is not controlled. Displacement is already underway. Before the land gives way, people suffer as saltwater encroaches. An often-bandied statistic is that 19 coastal districts could at least partially go underwater and 30 million people may move further inland. Inaction by large emitters, both with their own commitments and with their reluctance to provide necessary resources to the vulnerable countries, is a death sentence for millions. With all this in mind, it felt quite gloom and doom as I left Glasgow. However, there were certain hopeful takeaways, as slight as they are. The first is that through the tireless work of activists, NGOs, indigenous peoples and vulnerable states, Loss and Damage has moved from being the unloved black sheep of the climate framework to an increasingly popular talking point. While we didn't see meaningful operationalisation of the topic, this is no longer a niche topic for climate nerds it has entered mainstream vocabulary and movements have embraced the concept as fundamental to climate justice. While this deserves an article of its own, one hopes that the ball has started rolling irreversibly, especially as hosts Scotland themselves committed a symbolic amount of money to a loss and damage fund, the first country to do so. Secondly, as I met activists from across the world, I saw anger, both in the hallways of the SEC, especially as coalitions of civil society organisations including youth, indigenous peoples, farmers, researchers, etc, marched out of the SEC in protest on the last day, and on the streets of Glasgow as 150,000 people braved the torrential Scottish weather to demand action. Anger is an extremely potent emotion and for the climate movement, this COP reiterated that there is no rest. That anger must be funnelled into making the lives of policymakers a living hell until they act. That anger must be directed against the fossil fuel companies who lied about their knowledge about the effects of burning carbon and continue to lobby to protect their profits rather than protecting human life. Glasgow failed the developing world. This cannot be forgotten in Egypt next year. As the travelling circus of COP goes to Africa, developing states and the climate justice movement must lick their wounds and reorganise, remobilise and have their voices heard. Climate action is inevitable. The question is whether COP, as a platform, will deliver it in time. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Dhaka, Sept. 14 -- With six nations accounting for over 80 per cent of planned new coal projects globally, winning commitments to cancel those projects could help November's COP26 UN climate summit "consign coal power to history", a key goal of organisers, researchers said. Proposed new coal power capacity globally has plunged 76 per cent since the Paris Agreement in 2015, with 44 countries agreeing to end new projects, according to a report by think-tank E3G released on Tuesday. Ending the use of coal - the most polluting fossil fuel - for power production has been a key focus for climate change activists, leading to funding and insurance for new projects rapidly drying up. Swiftly ending coal use is seen as vital to global goals of capping global warming at "well below" 2 degrees Celsius and ideally 1.5C and avoiding swiftly worsening climate threats such as harsher storms, floods, wildfires and crop failures. But coal remains a mainstay for power generation in Asia, which accounts for 75 per cent of global coal demand, according to the International Energy Agency. Countries with significant coal deposits or energy systems reliant on the fuel have been slow to abandon it, tied down in part by the costs of abandoning still-functioning plants and mines or reluctant to break commitments to new plants. China also remains a major funder of new coal energy, even as declining prices for solar and wind power make green energy more competitive than coal in most parts of the world. "The economics of coal have become increasingly uncompetitive in comparison to renewable energy, while the risk of stranded assets has increased," said Chris Littlecott, the report author and an associate director at E3G. 'LAST MAN STANDING' China alone is home to about 53 per cent of the new coal power capacity under construction globally, the report noted. That is despite a 74 per cent reduction in its project pipeline since the Paris climate accord, according to E3G. The Asian giant, however, is not only under scrutiny for its coal projects at home but also for funding projects abroad, after two other major financiers - South Korea and Japan - said this year they would end overseas coal financing. "China is the last man standing in supporting coal projects abroad," Li Shuo, a Beijing-based policy advisor at Greenpeace East Asia, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. "The Chinese government should get ahead of this trend by declaring an overseas coal moratorium. Doing so before COP26 will contribute momentum into the year-end global climate gathering," he said. Getting countries to commit to more ambitious emission-cutting plans and providing the necessary finance to put them into place are key themes at the COP26 summit, billed as the last chance to galvanise the action needed to limit global warming to 1.5C. Alok Sharma, the British official who will preside over the talks, has said the summit, scheduled to take place in Scotland in November, needs to "consign coal power to history". Countries from Indonesia to the Philippines have been part of a new wave of commitments across Asia to not approve new coal power projects - but projects already planned or under construction will still go ahead in most cases. With new plants needing to run for decades to pay back the costs of building them, failure to reverse those plans could doom climate goals, climate scientists and activists say. "We have to talk about terminating 'under construction' projects, and cancelling the 'planned projects' when it comes to coal in Asia," said Sejong Youn, a director at Solutions for Our Climate, a Seoul-based non-profit on climate change. "That is the real target we need to be pushing in COP26 ." Youn said there is a "high likelihood" China will "quietly, virtually" end overseas coal finance at some point, but he expects the country will not announce such a move to avoid being seen as caving into outside pressure. COSTS OF COAL SWITCH Any efforts to ditch coal should also take into account how that would impact impoverished communities and workers across Asia and potentially deepen inequalities, said Indonesian campaigner Arti Indallah Tjakranegara. Transitioning to cleaner energy in Indonesia could create millions of new green jobs in the country of 260 million but also lead to the unemployment of tens of thousands and threaten the economy of coal-producing regions. Indonesia, the world's top exporter of coal for power generation, currently sources 60 per cent of its own energy from coal. It plans to stop using coal, oil and gas by 2060 and aims to have 85 per cent of its energy needs from renewable sources then. "Energy transition is like two sides of the same coin. There are also risks to be mitigated," said Tjakranegara, a manager at Yayasan Humanis dan Inovasi Sosial, an Indonesian non-profit working on climate change issues. "A just energy transition needs to address the main challenges of unemployment, environmental degradation and inequality," she said by phone from Jakarta.

Nov. 3 GLASGOW(Straits Times/ANN)  The leaders of more than 100 nations on Tuesday (Nov 2) pledged to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030, in a bid to preserve the planet's natural carbon sponges that can slow the rate of global warming. The Glasgow leaders' declaration on forests and land use, which was announced during the COP26 climate talks in the Scottish city, was signed by the European Union and countries such as Brazil, Indonesia, the United States and Congo. Together, the signatories account for about 85 per cent of the world's forests. Said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson during the Forest and Land Use event at COP26 : "These great teeming ecosystems  these cathedrals of nature  are the lungs of our planet. Forests support communities, livelihoods and food supply, and absorb the carbon we pump into the atmosphere. They are essential to our very survival." Ms Frances Seymour, a distinguished senior fellow at think-tank World Resources Institute (WRI), said the 2030 target is significant as a reiteration from a new generation of leaders of the commitment made by some 40 countries seven years ago in the New York Declaration on Forests. The New York Declaration, signed in 2014, aims to reduce natural forest loss by half by 2020 and strive to end it by 2030. "Many more countries have signed up, including those that are significant in terms of forest area, such as Brazil and Russia, and in terms of their footprint on forests through trade and investment, especially China," added Ms Seymour. But she cautioned that since the declaration is a collective and shared commitment without an embedded accountability mechanism, its significance will lie in how it is translated into specific actions by specific countries. "This will depend on citizens holding their leaders accountable for following through on these commitments," she told The Straits Times. The Glasgow leaders' declaration is backed by almost US$20 billion (S$27 billion) in funding. Some US$12 billion of public finance from 12 countries, including Britain, will go towards supporting activities in developing countries, such as restoring degraded land, tackling wildfires and supporting the rights of indigenous communities between this year and 2025. Another $7.2 billion of private investment will come from more than 30 financial institutions, including Aviva, Schroders and Axa, to eliminate investment in activities linked to deforestation. The declaration also outlines six key areas in which the 2030 goal can be achieved. They include plans to conserve land-based ecosystems  such as forests  while accelerating their restoration, and aligning policies in agriculture and trade with the goal of ensuring that these activities are done sustainably. Under the declaration, the leaders also pledged to direct financial flows to areas such as forest management and conservation, and to protect forests in a way that is respectful of the rights of indigenous people and local communities. "We urge all leaders to join forces in a sustainable land use transition," said the signatories of the declaration. This is essential to meeting the Paris Agreement goals, they added. The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015 by almost 200 nations, aims to limit planetary heating to 2 deg C  preferably 1.5 deg C  above pre-industrial levels. This threshold will help reduce the impact of climate change, including more frequent extreme weather events, sea-level rise and more intense storms, climate scientists say. The planetary crisis today is caused by an ever-thickening layer of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which traps heat and throws the Earth's systems out of whack. But ecosystems  such as tropical rainforests and peatlands  have the natural ability to take in planet-warming carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and then convert them to biomass in their trunks, leaves, roots and soils  locking away the carbon from the atmosphere. Forests are the lungs of the planet, absorbing around one-third of the global carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels every year, said the British host of COP26 in a statement. "But we are losing them at an alarming rate. An area of forest the size of 27 football pitches is lost every minute," it added. The burning of fossil fuels is the primary contributor to the atmospheric blanket, but land use changes and deforestation are the second-largest contributor. Professor Koh Lian Pin, who helms the National University of Singapore (NUS) Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions, said the declaration is an important step towards turning off the tap of carbon emissions from the conversion of natural ecosystems to unsustainable land uses. He said deforestation and forest degradation contribute to about a tenth of annual global emissions, and stopping these are crucial in the world's bid to limit planetary warming. But Prof Koh said more details are needed to determine if these goals can be met. For instance, the ability to achieve the intended outcomes depends on effective policies at the national and sub-national levels to incentivise the transition of forest-opening industries to other activities that can sustain the local economies. He added: "US$20 billion might sound like a lot, but the opportunity cost of carrying on business as usual in many parts of the world may be many times, if not magnitudes, greater than that." WRI's Ms Seymour said that while the funding pledges are larger than in the past, they remain small compared to the private financial flows and public subsidies that drive deforestation. She said: "That's why they should be seen in conjunction with the complementary efforts being announced at the (Glasgow meeting) to drive system change, such as putting a market price on forest carbon, and commitments to get deforestation out of financial-sector investment portfolios." Prof Koh said it is also important that financial benefits trickle down to affected local communities, who are the stewards of the land, through measures that enhance their lives and livelihoods. Separately, Britain, Norway, Germany, the United States and the Netherlands, in partnership with 17 funders, on Monday (Nov 1) pledged to invest US$1.7 billion to help indigenous and local communities safeguard the biodiverse tropical forests that are vital to protecting the planet from climate change, biodiversity loss and pandemic risk. Singapore did not sign the Glasgow leaders' declaration on forests and land use.

Dhaka, Dec. 5 -- As the world continues its transition toward cleaner, renewable approaches to climate and energy, the ways progress will be planned and paid for are becoming clearer. While some people left COP26 disappointed with the progress made, key frameworks that took shape in Glasgow in the crucial area of climate finance show how talk can be turned into action. Tangible progress will not come a moment too soon for our region. Many small island states with unique, scattered geography and marine ecosystems-many rising just a few meters above sea level-are in clear, existential peril. Each year, extreme weather throughout Asia and the Pacific causes death, destroys infrastructure, and disrupts economies. In the Philippines, damage from extreme weather and disasters reached the equivalent of $9.3 billion from 2010-2019. Meanwhile, our region now accounts for about half of all global greenhouse gas emissions and is home to 865 of the roughly 1,000 coal-fired energy plants in use around the world. As Asia and the Pacific's climate bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is working to help developing countries assemble three core elements in the effort to mitigate and adapt to climate change: technical solutions that help to green their economies; expertise and capacity to take a "whole-of-economy" approach; and financial resources to transition to more sustainable infrastructure. This holistic view covers everything from expanding climate literacy and training to sharing knowledge and a spirit of innovation to help prepare locally tailored solutions. So how can countries respond to rising sea levels, frequent disasters, and dangerous pollution? Let's consider the power sector. Solutions to the challenge of generating enough energy to meet rising demand while tackling climate change will look different for each country. An alternative renewable energy mix-whether wind farms or solar parks-can add to hydropower or geothermal generation that is cleaner and contributes to the energy transition. It all depends on what's available. But across countries the focus will be on designing impactful, climate-aligned programs and investments linked to broader national development strategies that move them toward more ambitious targets under the Paris Agreement. To develop those investments, it is critical to first weigh the feasibility of technical solutions to climate change development projects and use the findings to define an appropriate package of loans, grants and guarantees. Technical assistance is central for each country to reach its climate goals-and remains a key part of how ADB will help. In the power sector, access to technical expertise can help improve understanding of complex issues, build awareness of potential solutions, and support the transfer of new technologies that allow greater access to power while also promoting the clean-energy transition. This is critical in a region where 350 million people have unreliable access to energy and 150 million people have none whatsoever. Capacity development is also critical to help countries formulate approaches to a just transition through vocational training and social development, so new investments do not disrupt income growth or safety nets for the most vulnerable. We will also work with partners and clients to drive new ideas that protect the environment-and livelihoods. For instance, throughout Asia and the Pacific, vulnerable coastal wetlands are also critical sources of incomes. In Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam, more than 1.5 million people work in small-scale fisheries. One study estimated that, in the People's Republic of China and the Philippines alone, investing in climate-resilient coastlines saves an estimated 2,000 lives and $200 billion annually by preventing floods. By avoiding conventional seawalls and instead adopting climate-friendly approaches to contain surges and floods, we also safeguard economies and protect jobs. A climate bank like ADB can build from its strong balance sheet and high credit rating to pass on competitive lending rates and longer tenors to help finance such large efforts. We can also use multiple financing instruments, including guarantees, to leverage resources and serve as an important conduit for co-financing. Ultimately, however, our role is distinguished by a pipeline of bankable climate change projects with upfront due diligence, prefeasibility and other preparatory work. Our projects evolve through careful structuring to ensure the economic and financial returns generate income, enhance the welfare of ordinary people, and can even attract commercial financing. ADB has committed to increase our own climate finance allocation to $100 billion cumulatively from 2019 to 2030 and to fully align our operations with the Paris Agreement by 2025. At COP26 Frameworks and planning of this nature often fails to command centre stage. But each smart initiative-and the thinking and capacity support behind them-shows how the large-scale climate solutions that we now urgently need throughout Asia and the Pacific will take shape as the decade advances. By approaching each challenge holistically, we will reach our goal of a healthier environment together-with healthier economies to match.

Dhaka, Nov. 12 -- The developed countries should come forward right now in fulfilling their commitments to tackle the adverse effects of global climate change, said Information and Broadcasting Minister Hassan Mahmud. He made the remarks at a meeting with Scottish parliamentarians Foysol Choudhury and Sarah Boyack on Thursday afternoon at the parliament building in Glasgow, Scotland. The minister is now in Glasgow to attend the 26th UN Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) on climate change, reports UNB. At the meeting Hasan said, "Although some funds have been allocated from the World Climate Fund for tackling disasters caused by climate change, no funds are being allocated for long term adaptation yet." "As a result, countries that are at risk of climate change including Bangladesh have to struggle now," the minister added. He said that under the leadership and encouragement of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for climate adaptation, scientists and researchers of Bangladesh have produced varieties of crops tolerant to drought, flood, submergence and salinity with the help of local funding. In an interview after the meeting, the minister said that he discussed with the two Scottish parliamentarians on how to form a friendship group between the two legislatures and work together on various issues of common interest. Foysol Choudhury lauded the overall progress of Bangladesh and its leading role in fighting climate change.

Dhaka, Nov. 4 -- The International Finance Corporation (IFC) announced on Wednesday that it would partner two institutional investors - Allianz Global Investors, and Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) - to create a new US$3.0 billion global platform for climate-smart investment in line with the Paris Agreement, according to a press statement. The new programme - MCPP One Planet - would combine institutional investors' contributions along with the IFC's own funds to scale up climate-responsible financing for private companies in emerging markets. MCPP One Planet would create the world's first cross-sectoral portfolio of emerging-market loans - aligned with the Paris Agreement. The facility would enable institutional investors to directly provide capital for sustainable lending in emerging markets - allowing investors to scale up their exposure to this asset class and increase the share of their portfolios, aimed at climate-resilient development. MCPP One Planet builds on successful collaboration between the IFC and its partners, and would mark a further scale-up of the IFC's innovative private debt platform - Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Programme (MCPP). Announcing MCPP One Planet at COP26 on Wednesday, IFC Managing Director Makhtar Diop said expanding partnerships with some of the world's largest investors is fundamental to scaling up financial flows to emerging markets for climate-smart solutions, consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. "MCPP One Planet will create a global model for mobilisation of institutional investor financing in support of the climate agenda for the most vulnerable communities on the frontlines of climate change - in emerging and developing economies," he added. "Our strong partnership with the IFC and engaged investors enables us to shape programmes like MCPP One Planet, and contribute to climate-smart economic growth in markets of scale," said Oliver Bate, Chief Executive Officer of the Allianz SE. Huge sums need to be invested to bring emerging markets along with a Paris-aligned trajectory, and we are keen to help structure these public-private collaborations and mobilise the required capital, he noted. The HKMA has partnered with the IFC in the MCPP initiative, targeting sustainable investments across emerging markets since 2017. "We are very pleased to further our partnership with the IFC to develop MCPP One Planet, which aligns with the HKMA's commitment to green and sustainable investments," said Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA. Joining hands with the IFC allows the HKMA to tap into the considerable expertise, experience and network of the IFC in sourcing investable and climate-responsible opportunities with proper risk management and governance framework. "Together with the IFC and other like-minded partners, we believe that MCPP One Planet initiative will support emerging markets in accelerating their transition to low-carbon economies and provide the catalytic and demonstrative effect in the scaling of climate-responsible investments," he added. Meanwhile, in another statement, the IFC said it partnered with Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager, to establish a new fund to mobilise up to $2.0 billion in private investment into emerging market sustainable bonds that support COVID-19 relief efforts and promote a green, resilient and Unveiled on the sidelines of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland, the Build-Back-Better Emerging Markets Sustainable Transaction (BEST) strategy would be managed by Amundi. The $2.0 billion strategy would channel capital from institutional investors into anchor investments in sustainable bond issuances from corporates and financials in developing countries. This, in turn, would enable even more funding for such transactions, further strengthening the asset class and deploying greater resources in priority areas, such as climate and gender, it added.

Telenor Research, a scientific research unit of Norwegian technology conglomerate Telenor Group, has unveiled the seventh edition of "Tech Trends," highlighting how technology and digitalisation can enable a green transformation which it believes will define the upcoming year. Grameenphone revealed the research findings at an event in the capital Monday. The five anticipated tech trends for 2022 were revealed in a keynote and an expert reflection session. The core impression of the predictions for 2022 revolves around global climate change and its impact on the ecosystem. The trends predict how new-era advanced connectivity, climate-friendly energy-efficient modern hardware, edge cloud, and 5G technology will be more eco-friendly, increased demand for green job skills with institutions and digital learning platforms offering climate micro-degrees, an optimisation war between companies to make devices more energy-efficient and environmental-friendly, a surge in climate aware influencers and taking the next generation's expectations with importance to mitigate potential threats of the "great resignation." The report also has three tips on how businesses can avoid this threat once the pandemic is over. The trends are primarily influenced by the ongoing global pandemic and its consequences. Trend 1: Green clouds on the horizon Due to the immense growth in data usage, there is higher energy demand. Hence, cloud computing has seen exponential growth, and also edge computing is expected to take over by an acceptable margin in the coming year. Trend 2: Big appetite for climate micro-degrees "A growing number of businesses will implement green micro-degrees and courses as part of their 'curriculum' to slake the green knowledge thirst among employees. The businesses that fail to facilitate opportunities to acquire green online learning credentials on-the-job risk being perceived as less attractive in the eyes of new talent," predicts Sandberg. Trend 3: Optimise everything The global need for greater energy efficiency has the chance to trigger the "optimisation of everything" battle between consumer electronic manufacturers. "Going forward, more companies will put enormous sums of money on the table to acquire the knowledge and assets needed to come out on top of the optimisation battle." Trend 4: Here come the greenfluencers It has become imperative for influencers to acknowledge the young people's climate engagement, especially through social media. With the recent disappointments from the UN's Climate Conference ( COP26 ) and a grim outlook in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report fresh in memory, there is now an expectation of seeing a new movement shape the world of social media, that is coined "greenfluencing." "An undergrowth of climate-aware influencers and activists has emerged across niches on social media, and we believe their growing follower bases will be duly noticed by the influencer universe's established elite," explains Sandberg. "Influencers who appear oblivious or indifferent to climate challenges will be perceived as outdated. Instead, followers will flock to influencers who demonstrate climate awareness regardless of niche. Marketers will turn their attention in the same direction." Trend 5: Don't lose out on the 'lost generation' During the continuation of the pandemic, it will be tough for the young to establish and grow a personal network and acquire a general understanding of the corporate lingo and culture, as forming new social relations using only digital communication is much more challenging. "Many companies will in 2022 find that large groups of young employees who never got proper onboarding are likely to struggle - unless good leadership is exercised," says Sandberg. \</doc>

An agreement was signed on Wednesday between the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) and Chinese firm China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) to develop the country's first ever waste-based power plant in Dhaka. The power plant will generate 42.5 MW of electricity from the garbage in the capital city. Welcoming the deal, LGRD and Cooperatives Minister M Tajul Islam has said a new era will begin in Dhaka city's garbage management with the implementation of the project. Under the agreement, Dhaka city will supply 3,000 mts of solid waste to the project daily while CMEC will set up an incineration plant to generate 42.5 MW power and BPDB will purchase the electricity from the plant at US21.78 Cents, equivalent to Tk 18.295, per kilowatt hour (each unit) over the period of 25 year. A number of associated agreements were signed between the parties to implement the projects under which the DNCC will also provide 30 acres of land to set up the incineration and power plant at Aminbazar in the city while the CMEC will complete the construction of the project and start commercial operation within 24 months from the financial closing. The Chinese firm will complete the financial closing of the project within nine months of the contract's effective date. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB) will build required power transmission lines to evacuate electricity from the project. The agreement was signed at a function at Sonargaon Hotel in the city while State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid, DNCC Mayor Atiqul Islam, and Chinese Ambassador in Bangladesh Li Jiming also spoke. Tajul Islam said the project was undertaken in line with Bangladesh's commitment to the COP26 conference to reduce the carbon emission. Nasrul Hamid said similar projects will also be taken in all other City Corporation areas across the country. Mayor Atiqul Islam said the DNCC and the DSCC have been working together to introduce electric vehicles in the city as part of the government's commitment to green energy. 'No fuel-fired vehicles will be allowed in Dhaka city to run in near future,'he added. \</doc>

The state of food security and nutrition in Asia and the Pacific has worsened, as more than 375 million people in the Asia-Pacific region faced hunger in 2020, an increase of 54 million over the previous year, according to a joint report just published by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) on Wednesday in Bangkok. While hunger has increased, so too has inadequate access to nutritious foods, the report said. According to the 2021 Asia and the Pacific Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition, in this region alone, more than one billion people did not have access to adequate food in 2020 - an increase of almost 150 million people in just one year. The high cost of a healthy diet, and persistently high levels of poverty and income inequality, continue to hold healthy diets out of reach for 1.8 billion people in the Asia and Pacific region. In recent years, progress has stalled in reducing the number of undernourished, and the prevalence of certain nutritional indicators, such as stunting in children under five years of age, was already much too high, as reported last year. Since then, the situation has worsened. While it is not yet possible to fully quantify the damage done to food security and nutrition by COVID-19, the pandemic has had a serious impact on the region. Even countries that initially reported a limited number of COVID-19 cases experienced the negative effects of the containment measures, combined with people's health concerns, that led to a major contraction of economic activity in this region and worldwide. Disruption in food supply chains only added to the problems. The situation could have been worse without the response of governments and the impressive social protection measures they put in place during the crisis. In building back better food environments, future agri-food systems will have to provide better production, better nutrition, a better environment and better lives. To do that, FAO and UNICEF state the focus must revolve around meeting the needs of small-scale, family farmers and indigenous people in the region. Food systems must also prioritize the dietary needs of vulnerable groups, including young children and women. Commitments have been made to ensure recovery and there are opportunities to begin the hard work of advancing food security and nutrition through transforming agri-food systems such as the United Nations Food Systems Summit, the Nutrition for Growth Summit and the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ). Implementing these commitments will be needed to meet the second Sustainable Development Goal, SDG2, to eradicate food insecurity and malnutrition. \</doc>

The public-private partnerships (PPPs) are being recognised as a prospective source for financing climate actions in Bangladesh, State Minister for Public Administration Farhad Hossain said Tuesday. "Mobilising PPPs for addressing 'loss and damage' of climate change in Bangladesh offers a promising way forward," he said. Farhad was addressing a COP26 side event titled "Public private partnership approach to climate finance in Bangladesh" at Bangladesh Pavilion in Scotland's Glasgow. As an early adopter and advocate of climate change adaptation policy, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina continues to be a great example as world leaders seek to take action on climate change as part of the Sustainable Development Goals, the state minister said. Sheikh Hasina put forward a five-point proposal at the V20 Climate Vulnerable Finance Summit as the President of Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), calling upon the developed countries to reduce their carbon emissions drastically. Farhad said the CVF has also initiated a new programme "Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan - Decade 2030" to move from climate vulnerability to climate resilience and turn climate resilience into climate prosperity. "We are preparing the National Adaptation Plan and have finalised the interim nationally determined contributions (NDC)," the state minister added. He said the NDC calls for undertaking a number of mitigation actions that will help limit the country's greenhouse gas emissions, playing a key role in realising its shift towards a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy. \</doc>

Aug. 12 Thimphu(Kuensel/ANN)- The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a report recently warning of increasing heatwaves, heavy precipitation, agricultural and ecological droughts, reductions in the Arctic Sea, snow cover and permafrost. It states that it was "unequivocal" that human activities are to be blamed for increasing temperatures and that the 1.5\'baC global temperature limit will be exceeded during the 21st century unless reductions in emissions occur in the coming decades. "Many changes due to past and future greenhouse gas emissions are irreversible for centuries to millennia, especially changes in the ocean, ice sheets and global sea level," the report states. Following the IPCC's report, the Least Developed Countries (LDC) Group, comprising 46 countries including Bhutan, called for more "support to developing countries who are disproportionately impacted by climate change." LDC chairperson and National Environment Commission Secretary, Sonam P Wangdi, said that the report comes as yet another stark warning. "The science is even clearer: global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the climate crisis is worsening and the impacts will be devastating," he said. The IPCC report shows that continued global warming is projected to intensify the global water cycle, including its variability, global monsoon precipitation and the severity of wet and dry events. Sonam P Wangdi said: "We need to see developed countries and large emitters take the lead and slash emissions, and we need the assurance that this will happen urgently." He said that the countries were already experiencing the devastating impacts of the climate crisis. "In the last few weeks alone, the world has seen unprecedented and lethal heatwaves and floods. These will only get worse  more intense and more frequent  as emissions continue to rise." The secretary said that the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) must submit more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) that close the emissions gap. COP26 will be held from October 31 to November 12 this year in Glasgow. COP is the decision-making body responsible for monitoring and reviewing the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Sonam P Wangdi said: "Climate change is hurting our countries and communities worst. It's already late but by COP26 , developed countries must deliver their decade-old commitment to provide USD 100B annually and keep on increasing it as per the needs of countries facing climate impacts." He added that resubmitting the same NDC is not enough, stronger emission reduction targets were needed for 2030. "We really are running out of time." ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home \</doc>

Dhaka, Sept. 10 -- Participation of young people in the climate discussion with global efforts is mandatory as it affects the life, livelihood, health, and other socio-economical aspects of youths. Climate change is one of the greatest threats to the human rights of our generation especially for youth and it has profound impacts on a wide variety of human rights. Speakers said at a webinar titled 'Climate Justice: Capturing Youth Voice from Global South in the Context of Pandemic' organized by ActionAid Bangladesh on Thursday. The consultation was participated by young people across Asia, Africa, Central Asia and Europe, along with the young people from Bangladesh. Youth climate champions and activists from the various countries raised their voice, against the limited or no spaces to the various global decision-making spaces including in COP26 . Rebecca Sultana, founder of Youth Environment and Social Development Society (YESDS) and member of ActionAid International Bangladesh Society (AAIBS) General Assembly inaugurated the event as a chair. Stating climate change as man-made and we are to be blamed for it, Nahim Razzaq, Member of Parliament, Bangladesh and the Member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Climate change is evident and a great problem of today and requires changes to be made by all. He urged the governments to follow the Paris Agreement to ensure decent ecosystem for the betterment of the world. He also looks forward to seeing some change happened after the 5 years of the Paris agreement. Dr Saleemul Huq, Director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) in Bangladesh emphasised action rather than advocacy related to climate issues. "Advocacy is good, but it is not enough. Advocacy alone no longer can be sufficient. Action is more important along with advocacy and joins the forces of doers. Pick a problem of the locality and start solving the problem by building alliances of people. Action should be initiated locally first and then nationally to globally," Saleemul Huq said. Farah Kabir, Country Director of ActionAid Bangladesh said in a video message that young people around the globe want to take COP26 as an opportunity to raise their issues to bring to the global leadership. But young people are worried that the COP26 is not going to be participatory because of the issue of vaccination. She also expressed her concern that many countries of the world have not been able to vaccinate their population. The majority of the population who are not vaccinated are young people because of age bar and many other factors. She raised a question that "is this restriction supportive of participation especially of the young people and is a COP meaningful where there is no participation of the future generation and present young people?" Climate Activist Saila Sobnom Richi from 'Youth Net for Climate Justice Bangladesh' presented her experiences on the vulnerability of young people amid the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to climate change. According to her presentation, challenges remain to use cyclone shelter after maintaining COVID-19 protocols which negatively impacts Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR), Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), health and nutrition of young women. She argued system change for achieving climate justice and intersectional Justice for humanity. Among others, young climate Activists- Shreya K.C (Nepal), Disha Ravi (India), Eric Damien (Kenya), Neeshad Shafi (Qatar), Jon Bonifacio (Philippines), Manuel Vasquez (Guatemala), Maria Reyes (Mexico), Laksh Sharma (India), Khun Thet Paing (Myanmar), Joainta Babirye (Uganda) shared their thought and experiences for ensuring climate justice and meaningful climate actions.

Dhaka, Oct. 11 -- The economics of renewable energy have improved beyond recognition, because boosting investment in renewables is very vital to creating jobs, driving economic growth leading to reducing air pollution across the globe. Nowadays, solar power is the cheapest form of electricity in history and over 90 percent of power-generation capacity was added by renewables around the world last year. It does imply that to limit global warming to 1.5deg Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the world's energy systems must have to transform even faster. But that necessarily requires relevant action by concerned governments and public financial institutions to stop supporting fossil fuels and essentially emphasize on international support for the clean-energy transition, according to global experts. Thus, to meet the 2015 Paris climate agreement's 1.5degC target, the global energy transition needs to progress 4-6 times faster than its current quantum. This is necessary because fossil fuels still supply 84 per cent of the world's energy and account for over 75 per cent of global emissions can only meet the International Energy Agency's Net Zero by 2050 roadmap, which shows that global energy systems must have to be fossil-fuel-free by 2040. The Paris agreement was concluded since G20 governments provided more than three times more public finance for fossil fuels ($77 billion) than for renewables every year. The ongoing year's catastrophic storms, floods, and wildfires have shown why we need positive climate action as future prosperity lies in clean energy investment to ensure a clear economic development. In view of that, as wind and solar are now cheaper than new coal and gas power plants in two-thirds of the world. This dramatic cost reduction over the past decade has transformed global energy options, particularly in the very poorest countries, where renewables-based mini grids offer real opportunities to alleviate energy poverty and provide energy access, experts viewed. In the context of that boosting investment in renewables, vitally needed to to creating jobs, driving economic growth, and reducing air pollution. The International Renewable Energy Agency believing that deploying renewables at scale could help create 42 million jobs worldwide 50 and as such additional employment will be crucial for delivering a resilient, green recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, especially in countries with young, fast-growing populations. Of course, jobs will also disappear as we abandon fossil fuels. Therefore steps must be taken to ensure that every community benefits from the transition, which will require pragmatically carefully designed policies matching the newly managed shifting from older forms of energy generation. All these crucially require global solidarity to provide with the necessary technologies, expertise, investment support, and financial strategies. The United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) scheduled in Glasgow in November, governments and financial institutions have to commit to supporting cheaper, cleaner, no-regrets energy, and to ending all international support for fossil-fuel-based power. We recall, in May, G7 member states committed to cease all of their international financing for coal projects by the end of 2021, and to "phase out new direct government support for carbon-intensive international fossil fuel energy." Besides, South Korea, Japan, and now China - the world's largest providers of international coal financing - have also agreed to stop funding coal projects overseas. Thus, more than 85 countries (plus the European Union) have submitted updated national climate pledges, as outlined in the Paris agreement, showing a clear trend toward higher renewable energy use and lower reliance on fossil fuel. But to ensure the focal point by 2030, countries concerned will need substantial technical and financial support to achieve the success. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom and the European Investment Bank have both committed to making international support for the clean-energy transition a high priority. In 2019, the EIB became the first multilateral bank to announce an end to all financing for sill-fuel energy projects (by 2021). The bank has been increasing its investments in clean energy, including in developing countries to support their transition. In Kenya, EIB investments have helped build the largest wind farm in Africa, providing clean and affordable energy to the region. In March, the UK government put an immediate end to new public support for overseas international fossil-fuel energy projects, fully shifting investment into renewables. All these are the positive signals of a clear decision to unlock significant opportunities, building on existing support for clean energy provided by the country's export credit agency, UK Export Finance. This includes over &#163;140 million ($189 million) of financing for UK exports to Ghana, which will help Ghana pursue major national infrastructure projects, including an initiative for solar-powered clean water that will reach more than 225,000 people, according to latest reports from varied fronts. In the context of the facts as detailed above, the need of building more momentum in the process is necessitated to ensure the success of ensuing COP26 . But more strong commitments are needed to align international public support fully with the Paris goals. Here lies the importance of building solidarity by governments and public-finance institutions globally. The joint statement proclaiming support for clean energy and a phase-out of fossil fuels is the most important decision to taken in the ensuing COP26 scheduled in Glasgow in the best interest of human beings across the world.

Dhaka, Jan. 31 -- Speakers at a consultation on the formulation of the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) on Sunday stressed the conservation of the hill forests in Bandarban to save the region from climate disaster. The consultation was jointly organised by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), Economic Relations Division (ERD) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) with support from the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The speakers expressed concerns over the native species destroying plantation and horticulture practices. Although horticulture is bringing economic benefit to the farmers, rampant use of pesticides has emerged as a major threat to biodiversity, they said, reports UNB. Considering different vulnerability factors including extreme level water scarcity, deforestation, worsening biodiversity, flash flood Bandarban district was selected to conduct the consultation. Bandarban has been ranked second among the climate-vulnerable 10 hotspots in Bangladesh. The country on the other hand is ranked seventh among the climate-vulnerable countries globally (South Asian hotspots, World Bank, 2018). Additional Secretary of the MoEFCC and National Project Director of the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) Formulation Project Md Mizanul Haque Chowdhury informed the participants about Bangladesh's priorities outlined in SDG, Delta Plan 2100, Perspective plan, five-year plan and its ambition to graduate from a Least developed country to a middle-income country. "We are committed to implementing the Glasgow Climate Pact signed during the COP26 . We will work in close coordination with all the public and private entities, development partners and the people to keep the temperature well below 1.5 degrees Celsius and protect the biodiversity" He explained that the objective of the consultation was to understand the local vulnerability issues and get feedback from the participants on these for incorporation in the NAP. Mizanul Haque was present as the chief guest while Amal Krishna Mandal, Join Secretary, Wing Chief, Economic Relations Division (ERD) was present as the special guest. Bandarban Deputy Commissioner Yasmin Parvin Tibriji, chaired the consultation. More than 80 representatives from district administration, local government representatives, civil society representatives, sectoral experts, professionals, journalists and academia attended the event and provided their valuable comments and feedback to enrich the plan with locally specific climate adversities and adaptation needs. Participants from different parts of the Rangamati and Khagrachari districts joined over zoom. While delivering the keynote presentation, Professor Dr Ainun Nishat, Team Leader of the NAP Formulation Consortium said, "We will incorporate the locally-led adaptation practices in the NAP". He drew examples from the changing patterns of the climate and added that Chattogram Hill Tracts is heavy rainfall region and it is a major contributing factor to flash floods causing havoc. "We have to adopt measures on how to tackle such challenges", he said. For successful implementation of the NAP, he underlined incorporation of the NAP in the local, national and sub-national development planning and transformative capacity building. Khan Jamal Lusai, botanist and former academic emphasised on maintaining the navigability of the rivers and regular flow of water in the hill Charas would transform the life and livelihood of the hill people. "As there is no cultivable plain land, the hill people have no other choice but to do Jhum cultivation and produce cotton, vegetables and fruits". He also said that Jhum cultivation is not as productive as it was in the past. "We need to look beyond Jhum cultivation and introduce economic activities that support the livelihood of the hill people," he said. Ripon Chakma, executive director of Trinomul Unnayan Sangstha said that Use of herbicide and pesticide in mango cultivation is destroying the hill ecosystem. Large scale horticulture destroying the native species is likely to harm the ecosystem and biodiversity in the entire hill tracts regions. Rafiqul Islam, deputy director, Department of Agricultural Extension said, "We can consider conducting a study on season-specific availability of water in different regions. Based on the findings, we can erect permanent dam and reservoirs on an experimental basis and harvest rainwater". Buddhojoti Chakma, Correspondent of Prothom Alo said that destroying the biodiversity will only result in destroying the natural sources of water. Monirul Islam Monu of Kalerkantho said that Introduction of exotic horticulture without any study can be deadly for the biodiversity of the hill region. "Furthermore, we must stop burning our forests in the illegal brick fields and stone excavation." A K M Azad Rahman, Programme Officer-Climate Change, UNDP said, "Bandarban and the entire CHT needs special adaptation measures" He advocated for Village Common Forest (VCF), a traditional practice to conserve community land for ecosystem services among other adaptation measures. Amal Krishna Mandal said, "We are confident that we will have a country driven NAP that will document locally led adaptation efforts". Yasmin Parvin thanked the participants and said that The NAP should put utmost priority on solving the water crisis and land slide in the Bandarban as well as the entire CHT region. "We will continue such dialogues with all the relevant public agencies and stakeholders to address our local problem in a coordinated way." The country on the other hand is ranked seventh among the climate-vulnerable countries globally (South Asian hotspots, World Bank, 2018).

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday said global actions for adaptation to climate change have virtually remained ineffective due to the lack of finance and strong political will. 'To address this, developed countries must fulfill their commitment of annual 100-billion-dollar climate finance with 50:50 allocation for adaptation and mitigation,' she said. The Prime Minister said this while delivering her speech in the Leaders' Meeting on 'Action and Solidarity-The Critical Decade' at the COP26 venue here. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi convened the event. Sheikh Hasina said as the President of the CVF and the host to the South Asian office of Global Centre on Adaptation, Bangladesh is promoting locally-led adaptation in different countries of the world. 'But global adaptation actions are not being effective due to lack of finance and strong political will.' To address this, she mentioned that developed countries must fulfill their commitment of annual 100 billion dollars climate finance with 50:50 allocation for adaptation and mitigation. 'They also need to support vulnerable countries by transferring green and clean technologies at affordable cost,' she said. Despite being a climate vulnerable country, Bangladesh is a global pioneer on adaptation and mitigation initiatives, and resilience, said the Prime Minister. The country is planting 30 million saplings this year, and is going to launch the 'Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan' named after the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to guide the country's development trajectory to a strategic low-carbon pathway. The Prime Minister said Bangladesh has recently submitted an ambitious NDC (Nationally Determined Contributions). 'We've also drafted our National Adaptation Plan with significant enhancement of our adaptation initiatives,' she said. \</doc>

Greater ambition from the world is needed to fend off the climate crisis and greater funding for CVF countries will enable them to move from climate vulnerability to climate prosperity, read a new article published by global news magazine Newsweek. "That will be good for the 48 countries in greatest peril right now, but also for all those facing increasing threats. It is quite simply the right thing to do," Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, also chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, wrote jointly with CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation Patrick Verkooijen. In their joint opinion piece titled "More Funding is Critical for the Most Vulnerable to Survive Climate Change" they mentioned that though climate emergency is global, yet it does not affect everyone equally. Small island states such as Vanuatu, the Maldives and the Marshall Islands are being engulfed by rising sea levels. The vast and low-lying Delta region of Bangladesh, food basket for more than 160 million people, is being poisoned by saltwater infiltration and may soon become infertile wasteland, the article said. Extreme temperatures and severe droughts threaten to make large swathes of the Middle East, which is warming at twice the global average, uninhabitable. For the countries that make up the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), action on climate change, already urgent, simply cannot be delayed any longer. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), between $6 trillion and $10 trillion needs to be invested over the next decade to green our economies, read the article. Yet most CVF members are least developed, low or at best middle-income developing nations. They need support through both funding and expertise to help devise adaptation strategies to counter the effects of climate change, which scientists warn are already locked in for centuries. CVF Call At the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, the CVF will ask greater ambition to keep the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit on warming, a matter of survival for many of the most vulnerable nations. "We are also spotlighting the need to be more ambitious on adaptation because we are already living inside the eye of the storm that is the global climate emergency," the article read. And because of that, vulnerable nations are asking major emitting countries to join annual platforms at every U.N. climate conference to constantly raise ambition. But for the poorer nations, funding is essential to realize ambitious goals. "That is why developing nations have been so concerned that the climate finance promises at the U.N. of $100 billion in annual funding to developing countries is not being met," Hasina and her co-writer mentioned. COP26 . First, they will ask that rich countries finally make good on their pledge before the landmark 2015 Paris agreement to provide $100 billion a year to fund carbon emissions reduction and climate-adaptation projects in the developing world. Because climate-vulnerable countries are already living with the devastating effects of our warming planet, at least half of this funding-$50 billion a year-must be earmarked for adaptation. "We can then work on ways to transform these billions into the trillions needed to allow countries to move from climate vulnerability to climate prosperity," the article reads. "We know this is possible because investing in climate adaptation delivers great value for money," according to the article. According to figures from the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA), investing $1.8 trillion in five key areas of early-warning systems, climate-resilient infrastructure, improved dry land agriculture, mangrove protection and increasing water resilience by 2030 could reap $7.1 trillion in benefits. And studies show that the benefits of adaptation almost always return more than double what they cost, and often more than five times as much. "Second, and with these returns in mind, we will ask that the private sector steps up with discounted and targeted funding." Pension funds, with their $35 trillion in assets under management, and other banks and institutions that are custodians of the savings of millions of people, must look to direct their investments toward climate-change resilience. "As part of this, we will encourage financial institutions to offer innovative instruments such as resilience bonds, lending made for specific resilience projects at below market rates, or debt-for-climate swaps where repayments are redirected from creditors toward domestic climate-change projects. Look to the Seychelles, for example, which has swapped some of its national debt (held by the Nature Conservancy) in return for creating the Seychelles Conservation and Climate Adaptation Trust," the article reads. Third, also at COP26 , vulnerable nations are asking that the agreed revenues from carbon exchange schemes under the Paris agreement are channeled at the level of at least a 5 per cent levy on transactions to countries suffering the worst consequences of climate change. They are often the ones who have done least to cause it. The monies raised from carbon abatement schemes could be substantial-and so make a substantial difference. Research suggests that the IMF recommended benchmark of a global $75-per-ton carbon tax is equivalent to $0.17 a litre extra at fuel pumps, which would generate $40 billion additional tax revenues annually across Africa alone. Finally, they will ask that pandemic recovery resources be used with climate adaptation in mind, including some of the $650 billion of newly allocated IMF Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). These unprecedented resources should be channeled toward resilient infrastructure-roads and bridges that can withstand flooding, for example-and increased food and water security. Options are already being explored to channel SDRs from wealthier to poorer and more vulnerable member countries to climate-proof their economic recovery. A new Resilience and Sustainability Trust being considered for this purpose would be a very good start. Bangladesh, for example, is already sharing best practices and adaptation knowledge with other climate-vulnerable countries through the GCA's regional office in Dhaka, the article read. This includes its experience of adopting the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan, which aims to ensure funds are used to promote green growth as well as that the country's investment focus is on resilient infrastructure and renewable energy as well as the Climate Change Trust Fund which undertakes mitigation and adaptation programs to offset climate-induced impacts. Bangladesh spends, on average, 2.5 per cent of its GDP or $5 billion each year on climate adaptation and resilience-building. Nearly 800 adaptation and resilience projects have been implemented across the country, including 12,000 cyclone shelters and 200,000 hectares of coastal green belts at a cost of $450 million. "To make the most of this co-operation, we also need more adaptation initiatives," reads the article. The newly created Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM4C), for example, was founded to help equip farmers on the frontline of climate change with new climate-smart solutions and tools. With its three objectives of increasing investment in agriculture innovation, enabling co-ordination and collaboration and increasing co-operation, AIM4C is in a position not only to enhance existing efforts but also encourage their expansion. The response by governments around the world to the COVID-19 pandemic has shown what is possible when we face imminent peril. "We must harness this same drive in our response to existential climate threats," read the article. \</doc>

The UK government has launched its strategy to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, revealing its plan to lower its reliance on fossil fuels and transition to a green and sustainable future. This latest strategy comes ahead of the country hosting the two-week long UN COP26 summit from October 31 where the Prime Minister will call on other world economies to set out their domestic plans for cutting emissions, according to a report published in Rigzone. The Net-Zero Strategy sets out how the UK will secure 440,000 well-paid jobs and unlock near $125 billion in investment in 2030 on its path to ending its contribution to climate change by 2050. The strategy was unveiled by the UK government on October 19, 2021. The UK government said that this would provide certainty to businesses to support the UK in gaining a competitive edge in the latest low carbon technologies - from heat pumps to electric vehicles - and in developing thriving green industries in our industrial heartlands - from carbon capture to hydrogen, backed by new funding. Building on the Prime Minister's 10 Point Plan, UK's Net-Zero Strategy sets out a comprehensive economy-wide plan for how British businesses and consumers will be supported in making the transition to clean energy and green technology - lowering the country's reliance on fossil fuels by investing in sustainable clean energy in the UK, reducing the risk of high and volatile prices in the future, and strengthening our energy security. As part of the strategy, the new investment announced recently includes an extra $482 million to support the electrification of UK vehicles and their supply chains and another $853.5 million for targeted electric vehicle grants and infrastructure. The country is also working to kick-start the commercialization of sustainable aviation fuel made from sustainable materials such as household waste, flue gases from industry, carbon captured from the atmosphere, and excess electricity, which produce over 70 percent fewer carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel on a lifecycle basis. The plan also includes a $192.8 million Industrial and Hydrogen Revenue Support scheme to accelerate industrial carbon capture and hydrogen, bridging the gap between industrial energy costs from gas and hydrogen and helping green hydrogen projects get off the ground. An extra $688.5 million towards innovation projects to develop the green technologies of the future. Massive amounts of money - around $5.4 billion - will fund decarbonizing heat and buildings, including a new three-year Boiler Upgrade Scheme, so homes and buildings are warmer, cheaper to heat, and cleaner to run. Finances will be also directed to restoring around 280,000 hectares of peat in England by 2050 and treble woodland creation in England to meet our commitments to create at least 30,000 hectares of woodland per year across the UK by the end of this parliament. Around $165 million will be put towards the development of nuclear projects. Funding like this could support the UK's path to decarbonizing the country's electricity system fifteen years earlier from 2050 to 2035. Falling costs of renewables and the measures in the strategy also mean people's energy bills will be lower by 2024 than if no action was taken particularly as gas prices rise. The UK is also the first major economy to commit in law to net-zero by 2050. So far, the country has hit every carbon budget to date - with the Net-Zero Strategy it set out policies and proposals for meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets and keeps the United Kingdom on track for carbon budget six. 'The UK's path to ending our contribution to climate change will be paved with well-paid jobs, billions in investment, and thriving green industries - powering our green industrial revolution across the country,' Prime Minister Boris Johnson said. 'By moving first and taking bold action, we will build a defining competitive edge in electric vehicles, offshore wind, carbon capture technology, and more, whilst supporting people and businesses along the way. COP26 'There is a global race to develop new green technology, kick-start new industries, and attract private investment. The countries that capture the benefits of this global green industrial revolution will enjoy unrivaled growth and prosperity for decades to come - and it's our job to ensure the UK is fighting fit,' Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng stated. 'Today's plan will not only unlock billions of pounds of investment to boost the UK's competitive advantage in green technologies but will create thousands of jobs in new, future-proof industries - clearly demonstrating that going green and economic growth go hand in hand,' he claimed. \</doc>

UK's Minister for South Asia Lord (Tariq) Ahmad of Wimbledon on Monday expressed optimism that the citizens of Bangladesh will have an open and vigorous debate about the country's direction as Bangladesh approaches its next election period. 'Inclusive politics are essential for every country's prosperity, something that the Father of the Nation (Bangabandhu) Sheikh Mujibur Rahman knew very well,' he said, adding that the constitution (Bangladesh) emphasizes both transparency and due process which is a real guiding right to everyone. The British Minister said Bangladesh, on Bangabandhu's legacy, has built something quite remarkable and there is an opportunity for this great nation to go even further. He made the remarks while delivering keynote speech at a programme titled 'Bangladesh-UK: Partners in Progress' with Foreign Secretary (Senior Secretary) Masud Bin Momen as the chair. The event was held at the Foreign Service Academy. Lord Ahmad, also the Minister for the United Nations and the Commonwealth at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), said as a steadfast friend and partner of Bangladesh they value this unique relationship and friendship. 'Our message is simple - to all of you from all of us. I assure we're partners for today and for the future. As close and honest friends, we look forward to further strengthening this unique partnership,' he said. Lord Ahmad, who is also the UK Prime Minister's Special Representative on Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict, is expected to meet Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina during his stay in Bangladesh. He met Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen and Foreign Secretary Masud Bin Momen separately. 'The UK and Bangladesh are partners in trade, development, peace and security, and climate,' the UK Minister said after his meeting with Dr Momen. During his meeting with Foreign Secretary Masud, he discussed the outcomes from COP26 and Covid recovery. They also discussed Afghanistan issues and other shared interests and commitment to UK-Bangladesh friendship. The UK Minister discussed his aspirations for the next 50 years of friendship between the UK and Bangladesh, with opportunities for increased trade and investment, closer security cooperation, and UK support to critical climate projects. \£354mn announced for education in Bangladesh The funding will be used for two new programmes which will help ensure disadvantaged girls and young people will have access to a quality education. The first programme, called 'Educate the Most Disadvantaged Children', will provide catch-up and accelerated education for marginalised out-of-school children in hard to reach areas, focusing on girls and children with disabilities. It aims to reach over 360,000 children, supporting them to gain foundational learning and, where possible, re-enter formal education. The UK will work with the government of Bangladesh's Bureau of Non-Formal Education to strengthen the non-formal education sector and will fund robust research to build the evidence based on 'what works' to bring disadvantaged children back to school in Bangladesh. The programme will be delivered with partners, including Unicef and BRAC. The second programme, 'Education Quality Improvement Programme in Bangladesh', will provide technical assistance to the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Primary and Mass Education in Bangladesh. It will work alongside the government of Bangladesh to improve students' learning, strengthen the education system's efficiency and effectiveness, and enable adolescent girls to stay and learn in secondary school. The programme will be delivered with partners, including Unicef and the World Bank. Lord Ahmad said educating girls is one of the smartest investments they can make to fight poverty and save lives. 'Today I announced new UK funding of up to \£354 million to support education in Bangladesh, with a focus on ensuring all children, but especially girls and those with disabilities, have access to a high-quality education,' he said. The minister said increasing access to literacy and skills will bring benefits to children and their families and will drive Bangladesh's continued economic growth. Lord Ahmad will represent the UK at the Indian Ocean Rim Association Council of Ministers, as Bangladesh assumes the Chair from the UAE. He will also visit Cox's Bazar and discuss solutions to support the Rohingya refugees from Myanmar. Lord Ahmad's visit follows the recent meeting between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at COP26 in Glasgow, and messages of support for Bangladesh's Golden Jubilee earlier this year from the Queen, the Prince of Wales, and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Ahead of his arrival, Lord Ahmad said, 'I'm delighted to be returning to Bangladesh in its Golden Jubilee year and look forward to celebrating the tremendous achievements of the past half century with friends old and new.' He said the relationship between the two countries is founded on a shared history and strong ties. 'I'm confident that our partnership will continue to flourish over the next fifty years and beyond.' \</doc>

Australia has shown keen interest to help Bangladesh over Rohingya repatriation and building climate resilience. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison came up with the message while holding a bilateral meeting with his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina on the sidelines of COP26 on Tuesday. 'The bilateral meeting was held at the invitation of the Australian Prime Minister,' said PM's press secretary Ihsanul Karim said. He said both the leaders discussed the cooperation between the two countries and they particularly emphasized the importance of climate cooperation and Rohingya repatriation issues. The Australian Prime Minister said his country will help Bangladesh, especially in climate resilience building and Rohingya repatriation. Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh is a climate vulnerable country and Australia is also experiencing extreme climate events, including bushfire, floods, coral reef bleaching. 'Both the countries can work closely to build resilience against the impacts of climate change,' she said. Hasina mentioned that although Bangladesh is not historically responsible for climate change, the impact of climate change is severe on it. 'As such, it's important for the international community and especially major carbon-emitting countries to respond to the needs of the developing countries that are most vulnerable to climate change. And the developed world must deliver on the $100 billion dollars they promised in climate finance and make it a reality,' she said. The Bangladesh Prime Minister underscored the urgency for the transfer of green and clean technologies from developed to developing countries to effectively respond to climate change, resilience building and socio-economic development for the post-Covid recovery. 'If shared, many countries could be benefitted from Australia's technology-led emission reduction approach.' She thanked Australia for its continued support to Bangladesh over the Rohingya issue. Expressing concern for not having made any progress in repatriation of Rohingyas to Myanmar since 2017, Hasina urged Australia to exert more international pressure on Myanmar so that it takes its nationals back. \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 26 -- Current commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions put the planet on track for an average 2.7 degrees Celsius temperature rise this century, a United Nations report said on Tuesday, in another stark warning ahead of crunch climate talks. Governments will be in the spotlight at the COP26 conference next week to meet a deadline of this year to commit to more ambitious cut pledges, in what could be the last chance to put the world on track to limiting warming to below 2C above pre-industrial levels and ideally to 1.5C (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). As extreme weather events from wildfires to floods have hit countries around the world, a UN report in August warned that global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions could breach 1.5C in the next two decades, reports Reuters. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday it was "touch and go" whether the most important round of UN talks since the Paris Agreement in 2015 will secure the agreements needed to tackle climate change. The annual "emissions gap" report by the United Nations' Environment Programme (UNEP), which measures the gap between anticipated emissions and those consistent with limiting the temperature rise this century as agreed in the Paris accord, said updated pledges only reduce forecast 2030 emissions by an additional 7.5 per cent, compared to the previous commitments. If continued throughout this century, this would lead to a warming of 2.7C, slightly less than the 3C UNEP forecast in its last report. A 30 per cent cut is needed to limit warming to 2C and a 55 per cent cut is needed to limit to 1.5C. It said current commitments to net-zero could limit warming to around 2.2C by the end of the century, but 2030 pledges so far do not put major emitters on a clear path to this. As a group, G20 countries, which represent 80 per cent of global emissions, are not on track to achieve their original or new 2030 pledges. "If there is no meaningful reduction of emissions in the next decade, we will have lost forever the possibility to reach 1.5 degrees," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told a press briefing. "It is absolutely essential that all G20 countries present before Glasgow or in Glasgow (pledges) that are compatible with 1.5C," he added. THE CLOCK IS TICKING Latest U.N. data shows 143 countries, accounting for around 57% of global emissions, have submitted new or updated emissions cut plans ahead of COP26 and their total emissions are estimated to be around 9% of 2010 levels by 2030 if implemented fully. But if all pledges by 192 countries under the Paris Agreement are taken together, an increase of around 16% in global emissions is expected by 2030 compared to 2010, which would lead to warming of around 2.7C. Over the last 11 years, policies have been put in place which will lower annual emissions by 11 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2 equivalent by 2030, compared to what would have happened without these policies, the report said. However, fossil fuel production is not slowing at the rate needed, with major economies set to produce more than double the amount of coal, oil and gas in 2030 than is consistent with meeting climate goals. "On current progress, we'll close the 2030 emissions gap sometime in the 2080s," Myles Allen, professor of geosystem science at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the report, said. By 2030, to reach the 1.5C limit, annual greenhouse gas emissions need to fall by an extra 28 Gt, or be halved from current levels of nearly 60 Gt, over and above what is promised in updated pledges and other 2030 commitments, UNEP said. For the 2C limit, an additional 13 Gt cut in annual emissions is needed by 2030. "We have eight years to make the plans, put in place the policies, implement them and ultimately deliver the cuts," UNEP executive director Inger Andersen said. "The clock is ticking loudly."

Jan. 18 ABU DHABI (The Straits Times/ANN)  Singapore can work with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on solutions that reduce planet-warming carbon emissions to sustain "robust global responses to the climate crisis", said President Halimah Yacob on Monday (Jan 17). These solutions include hydrogen fuel and carbon capture, utilisation and storage. Delivering a virtual keynote speech for the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week Summit held in Dubai, she highlighted green innovations and efforts in the UAE, such as its vast solar parks and being the first in the Middle East and North Africa region to declare a net-zero commitment by 2050. Dubai houses the region's first solar-driven hydrogen electrolysis facility to produce green hydrogen, where the gas is produced using renewable energy and has zero emissions. Singapore is keen to collaborate with the UAE on improving the technical feasibility and the establishment of supply chains for low-carbon hydrogen, said Madam Halimah. Such advanced low-carbon technologies are an area of interest for Singapore, which has pumped $55 million into 12 research projects in the areas of hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage. A local study looking at the feasibility of using hydrogen as a fuel stated last year (2021) that Singapore would need to explore various supply pathways for price-competitive low-carbon hydrogen. It was reported in June last year that three Singapore agencies were studying whether hydrogen could be imported via ships or pipes. "We cannot afford to work in isolation when our planet's future is at stake. Cooperation, partnerships and leadership are critical," said Madam Halimah. "Sustainability plans and road maps, including our Singapore Green Plan, will need to be refined as technologies evolve, mistakes are made and learnt from, and the knowledge and experiences of others guide us onto better and wiser paths," she added. The Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) is the first global and large-scale sustainability event after last year's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Scotland. The programme  which started on Saturday and ends on Wednesday  convenes numerous world leaders, international businesses and students to accelerate pathways to further sustainability and meet net-zero goals. ADSW also acts as a global catalyst for COP27, which will be held in Egypt later this year, and COP28, which will be hosted by the UAE in 2023. Speaking from Singapore, Madam Halimah said on Monday that the Republic and UAE will be enhancing their bilateral memorandum of understanding (MOU) on environmental protection and climate change to include food and water security. The MOU  signed in 2017  identified environmental protection, climate change and sustainable development issues of mutual interest to both countries, and established a mechanism through which both nations can pursue cooperative efforts. "As we work to implement our respective plans, Singapore stands ready to collaborate with the UAE and other partners in the Middle East," added Madam Halimah. Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said in Parliament last week that there is "significant uncertainty" associated with technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage. "Their commercial success hinges on factors such as technological maturity and transboundary cooperation, which are not entirely within our control," she said during a debate on Singapore's green transition. There have been sustainability-related collaborations between the UAE and Singapore. Last year, a few Abu Dhabi organisations collaborated with Enterprise Singapore to hunt for start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises from the Republic that can help with smart city developments in the Middle East. The partnership is called the Abu Dhabi-Singapore Smart Cities Open Innovation Challenge. Mr Imran Hamsa, Enterprise Singapore's regional group director for Middle East and North Africa, told The Straits Times: "As global trading hubs, Singapore and the UAE share strong economic links and cooperation in areas such as innovation and sustainability. "Through this innovation call, we hope to uncover new and viable solutions that will accelerate the development of smart cities and knowledge economies for both countries." Ms Fu is in Dubai for the ADSW. On Monday, she attended the Zayed Sustainability Prize award ceremony, where Singaporean company Wateroam  which develops portable water filters  won an award under the water category. Ms Fu will be meeting various officials, including UAE's Minister of Climate Change and Environment, the chairman of the Abu Dhabi Department of Energy, and the chief executive of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 25 -- Saudi Arabia's crown prince launched a Middle East Green Initiative on Monday which he said aimed to invest 39 billion riyals ($10.4 billion) to reduce carbon emissions in the region and protect the environment. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the kingdom, which is the world's top oil exporter, would contribute 15 per cent of the funds and would work with other states and development funds on the funding and execution of the initiatives, reports bdnews24.com citing Reuters. "As part of the kingdom's leading role in developing energy markets, it will work to establish an investment fund for carbon circular economy solutions in the region and an initiative to offer clean energy solutions to help feed more than 750 million people worldwide," he said. Saudi Arabia would work to establish a regional carbon capture and storage centre, a regional early storm warning centre and a regional cloud seeding programme, he also said. When plans for the initiative were first announced in March, the prince had said it aimed to reduce carbon emissions in the region by 60 per cent and reverse desertification in one of the world's most water-stressed regions by planting billions of trees. On Saturday, the crown prince pledged that Saudi Arabia would reach "net zero" emissions by 2060 at the Saudi Green Initiative forum. The Gulf state is hosting the climate events ahead of COP26 , the United Nations conference in Glasgow, which hopes to agree to deeper global emissions cuts to tackle global warming.

Dhaka, Nov. 1 -- A UN conference critical to averting the most disastrous effects of climate change kicked off on Monday, its task made even more daunting by the failure of major industrial nations to agree ambitious new commitments. The COP26 Their commitment to phase out fossil fuel subsidies "over the medium term" echoed wording used by the G20 at a summit in Pittsburgh as long ago as 2009, reports Reuters. "Humanity has long since run down the clock on climate change. It's one minute to midnight on that Doomsday clock and we need to act now," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the opening ceremony. "If we don't get serious about climate change today, it will be too late for our children to do so tomorrow." As Johnson was speaking, Swedish activist Greta Thunberg retweeted an appeal for her millions of supporters to sign an open letter accusing leaders of betrayal. "This is not a drill. It's code red for the Earth," it read. "Millions will suffer as our planet is devastated -- a terrifying future that will be created, or avoided, by the decisions you make. You have the power to decide." Many of those leaders were due to take to the stage in Glasgow at the start of two weeks of negotiations that conference host Britain is billing as make-or-break. DISCORD Discord among some of the world's biggest emitters about how to cut back on coal, oil and gas, and help poorer countries to adapt to global warming, will not make the task easier. At the G20, US President Joe Biden singled out China and Russia, neither of which sent its leader to Glasgow, for not bringing proposals to the table. Chinese President Xi Jinping, whose country is by far the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, ahead of the United States, was due to address the conference on Monday in a written statement, according to an official schedule. President Vladimir Putin of Russia, one of the world's top three oil producers along with the United States and Saudi Arabia, dropped plans to participate in any talks live by video link, the Kremlin said. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said he had decided to stay away after Britain failed to meet Ankara's demands on security arrangements and protocol, the Turkish broadcaster NTV reported. Less senior delegates - many of them held up on Sunday by disruptions to the rail service between London and Glasgow - had more mundane problems. More than a thousand had to shiver for over an hour in a bottleneck outside the venue to present proof of a negative COVID-19 test and gain access while being treated by activists to an electronic musical remix of Thunberg's past speeches. PROMISES, PROMISES Delayed by a year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, COP26 aims to keep alive a target of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above - a level scientists say would avoid its most destructive consequences. To do that, it needs to secure more ambitious pledges to reduce emissions, lock in billions in climate-related financing for developing countries, and finish the rules for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement, signed by nearly 200 countries. Existing pledges to cut emissions would allow the planet's average surface temperature to rise 2.7C this century, which the United Nations says would supercharge the destruction that climate change is already causing by intensifying storms, exposing more people to deadly heat and floods, raising sea levels and destroying natural habitats. Developed countries confirmed last week that they would be three years late in meeting a promise made in 2009 to provide $100 billion a year in climate finance to developing countries by 2020. "Africa is responsible for only 3.0 per cent of global emissions, but Africans are suffering the most violent consequences of the climate crisis," Ugandan activist Evelyn Acham told the Italian newspaper La Stampa. "They are not responsible for the crisis, but they are still paying the price of colonialism, which exploited Africa's wealth for centuries," she said. "We have to share responsibilities fairly." Two days of speeches by world leaders will be followed by technical negotiations. Any deal may not be struck until close to or even after the event's Nov 12 finish date.

The assurance came from none other than the global leader's Vice President for South Asia, Hartwig Schafer, as he wrapped up his week-long visit to Bangladesh. During his visit, Schafer met with the Finance Minister and commended the government's measures to contain the pandemic, and its focus on an inclusive economic recovery. He also noted the strong role the Prime Minister played at the recent COP26 meeting, the World Bank said in a statement. 'The resilience of Bangladesh's people and the economy is striking. The Covid-19 pandemic hit the country hard, but the government's proactive measures have largely contained the virus and the economy has started to turn around,' Schafer said. He said that the World Bank is committed to helping Bangladesh remain on a sustainable growth path, which will require timely policy actions to build strong public institutions, a robust private sector and conducive business climate, and a skilled labour force, and at the same time focus on climate resilience. During the visit, Schafer also met with Advisor to the Prime Minister Salman F Rahman, Governor of Bangladesh Bank Fazle Kabir, Chairman of the National Board of Revenue (NBR) Abu Hena Md Rahmatul Muneem, as well as senior government officials, representatives from the private sector, and development partners. The World Bank Group is beginning the preparation of its new Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Bangladesh, which will guide its support to the country from 2023-2027. This entails a robust consultation process with a broad range of stakeholders in government, the private sector, and civil society, and with development partners, the statement said. In his meetings with government and other stakeholders, Schafer discussed their perspectives on Bangladesh's development priorities and how the World Bank can support these in a sustainable way. 'Bangladesh is an inspiring development success story,' said Schafer. 'As the country works to become an upper-middle-income country by 2031, the World Bank will be there every step of the way on a path to economic growth that is greener, more resilient, and more inclusive for the people of Bangladesh.' Schafer also visited two World Bank-financed project sites. In Bhairab, he met with micro-entrepreneurs who are using clean technologies in their shoe-making businesses. They are among the 40,000 micro-enterprises who are gaining access to microfinance to grow their small businesses and boost their incomes, while adopting greener and cleaner production practices. In Ashuganj, he visited a modern steel silo complex construction site. The World Bank is supporting with the construction of eight modern steel silo complexes in Bangladesh. These silos can store 535,500 metric tonnes of rice and wheat for up to three years while retaining their nutritional quality. Schafer also joined an event, jointly organised by the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges, BRAC and the F\'e9d\'e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), to promote road safety awareness and UN-standard helmets that are affordable and certified for motorised two-wheeler riders. \</doc>

Young people left unemployed by the Covid-19 pandemic can now dream of staging a comeback, thanks to a new initiative by the Uddokta project that aims to encourage entrepreneurship. Uddokta -- empowering entrepreneurs -- a three-year (2020-2022) project was initially a partnership between Chevron and global nonprofit organisation iDE, signed in 2019 under Chevron's Bangladesh Partnership Initiative (BPI). Now, Uddokta has partnered with the Embassy of Switzerland to take this noble initiative forward. The formal integration was done at a recent event 'Empowering people through our partnership' in Dhaka. Chevron's director of corporate affairs, the deputy head of cooperation from Swiss Embassy and the Asia-Pacific vice president of iDE attended the event. This partnership seeks to improve incomes and livelihoods of rural communities via enterprise development, creation of local entrepreneurs and strengthening market systems in Chevron BPI catchment areas of Sylhet division -- Sylhet, Moulavibazar, and Habiganj. In July 2021, Switzerland supported Uddokta through their Bangladesh Covid-19 response to increase the employment of youths and women affected by the pandemic in and around the project area. In this joint collaboration, the Uddokta project will help improve the lives and livelihoods of over 2,600 youths by supporting micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and more than 100 local cooperatives with a strong emphasis on gender inclusivity and integration. Apart from supporting the out-of-job youths, the project will focus on long-term sustainability through greater emphasis on climate-smart sectors in the four districts of Sylhet division -- Sylhet, Moulavibazar, Habiganj and Sunamganj. As the pandemic continues to impede the country's economic activities, especially for Bangladeshi rural women and youths, the partnership also aims to promote an inclusive and non-discriminative society, and youth employment opportunities. 'The new partnership is appreciated for their innovative approach towards supporting youths affected by Covid-19," said the director of corporate affairs, Chevron Bangladesh, Muhammad Imrul Kabir. "With global attention on the annual UN Climate Change Conference of COP26 , the Uddokta project will be prioritising green growth and initiatives for the betterment of rural communities in the future." iDE vice president for Asia-Pacific, Deepak Khadka said: 'Sustainability will be key to the programme as well as developing solutions to challenges and accelerating the results of the programme." The deputy head of cooperation from the Embassy of Switzerland, Corinne Henchoz, Pignani said: "Responsible decisions need to be taken to leave the world better for the future generations. I am hopeful that this project will demonstrate how to do this sustainably in Bangladesh." \</doc>

Dhaka, Dec. 13 -- - What are you making? - Houses of sand - But the water will sweep it away - So what? We'll build it again Such is the depth and strength of a conversation between Rudro, a young artist from the city, and a child from a fishing village. 'Nonajoler Kabbo' (The Salt in Our Waters) is the story of our fishermen and how their lives have been affected by the effects of climate change. The story moves through the journey of a young sculptor Rudro, who comes to the village trying to track where his father had visited long ago with relief material. The movie glides beautifully through the personal journey of Rudro, who believes his universe lies in the huge box where he carries all things dear to him, to the lives of the villagers whom he touched with his mind and actions. The timeline of this story continues in a time where the village was recovering from the aftereffects of a cyclone and on the verge of another. Notable for portraying the effects of climate change, The Salt in Our Waters was screened at the COP26 , 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow. "I believe that as a storyteller, it is my duty to bring up the tragedies of the people. But most people who hear about the lives of these people on the news, have an image of them as poor, unlucky people who are very resilient despite what nature throws at them," said the director Rezwan Shahriar Sumit in the premiere of the film in Blockbuster Cinemas. "I wanted to show them that beyond this resilience, beyond this misfortune, these people have dreams and aspirations, just like us. I wanted to make their image a bit closer to home while making you think about their lives." The dreams and aspirations come up in the stories of other characters as well, like that of the female protagonist Tuni's, her brother's and so on. The movie wonderfully blends the attempts to break through the chains of patriarchy, superstitions, power hierarchies with little nuances of innocence and dreams. The movie leaves the audience with melancholic feelings. On one side, one cannot remove his/her eyes from the beautiful colours of nature, it makes one think about the purpose of human life, especially humanity in the context of a challenging livelihood. Along with the splendid cinematography and colour grading, the intent behind making this movie needs to be remembered. The Gangamotichar, where the movie was originally shot in 2018, has now been swept away by the sea. It is a stark reminder of how climate change keeps on devastating the lives of millions every year by sinking many such lands. It also reminds us to be more aware as a society to bring changes in the policy levels to stop many such preventable instances and to be fiercer in our global fight to ensure the safety of our homes from the impacts of climate change.

Oct. 12 SINGAPORE (The Straits Times/ANN)  Almost 4,000 individuals and organisations from the global healthcare sector have signed a letter urging governments to safeguard the health of their people by taking bolder action to reduce their carbon emissions. Signatories to the Healthy Climate Prescription letter include two Singapore organisations  the Singapore Paediatric Association and Third Spacing, a podcast run by local healthcare students. The open letter aims to galvanise greater climate action from nations before they gather in Glasgow in Scotland for the United Nations' climate change conference, which kicks off on Oct 31. The climate meet aims to finalise details that will help nations take steps to implement the Paris Agreement inked in 2015. Under the agreement, nations aim to limit global warming to well below 2 deg C, preferably to 1.5 deg C, compared with pre-industrial levels. This threshold will help the world avoid the harshest impacts of climate change. "The climate crisis is the single biggest health threat facing humanity," the letter said. "As health professionals and health workers, we recognise our ethical obligation to speak out about this rapidly growing crisis that could be far more catastrophic and enduring than the Covid-19 pandemic." Hospitals, clinics and communities around the world have already been responding to the health harms caused by climate change, the signatories said. People are suffering from air pollution from forest fires, harmful agricultural burning practices and the burning of fossil fuels  the key driver of climate change, they added. Changes in weather patterns are also causing an increase in food-borne, water-borne and vector-borne diseases. Studies have shown, for instance, that the incidence of dengue fever will increase in a warming world. Said the signatories: "This year alone, major climate change-related health disasters occurred in China, India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Canada, Germany, Belgium and many other nations." Climate change can also disrupt food production and lead to hunger and malnutrition, while rising sea levels can destroy homes and livelihoods that are key to supporting human health. The healthcare professionals added: "Climate change impacts are taking a serious toll on peoples' mental health, causing post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety, and worsening existing conditions." The open letter comes alongside a new report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) outlining the intimate links between the environment and human health. The WHO COP26 Special Report On Climate Change And Health establishes the inseparable links between climate and health, and highlights 10 priorities for safeguarding the health of people and the planet. They include: protecting and restoring nature, financing the green recovery, creating energy systems that protect and improve climate and health, and promoting healthy, sustainable and resilient food systems, among other things. The 82-page WHO report also highlights action points that governments can take to achieve these goals, such as by phasing out fossil fuels and internal combustion engines in vehicles, investing in clean energy, and committing to protect at least 30 per cent of the land and sea by 2030. The Covid-19 pandemic has illustrated the links between man and nature, said the report. The outbreak of the coronavirus disease is likely to have animal origins. The WHO said the recommendations were developed in consultation with more than 150 organisations and 400 experts and health professionals. "The Covid-19 pandemic has shone a light on the intimate and delicate links between humans, animals and our environment," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO. "The same unsustainable choices that are killing our planet are killing people. WHO calls on all countries to commit to decisive action at COP26 to limit global warming to 1.5 deg C  not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it's in our own interests." ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Dhaka, Jan. 6 -- Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) practitioners are understandably aggrieved by some searing criticism levelled at them. Under gimlet scrutiny in trying times, the best of efforts stir more controversy. True blooded enthusiasts had seen it coming. The quick-fix solution seeking corporates threw caution to the winds when they missed the cardinal principle of horses for courses. The wrong personnel appointed took the heart out of CSR purpose creating a new brand of practitioners that began on the wrong footing. The theories developed were just destined to go the South. Added to this incongruity has been the increasing concerns related to the environment. Anyone worth the salt knows that the essence of CSR lies in careful retracing of the footprint impact of any business or industry. That should, ideally, lead to remedial measures. The obvious questions about sectors with no obvious footprints to address didn't probe deep enough. As businesses integrated in the digital world, some of it became clear. Thereafter, purpose list out in the internecine conflict of whose baby it was. The upshot has been the more sore-thumb targets sticking out even larger. Now that some form of convoluted focus has been given to Climate Change and Global Warming the bigger questions are being asked. Forget Genetical Modification. Traditional Agriculture is being looked at with suspicion for the environmental malaise. Multiple cropping, such a boon twenty-five years ago is now a bane. Tree plantation long considered as a measure of balance in bio-diversity isn't such a good idea anymore. Everything in proportion, we are told. Some forests must go to allow bogs and such to flourish because their carbon emissions are lower than-guess what?-trees. So much for sustainable deforestation! The kind doctor's advice on more veggies in diets is under stress-test. Over farming greens isn't good for gold old environment. Nor is an over indulgence in or artificial rearing of livestock. The average animal contributes towards carbon emissions and growth beyond organic is being frowned upon. It all opens up rude and deep wounds in whatever had been previously sacrosanct. Think of the poorer sections of the world where women empowerment begins through a form of economic emancipation fuelled mostly by NGO support. Small loans in poultry and livestock farming rings a bell. One that may now be compelled into silence! Small countries with large populations don't have answers to multiple cropping to keep granaries full. Those that point fingers aren't exactly making available surplus stocks to help. Nor are they opening up land subsidised into green fields as optional crop area. Increasingly irrelevant UN bodies aren't diverting funds from fat-salaried experts to transportation of food that otherwise goes to waste. Concepts have been slow to adapt be they economic or otherwise. Demand and supply, diminishing returns continue to be relevant. Over consumption spurred by over-aggressive advertising hasn't been theorised yet. Cost and convenience leading to the explosion in plastic consumption hasn't been thought through. The looming apocalypse of non-degradable waste dumping is a far greater threat to mankind than most know, appreciate or realise. Greenhearts put on a brave face in accepting the pared down outcome of COP26 . Something is better than nothing. There is, as of now, no agreed moot points of affordable alternative energy, agriculture and lifestyles. For that to be attained policies must rewind to get inclusive inputs. In business the CSR practitioner suddenly has a bigger, overarching role to play. For social scientist it's a far difficult hurdle to cross. The settlers in the Amazon forest believe it their right to clear up for agricultural land. For the indigenous such thoughts border on sacrilege. In riverine Bangladesh clean, navigable rivers are lifelines. Those that live by land grabbing don't necessarily share the idea. Governments don't seem to mind admitting that procedural and design flaws lead to burgeoning costs of projects. Businesses don't mind when product or service improvements bomb after high-cost years of experiments. When it comes to social cost or CSR projects similar albeit smaller debacles aren't viewed kindly. Innovation must be encouraged; risks have to be taken. True enough. Provided it's in line with conformity! HYPERLINK mailto:mahmudrahman@gmail.com mahmudrahman@gmail.com Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Dhaka, Oct. 13 -- The governance of the world economy needs to be overhauled to ensure it can withstand future health and economic shocks, as well as challenges posed by climate change and the rise of China, advisors to the Group of Seven rich nations said. Supply chains, vaccine distribution, access to critical minerals, cyber threats, digital tax, crypto-assets and climate change required a step-change in how the world economy is managed, the advisors said in a report published on Wednesday, reports Reuters. Mark Sedwill, a former head of Britain's civil service and national security advisor who chaired the G7 Advisory Panel on Economic Resilience, said the G7 should work together more effectively to identify and manage emerging risks or coercion. In China, the advisors said Beijing was determined to reach market dominance in areas such as artificial intelligence and biotechnology and had already done so in the refining and production of minerals key to the world's green transition. The panel recommended investment in new infrastructure and research, ensuring that trade rules supported the fight against climate change, and a commitment to information-sharing, traceability and standards reform for minerals critical to the green transition. The report will form part of discussions at a Group of 20 leaders' summit in Rome later this month and at the COP26 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in November.

Nov. 3 GLASGOW(The Yomiuri Shimbun/ANN)  Prime Minister Fumio Kishida pledged Tuesday to provide up to $10 billion (about \£51.14 trillion) in new aid over the five years until 2025 for decarbonization efforts mainly in Asia during his speech at a U.N. climate change summit in Glasgow. Speaking at the summit-level meeting of the 26th Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP26 ), Kishida also emphasized Japan's commitment to reducing its own greenhouse gas emissions. He reiterated the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 46% by fiscal 2030 compared to the fiscal 2013 level. Kishida said Japan would then go on to strive for the 50% mark, on its way to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. Kishida also said, "Japan will provide up to $10 billion in the coming five years" in additional assistance to reduce emissions mainly in Asia. This would go toward fulfilling a 2009 commitment by developed countries to provide developing countries with an annual total of $100 billion in climate-related assistance by 2020. In contributing to that goal, Japan has already announced its intention to provide about a total of $60 billion in public and private assistance over the years from 2021 to 2025. The aid announced by Kishida this time will bring the total to about $70 billion. In particular, the government will encourage the introduction of renewable energy through official development assistance and private sector investment supported by the government. Regarding thermal power generation, Kishida said, "Converting existing thermal power generation into zero-emission power generation is a necessary path," referring to a leading project in Asia worth $100 million to switch from using fossil fuels for electricity generation to instead using ammonia and hydrogen, which emit no carbon dioxide when burned. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Information and Broadcasting Minister Hassan Mahmud has said that the procrastination of developed countries to provide funds to mitigate climate change damages is not acceptable. Hasan Mahmud said that donors are not coming forward to help Bangladesh with funds to boost its capacity to tackle climate crisis. The minister made this remark at a COP26 side event titled 'Transparency Mechanism under Paris Agreement: issues, concern and opportunity for effective implementation in Bangladesh' organised by Center for Climate Change and Environmental Research (C3ER) BRAC University at Bangladesh Pavilion in the Scottish city of Glasgow on Wednesday evening. 'Bangladesh has the capacity to deal with the damage caused by climate change and the government has shown its capability to take effective adaptation activities', he added. He said that Bangladesh is an innocent victim of climate damage caused mainly by developed countries. But they are not taking any reponsibilityfor this. Yet Bangladesh did not surrender to the effects of climate change. On the contrary, it is working with its own funds at the directive or Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the minister added. He said that various initiatives have been taken by the government to produce climate tolerant rice. Especially crops tolerant of drought, flood and salinity. He also said the developed countries should provide necessary financial and technical assistance to the affected countries to address climate risk. Tanvir Shakil Joy Member of Parliament, said adaptation is most important for Bangladesh. Climate projects should be developed based on indigenous and traditional knowledge through consultation and participation of local communities. ICCAD Director Dr Saleemul Huq said the biggest failure of the COP is to meet 100 billion dollar climate fund pledge. The second failure is that there is very little funding for climate finance adaptation. Gerry Fox, Team Leader, PROKAS, British Council "stated that local adaption will be key to the future in combating climate change. In Bangladesh we are developing a climate finance ecosystem which brings together lead organizations working at local, national and global, creating a virtuous circle to strengthen adaption solutions that respond to community needs, and develop a system that provides the necessary MRV to encourage increased global funds.) Climate experts Dr. Salimul Haque and Dr. Atik Rahman spokev at the event which was presided over by water and climate expert Dr. Ainun Nishat. \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 23 -- The Mayor of Khulna City Corporation (KCC) Alhaj Talukdar Abdul Khaleque has said the world leaders should come forward together to save the planet from climate change impacts. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has raised a five-point proposal by attending this year's COP-26 conference and calling on world leaders to work together. He also has added earlier no other government in Bangladesh has taken such initiatives in the conference of parties worldwide. As Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable listed countries, the coastal areas of this countries are the most vulnerable. Although this area is closer to the Bay of Bengal, our mangrove forest save us from the severe loss and damage. That is the reason our honorable mayor urged to come forward for disaster mitigation through saving the mangrove forest, Sundarban. Besides, at the conference of COP26 , the world leaders and governments have agreed with Paris agreement and sustainable development in addition sanctioning 100 billion dollars together. Moreover, Including Bangladesh 141 countries have agreed to stop cutting trees and forests within 2030. On the contrary, he told that not only GO-NGOs, but also children's have also responsibilities in this regards. The "Coastal Children's Climate Conference-2021" was held on Sunday at Caritas Regional Office, Rupsha, Khulna, to bring it to the attention of Khulna children. Khulna City Corporation Mayor Alhaj Talukder Abdul Khaleque was present as the chief guest at the conference, which was conducted by JJS Executive Director ATM Zakir Hossain and chaired by Chairperson Zakia Akter Hossain. Academics, representatives of national and international development organizations, journalists, and other civil society representatives have joined directly and through the virtual media (via ZOOM) to share their views on the harmful effects of climate change and provided way forward to meet the challenges. At the conclusion of the session, M M Chishty, Director Program of Jagrat Juba Sangha (JJS), thanked all of the participants and children engaged. Children's representative Sajidur Rahman said, "I heard from my grandmother that before Sidr, our family lived in a village on the banks of a river in Koyra. In Sidr, our houses were washed away and we were compelled to move to the city. " At the conclusion of the session, ATM Zakir Hossain, Executive Director along with M M Chishty, Director Program of Jagrat Juba Sangha (JJS), thanked all of the participants and children engaged.

Bangladesh is focusing on renewable energy, energy efficiency and conservation to mitigate the adverse impact of carbon emissions, Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Md. Shahab Uddin has said. Speaking at a briefing at COP26 press conference room at Glasgow on Monday, the minister reiterated that Bangladesh has been making the efforts despite being one of the least emitters in the world. He said in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) update submitted in August this year, 'We have put forward enhanced emission reductions by 2030 amounting to around 90 million tons of CO2 equivalent in combination of conditional and unconditional commitments,' He, however, lamented that the global community still lacks a sense of urgency and a true commitment to implementing the Paris Agreement so that countries like Bangladesh can have a sustainable future. In this regard he said that commitment to limit the global warming to 1.5?, NDC ambition, common timeframe for NDCs as well as decision on Long Term Finance (LTF) are not decided yet. 'One crucial demand is definition of Climate Finance, which is yet to be agreed upon. There is no clear roadmap on $100 billion mobilization and new quantified goal. Urgent and adequate replenishment for Green Climate Fund and Adaptation Fund is also looked-for,' he said. Shahab Uddin mentioned that Bangladesh has recently scrapped 10 coal-based power plant projects worth USD10 billion. The country has also joined the global leaders' declaration to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina presented clear and concrete proposals from Bangladesh and as the President of Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) on November 1, the minister mentioned. Bangladesh looks forward a balanced and fair outcome at Glasgow by strengthening a 'common global commitment' for leaving a healthier planet for our future generation, he said. Deputy Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Begum Habibun Nahar, Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Environment, Forest and Climate Change Ministry Saber Hossain Chowdhury, Secretary Mostafa Kamal, delegation members Dr Quazi Kholiquzzaman and Prof. Dr. Ainun Nishat were present at the briefing. \</doc>

Bangladesh has urged the United Kingdom to repatriate the convicted war criminals currently living there to implement the court verdict as Bangladesh believes in the rule of law. Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen made the request when visiting UK's Minister for South Asia Lord (Tariq) Ahmad of Wimbledon met him on Monday. Dr Momen also asked them to facilitate visas for those working in the curry industry, which will create an opportunity for skilled manpower to work in the UK. He urged the UK to continue to remain engaged in the questions of Rohingya repatriation. Lord Ahmad assured the Minister of standing by the Rohingyas to help find a durable solution. The UK Minister expressed satisfaction at the recent understanding reached between the government of Bangladesh and UN for the latter's work on Bhasan Char. The two ministers exchanged views on cyber security issues and the challenges for religious tolerance and communal harmony. They talked about further accelerating the UN's work on promoting responsible behavior in cyberspace by involving the concerned private sector. During the meeting, the UK Minister discussed his aspirations for the ever closer Bangladesh-UK friendship with opportunities for increased trade and investment, closer security cooperation, cyber security and UK support to critical climate projects and quality education for girls. Lord Ahmad congratulated Bangladesh on assuming the chair of Indian Ocean Rim Association and recognized Bangladesh's efforts in managing the Covid-19 pandemic. Foreign Minister Momen thanked the UK government for removing Bangladesh from the travel restrictions imposed in the wake of the Delta variant. He commended the role of the UK presidency for COP26 on climate change held in Glasgow this month. The UK minister informed the Bangladesh Minister about the UK's funding support of 120 million GBP for climate action in Bangladesh, with focus on addressing the vulnerability of women and girls. Lord Ahmad also stressed the UK Government's priority in girl's education and announced a new funding support of 54 million GBP targeting female students and disadvantaged children affected by the pandemic. Earlier, Lord Ahmad delivered a speech on 'Bangladesh - UK: Partners for Progress' at the Foreign Service Academy. Lord Ahmad is on a three-day visit to Bangladesh to attend the 21st IORA Council of Ministers' meetings. \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 1 -- They can sharply cut greenhouse gas emissions and help communities and countries survive what is becoming a hotter, harsher world, Espinosa said. "Or we accept that humanity faces a bleak future on this planet." "It is for these reasons and more that we must make progress here in Glasgow," Espinosa said. "We must make it a success." India Logan-Riley, an Indigenous climate activist from New Zealand, had a more blunt message for negotiators and world leaders at the summit's opening ceremony. "Get in line, or get out of the way," Logan-Riley said. But G-20 leaders offered more vague pledges than commitments of firm action, saying they would seek carbon neutrality "by or around mid-century." They also agreed to end public financing for coal-fired power generation abroad, but set no target for phasing out coal domestically - a clear nod to China and India The G-20 countries represent more than three-quarters of the world's climate-damaging emissions and G-20 host Italy and Britain, which is hosting the Glasgow conference, had looked for more ambitious targets coming out of Rome. But major polluters including China and Russia had already made clear they had no immediate intention of following U.S. and European pledges to zero out all fossil-fuel pollution by 2050. Russia said on Sunday that it was sticking to its target of 2060. Speaking to reporters before leaving Rome, U.S. President Joe Biden called it "disappointing' that G-20 members Russia and China 'basically didn't show up" with commitments to address the scourge of climate change ahead of the U.N. climate summit. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson struck a grim tone, saying G-20 leaders "inched forward" on curbing global warming, but the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) -- struck in a landmark deal at the end of the 2015 Paris climate accord -- was in danger of slipping out of reach. "If Glasgow fails then the whole thing fails," Johnson told reporters in Rome. Before leaving Rome, U.S. Some observers said the G-20 pledges were far from enough. "This weak statement from the G-20 is what happens when developing countries who are bearing the full force of the climate crisis are shut out of the room," said Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa. "The world's biggest economies comprehensively failed to put climate change on the top of the agenda ahead of COP26 in Glasgow." While the opening ceremony in Glasgow formally kicked off the talks, known as COP26 , the more anticipated launch comes Monday, when leaders from around the world will gather to lay out their countries' efforts to curb emissions from burning coal, gas and oil and deal with the mounting damage from climate change. The leaders of two of the top climate-polluting nations - China and Russia - were not expected to attend the summit, though seniors officials from those countries planned to participate. Biden, whose country is the world's biggest climate polluter after China, the summit comes at a time when division within his own Democratic party is forcing him to scale back ambitious climate efforts. At the Vatican Sunday, Pope Francis urged the crowds gathered in St. Peter's Square: "Let us pray so that the cry of the Earth and the cry of the poor" is heard by summit participants. Negotiators will push nations to ratchet up their efforts to keep global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius this century compared with pre-industrial times. The climate summit remains "our last, best hope to keep 1.5 in reach," said Alok Sharma, the British government minister chairing climate talks. Scientists say the chances of meeting that goal are slowly slipping away. The world has already warmed by more than 1.1C and current projections based on planned emissions cuts over the next decade are for it to hit 2.7C by the year 2100. The amount of energy unleashed by such planetary warming would melt much of the planet's ice, raise global sea levels and greatly increase the likelihood and intensity of extreme weather, experts say. U.S. climate envoy John Kerry warned last week of the dramatic impacts that exceeding the 2015 Paris accord's goal will have on nature and people, but expressed optimism that the world is heading in the right direction. Sharma noted that China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, had just raised its climate targets somewhat. "But of course we expected more," Sharma told the BBC earlier Sunday. India, the world's third biggest emitter, has yet to follow China, the U.S. and the European Union in setting a target for reaching 'net zero' emissions. Negotiators are hoping India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi will announce such a goal in Glasgow. Some of the issues being discussed during the talks have been on the agenda for decades, including how rich countries can help poor nations tackle emissions and adapt to a hotter world. The slow pace of action has angered many environmental campaigners, who are expected to stage loud and creative protests during the summit.

The global warming, caused by excessive greenhouse gas emissions, has been a key concern of the world leaders for a long time. Over the years, they met at special climate conferences as well as at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) sessions to discuss ways to reduce the heat-trapping carbon emission to a tolerable level, now below 2 degrees Celsius, most ideally to 1.5 degrees Celsius in order to save the planet. The world's rich countries have long been the biggest emitters of harmful gas, caused by the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil. The latest big global conference was held in Paris in 2015 when the developed nations promised to cut down emissions to 1.5C and raise a $100-billion fund every year until 2025 to finance the climate adaptability of the most climate vulnerable countries like Bangladesh. The next United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26 , is the 26th such UN exercise. It is scheduled to be held in the city of Glasgow, Scotland between 31 October and 12 November 2021, under the presidency of the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, the climate change issues took a center stage in urgent discussions as the world leaders met at the 76th session of the UNGA in New York. The leaders raised it both during the general debate and also on the side-line conferences outside it. In these sessions, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina made an impact as she tried to draw the other leaders' attention, specially of US President Joe Biden, the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. In her speeches, she was bold and thought-provoking. Speaking at a closed-door meeting of the world leaders ahead of the weeklong UNGA debate, the Bangladesh leader voiced her dismay as the rich nations were not doing good enough to fulfil their pledges. She renewed her call for strict implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5C. Bangladesh is the chairman of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a platform of about 50 developing nations. Speaking on behalf of the vulnerable nations, Sheikh Hasina made a very pertinent point: the developing mostly non-industrialised nations are in no way responsible for harmful gas emissions. Yet they are becoming the victims. So, it is now up to the rich nations to compensate the developing and least developed nations in the damages inflicted on them by rising of sea level because of global warming, inundation of their farmlands with saline water apart from increased incidents of flooding, droughts and cyclones. In the process, tens of thousands of people living along the coast are threatened with displacement from their homes and become climate refugees. Presiding over the important conference, UK Premier Boris Johnson almost echoed Sheikh Hasina, but he said the US must come forward to make the difference. Johnson agreed with our PM that CVF nations are being punished for the climate wrongs they did not commit. The Glasgow conference is expected to be a landmark one as the leaders of the nations, mainly responsible for bringing the planet to this sorry state, have started realizing that it is time to act instead of making rhetoric and tall promises. Biden has proudly announced that the US is back to the climate change negotiations and is giving signals it is ready to substantially raise its climate adaptability contributions. Chinese President Xi Jinping has announced recently that his country will from now on stop financing coal-based power projects abroad. These statements have raised hopes about the outcome of COP26 . \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 6 -- Former US Vice President Al Gore is hopeful China and the United States will set aside their differences at UN climate change talks in Glasgow, just as they came together in 2015 to help hammer out the Paris Agreement. Speaking in an interview broadcast on Monday at the Reuters Impact conference, Gore also said China could surprise the world by bringing forward one or both of its targets for reaching peak emissions and becoming carbon neutral. Gore said frictions between China and the United States, the world's top two greenhouse-gas polluters, had to be taken into account. Beijing and Washington have clashed over alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, as well as military activity in the South China Sea, reports Reuters. But Gore, who shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for his work on informing the world about climate change, held out hope that tensions between the two could ease at the UN COP26 talks in Glasgow, Scotland, which start on Oct 31. "It's true that in the earlier part of this year..., it didn't seem as if the stars were aligned," he said. "Since then, we have seen a welcome pledge from (President) Xi Jinping at the UN General Assembly, announcing that China will halt its financing of overseas coal plants." Xi announced last month that China would stop building new coal-fired power plants overseas, after similar pledges by Japan and South Korea earlier this year. US climate envoy John Kerry had urged China to follow their lead. Ahead of COP26 'ABSOLUTELY FALSE INFORMATION' Gore said he believes Xi could pull forward one or both of the climate targets that he set at last year's UN General Assembly - that China would reach peak emissions before 2030 and become carbon neutral before 2060. US President Joe Biden pledged in September to work with Congress to double funds to help developing countries deal with climate change to $11.4 billion a year by 2024, and Gore said this could help push other countries to boost their pledges. An increase in funding could help achieve a global goal set more than a decade ago of $100 billion per year by 2020 to help countries vulnerable to climate change, a deadline that has come and gone without the target being hit. Gore also said he was hopeful about recent actions by business groups such as the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a group of investors with $43 trillion in assets that have joined a push to limit greenhouse gases to net-zero by 2050. But he called out efforts by fossil fuel companies pushing "absolutely false information to try to deceive people into thinking that the climate crisis is not real or not that bad, or that they have solutions in their purview". He criticized announcements by US energy company Chevron about expanding capacity of renewable natural gas (RNG), or gas captured at landfills and from agricultural waste. "That's ridiculous. There is no such thing," Gore said about so-called renewable natural gas. Chevron spokesperson Sean Comey said RNG, a fuel recognised by the US Environmental Protection Agency as having the potential to cut emissions, "is one element of our approach to helping transition to a lower carbon future". Despite being hopeful, Gore said the world was not moving fast enough. Without more action, extreme weather could lead to an increase in refugees fleeing developing countries, which can trigger "xenophobia" and "populist authoritarian impulses", in the countries they move to, he said.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will pay a visit to Paris, France from November 9 to 13 which Dhaka says will be a very 'extensive and engaging' one and take the relations between the two countries to a newer height. She will have bilateral meetings with French President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Jean Castex separately during the visit. 'Both the French President and the Prime Minister invited our Prime Minister to visit France,' Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen told reporters at a media briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday. State Minister for Foreign Affairs Md. Shahriar Alam said the Prime Minister's engagement in Paris will be very extensive and she will be given guard of honour in three places. He said many French companies want to invest in Bangladesh and there is interest from both sides to boost export and import to strengthen the trade relations. Shahriar highlighted the growing relations between Bangladesh and the European countries mentioning that there had been bilateral visits in Italy, Germany and Mexico in the recent past. Unesco's 75th birthday has further increased the importance of the Prime Minister's visit to Paris, said the State Minister for Foreign Affairs. Asked about the bilateral documents likely to be signed during the visit, the State Minister said they do not want to make a comment on that at this moment as they are still working on those issues. 'You know negotiation goes on even at the last moment, let's wait a bit.' Dr Momen said French Ministers and lawmakers are likely to meet the Prime Minister during her visit. He said the chiefs of many French companies and a delegation of the MEDEF (the Mouvement des entreprises de France, or the Movement of the Enterprises of France, is the largest employer federation in France) want to meet the Prime Minister. 'We're expecting that the visit will take the relations to a newer height,' Dr Momen said, adding that a memorandum of understanding and a letter of intent are likely to be signed to that end. The Foreign Minister said Prime Minister Hasina is expected to hand over the 'Unesco-Bangladesh Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman International Prize for the Creative Economy' to the winner on November 11. 'It's matter of pride for the entire nation.' Unesco is hosting the programme and the prize is fully managed and administered by Unesco. 'The Unesco-Bangladesh Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman International Prize for the Creative Economy 'will create a knowledge-sharing mechanism by capturing, celebrating, and communicating best practice in the development of creative entrepreneurship, according to Unesco documents. The objectives of the award are in line with strategic objective 8 of Unesco's Medium-Term Strategy for 2014-2021 and with the 2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions. "Bangladesh and Bangabandhu are one and unique which was reflected in the name of the award. This award will play a role in branding Bangladesh and boosting its image globally," Dr Momen said. This will be a proud moment for each Bangladeshi, said State Minister for Foreign Affairs M Shahriar Alam. On November 11, the Prime Minister is expected to join a high-level Paris Peace Forum at the invitation of Pascal Lamy who was the Director-General of the World Trade Organization from 1 September 2005 to 1 September 2013 for 8 years and a former Trade Minister of France. On November 12, the Prime Minister is likely to attend a high-level meeting marking the 75th birth anniversary of Unesco where she will highlight the achievements of Bangladesh apart from her plan on achieving Sustainable Development Goals. The Prime Minister is also likely to have a bilateral meeting with Unesco Director General Audrey Azoulay The Unesco General Conference, which takes place in Paris from the 9th to the 24th of November, will mark the organisation's 75th anniversary. Several important decisions are expected from UNESCO's 193 Member States, in particular on cultural heritage, on global education policy, on the ethics surrounding technology and the vital need for greater openness around scientific research. A special ceremony will be organised and broadcast live from Unesco's headquarters in Paris on November 12 to celebrate the organisation's 75th birthday. Heads of state including Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will attend as well as internationally renowned artists. The General Conference will elect the president of the General Conference as well as the Director-General of the Organization on November 9. The Organization's Executive Board proposed the renewal of Audrey Azoulay's mandate at a meeting in October 2021. On the occasion of the General Conference, she will present her vision for the future of Unesco. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will leave here for the United Kingdom on Sunday to attend the COP26 and other bilateral meetings. She will go to Paris after wrapping up her Glasgow and London visit. The Prime Minister will address the key segment of the COP26 on November 1 hosted by the UK in Glasgow. \</doc>

Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen on Monday said BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia is allowed to fly in any doctor from abroad for her treatment if she wants. 'If they feel that doctors from abroad would be much more helpful for her treatment, of course (it's) most welcome,' he told reporters after briefing diplomats at state guesthouse Padma on the current issues including Khaleda's health condition. The current issues also included UP elections, forthcoming World Peace Conference, Covid-19, Rohingya crisis and recently held COP26 . Dr Momen said whatever the former Prime Minister wants to do, she is free to do and can receive treatment anywhere in the country. 'But if she has to go abroad, then she has to go through the legal process,' said the Foreign Minister, adding that the government wants to uphold the rule of law in the country and it wants Khaleda to follow it, too. Talking about the UP elections, the Foreign Minister said these have been done in phases and they are very happy that the elections are 'inclusive' and the 'enthusiasm is very high.' He, however, said the only bad thing is that in some cases, out of enthusiasm, there are a few fatalities. 'We don't want to see any single fatality in any election. But I don't know how it can be done.' The Foreign Minister said they ask all the leaders that they should not incite their people in such a way they have to get involved in any violence. 'They should stop violence and they should only cast votes. Voters are really great and they never make mistakes.' He said this is an enormous election and thousands of people are casting their votes and the government is committed to a free and fair and transparent election. 'The government didn't interfere and intervene. These're free, fair and transparent elections.' Dr Momen said Bangladesh will host the World Peace Conference on December 4-5 where he expects a wider presence of the international community to promote peace in the world. 'Peace is essential.' On the Covid situation, the Foreign Minister said the pandemic is under control in Bangladesh but they are careful about the new South African variant. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a new coronavirus variant to be "of concern" and named it Omicron. 'In terms of Covid, it's under control. But we had to stop all the flights from South Africa to Bangladesh to avoid that particular variant,' Dr Momen said. Talking about the Rohingya crisis and their relocation to Bhasan Char, he said those who have been relocated so far have gone there voluntarily. "We didn't force anybody to go there." Dr Momen said the ultimate solution is that they must go back to Myanmar. The government has planned to shift 100,000 Rohingyas to Bhasan Char from Cox's Bazar Rohingya camps. \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 5 -- Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has spent a joyous evening with a new generation of Bangladeshi-British youngsters in London after wrapping up her visit to Scotland for COP26 . British Minister Penny Morton, House of Lords member Jitesh Gadhia and British MPs of Bangladeshi origin Rushanara Ali, Rupa Haque and Apsana Begum were present at the event. The prime minister, accompanied by her sister Sheikh Rehana, was overjoyed speaking to bright young representatives from the Bangladeshi-British diaspora community in London which included a broad range of talents - researchers, football players, musicians and entrepreneurs. The youngsters, for their part, got the opportunity to have a friendly conversation with the premier in a relaxed setting. The prime minister was attentive to their talk and posed for photographs and selfies. "I am pleased to see there is growing representation of them in Westminster. All four of them (British MPs of Bangladeshi origin) are women too." Hasina said she is confident that the representation of the British Bangladeshi community in parliament will only grow in the future. Hamza Choudhury, a British footballer of Bangladeshi origin, met Hasina at the event with his parents. The 24-year-old plays as a defensive midfielder for Premier League club Leicester City. After taking a photograph with Hasina, Hamza said he was honoured to have the opportunity to meet the prime minister alongside his parents. Sheikh Rehana, who was standing next to the premier, told the footballer that her son, Radwan Mujib Siddiq, was a fan of his. Syed Nishat Monsur, a British singer, songwriter, guitarist, and pianist of Bangladeshi origin better known by his stage name Nish was also delighted by the opportunity to meet with the prime minister.

The world has a viable pathway to building a global energy sector with net-zero emissions in 2050, but it is narrow and requires an unprecedented transformation of how energy is produced, transported and used globally, the International Energy Agency said in a landmark special report released recently. Climate pledges by governments to date - even if fully achieved - would fall well short of what is required to bring global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to net zero by 2050 and give the world an even chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 \'b0C, according to the new report titled 'Net Zero by 2050: A Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector'. The report is the world's first comprehensive study of how to transition to a net zero energy system by 2050 while ensuring stable and affordable energy supplies, providing universal energy access, and enabling robust economic growth. It sets out a cost-effective and economically productive pathway, resulting in a clean, dynamic and resilient energy economy dominated by renewables like solar and wind instead of fossil fuels. The report also examines key uncertainties, such as the roles of bioenergy, carbon capture and behavioral changes in reaching net zero. 'Our Roadmap shows the priority actions that are needed today to ensure the opportunity of net-zero emissions by 2050 - narrow but still achievable - is not lost. The scale and speed of the efforts demanded by this critical and formidable goal - our best chance of tackling climate change and limiting global warming to 1.5 \'b0C - make this perhaps the greatest challenge humankind has ever faced,' said Fatih Birol, the IEA Executive Director. 'The IEA's pathway to this brighter future brings a historic surge in clean energy investment that creates millions of new jobs and lifts global economic growth. Moving the world onto that pathway requires strong and credible policy actions from governments, underpinned by much greater international cooperation.' Building on the IEA's unrivalled energy modelling tools and expertise, the Roadmap sets out more than 400 milestones to guide the global journey to net zero by 2050. These include, from today, no investment in new fossil fuel supply projects, and no further final investment decisions for new unabated coal plants. By 2035, there are no sales of new internal combustion engine passenger cars, and by 2040, the global electricity sector has already reached net-zero emissions. In the near term, the report describes a net zero pathway that requires the immediate and massive deployment of all available clean and efficient energy technologies, combined with a major global push to accelerate innovation. The pathway calls for annual additions of solar PV to reach 630 gigawatts by 2030, and those of wind power to reach 390 gigawatts. Together, this is four times the record level set in 2020. For solar PV, it is equivalent to installing the world's current largest solar park roughly every day. A major worldwide push to increase energy efficiency is also an essential part of these efforts, resulting in the global rate of energy efficiency improvements averaging 4% a year through 2030 - about three times the average over the last two decades. Most of the global reductions in CO2 emissions between now and 2030 in the net zero pathway come from technologies readily available today. But in 2050, almost half the reductions come from technologies that are currently only at the demonstration or prototype phase. This demands that governments quickly increase and reprioritise their spending on research and development - as well as on demonstrating and deploying clean energy technologies - putting them at the core of energy and climate policy. Progress in the areas of advanced batteries, electrolysers for hydrogen, and direct air capture and storage can be particularly impactful. A transition of such scale and speed cannot be achieved without sustained support and participation from citizens, whose lives will be affected in multiple ways. 'The clean energy transition is for and about people,' said Dr Birol. 'Our Roadmap shows that the enormous challenge of rapidly transitioning to a net zero energy system is also a huge opportunity for our economies. The transition must be fair and inclusive, leaving nobody behind. We have to ensure that developing economies receive the financing and technological know-how they need to build out their energy systems to meet the needs of their expanding populations and economies in a sustainable way.' Providing electricity to around 785 million people who have no access to it and clean cooking solutions to 2.6 billion people who lack them is an integral part of the Roadmap's net zero pathway. This costs around $40 billion a year, equal to around 1% of average annual energy sector investment. It also brings major health benefits through reductions in indoor air pollution, cutting the number of premature deaths by 2.5 million a year. Total annual energy investment surges to USD 5 trillion by 2030 in the net zero pathway, adding an extra 0.4 percentage points a year to global GDP growth, based on a joint analysis with the International Monetary Fund. By 2050, the energy world looks completely different. Global energy demand is around 8% smaller than today, but it serves an economy more than twice as big and a population with 2 billion more people. Almost 90% of electricity generation comes from renewable sources, with wind and solar PV together accounting for almost 70%. Most of the remainder comes from nuclear power. Solar is the world's single largest source of total energy supply. Fossil fuels fall from almost four-fifths of total energy supply today to slightly over one-fifth. Fossil fuels that remain are used in goods where the carbon is embodied in the product such as plastics, in facilities fitted with carbon capture, and in sectors where low-emissions technology options are scarce. 'The pathway laid out in our Roadmap is global in scope, but each country will need to design its own strategy, taking into account its own specific circumstances,' said Dr Birol. 'Plans need to reflect countries' differing stages of economic development: in our pathway, advanced economies reach net zero before developing economies. The IEA stands ready to support governments in preparing their own national and regional roadmaps, to provide guidance and assistance in implementing them, and to promote international cooperation on accelerating the energy transition worldwide.' The special report is designed to inform the high-level negotiations that will take place at the 26th Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) of the United Nations Climate Change Framework Convention in Glasgow in November. It was requested as input to the negotiations by the UK government's COP26 Presidency. 'I welcome this report, which sets out a clear roadmap to net-zero emissions and shares many of the priorities we have set as the incoming COP Presidency - that we must act now to scale up clean technologies in all sectors and phase out both coal power and polluting vehicles in the coming decade,' said COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma. 'I am encouraged that it underlines the great value of international collaboration, without which the transition to global net zero could be delayed by decades. Our first goal for the UK as COP26 Presidency is to put the world on a path to driving down emissions, until they reach net zero by the middle of this century.' New energy security challenges will emerge on the way to net zero by 2050 while longstanding ones will remain, even as the role of oil and gas diminishes. The contraction of oil and natural gas production will have far-reaching implications for all the countries and companies that produce these fuels. No new oil and natural gas fields are needed in the net zero pathway, and supplies become increasingly concentrated in a small number of low-cost producers. OPEC's share of a much-reduced global oil supply grows from around 37% in recent years to 52% in 2050, a level higher than at any point in the history of oil markets. Growing energy security challenges that result from the increasing importance of electricity include the variability of supply from some renewables and cybersecurity risks. In addition, the rising dependence on critical minerals required for key clean energy technologies and infrastructure brings risks of price volatility and supply disruptions that could hinder the transition. 'Since the IEA's founding in 1974, one of its core missions has been to promote secure and affordable energy supplies to foster economic growth. This has remained a key concern of our Net Zero Roadmap,' Dr Birol said. \</doc>

A road map has to be prepared right now to reach the government's goal of increasing the country's consumption of renewable energy to 40 per cent by 2041, Information and Broadcasting Minister Hasan Mahmud has said. He said, 'From now on, if a road map is prepared, it is possible to achieve these goals gradually.' The minister made this remark at a COP26 side event titled 'Foreign Investment in Renewable Energy Sector' organised by the Power Division at Bangladesh Pavilion in the Scottish city of Glasgow on Tuesday evening. He told the representatives of Bangladesh's development partners present at the meeting that Bangladesh will benefit from the use of modern technology and financial assistance to reach its green energy targets by 2041. There is no alternative to green energy to make the global mitigation efforts a success, the minister added. He said that Bangladesh is an innocent climate victim due to the continuous carbon emissions of the developed countries of the world. But they are not giving any compensation or technical assistance for causing this damage. About the development in the power and energy sector in the country, Hasan Mahmud said per capita income and average life expectancy have increased due to the development of this sector. The living standard of the people has improved. 'Now people in remote areas of the country have access to electricity, their income has also increased.' Besides, he said Bangladesh has become a middle-income country this year thanks increasing electricity coverage. Now the per capita income stands at $2250. Noting that remarkable development has been achieved in the power and energy sector under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the minister said 100% of the people of the country will get access to electricity by the end this year. When Sheikh Hasina took over as the prime minister in 2009, her government inherited only 3,500 MW of electricity, which in the last 12 years has increased to 24,000 MW. Secretary of the Power Division Md Habibur Rahman, Chairman of Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (Sreda) Mohammad Alauddin, Director General of Power Cell Mohammad Hossain and Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF) Deputy Managing Director Fazle Rabbi Sadeque Ahmed were present at the event among others. \</doc>

Nov. 11 Kolkata(The Statesman/ANN)- Even as the ongoing Climate Summit at Glasgow ( COP26 ) is trying to sort out ongoing debates on what is being increasingly described as the biggest challenge confronting humanity, there is increasing evidence that past efforts have not succeeded in keeping temperature rise to below 2 degree C and closer to 1.5 degree C. Where is the missing link? Will this missing link get adequate attention at COP26 ? The missing link here refers to the failure to involve and mobilize small farmers and workers adequately. Of course, there is widespread agreement that they will be impacted most severely by climate change. So why have they not been adequately informed and mobilized? A common belief is that the issue of climate change is too scientific and technical to be taken to peasants and workers. But this belief is not justified as people certainly understand the issue when it is contextualized properly with their reality, as I observed in the context of holding workshops on this issue in remote villages. Small farmers are most capable of the kind of caring cultivation that is needed for climate change mitigation. Big companies cannot do this kind of cultivation with their heavily mechanized work based on polluting, hazardous inputs and centralised decisions. Basically, the cultivation that is needed is of a kind which will conserve soil and water and increase the organic content of soil. For this it is also very important to protect or regenerate earthworms and micro- organisms in soil which can contribute all the time by their natural actions to increasing organic content of soil. The mixed cropping systems, arranging organic manure and composting, the careful tending of soil  all this is best achieved by small farmers. Soil with an increasing organic content can absorb high amounts of carbon dioxide, while by avoiding chemical fertilizers very damaging pollution by nitrous oxide (a much more damaging greenhouse gas compared to carbon dioxide) is avoided. To regenerate degraded forests, landless workers in particular can make a very important contribution. While in several places, forests will regenerate once the degraded area is protected for some time, wherever afforestation work is needed, this must also be based on indigenous species known for their contribution to social and water conservation, for fodder and fruits and other nutritious edibles, trying to mimic local natural forests. This is just the kind of work that can creatively combine mitigation as well as adaptation. The regenerated forests and pastures contribute to greater absorption of greenhouse gases, and at the same time increase prospects of sustainable, self-reliant livelihoods, increasing resilience of communities in difficult times of climate change. Organizations of small workers and landless workers should be increasingly involved in these issues. Many urban workers such as construction workers, quarry workers and others working in the open will have to face much higher heat stress as climate change advances. Domestic workers and homeless persons, including migrant workers coming for shorter durations, will also face problems of increased heat stress. In industries involving thermal stress, this is an acute problem even in normal times; this will increase with climate change. Remedial actions can be found best by engaging workers in these issues closely. While they can be most effective in suggesting adaptation measures, sometimes they can also come up with suggestions for mitigation aspects as well. Organizations of these workers should be involved in efforts to take timely steps. However, budgets are needed to step up all these efforts. Domestic availability of funds for all these activities has been very limited compared to the needs in most countries of the Global South including India. While efforts to increase domestic funding should be made, the realistic situation on the basis of trends indicates only limited possibilities and this will not be adequate keeping in view the more urgent need to tackle climate change challenges. This is why a lot of hope was reposed by Global South countries in the international climate fund. Unfortunately, the Climate Fund has lagged behind in fulfilling its target of annual contribution of $100 billion. In addition, the target of $100 billion has itself been found to be too inadequate keeping in view the enormity of challenges. Some idea of this inadequacy can be obtained from comparison with some other statistics. The total wealth of the world's billionaires is US $13,000 billion in 2021, according to Forbes listing of billionaires. The net worth of four billionaires is well over $100 billion each  Jeff Bezos at $177 billion, Elon Musk at $151 billion, Bernard Arnault at $150 billion and Bill Gates at $124 billion. The wealth of the world's billionaires increased from $8000 billion to $13000 billion dollars in just one year from 2020 to 2021. The total military expenditure of just the USA is $778 billion. The total amount spent on the war on terror following 9/11 during the next 20 or so years was $5800 billion, according to a Brown University analysis, out of which $2300 billion was spent in Afghanistan alone. The spending on alcoholic beverages in the USA alone in one year is $252 billion. The spending on cigarettes in the USA and the EU in one year is over $210 billion. The total trade in the world in a year is $17000 billion. Total external debt of Africa in one year is $726 billion. Clearly the annual commitment of $100 billion should be increased. Also the main component of this should be linked to those climate change mitigation and adaptation actions which are linked to sustainable livelihoods of workers and peasants. This will help in climate actions emerging in the form of a people's movement with firm roots. (The writer is Honorary Convener of Campaign to Save Earth.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday said Bangladesh expects the UK to promote the interests and priorities of climate vulnerable countries to international platforms. She said this when COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma met her at her official residence Ganobhaban. PM's Press Secretary Ihsanul Karim briefed reporters after the meeting. He said they discussed various issues like the climate change situation, its global adverse impacts, mitigation and Climate Change Fund and Covid-19 pandemic. Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh is going to be the worst affected like some other countries across the globe due to the climate change even though the carbon emission of these countries are very negligible. 'We'll be affected massively,' she said. Hasina said the government has taken various programmes to increase the renewable energy use in mitigating the demand for power. She said there are currently some 5.8 million solar power connections in Bangladesh. The Prime Minister said her government and the Awami League as a party are engaged in massive tree plantation to improve the environment of the country. Talking about the Covid-19 pandemic and vaccination, the Prime Minister said the government has adopted various measures to run the economy apart from containing the coronavirus infection although Bangladesh is a densely populated country.

Md Habibur Rahman, Secretary of Power Division, made the observation in an exclusive interview with Energy and Power Editor Mollah Amzad Hossain. Before the commencement of COP26 , the entire world was now facing a gas and coal crisis due to the global fuel market crash. The EU countries including the host United Kingdom are now huffing and puffing for ensuring supply of primary fuel. How is this going to impact the power generation cost of Bangladesh? It is undeniable that the cost of power generation would increase as a consequence of the global fuel market crash. But the increase in retail price of electricity depends on the government's policy decision. We are working on determining the actual impact of fuel price increase on the bulk and retail prices of power. What are achievements the power sector has so far made in implementation of the unconditional 5% reduction of emission as committed in the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)? The amended NDC is an even higher target? What steps are you taking to achieve that? Bangladesh has submitted the NDC to the UNFCCC in September 2015. In the NDC, Bangladesh had set an unconditional target of 5% and with a conditional target, the overall goal set at 15% Greenhouse Gas emission reduction in the power, industry and transport sector by 2030. Later in August 2021, the country submitted the revised NDC. Energy, Agriculture and Waste have been added to power, industry and transport sectors in the revised NDC. The new unconditional and conditional combined target is 21.85%. In addition to individual ministries and taking required initiatives on a national basis, the environment, forest and climate ministries have launched various initiatives. Power and energy ministries over achieved the original NDC target. Bangladesh has invested more than originally set target in mitigation programs though it could not draw any financial support from the climate fund. The power sector would not have any problem in achieving an unconditional target as the preparation for this is already made. The Power Division is now working with the climate change and forest ministry and Economic Relations Division (ERD) for getting finance for the new projects from the climate fund under the conditional target. Bangladesh despite no obligation has rescinded 10 coal power projects. Environmental activists have termed this as a good initiative. But this has pushed the power sector to higher priced LNG dependence. Are you planning to take any initiative for finance from the Green Climate Fund for this? You are aware that the carbon footprint of Bangladesh is negligible. But our Prime Minister, being President of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, has taken the decision to cancel 10 coal power projects giving this utmost priority attention. In the changed circumstances we have updated the power generation plan. Work is ongoing for formulating a comprehensive Power and Energy Sector Master Plan with the assistance of JICA. We will have an idea of appropriate fuel mix from this master plan. This would also give an idea about the level of investment required. The international community, especially the industrially developed countries of affluent economies, must take the lead investing in green renewable energy development as these are still very costly. Bangladesh must get adequate financing from the GCF being one of the most climate vulnerable countries. Bangladesh has adopted advanced technologies for power generation for greater fuel efficiency. This is assisting in restricting carbon emissions. It is being told that Bangladesh must approach for additional financing from GCF by producing actual data and information of the size and level of investment it is making for reducing the emissions. What are your views? Bangladesh itself is a net carbon negative country; still it is suffering a great deal from global warming effects and impacts. Bangladesh has taken various initiatives including adoption of modern technologies for power generation. Without waiting for external assistance, Bangladesh is investing from its own source and has adopted state-of-the-art and modern less-emitting technologies for power generation. Bangladesh is a worthy candidate for global assistance as a 'Climate Vulnerable Country' for using expensive modern technology for power generation. Bangladesh can definitely approach for required finance from the GCF for continued use of modern technology for power generation. Recent studies state that the use of fossil fuel in developed countries would double by 2030 from the present level. What would actually happen to emission control? Will not that ultimately create impediment to achieving global warming restriction below 1.5 degree Celsius by 2100? If we talk about our own implementation of programs by 2030, our generation capacity would grow to 46,000 MW. That would be double our present capacity. The requirement of primary fuel would also be doubled. But using fossil fuel for power generation would not make any noticeable impacts on global warming. But the developed countries, not reducing the use of fossil fuel, would definitely make achieving the global warming restriction target below 1.5 degree Celsius extremely challenging. The Power Division would be present alongside other ministries and divisions at COP26 . What achievements and challenges of the Bangladesh power sector would you present before the world community in the side events? Yes, we are participating in COP26 with a definite mission and objective. We have planned for an event on renewable energy there. We would present the current status and project the future plan, challenges of implementation and requirements of possible investments. It is being said that renewable energy would contribute 40% of the total power generation by 2041. How realistic is this projection in your opinion? In 2021 this contribution is only 3%. What are the plans of the power division for getting global financial assistance and technical collaborations for achieving the target? True contribution of renewable energy to the total generation capacity is very low now. Yet over the last 10 years, several initiatives have been launched towards the right directions. Further to that power division has formulated time tested policies, adopted implementation plans, initiated actions for large capacity renewable power generation plants, adopted alternative to traditional technology based renewable power generation options and import initiatives for renewable power from regional countries. The government has set up the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA) as a nodal agency for RE. In consideration of the prevailing situation, an initiative has been taken to update the RE policy. Initiative has also been taken for formulating and adopting a Solar Roadmap. Multimodal use of land has been thought of as a way to overcome issues of land availability for large grid solar power plants. Survey is going on for offshore wind power generation. RE targets can be achieved if all these are implemented. The Power Division has taken initiatives for achieving global financial and technical assistance for achieving the government planned targets like setting up power plants through private sector entrepreneurs, innovative financing, public-private partnership etc. Solar Home System (SHS) is a milestone achievement of Bangladesh. Around 5.8 million SHSs have so far been installed. Introduction of net-metering has given new dimensions to rooftop solar installation. But there are issues of financing. How would you attract investment here? Among various RE options till now, solar appears as the main prospect. We have extended electricity supply to more than 2 crore population through 60 lakhs SHSs. This was an epoch making achievement. Introduction of net-metering is also a time-tested decision as the power grid has been extended all nook and corner of the country. Now a consumer has also become a producer and he can now be called a prosumer. RE extension has truly got a new dimension with the introduction of net-metering, which is mostly happening in the industrial sector. As such not much investment from global sources would be essential here, I believe. Another achievement of Bangladesh is the ongoing works for achieving 15% energy efficiency through formulation and adoption of Energy Efficiency and Conservation Roadmap. By this time 7% EE has been achieved. Is there any plan of the government for developing an information database on annual carbon emission reduction through this initiative? The targets for 15% reduction of energy use by 2021 and 20% by 2030 were set in the Energy Efficiency and Energy Conservation Roadmap 2030 for reducing carbon emission and efficient use of energy. Notable success has already been achieved here for the government setting up SREDA and taking other relevant initiatives. SREDA is already working on assessing how much emission is reduced annually and how much energy efficiency is being achieved? A program has also been adopted under the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target. The World Community could not yet reach any consensus on Carbon Market Mechanism for finalizing the Paris Rule Book or in other words a decision on article 6. It is expected that the Glasgow summit would have a meeting of minds. What are your thoughts about this? Will Bangladesh also benefit if carbon trading commences globally? Industrially developed and economically affluent countries can assist climate vulnerable LDCs and developing countries financially and technically in implementing various projects for reducing carbon emissions through their NDCs per article 6. This would create a strong carbon market mechanism. Bangladesh is really hopeful that the Glasgow summit would reach an effective agreement about article 6. Climate vulnerable countries like Bangladesh can adopt and implement various projects for adaptation and mitigation of climate change impacts if this happens. Power generation in Bangladesh is still almost 100% dependent on traditional fossil fuel. But the Prime Minister is strongly in favor of low carbon development. What are the plans of the power sector for achieving the Net Zero emission target? We are giving greater emphasis on RE development though we are still almost exclusively reliant on fossil fuel. We are aware that solar is our main source, but we are emphasizing on wind energy. We have taken up projects for power generation from municipal solid wastes. We are going to have nuclear power soon. We are in continuous discussions with neighbors for importing hydropower. We hope that by 2050 we will see a green energy-based power sector of Bangladesh. \</doc>

Projects to tackle climate change and protect the world's oceans have been given a major boost with the first \£316.2 million of funding from the UK's \£3500 million Blue Planet Fund. In Bangladesh, the Ocean Country Partnership Programme (OCPP) will support aquatic food production and trade, said the British High Commission in Dhaka. It put in place the systems and ability to reduce the harmful impacts of aquatic food production, control common diseases of fish and seafood, and increase production. This in turn will also support progress towards several UN Sustainable Development Goals on poverty alleviation, zero hunger and good health and well-being, said the High Commission. The new programme builds on an existing strong cooperation between the UK's Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, WorldFish, and the Bangladesh Government's Department of Fisheries. The programmes, financed from the UK's overseas aid budget, will increase marine protection, tackle plastic pollution and the decline of global coral reefs, as well as using the UK's world-leading expertise to help respond to marine pollution disasters such as the Xpress Pearl in Sri Lanka. The ocean is a critical carbon sink which every year absorbs almost a third of global CO2 emissions. Around the globe, the ocean supports the livelihoods of one in every ten people, including some of the poorest and most vulnerable. In the run up to the UK hosting the COP26 climate talks in November, the government is working with developing countries to take action to protect and restore our oceans. The projects receiving funding include the launch of a new UK-led programme which will help developing countries partner with the UK's world-leading scientists to better manage marine protected areas, and improve our understanding of the impacts of climate change and contaminants in the ocean. The Ocean Country Partnership Programme (OCPP) already has work underway with UK scientists at the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) providing analysis of water samples from Sri Lanka to contribute to the ongoing response to the Xpress Pearl environmental disaster in June. British Environment Secretary, George Eustice, said the UK is a global leader in marine protection and will continue to advocate for ambitious climate and ocean action at COP26 this year. 'Our shared ocean is a vital resource and provides habitat to precious marine life, as well as supporting the livelihoods of one in every ten people worldwide. 'The Blue Planet Fund will support many developing countries on the front line of climate change to reduce poverty and improve the health of their seas.' \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 12 -- Denmark's ambitious goals to reduce carbon footprint and achieve sustainable growth is globally relevant, especially for a fast-growing economy like Bangladesh For the past four decades, Denmark has managed to grow its economy all the while lowering CO2 emissions and resource consumption, proving that it is possible to have a green economy that also creates more jobs. Hence, the Embassy of Denmark in Bangladesh hosted a 5-day exhibition at Bay's Edge Gallery, in the backdrop of COP26 taking place in Glasgow, to highlight commercially viable green solutions that can support sustainable and inclusive economic growth in Bangladesh. The Danish Ambassador Winnie Estrup Petersen said: 'The 'Green Together' exhibition embodies and shares Denmark's understanding of sustainability with a Bangladeshi audience, which is a holistic approach to the environment and lifestyle, and also includes social goals like responsible business, good governance, equality, and inclusion'' As a frontrunner in green economic growth and a leader in clean technologies, Denmark is well positioned to serve as a knowledge partner for Bangladesh on its journey towards a greener and more sustainable society. 'Sustainable Green Buildings and Future of Urbanization' was the focus of the exhibition's panel on the opening night. While we do not think of buildings and installations as sustainable, they have a significant impact on the environment. Indeed, living and workspaces can be designed to be more resource efficient while offering modern aesthetics and comfort. The panel members highlighted possibilities for sustainable residential, commercial, and industrial spaces in Bangladesh building on the progress achieved thus far. Attendees from government bodies, top real estate developers and architects, and Danish companies engaged in discussions on how simple technologies, such as energy efficient water pumps and ventilation systems, can be integrated into buildings for more sustainable urbanization. On the second day of the exhibition, the panellists unpacked the 'Future of Sustainable Apparel Production.' Panellists on day three of the exhibition spoke on the 'Sustainable Future of Food.' Bangladesh recently hit the 1 billion mark from the exports of agriproducts. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Dhaka, Nov. 29 -- Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen on Monday said BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia is allowed to fly in any doctor from abroad for her treatment if she wants. "If they feel that doctors from abroad would be much more helpful for her treatment, of course (it's) most welcome," he told reporters after briefing diplomats at state guesthouse Padma on the current issues including Khaleda's health condition. The current issues also included UP elections, forthcoming World Peace Conference, Covid-19, Rohingya crisis and recently held COP26 , reports UNB. Dr Momen said whatever the former prime minister wants to do, she is free to do and can receive treatment anywhere in the country. "But if she has to go abroad, then she has to go through the legal process," said the Foreign Minister, adding that the government wants to uphold the rule of law in the country and it wants Khaleda to follow it, too. Talking about the UP elections, the foreign minister said these have been done in phases and they are very happy that the elections are "inclusive" and the "enthusiasm is very high." He, however, said the only bad thing is that in some cases, out of enthusiasm, there are a few fatalities. "We don't want to see any single fatality in any election. But I don't know how it can be done." The Foreign Minister said they ask all the leaders that they should not incite their people in such a way they have to get involved in any violence. "They should stop violence and they should only cast votes. Voters are really great and they never make mistakes." He said this is an enormous election and thousands of people are casting their votes and the government is committed to a free and fair and transparent election. "The government didn't interfere and intervene. These're free, fair and transparent elections." Dr Momen said Bangladesh will host the World Peace Conference on December 4-5 where he expects a wider presence of the international community to promote peace in the world. "Peace is essential." On the Covid situation, the foreign minister said the pandemic is under control in Bangladesh but they are careful about the new South African variant. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a new coronavirus variant to be "of concern" and named it Omicron. "In terms of Covid, it's under control. But we had to stop all the flights from South Africa to Bangladesh to avoid that particular variant," Dr Momen said. Talking about the Rohingya crisis and their relocation to Bhasan Char, he said those who have been relocated so far have gone there voluntarily. "We didn't force anybody to go there." Dr Momen said the ultimate solution is that they must go back to Myanmar. The government has planned to shift 100,000 Rohingyas to Bhasan Char from Cox's Bazar Rohingya camps.

Civil society organizations (CSOs) in Bangladesh have said that recent CoP-26 climate summit failed to address the adaptation programmes and loss and damage issues of the most vulnerable countries like Bangladesh. The CSOs have asked the government to develop a country-owned long-term financial strategies to support climate change actions in future. Their demand came at a virtual seminar titled 'CoP 26 outcome and our future perspective as MVCs' held on Monday. The seminar was jointly organized by COAST foundation, An Organization for Socio-Economic Development (AOSED), BIPNET-CCBD (Bangladesh Indigenous Peoples' Network on Climate Change), Centre for Participatory Research and Development (CPRD) Coastal Development Partnership (CDP), Coastal Livelihood and Environmental Action Network (CLEAN) and Equity and Justice Working Group, Bangladesh (EquityBD). Barrister Shamim Haider Patowary MP participated as special guest in the seminar moderated by Mostafa Kamal Akand of EquityBD. Among others Dr. Ainun Nishat-Emeritus Professor (BRAC University) and Lead climate negotiator of BD, Dr. Mostafa Saroar-Professor Khulna University of Engineering and Technology, Md. Sharif Jamil-General Secretary of BAPA (Bangladesh Paribesh Anolon), Quamrul Islam Chowdhury, climate change negotiator and Ex. Secretary of National Press Club, Mrinal Kanti Tripura of BIPNET-CCBD, Md. Jahangir Hossen Masum of CDP, Shamim Arefin of AoSED-Khulna, Emranul Hoque-climate change advocate, .Kawser Rahaman of Janakhanta spoke at the event. Syed Aminul Hoque from EquityBD presented the key note paper. Syed Aminul Hoque said that, the CoP 26 outcome was expected to produce a concrete decision and actions by world leaders to reduce global Green House gas emissions and appropriate financing to support adaptation actions and to face recurrent loss and damages. This did not happen due to opposition from some developed countries, especially the USA and their allies, he said. He also criticised the UK position for its so called 'Net Zero Emission' target by 2050 which in fact support the big emitters to continue their GHGs emission. Barrister Shamim Haider said that the CoP26 outcome is somehow disappointed as the decisions aggregately has dismantled the Common but Differentiate Responsibilities principle of Paris Agreement, denied the loss and damage with displacement issues and moving towards a business model instead survival of MVCs and save the earth from global warming. He appreciated the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's voice as very realistic. He, however, pointed out less participation of BD govt. delegations in many CoP plenaries where main decisions came. Dr. Mostafa Saroar said that the proposed 'Net Zero emission' target is a false and elusive solution and the UK pushed the poor and developing countries to adopt this target. Quamrul Islam Chowdhury criticised the developed countries initiative of 'New collective and quantified goal on finance (NCQG)' where there are no representatives of MVCs to finalize the process Sharif Jamil said that government's mind-set is confused as there are inconsistencies between govt. coal using and alternative energy strategies. Mr. Shamim said that in CoP 26, developed countries have failed to deliver on the annual payment of US$100 billion and instead deferred it to 2023. This is is completely unacceptable for MVCs, he said. \</doc>

Bangladesh is weighing option on whether to express solidarity with the pledge 124 countries have made at Glasgow climate change summit to end and reverse deforestation by 2030, several delegates indicated on Thursday. Bangladesh stayed away from the deforestation deal signed at COP26 summit arguing that the country's constitution already provides clear and specific guidelines on preservation of forests, several delegates said. On the third day of climate conference the topic of discussion focused on protecting the forest of the planet. It has received commitments from leaders representing more than 85% of the world's forests to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. Among them are several countries with huge swathe of forests, including Brazil, China, Colombia, Congo, Indonesia, Russia and the United States. Nasrul Hamid, state minister for power, energy and mineral resources said Bangladesh representatives have raised the points on industrialization without harming the environment at the discussion. 'In Bangladesh industrialization is going on without harming the environment. Rampal power plant is being built far away from the Sundarbans. In future projects Bangladesh will maintain the practice,' he said. 'As this is a declaration of agreement, we have time to consider about Bangladesh's involvement, 'said Saber Hossain Chowdhury, Chairman of parliamentary standing committee on Forest, Environment and Climate change. 'For this the country will be deprived of the compensation the signing countries will receive from the deal. It also indicates Bangladesh will not take stricter steps to end deforestation in the country, 'he said. Meanwhile, Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) has expressed deep concern over Bangladesh's failure to show solidarity with the joint declaration of world leaders on forest and land use at the COP-26 conference. Executive Director of TIB Dr. Iftekharuzzaman said Bangladesh not showing solidarity with the declaration is extremely disappointing. Being one of the most damaged country by climate change Bangladesh not responding to the pledge is unbelievable, he said 'Even the Sundarbans, known as a natural sanctuary for various unscrupulous public and private activities, is now under threat. In such a difficult reality, Bangladesh must immediately be involved in this global declaration, 'said Dr Iftekharuzzaman. \</doc>

Nov. 10 Tokyo(Yomiuri Shimbun/ANN)  Japan, the United States and European nations are among an international alliance of 73 nations and regions that agreed Tuesday to enhance their aid to developing countries on measures to cope with emissions of chlorofluorocarbons, during the 26th U.N. Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow. The international alliance, formed under the Nairobi-based U.N. Environment Program, will place an initiative led by Japan at the center of these CFC-related activities. CFCs are used as refrigerant gases in air conditioners and large refrigerators. It is believed that the greenhouse effect of CFCs is hundreds of times to 10,000 times worse than carbon dioxide. About 4% of Japan's greenhouse gas emissions comes in the form of CFCs. The nation is regarded as one of the most progressive countries regarding the strictness of its regulations on CFCs, as the government obliges businesses to recollect the gases from discarded refrigerators and other such products. The technologies used for recovery and disposal of CFCs is also advanced. On the other hand, there are more than 100 developing countries that have not taken any measures to cope with CFC emissions. According to the Environment Ministry, it is predicted that the number of air conditioners worldwide will increase in the coming 30 years at a pace of 10 units per second. Under the current situation, most CFCs in air conditioners are discharged into the atmosphere without being processed. During the alliance's ministerial meeting on Tuesday, members shared the opinion that measures to cope with CFC problems in developing countries are essential for capping the rise of global temperature at 1.5 C compared with the level before the industrial revolution. They agreed to set up a CFC-related task force of experts and make progress with the measures. Practically, the alliance will make use of the Initiative on Fluorocarbons Life Cycle Management launched by Japan during the COP25 meeting in 2019. Participating in the initiative are 14 countries and international organizations such as Japan, Britain, France, the Philippines, Vietnam and the World Bank. The initiative has conducted such activities as assisting developing countries in acquiring technologies for recovering and disposing of CFCs, helping them take legislative actions for the purpose and training of administrative officials. An agreement document adopted Tuesday presented a prediction that the volume of CFC emissions worldwide could be reduced by up to 99.5% by 2050 from the level in 2010. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Every country in the world will be impacted by climate change, and Bangladesh is also subject to its effects. While contributing less than 0.47% of global emissions, it is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries globally. Bangladesh has laid out clear plans to decarbonize and do its part to fight climate change in the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan (MCPP), launched at this year's COP26 . This sets Bangladesh on a transitionary path towards renewables by moving away from fossil fuels, exploring more energy storage solutions, and focusing on fuels like hydrogen and ammonia for zero-carbon power generation. Natural gas as a transitionary fuel Even as coal plants remain on the energy grid to ensure energy security, Bangladesh is halting development of new coal plants and shifting to natural gas in the near term. Earlier in 2021, it scrapped plans to build 10 new coal-fired power plants of over 8,700 MW in capacity. This shift to natural gas-fired power plants helps reduce carbon emissions and water consumption. Mitsubishi Power's gas turbines reduce emissions by up to 65% when compared with coal-fired power plants, with power generation efficiency approaching 65% and reliability of over 99%. For every megawatt of electricity produced using natural gas instead of coal, water consumption is also reduced by 260 gallons. Mitsubishi Power's gas turbines reduce emissions when compared with coal-fired power plants, and enhance power generation efficiency and reliability In 2001, Bangladesh began operation of its first large-class gas turbine, Mitsubishi Power's M701F gas turbine, at the Haripur Power Plant in the city of Narayanganj. The M701F gas turbine also supports four other power plants across the country - the New Haripur, Bheramara, Bibiyana and Sirajganj Power Plants - and continues to be one of the most efficient and reliable today, supporting the energy transition. Adopting carbon-free fuels In the long term, carbon-free fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia will play key roles in getting the country to net-zero, as both fuels don't emit carbon dioxide. Additionally, Mitsubishi Power's H-25 Series gas turbines will have the ability to exclusively fire with ammonia by 2025 - and can be adopted in tandem with other technologies such as renewable energy to enable a gradual energy transition for Bangladesh. Supporting the adoption of renewables Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar will bring about substantial carbon reductions for the country but could be susceptible to seasonal shifts and changes in demand. Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) solutions, such as those from Mitsubishi Power, will help maintain energy security by storing energy for use when supply decreases and demand peaks. Since 2011, Mitsubishi Power has worked on BESS solutions, amassing orders globally totaling over 1GWh worth of energy storage Another complementary technology for renewables are gas turbine combined cycle (GTCC) plants, which are able to operate flexibly, to support energy needs of the grid. A partner in Bangladesh's energy transition Mitsubishi Power is a committed partner to Bangladesh in its journey to decarbonization. We have been a part of the country's journey since 1960, when we delivered our first steam turbine to Bangladesh, and are now responsible for approximately 20% of the country's peak daily energy production, across 13 power plants and industry sites. With decades of invaluable experience, operations and maintenance (O and M) services have also been integral in our work to ensure power plants run efficiently with minimal downtime. We work with customers to propose and implement the right financial solutions to fund new projects - and have formed strong partnerships with government bodies and local utilities. We remain committed to our efforts to help produce 'Power to build a brighter sonar Bangla'. \</doc>

Glasgow (Scotland), Nov 1 (UNB) - Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday said Bangladesh has cancelled 10 coal-based power plants involving 12 billion dollars of foreign investment, just to supplement its efforts against the adverse impacts of climate change. 'We've cancelled 10 coal-based power plants worth 12 billion dollars of foreign investment,' she said while addressing the 26th Session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). She also put forward four points to the world leaders to fight climate change. In the first point, Hasina said, the major emitters must submit ambitious NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions), and implement those. 'Second,' she said, 'The developed countries should fulfill their commitments of providing 100 billion dollars annually with a 50:50 balance between adaptation and mitigation.' Third, the Prime Minister said, the developed countries should disseminate clean and green technology at affordable costs to the most vulnerable countries. 'The development needs of the CVF countries also need to be considered.' In her fourth point, Hasina said the issue of loss and damage must be addressed, including global sharing of responsibility for climate migrants displaced by sea-level rise, salinity increase, river erosion, floods, and draughts. The Prime Minister said the government has recently submitted an ambitious and updated NDC to UNFCCC. 'Bangladesh has one of the world's most extensive domestic solar energy programs. We hope to have 40 percent of the country's energy from renewable sources by 2041.' She said, 'We're going to implement the 'Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan'- a journey from climate vulnerability to resilience to climate prosperity.' Hasina said Bangladesh is trying to address the challenge of climate impacts because of 1.1 million forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals or Rohingyas. She said Bangladesh is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries, though it contributes less than 0.47 percent of global emissions. Hasina mentioned that the government has established the 'Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund' in 2009 to address this challenge. 'We've doubled climate-related expenses in the last seven years. Currently, we're preparing the National Adaptation Plan.' As the Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) and V20, Bangladesh is promoting the interests of the 48 climate-vulnerable countries, she said. 'We're also sharing best practices and adaptation knowledge regionally through the South Asia Office of the Global Center of Adaptation's Dhaka,' she added. On behalf of the CVF, Hasina said, Bangladesh is pursuing to establish a Climate Emergency Pact. \</doc>

Nov. 1 Kolkata(The Statesman/ANN)- An issue of growing concern that is likely to be reflected prominently at the Convention on Climate Change  the 26th Conference of Parties ( COP26 )  which starts at Glasgow today  is the increasing resentment in the Global South that the disbursement of funds in terms of the agreement for climate funding has not been just, having fallen much short of expectations and commitments. It was at COP15 held at Copenhagen in 2009 that a decision was taken about the creation of an annual fund of $100 billion dollars, to be set up by developed countries for facilitilitating climate change adaptation and mitigation in the Global South (or developing countries, as the agreement stated). This was confirmed at the time of the Paris agreement in 2015, when it was added that attempts to increase this funding around 2025 would be made. Against this commitment, what has been the actual achievement so far? The general consensus is that 'we are not there yet'. While not disputing this, the OECD stated on behalf of the rich countries that by 2018-19 the funding had come quite close to between 78 and 80 billion dollars (per year) in these two years. However this has been contested by several independent sources. A report by Oxfam stated that the actual funding is likely to have been somewhere between $ 19 and 22.5 billion in 2017-18. Some other estimates have also mentioned lower levels of funding, some lower than even the Oxfam estimate. How can estimates differ so much? One main reason relates to how special climate funding is defined. Since this is not a business investment but is meant to help activities related to better adaptation to climate change and to reduction of GHG emissions, countries of the Global South had initially taken it for granted that climate funding would be in the form of grants. But soon it was found that loans were also being counted. The component of loans had an increasing trend, while that of grants had a decreasing trend. Analysis of data for 2018 revealed that only 20 per cent of the fund consisted of grants. In addition, multilateral funding by organisations like the World Bank was also being counted. Export credits were also being counted. It was not very clear in several cases how what was being included in this category was different from normal lending. Even loans given for projects known to cause ecological ruin and displacement were counted in some cases. Secondly, some negotiators have been stating that given the needs of the Global South and accepting the historical responsibility of the richest countries, in fact the sum of $100 billion is inadequate and needs to be increased several times. In fact, negotiators for several African countries who met in September to prepare for COP26 came up with an estimate for 1.3 trillion dollars a year by the year 2030 to meet the needs of their continent alone. Even at present the needs of the Global South for climate change adaptation and mitigation are estimated to be several hundred billion dollars, and not $100 billion. These opinions have emerged once the implications of the changes required have been studied in detail. Now it is being asked how the muchpublicized figure of 100 billion dollars was arrived at in 2009 in the first place. It appears that this was a rounded off, convenient figure and not based on a detailed calculation of real needs as well as the reduced value of this sum by the time the target was to be met by 2020. Now two weaknesses are becoming increasingly clear. Firstly, detailed estimates of real needs were not prepared in a credible way in consultation with the Global South. Secondly, a specific commitment that this would be in the form of grants and not loans was not made, even though this was taken as granted by many. Hence an increasing need is now felt to make corrections. Thirdly, it was important that the share of individual countries should have been spelt out, and penalties determined for delayed payments. The USA, which is supposed to be a very resourceful country, has been the worst offender, having paid only a fraction of what it was supposed to. Unless there is a mechanism for ensuring that laggards are made to fulfil their commitment, there will be serious shortfalls and the preparations for mitigation and adaptation made by countries of the Global South may be seriously jeopardized when the expected funds do not materialize. The last problem is of unfair conditions getting attached to assistance. One of the critical components of foreign aid has been that it comes attached with narrow and self-serving conditions. There are concerns that such conditions should not reduce the value of special funds. One reason for such a possibility is that several multinational corporations and big business interests have also been able to position themselves in the climate change negotiations. They not only seek to protect their narrow interests but also advance them in the name of climate change action. For example, climate smart agriculture has been sought to be defined by them in ways that will push their interests, instead of helping small farmers of the Global South. There is now less of a tendency to speak of the special responsibility of the richest countries to contribute more to checking climate change and to help developing countries in their adaptation efforts. Even in terms of allocation of the limited funds that have become available, there is lesser allocation for adaptation aspects. Clearly a much more sincere, just and transparent approach is needed in terms of increasing and strengthening climate funds and ensuring their fair utilisation in the interests of the Global South. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 3 -- In 1785, Robert Burns reflected on how humanity has come to dominate our planet: "I'm truly sorry man's dominion, has broken nature's social union," he wrote. The Scottish poet's words still ring true two centuries later. Man-made climate change threatens our planet's ecosystem and the lives and livelihoods of millions of people. From the IMF perspective, climate change presents a grave threat to macroeconomic and financial stability. Now, the window of opportunity for containing global warming to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius is closing rapidly. As world leaders gather in Glasgow for COP26 , a new IMF Staff Climate Note shows unchanged global policies will leave 2030 carbon emissions far higher than needed to "keep 1.5 alive." Cuts of 55 percent below baseline levels in 2030 would be urgently needed to meet that goal, and of 30 percent to meet the 2 degrees Celsius objective. To achieve these cuts, policymakers attending COP26 must address two critical gaps: in ambition and in policy. 135 countries representing more than three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions have committed to net zero by mid-century. But we fall short in pledges for the near term. Even if current commitments for 2030 were met, this would only amount to between one- and two-thirds of the reductions needed for temperature goals. Advanced economies are expected to cut emissions more rapidly for reasons of equity and historical responsibility. They have collectively pledged to cut their emissions 43 percent below 2030 levels. At the same time, higher-income emerging market economies have together pledged a 12 percent cut, and lower-income emerging market economies, 6 percent. However, the Climate Note shows regardless of how cuts are spread across country groups, everyone has to do more. For example, getting in the range of the 2 degrees target could be achieved with emissions cuts from advanced economies, high-income emerging markets, and low-income emerging markets of 45, 30, and 20 percent, respectively. A different balance of effort with cuts of 55, 25, and 15 percent would achieve the same goal, as would a weighting of 65, 20, and 10 percent. To stay on track for 1.5 degrees, much more ambitious reductions are required for the same groups of countries. The good news is abatement costs are manageable. To put global emissions within range of a 2 degrees target would cost 0.2 to 1.2 percent of GDP, with the biggest burden falling on richer countries. And in many nations, the cost of shifting away from fossil fuels may be offset by domestic environmental benefits, most notably reductions in deaths from local air pollution. Enhanced external financing will be essential to support stronger mitigation ambition for emerging markets and developing economies. Advanced economies must fulfill their commitment to provide $100 billion per year in finance to low-income countries from 2020 onward. The most recent figures show that we remain short of that target. In addition, to scale up private financing, certainty over public mitigation objectives will be critical, especially price signals to level the playing field for clean technologies. Also critical will be better-quality and standardized information, so investors can help address perceived risks, including in low-income countries. Carbon pricing-charges on the carbon content of fuels or their emissions-should play a central role, especially for large emitters. At a stroke, it provides a price signal to redirect private investment to low carbon technologies and energy efficiency. But the gap between what's required versus what's in place is very large. A global carbon price exceeding $75 per ton would be needed by 2030, to keep warming below 2 degrees. At the international level, coordination will be critical to overcome political economy constraints and scale up carbon pricing. Think of concerns about competitiveness and uncertainty over policy actions that make it difficult for countries to act alone. Addressing these issues is at the heart of an IMF staff proposal for an international carbon price floor among a small group of large emitters. Such a floor would be equitable, with differentiated pricing for countries at different levels of economic development, alongside financial and technological assistance for low-income participants. And the price floor arrangement would be pragmatic, allowing for national implementation through non-pricing measures that achieve equivalent outcomes. It would be collaborative, helping avoid contentious border carbon adjustments if some countries move ahead with robust pricing while others do not. At the domestic level, carbon pricing reforms could jump-start emissions reductions. Critically, this need not come at the cost of the economy. Recent empirical studies suggest that carbon pricing reforms have not reduced GDP or employment. Indeed, such reforms could support long-run growth objectives. Revenues from carbon pricing-typically around 1 percent of GDP or more - can be used to reduce labor taxes or increase public investments, helping boost the economy. These are just some examples of how mitigation strategies can-and must-bring wider benefits at all levels of society. Policymakers should ensure a just transition with robust assistance for vulnerable households, workers, and regions. For instance, carbon pricing reforms can be equity-enhancing and pro-poor. If revenues are used to strengthen social safety nets and raise personal income tax thresholds, the policy has net benefits to poorest groups and neutral impacts on the middle class. Alternatively, revenues could be used for public investments in health or education. Another key ingredient of any mitigation strategy is green public investment. We need to accelerate the adoption of clean technology infrastructure like smart grids and charging stations for electric vehicles. Working together, not only do private and public investments in clean energy have especially powerful growth effects, low-carbon industries also tend to be more labor-intensive than fossil fuels which can help boost employment. Lastly, all reforms should also be introduced progressively and well-communicated, so firms and households can adjust. They should also cover broader emissions sources, such as methane, and enhance forest carbon storage. Without an urgent narrowing of ambition, policy, and financing gaps, a dangerous cliff-edge for emissions reductions beyond 2030 will be set up-greatly increasing transition costs, and potentially putting temperature goals permanently beyond reach. An orderly, cooperative, and timely transition can and must happen. Now. In the words of Robert Burns again: "Now's the day, and now's the hour."

Nov. 2 Dhaka(The Daily Star/ANN)- The issue of loss and damage must be addressed, including global sharing of responsibility for climate migrants displaced by sea-level rise, salinity increase, river erosion, floods, and draughts. This is one of the four points put forward by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to the world leaders to fight climate change. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. She was addressing the 26th Session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) yesterday. In the first point, Hasina said the major emitters must submit ambitious NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions), and implement those. "Second," she said, "The developed countries should fulfil their commitments of providing 100 billion dollars annually with a 50:50 balance between adaptation and mitigation. " Third, the prime minister said, the developed countries should disseminate clean and green technology at affordable costs to the most vulnerable countries. "The development needs of the CVF countries also need to be considered." The fourth one was on the issues of addressing loss and damage and global sharing of responsibility for climate migrants. The prime minister further said Bangladesh has cancelled 10 coal-based power plants involving 12 billion dollars of foreign investment, just to supplement its efforts against the adverse impacts of climate change. The government has recently submitted an ambitious and updated NDC to UNFCCC, she added. "Bangladesh has one of the world's most extensive domestic solar energy programmes. We hope to have 40 percent of the country's energy from renewable sources by 2041. "We're going to implement the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan  a journey from climate vulnerability to resilience to climate prosperity." Hasina mentioned that Bangladesh is trying to address the challenge of climate impacts because of 1.1 million forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals or Rohingyas. She further said Bangladesh is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries, though it contributes less than 0.47 percent of global emissions. Hasina noted that the government has established the "Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund" in 2009 to address this challenge. "We've doubled climate-related expenses in the last seven years. Currently, we are preparing the National Adaptation Plan." As the Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) and V20, Bangladesh is promoting the interests of the 48 climate-vulnerable countries, she said. On behalf of the CVF, Hasina added, Bangladesh is pursuing to establish a Climate Emergency Pact. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 22 -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has confirmed that it will not provide any support for coal extraction and power projects in the coal and oil sectors, but will continue to allow some natural gas financing as it seeks to help transition the Asia Pacific toward renewable energy. The ADB's board approved the multilateral development bank's new energy policy during a meeting on Wednesday (October 20), says a press release. While the policy bars the bank from most fossil fuel financing, there are some limited carve-outs for oil trading. The organisation, which lends around US$5bn annually in the energy sector, has had to juggle a desire to help slash greenhouse gas emissions in the Asia Pacific while still supporting member states that are largely reliant on fossil fuels for power production. "This new policy locks in our strong commitment that ADB will not fund new coal power production," says ADB president Masatsugu Asakawa. "Together with our elevated ambition to deliver US$100bn in climate financing to our developing member countries in 2019-2030, it provides a clear path for ADB's contribution to an environmentally sustainable energy future." "ADB's new energy policy will support our developing member countries in the critical and urgent task of expanding access to reliable, affordable, and clean energy," Asakawa says. Around 350 million people in the Asia Pacific do not have an "adequate" power supply while 150 million have no access to electricity at all, according to the bank. Earlier in the week the lender announced it is aiming to deliver US$100bn in climate financing to developing countries between 2019 and 2030, a US$20bn jump on an earlier commitment made in 2018. The extra financing will be put toward climate change mitigation and adaptation projects, the bank said in an October 13 statement. It will also try to boost its private sector financing. The lender has 67 member countries and provided US$31.6bn in loans, grants, equity investments and guarantees last year. Pakistan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are its top three recipients for trade and supply chain finance.

Dhaka, Nov. 5 -- With humanity already struggling to cope with rising seas, more powerful storms, deadly heat waves and rapidly changing ecosystems, the global climate summit opened in Glasgow, UK on October 31 with a series of desperate pleas for action from nations large and small. But the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ), which will continue till November 12, looks like a historic failure after the world's biggest polluters snubbed the summit and even rich nations failed to deliver on their promises made at the 2015 Paris climate summit. Although the conference is not yet over, the direction has been set, and the chance for the most decisive action has likely departed with the parting of heads of state or government. Countries are yet to commit to an agreement that would limit global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a threshold identified as crucial by scientists in preventing irreversible damage to the planet. Commitments on emissions cuts made so far might lead to a temperature rise of 1.8 degrees Celsius, experts said according to BBC News. The Paris climate summit saw nations, including the US and Germany, pledge donations of $100 billion per year to poorer countries to help tackle climate change. Unfortunately that pledge still remains unfulfilled. Even the summit's most enthusiastic proponent and host UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday was only "cautious optimistic" that change would come. US President Joe Biden has said climate is "a gigantic issue" and China "walked away" -- adding it was the "same thing with Russia and Putin". This, he said, would be the "decisive decade" in which to prove that the goal of limiting global warming to just 1.5 degrees Celsius could be met. Scientists more or less agree that one of the main reasons for climate change is the use of fossil fuel, which remains on an upward trend. As a result, a huge number of people across the world, including Bangladesh, is being displaced and losing employment due to various natural calamities, like excessive rain, floods, fires, drought and rise in sea level. A vast portion of Bangladesh's coastal belt may go under sea if such a trend continues, fear scientists. About the plan for green economy, we stand for the development of renewable energy and environment friendly development instead of use of fossil fuel. But even if Bangladesh stops its fossil fuel emission at once, the problem will remain at the same extent. So, global initiatives should be taken to save the planet as it is a global problem.

DHAKA, Feb. 24 -- Renewable energy (RE) comprises of energy from the sun (directly), usually called solar, biomass, wind, tidal, geothermal and hydro. The endowment of these resources will determine how much of each form of renewable energy source can be exploited in a country. For example, Bangladesh does not have geothermal potential and its hydro potential, especially that based on elevation, is small. Tidal is a new form of energy source that is yet to achieve commercialisation. It thus leaves solar, wind and biomass as the only current options. With regards to biomass, the principal problem is the high demand of agricultural and animal wastes for cooking in rural areas. Moreover, extracting too much organic matter in an unsustainable manner can lead to soil degradation. However, through the bio-gasification route, there exists significant potential, but that would require careful planning and management of the bioresources. In the case of Bangladesh, the principal barrie with biomass are; the price is high and collecting large quantities is difficult, hence expensive. Wind has always been a problematic resource to evaluate in the context of Bangladesh. A group of experts believe that the wind potential in Bangladesh, especially onshore, is limited. The offshore potential is unknown, even though one does hear of unsubstantiated claims of huge potential. In financial terms, it is difficult to comment on this in the absence of comprehensive environmental and technical investment grade studies on offshore wind potential. Solar energy is the single most dependable RE resource that can be resourced on a large scale. This expectation is turning out to be true with local and foreign investments occurring in grid-tied utility scale solar parks and industrial rooftop projects. According to the Chairman of SREDA, more than 1,000 MW of utility scale solar parks and 500 MW of commercial/industrial rooftop solar PV projects under the net metering scheme are on the horizon. According to the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), as of January 2022, Bangladesh had 22,066 MW of grid-connected installed capacity, the fuel wise breakdown of which is shown in Figure 1. RE consists of only 2.08 percent of the total installed capacity connected to the grid; half of that, i.e., 1.04 percent is hydropower, which has remained static in generation since 1967. The complete picture of RE deployment can be seen from Figure 2, which shows both on-grid and off-grid RE applications. A large portion of the claimed 543 MW solar power is off-grid solar, grid-tied solar parks only contributes 196 MW. It is worth pointing out that, as a result of the extension of rural electrification through the expansion of the grid, a large portion of the Solar PV Home Systems that brought so much fame to Bangladesh is lying idle. As expected, RE in Bangladesh is dominated by solar with other sources being very small in comparison. It is clear that Bangladesh is struggling to increase the share of RE in its energy mix. The future of RE in Bangladesh also does not look very bright, unless the government takes steps to explore new and innovative ways of harnessing RE. Agricultural land and solar projects The single biggest barrier to the large-scale deployment of solar PV electricity is the acute shortage of land. The problem is more connected with the policy-total ban on use of agricultural land for solar projects-than land availability. In Bangladesh, land is very fragmented, and it is very difficult to find contiguous land to construct even a 50 MW solar park without encroaching onto agricultural land. Thus, instead of a total ban, a policy could be formulated that permits a certain amount of agricultural land; say 25 percent of the land of a single solar park, to a maximum of 200 acres per project. The use of only one percent of the total agricultural land of Bangladesh can facilitate the construction of approximately 50,000 MW of solar power plants. Using the average capacity factor of 4.5 hours per day for Bangladesh, the electricity output from the one percent agricultural land is approximately 82,000 GWh, which is more than the total consumption in the year 2020. If the cost of fuel saved is compared with the output of even three-cropped land, the financial benefits will be more than five times. The lost agricultural output of the one percent land can be easily made up by preventing spoilage that occurs due to the lack of cold storages and other processing facilities. Figure 3: Cost of electricity for different technologies and fuels. SOURCE: FRAUNHOFER INSTITUTE FOR SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS Optimal dual usage of land and Floating Solar Farms ('floatovoltaics') Since land is very expensive in Bangladesh, dual use of land can make many solar projects viable. There are over 2.83 million hectares of low-lying land in Bangladesh (roughly 20 percent of the total area of the country). Using such low-lying land combined with fisheries is one such innovative solution. A 50 MW solar-fisheries project has been approved and project implementation is underway. "Floatovoltaics" are photovoltaic (PV) solar power systems designed for floating on reservoirs, lakes, rivers, and other water bodies. Floating solar farms can generate huge amounts of electricity without using valuable land. Bangladesh, being a riverine country, is ideal for floatovoltaics deployment. A comprehensive study and pilot projects are required to harness this potential. Numerous lakes and reservoirs are under the jurisdiction of WASA can be developed as private-public joint venture projects. There are many other innovative solar technologies being researched and commercially developed. One very promising technology for Bangladesh is "Agrivoltaics", where crops can be grown beneath the solar panels. A standard conventional solar panel is largely opaque to sunlight. Therefore, underneath the PV panels most crops will not grow. Panels require only a small portion of the solar bandwidth; therefore, technologies are being developed that can filter this for electricity production and pass through the infrared and ultraviolet rays needed by plants, i.e., a translucent/transparent solar panel. If this technology achieves full commercial application, the land constraint that Bangladesh is facing will be removed. Electricity transmission network Despite the fact that Bangladesh is a small country in terms of area; electricity grid coverage is very poor. Inexpensive land is invariably located far from the existing electricity infrastructure. The Bangladesh government needs to undertake a massive grid modernisation initiative. The carrying capacity of the national network of transmission lines needs to be made smart and expanded throughout the country. Being geographically small, no matter where the solar plant is located the grid should be able to deliver power anywhere in the country with minimal losses. With a smart, integrated transmission network connected regionally, the intermittent nature of renewable energy can be made more reliable and robust. Solar combined with Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) Solar PV electricity is already the cheapest source of electricity in many places, but it is only available when the sun is shining. To make solar PV electricity available at other times and make it a source that can truly replace fossil fuels, one has to store the electricity for later use. At the present time, the most promising technology is battery. BESS is one of several technology options that can enhance power system flexibility, reliability, and enable high levels of renewable energy integration. Due to technological innovations and improved manufacturing capacity, lithium-ion chemistries have experienced a steep price decline of over 70 percent from 2010-2016, and prices are projected to decline further. Technological advancements and cost reduction In Germany, the cost of electricity from Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT), the technology of choice in Bangladesh, is more than electricity from PV Utility Scale Battery. The average cost electricity from PV Utility Scale Battery in Bangladesh would be around Tk 15, which is nearly 100 percent more than in Germany, while electricity from LNG based CCGT would be approximately Tk 10. At the present time, therefore, PV Utility Scale Battery is much more expensive than one of the cheaper electricity options for Bangladesh, but this 100 percent cost difference is expected to disappear by 2030, making solar electricity comparable in cost to any conventional electricity. Therefore, it is important to revise the country's Power System Master Plan (PSMP) and integrate solar options in a meaningful way by taking into consideration the fast-changing reality of utility scale solar power plants with storage. The country experiences peak power demand on average 3 hours a day, i.e., from 7 PM to 10 PM. A BESS project may be designed such that during daytime when the sun shines it charges a battery pack and discharges the stored power at that time. That, this is a financially viable solution, can be verified from Figure 3; the cost of electricity for PV Battery is much lower than Gas Turbine. Therefore, the peaking Gas Turbine power plants (assuming those to be fired by LNG) and the oil-based (HFO and diesel) power plants can immediately be retired in favour of PV Battery is much lower than Gas Turbine. Therefore, the peaking Gas Turbine power plants (assuming those to be fired by LNG) and the oil-based (HFO and diesel) power plants can immediately be retired in favour of PV Battery power plants. Administrative measures and regulatory reforms COP26 . The Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) talks about a target of 4,100 MW Renewable Energy by 2030. However, these plans would be hard to mobilise from a private sector perspective unless substantive changes to the grid and regulatory reforms are implemented. Numerous obstacles for RE companies in the private sector are hampering the widespread use of renewable energy. Some of the major challenges are enumerated below: 1. Lack of strategic direction: The RE hamstrung.Different sector in Bangladesh lacks a clear strategic direction in terms of setting targets from specific technologies. Shifting government priorities have seen some technologies (Solar Home Systems, Mini-grid) being hamstrung.Different competing energy sources and power systems are also shifting the government's focus from RE. Fuel Oil-based Quick Rental Power Plants from small independent power producers are still a major and costly portion of the power mix, and these need to be gradually phased out to make room for RE. 2. Failure of the early unsolicited utility-scale solar projects: The major points of contention were land availability and land acquisition, securing the Right of Way (ROW), and challenges surrounding grid-interconnection. 3. Lack of proper studies, bankable data, regulatory checklist in the wind energy sector: The private sector is exposed to a lot of risk in terms of acquiring reliable and authenticated data. There is a dearth of data in terms of land availability, substation load capacity, site specific data, etc. 4. Investor/lender interest surrounding uncertainties: Foreign investors/lenders are deterred over project timelines, interagency navigation, contract lock-ins (e.g., a local partner and their foreign partner need to be a part of the project for at least 6 years), and lack of clarity over various regulations. 5. Utility distribution companies' upgradation: The distribution utilities in its current state are inadequate to support mass RE adoption to serve the local electricity market. The underlying problems are two-fold, first, in the infrastructure readiness and planning level, and second, in terms of capacity and preparedness of many local level offices.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Friday urged the international community to give proper attention to the Rohingya issue as growing violence and crimes in the Rohingya camps can soon spread beyond borders. 'The security situation in the Cox's Bazar camps is getting complicated. The growing violence and crimes can soon spread beyond our borders,' she said. The prime minister made the statement in a video message played in the two-day13th Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Summit that concluded in Cambodia on Friday. She also cautioned the world community saying that a provisional response to the crisis will serve little purpose. 'A critical test of our multilateral cooperation will be to find a lasting and peaceful solution for Myanmar's forcibly displaced people - the Rohingyas,' she said. In this connection she mentioned that Bangladesh offered temporary shelter to the Rohingyas and stabilized the situation. 'We continue to amplify the demand for their safe and dignified return to Myanmar. I urge the international community to give proper attention to the concerns we are raising,' she said. Sheikh Hasina said that the COVID-19 pandemic has put a heavy pressure on the health systems and economies across the world. 'It has compelled us to divert our development resources for emergency treatments and vaccines,' she said. In this regard, she said that the government adopted a strategy to save both lives and livelihoods, and announced 28 stimulus packages worth USD 5.4 billion to offset the impacts of the pandemic. 'Our priority now is to preserve our hard-earned development gains in reducing poverty and hunger, saving mothers and children, promoting literacy and education, and ensuring safe and healthy living,' she said. She said that the government aims to vaccinate 80 per cent of the target population by March 2022. 'We hope to sustain the momentum of our LDC graduation. We shall remain focused on attaining the SDGs by 2030. Our vision is to build an inclusive and prosperous nation by 2041. To achieve these goals, our partnership with Asia and Europe remains crucial,' she said. She thanked the friendly countries in Asia, Europe and the US for their donations of vaccines. 'Bangladesh has the capacity to produce quality vaccines. We seek technical know-how and licenses for the purpose,' she added. The PM put emphasis on joining hands of Asia and Europe for mobilising finances and technology to combat climate change. 'The advanced and industrialized economies need to raise their climate ambitions beyond COP26 . I urge them not to shift responsibilities that may otherwise hamper our own economic growth take-off,' she said. She invited all interested ASEM partners to invest in projects under Bangladesh's long-term Bangladesh Delta Plan and Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan. She said that Bangladesh aspires to become a regional connectivity hub, with potential benefits for its neighbours. She said that Bangladesh also offers to be one of the bridges in the EU-Asia Connectivity Strategy and welcomes Europe's engagements in sub-regional connectivity projects in railways and roads. 'Our shared growth pursuits need to be supported by sound international security cooperation. Regional platforms like ASEAN Regional Forum should help foster real-time cooperation in counter-trafficking, maritime and cyber security, and fighting terrorism.' Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh considers itself to be modelled after the best of Asian norms and European values. 'Since our early days, our commitment to multilateralism has remained a constant.' 'Our present lead in IORA, D-8, BIMSTEC and other forums will be used for advancing our shared objectives.' She wished to see ASEM emerge as a force for good in the international system. \</doc>

The just concluded COP26 that culminated with the Glasgow Climate Pact 2021 has shown some lights at the end of tunnel. The global community could reach closer than ever before for a cleaner, greener future world. Expectations have grown brighter for a non-carbonised, environment-friendly future world. True that there exist many issues and challenges, but there has been a greater realization that use of fossil fuel must be reduced at a faster rate for achieving the 1.5 degree C global warming limit by 2100 and Net Zero Vision. The world community is divided into three broad categories - developed world also the major polluters, developing world also significant polluters and least developed countries mostly with insignificant carbon footprints of their own. There is another category - climate vulnerable countries. The onus is on developed countries for drastically reducing emissions, contributing generously to Green Climate Fund (GCF) for assisting the LDCs, Climate Vulnerable Countries in managing the environment and at the same time ensuring that the economic development keeps going by adopting advanced technologies. Developed countries must also assist others with financial and technological support. Global research suggests that achieving a green future is technically and technologically possible. But how soon or whether at all will be achievable depends on many issues and challenges which COP26 has addressed to some extent. Bangladesh is a developing country as well as a climate vulnerable country. Every year as impacts of global and regional emissions, natural disasters (cyclones, tidal bores, floods) destroy crops and properties, make many climate refugees. Its own carbon footprint is negligible and as such has no obligation for reducing emission. But still for its own sake it has no option but growing green by adopting non-carbonised energy generation. The challenges of Bangladesh would be unlike many other developing nations. Till now it almost exclusively depends on fossil fuel (own gas and imported LNG, LPG and other Petroleum products). It is importing electricity from a regional country. Bangladesh delayed exploiting its own discovered coal reserve. With the world community agreeing to phasing down use of coal, we are not sure whether Bangladesh can exploit its coal resource at all. Apart from under implementation coal power projects, no new coal power plant may also be built in Bangladesh. Natural gas (own gas and imported LNG) may continue as a major transition for another 25-30 years at least. Renewable energy like solar and wind have some prospects. Bangladesh being predominantly a flat country. There is no significant prospect of hydroelectricity of its own. Talks for importing hydroelectricity from Nepal, Bhutan and India have been going on since mid 1990s without much headway. Bangladesh is going to have its first nuclear power project (2X1200 MW) up and running by 2025. For Bangladesh to achieve its goal of a developed economy by 2041 keeping an eye on its pledge of Net Zero 2050, Bangladesh needs to be very smart in going green. Can the World Grow Green at All? There was a thought whether the world can ever grow clean and green. Fossil fuel lobbies with strong public relation access made the most believe that transitioning to renewable energy from dirty polluting fossil fuels may never be possible at all. But for damage and destruction from global warming due to carbon and GHG emissions playing havoc made scientists and researchers carrying out extensive works on climate issues and renewable energy. Stanford University, recently collated research papers by 91 authors. These analysed different scenarios whether individual nations or the entire regions could get exclusively reliant on renewable energy. The findings were that it is technically possible and technologically feasible for switching to a fully sustainable global energy landscape within 2050. It was also found that greater geographical connectivity of solar, wind and hydropower can reduce energy use and cut costs. These would help achieve limiting global warming below 1.5 degree C by 2100. But for this, strong support and commitment of policymakers, businesses and all other stakeholders would be essential. The research papers reviewed different situations and geographies. Scenarios of small island states, developed countries and countries in sub-Saharan Africa came under the purview. In every case, the researchers considered energy for electricity generation, transport, heating and cooling of buildings and industry. The outcome of the research was yes. 100% or near 100% supply of energy can be made from renewable sources at different locations of the world. One such study reviewed global warming, air pollution and energy insecurity, creating Green New Deal roadmaps for 143 countries to confront the challenges. The roadmaps worked out requirements for countries contributing 99.7% of global CO2 emissions switching to 100% clean, renewable wind, water and solar power no later than 2050, with at least 80% by 2030. The study divided the world into 24 regions for working together on grid stability and energy storage solutions in order to meet energy demand matching supply between 2050 to 2052. If this can happen, it would be possible to power the entire world by sustainable energy. Just through switching to wind, water and solar worldwide, it would be possible to eliminate 4-7 million deaths from air pollution annually. Researchers in Finland reviewed the feasibility for developing a renewable super grid connecting the regions of North America, including the USA, Canada and Mexico. It appeared that dividing the regions to 20 interconnected sub-regions, based on population, energy demand, area and electricity grid structure, it would be possible to reduce storage requirements and overall costs of the energy system. Theoretically it sounds very encouraging. But achieving all the above would be only possible by 2030 with the full support of policymakers, investors and other relevant stakeholders. The above studies dealt with wind, solar and water energy only. According to some other studies, nuclear power is also considered another reasonably good environment-benign source of energy. For stringent and innovative safety regulations and closer international watchdogs, nuclear has become a safer and popular form of energy. But this would need countries having state-of-the-art modern technologies transferring this to other countries and assisting them with finance and human resources development. Moving Away from Coal and Oil Countries, which extensively rely on coal and oil, may appear reluctant to transit quickly. In fact some major developing countries desperately tried to rephrase the expression of phasing out coal as was the popular demand for inclusion in the Glasgow Climate Pact. Fortunately, global pressure could help achieve phasing down. Realistically, the end of the coal era is now in sight. There are great possibilities that most of the old technology using polluting coal power plants would be retired soon. Those built with modern ultra super critical technology and using superior qualities cleaner coal and keeping emissions below permissible limits would also be retired on due course and no new plants would be built after a while. It is not that countries are pledging for it, but also major financial institutions and donor countries have made fresh vows for not providing technical and financial assistance for new coal plants. As for transiting from oil, the example of Saudi Arabia, to a 100% renewable energy by 2040 can be mentioned. World is aware of the huge oil deposit. World is also aware of sunshine for powering solar energy. Finish study said that by 2050; solar power can contribute 79% of the country's energy demand supported by enhanced battery and water storage. Energy storage would play a central role in the transition to a sustainable energy landscape. This is essential for overcoming the intermittent nature of solar and wind resources. Bangladesh Priorities Bangladesh is on the threshold of industrial revolutions. A small country with very thick population density has to change its agro-based economy to industries. It needs energy for fueling the economic growth. For different reasons it could not explore and exploit all its potential own primary fuel resources (fossil fuels - coal and petroleum). It has huge challenges in relying on imported fuel as well. The energy generation is still predominantly fossil fuel based. It cannot and should not have immediate plans for scraping too many coal or gas based power generation schemes. It must endeavor for exploring and exploiting own primary fuel resources to the best of the ability. There is significant potential for solar and wind (specially, offshore wind). Not much potential for major hydro electricity. But Bangladesh has a great potential for being part of sub regional renewable energy grid (BBIN). It is not only hydroelectricity generation and sharing. India, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh must work more closely in setting up renewable energy regional grid benefitting all. Although not really a green energy, Bangladesh can have at least one more nuclear power plant in the Southern region. About 5000-6000MW nuclear by 2041 would be great for Bangladesh. From the lessons being learnt in Rooppur, it may not be difficult bringing another nuclear power plant on stream in less than 10 years say by 2030. Renewable energy either of own or from regional grid can contribute 20% in the fuel mix by 2030. Bangladesh must go all out for achieving energy efficiency. That in itself would act as third fuel. What Green World Would Mean? We are aware of the issues and challenges. We admit that the targets for limiting global warming to 1.5 degree C and Net Zero by 2050 are ambitious. But we are convinced that technologies exist for the world transiting to fully sustainable system by 2050. Mitigating the impacts of climate change would mean fewer natural calamities - cyclones, floods, tsunamis, bush fires, droughts caused due to global warming. The air would get cleaner. WHO report mentioned that nine out of ten people in the world now breathe polluted air. This causes respiratory diseases, heart conditions, strokes and other life threatening diseases. Pollution, mostly from burning fossil fuels, kills up to seven million people annually, this includes exposures to toxic fumes from using wood, coal and dung as primary cooking fuel. Transition to renewable and sustainable energy sources would also reduce energy bills well within affordable limits. Renewables are already on course of outpricing fossil fuels. But for attaining the objectives in the greater interest of human civilization, urgent actions need to be taken by all stakeholders, policymakers, business leaders, financial institutions, medias. World must act as a global village. \</doc>

Nov. 8 MANILA(Philippine Daily Inquirer/ANN)  More than 40 countries, including the Philippines, have signed a pledge to end use of coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, by 2030, as part of their broader commitments to curb the single biggest source of planet-warming emissions worldwide. But while the summit heralded the pledge as a signal for the "end of coal," several nations that are also the biggest coal emitters were also noticeably absent from the pledge, including the United States, China, India and Australia. The pact was signed on Thursday at the 26th session of the Conference of Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland, which is seen as the "best and last moment" to shore up international commitment to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep the planet from warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius. In signing the accord, the countries acknowledged that coal "is the single biggest cause of global temperature increases, and the reason why they must accelerate an energy transition to meet their shared goals under the 2015 Paris Agreement." Even so, for environmental and climate activists, the coal use pledge still "falls spectacularly short of what the moment requires." "An agreement that only tackles coal doesn't even solve half the problem," said Murray Worthy, campaign leader of Global Witness. "The science is absolutely clear, all fossil fuels must be phased out if we're to avoid the worst impacts of climate change." "A truly ambitious agreement on energy to put the world on course for 1.5 degrees Celsius would be a phaseout of coal, oil and gas. This is a small step forward when what was needed was a giant leap," he added. Among others, the four-clause pact seeks to rapidly scale up clean energy; scale up technologies and policies for energy transition; cease the issuance of permits and construction of new coal-fired power plants; and strengthen domestic and international efforts to provide a just transition from coal power. "We recognize that while significant progress has been made to realize our shared vision, our task is not yet complete, and we call on others to join us as we redouble our efforts to accelerate the global energy transition over the coming years," the pledge read. Cusi only signed Clauses 1 and 4 (clean energy and just transition from coal), and did not agree to the clause that would end permits and support for coal plants. "We are saddened by the half-baked position of the Department of Energy," environmental group Aksyon Klima said in a statement. "The agreement should have been a leverage and instrument to demand financing for energy transition toward greenhouse gas emissions avoidance." ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Nov. 3 Tokyo(Yomiuri Shimbun/ANN)  Prime Minister Fumio Kishida kicked off "Kishida diplomacy" in Glasgow on Tuesday morning, speaking with multiple world leaders at the U.N. global climate summit. Kishida traveled to Scotland for COP26 , or the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. He spoke briefly with U.S. President Joe Biden, and also met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. It was the first trip abroad as prime minister for Kishida, who announced the dissolution of the House of Representatives immediately after taking office on Oct. 4. During Kishida's meeting with Johnson, the two leaders confirmed that they would further promote defense cooperation, noting that Britain's most advanced aircraft carrier, the HMS Queen Elizabeth, docked at the U.S. Navy's base in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, in September. Kishida and Johnson also agreed to seek the early conclusion of a bilateral reciprocal access agreement for the mutual acceptance of troops. The two men met several times when they were both foreign ministers, and Johnson said he was glad to see Kishida, whom he called an old friend. With Morrison, Kishida is believed to have agreed to enhance close cooperation through the Quad framework of Japan, the United States, Australia and India to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific. Kishida also met with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh. They are believed to have shared concerns over China's unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force in the East China Sea and the South China Sea. Kishida's schedule is jam-packed as he prepares to inaugurate his second Cabinet on Wednesday, so he was in Britain for only about eight hours. He had limited time to meet with world leaders, but Kishida is believed to have decided to go because Japan skipping the COP summit for the first time in six years would give the impression that it was not that interested in climate change issues. "I had the opportunity to reunite with many old friends," Kishida said to reporters before leaving Glasgow. "We received high praise from many leaders and have been able to firmly demonstrate Japan's presence. I think my face-to-face diplomacy has started in a very positive way." Japan's foreign policy faces a mountain of challenges, including dealing with China and North Korea, which are stepping up military provocations, and improving relations with South Korea. Kishida intends to engage in summit diplomacy, making use of the personal connections he cultivated during his four years and seven months as foreign minister. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Dhaka, Dec. 11 -- The government yesterday gave a big push to its renewable energy and waste-based power generation drive as it approved five projects with a combined electricity production capacity of 223.5 megawatts. The cabinet committee on public purchase gave the go-ahead to the projects to be implemented by mainly Chinese companies. The government will purchase electricity from the projects for a period of 20 to 25 years. COP26 . The government will purchase electricity for 25 years from Canves Environmental Investment Company Ltd of China at Tk 17.20 per kilowatt-hour of power. Shaheen Kabir Khan, chief coordinator for Bangladesh at Canves, says the plant will be based on incineration technology, and its cost is low compared to other waste-based energy projects. The city corporation will supply 2,500 tonnes of mixed-waste per day to the plant after collecting them from city-dwellers. The estimated investment will be about $450 million and Canves will bear the cost. "It will be environment-friendly, and 40 per cent of investment will be spent to safeguard the environment," said Khan. The plant is part of the government initiative to set up waste-based power stations aiming to streamline waste management. On December 1, an agreement was signed between the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), the Dhaka North City Corporation, and China Machinery Engineering Corporation to develop the country's maiden waste-based power plant at Aminbazar in Dhaka. The plant will have capacity to produce 42.5 MW of electricity. There will be two more waste-to-power plants in near future in the city corporation areas of Narayanganj and Chattogram. Many such proposals have already been submitted to the ministry and the BPDB, said a BPDB official. The cabinet gave its consent to three solar power-run projects. Bangladesh-China Renewable Energy Company, a joint venture of North-West Power Generation Company and China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation, will set up a 60-MW solar power plant in Pabna's Sujanagar. Cyclect Energy Pte. Ltd of Singapore will build a 50-MW solar power plant in Chuadanga's Jibannagar upazila. The government will buy electricity at Tk 8.16 per unit. Western Renewable Energy Pvt Ltd will set up a 3MW solar-battery, diesel-based hybrid power plant in Monpura upazila of Bhola. Each unit will cost Tk 21.25. Khondaker Golam Moazzem, research director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue, described the focus on renewable energy as very positive. About waste-to-power generation, he said, "It would help waste management that is very tough to manage. Besides, electricity generated from such power plants would cut the dependency on fossil fuels." "However, site selection should be done with utmost care so that it doesn't affect local communities. The implications of such plants on the environment should also be taken into account." Currently, Bangladesh's installed power generation capacity is about 24,000 MW. Of the amount, 777 MWs are generated from renewable sources, representing about 3 per cent of the total production. Electricity generation from renewable sources is expected to rise as projects involving the capacity to produce about 2,000 MW of electricity are in the pipeline. Presently, nine solar power plants are being constructed with a combined capacity of 450 MW, and a wind power project that will produce 60 MW. Besides, deals are set to be inked to establish 12 solar plants with a collective generation capacity of 500 MW and a few other wind and biomass plants with the capacity totaling 130 MW. "Renewable energy in Bangladesh has made impressive strides in recent times, and the total power generation from the segment will increase significantly by the current fiscal year," said Mohammad Alauddin, chairman of the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority.

Dhaka, Sept. 24 -- Referring to climate scientists, a group of young people said that half a degree rise in temperature would significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat, higher sea levels and causing destruction. This slight rise would also bring poverty for hundreds of millions of people, particularly for those who live in the Global South, they pointed out. Demanding climate justice for all, ActionAid Bangladesh (AAB), in cooperation with young people, organised the Global Climate Strike for the third time on Friday, in front of the National Press Club, Dhaka. This Global Climate Strike was attended by more than a hundred representatives of young people including 15 transgender. In addition, young people from nine Local Rights Programme (LRP's) and two youth platforms (YouthNet for Climate Justice & Bindu) organised the global climate strike on the same day in 19 districts of Bangladesh. These effects will impact everyone, both rich and poor and be devastating to our most vulnerable people, especially the poorest, youngest, children and women, they also insisted. In this climate strike, AAB's Resilience and Climate Justice and Young People Strategic Priority reached out the unheard voices from youth for the upcoming Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ), Youth COP and other relevant events on climate issues. To reinforce 'Fridays for Future' and 'Global Climate Strike', young people of Bangladesh raised their voices and backed in solidarity with the theme 'Uproot the System'. In this colourful, sensible and non-violent strike, young activists along with people from across the society demanded climate justice by showing placards and posters titled 'There is no planet B'; 'STOP! Listen to My EARTH'; 'BURN Borders, NOT Coals'; 'Treat every crisis as crisis';'LOVE Trees, PLANT Trees'; and many more.

Dhaka, Nov. 22 -- Bangladesh produced 1,000 tonnes of textile waste in a year, until November this year, amounting to potentially a billion dollar worth of recycled textile, said a new global report. The new analysis showcased a strong case for other markets including Vietnam, Turkey, India, Malaysia and Indonesia, claiming there is a $4.5 billion worth of opportunity of recycling textile. Bangladesh is expected to produce an estimated 200 tonnes of textile waste per month by the end of 2021, which the study, Circular Fashion Partnership by Global Fashion Agenda (GFA), called a significant achievement in the context of the global pandemic. The report also highlights the actions needed to overcome the barriers to scaling systems, including formalising the informal waste management sector, providing alternatives to current used-cases for textile waste and assuring the supply of quality feedstock and demand for recycling output. Federica Marchionni, CEO, GFA, said: "This research proves that the necessary recycling technologies exist, deliver huge improvements in environmental impact and that the economics work at scale. "The challenge is providing conditions for scaling. With sufficient investment, supportive policies, and by enabling pre-competitive collaborations, I am optimistic that we can create a profitable circular system and accelerate fashion's journey to net zero." Bangladesh garments industry has shown resilience even during the Covid pandemic and is gaining momentum, said Faiyaz Murshid Kazi, Director General of the foreign ministry's wing for west Europe and EU. Mr Faiyaz highlighted some challenges in incorporating the study suggestion in the country. He, however, said the government will take the findings positively to further nourishment of the sector. The report titled "There is huge economic potential to scale this model beyond Bangladesh," published virtually on Monday, added that less than 1.0 per cent of the material used to produce clothing is recycled into new clothing, representing a loss of more than $100 billion worth of materials each year. In the aftermath of COP26 , GFA, the leading non-profit for industry collaboration on sustainability in fashion, and its Strategic Knowledge Partner, McKinsey & Company, published Scaling Circularity - a new report which reveals the opportunities and investment required to scale circular fashion systems. The report added that the fashion industry could become 80 per cent circular by 2030 if there is increased investment in existing recycling technologies and infrastructures. The findings are based on independent analysis and learnings from the Circular Fashion Partnership in Bangladesh - a cross-sectoral project to scale post-industrial recycling and capture textile value domestically in Bangladesh - one of the largest garment producing countries in the world. In order to deliver the 2030 scenario, it estimated that $5.0-7.0 billion investment is needed by 2026. The shift also requires increased confidence in the business case, calling for greater transparency of the demand for recycled output and the consistent supply of traceable high-quality feedstock. The clothing and textile industry accounts for 4.0 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions, equivalent to the emissions of France, Germany and UK combined, and material production is the largest polluter within the value chain - accounting for 70 per cent of fashion's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Scaling Circularity modelled the potential for scaling textile recycling across the full value chain in 2035 based on existing technologies. The analysis also indicated that major recycling technologies deliver better environmental outcomes across GHG emissions, water depletion and land use.

Dhaka, Oct. 30 -- Britain will send 20 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to developing countries by the end of this year, in what Prime Minister Boris Johnson will tell other world leaders is a much needed step to speed up the post-pandemic economic recovery. Leaders of the world's 20 richest countries are gathering in Rome at a meeting which Johnson hopes will make progress on producing firm commitments to cut emissions before climate talks in Glasgow at the United Nations COP26 summit, reports Reuters. But he also needs to get the backing from developing countries, some of which are already experiencing the devastating impact of global warming and have struggled to vaccinate their populations against Covid-19 as Western countries race ahead. At a meeting of the leaders of the seven largest advanced economies earlier this year, Britain pledged at least 100 million shots as part of a G7 aim to offer 1 billion doses, a scheme critics said was too slow and unambitious. Britain said in a statement it had delivered 10 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to the COVAX vaccine-sharing facility, with 10 million more to be delivered in the coming weeks, taking the total to 30.6 million in 2021. In 2022, Britain will donate at least 20 million more Oxford-AstraZeneca doses and also donate all the 20 million Janssen doses ordered by the government to the COVAX facility, backed by the World Health Organization and the GAVI vaccine alliance. "Like a waking giant, the world economy is stirring back to life. But the pace of recovery will depend on how quickly we can overcome COVID," Johnson will tell G20 leaders, according to his Downing Street office. Mass vaccination against the coronavirus is seen as crucial to restoring economic growth, trade and travel, but Western nations are racing ahead of developing countries, many of which have the lowest inoculation rates and rising cases. One hundred former leaders and government ministers from around the world have called on Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, who is hosting the G20 meeting, to address what they said was an unfair distribution of vaccines. They said the United States, European Union, Britain and Canada would be stockpiling 240 million unused vaccines by the end of the month, which these nations' military could immediately airlift to countries in greater need. By the end of February a total of 1.1 billion surplus vaccines could be transferred, it said. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Dhaka, Nov. 5 -- Progress and prosperity in South Asia are under threat. The UN scientific body Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which sets the gold standard for evidence of a changing climate, recently released the latest in a long list of studies drawing attention to the region's climate chaos. Yet, over the last decade, regional collective action to address the crisis has steadily dwindled and, in many cases, come undone. Without South Asian cooperation many of the goals of climate action are beyond reach. We have not seen a river treaty in over a quarter of a century; crucial shared resources, such as the air, underground water aquifers and biodiversity, remain largely ungoverned; constantly changing plans for a regional electricity trading mechanism, potentially crucial in the age of fickle renewables, have been sites of diplomatic bitterness. Moments for optimism, such as a SAARC Action Plan on Climate Change and a joint declaration by South Asian Environment Ministers in Dhaka in 2008 were quickly forgotten. This is unsurprising. The very idea of South Asia has been eroded by the unforgiving tides of recent geopolitics. China's economic dominance and new alliances in the region have exacerbated tensions between neighbouring India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal. Institutions such as the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) seem to be at the point of no return. It is ironic that, after decades of painstaking diplomatic work, we are left without an institutional safety net just as the climate crisis and other cross-border threats intensify. The case for regional climate cooperation The arbitrary nature of national borders makes climate change hard to manage. They are determined by politics and often completely neglect ecological boundaries and planetary systems. Today, impacts are felt across hard borders: melting glaciers are changing the hydrology of the entire Hindu Kush Himalayan region and its eight countries, erratic monsoons risk driving drought in some parts of India and devastating floods in others. The rigid borders of South Asia, so hastily defined in the middle of the last century, are unsuited to the problems of the 21st. The case for regional climate cooperation in South Asia is straightforward: in many areas of mitigation and adaptation, more can be achieved together than alone. The bulk of climate action will undeniably have to happen at the national and sub-national scales, but regional cooperation offers novel opportunities for progress. For example, a regional electricity grid would allow India to sell renewable power to its neighbours while they help balance sudden falls in production. Proponents dream about solar power from Rajasthan traversing the subcontinent to power Dhaka at dusk. A regional grid must be the foundation for India's grand plans of spearheading a global grid, recently announced at COP 26 to great fanfare. Jointly planned river basins could focus on reviving trade through inland waterways, which could mean significantly less emissions than road transport if correctly regulated. A united front at COP26 The climate talks are an opportunity to rebuild some momentum despite the region's fraught politics. There are concrete reasons to believe that this is a good moment for regional climate diplomacy. First, nearly all South Asian heads of governments have, in the recent past, publicly expressed their climate anxieties and established a variety of climate policies as scientific evidence has grown more alarming. Regional policies could be part of this brew. Second, climate finance commitments from developed countries and multilateral organizations are growing and could easily be channelled to projects that would benefit tens, if not hundreds of millions of South Asians. The region has a history of several large regional projects executed by capable intergovernmental and civil society institutions that have benefited South Asian cooperation, including the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) among others. Third, regional leadership is an easy way for India to burnish its credentials as a climate leader. The Least Developed Countries climate bloc, of which Bangladesh and Nepal are a part, recently issued a strong pre-COP statement reflecting the pressures felt by the countries least prepared to deal with climate change. Large countries in the Global South could gain by foregrounding those fears in regional and bilateral agendas. How to break the diplomacy deadlock Given the rising stakes of inaction, any attempt at revival would have to learn from the last two decades of South Asian history. In the context of fraught geopolitics, small, practical advances could lay the foundations for long-term cooperation. As former Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh noted at a recent event organised by The Third Pole, begin negotiations with small and meaningful steps while avoiding 'conversation-stoppers' at all costs. This strategy would, for example, put collaborative scientific programs on Himalayan glaciers before updated river treaties. The creative energies of states and provinces might also revitalise the South Asian project. India's mountain states might, for example, benefit from exchanges with Nepal's mountain provinces or Bhutan in matters of adaptation or scientific institution building. States sharing groundwater reservoirs might find it useful to speak to each other before national governments get involved. States in India's east and northeast might be able to work out ways of creating small-scale, localised inland waterway trade that benefit border communities with neighbouring countries. National governments will always have the final say, but these conversations could shape bilateral negotiations in productive ways. Funding the change for South Asian cooperation The 2010 Thimphu Declaration by SAARC heads of government called for a study to explore ways of providing capital for 'projects that promote low-carbon technology and renewable energy'. This is a strong and legitimate foundation for such a fund, though it would be more useful if it covered both mitigation and adaptation given how much our understanding of South Asian vulnerability has grown since then. Separating climate cooperation and geopolitics For this to work, climate action must be de-securitised. This is being attempted elsewhere, notably between the US and China. It makes sense because South Asia is a subcontinent with ecological continuities; it is also a way of keeping the South Asian project alive. COP26 is an opportunity for South Asian leaders to make a start by reaffirming their commitment to the Thimphu Declaration, or some version of it. The climate crisis is always spoken of as a source of political fragmentation but, with pragmatic diplomacy, it could well rejuvenate an ailing political project.

Nov. 3 MANILA(Inquirer/ANN)  Consultants for the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have recommended three coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) with an aggregate capacity of 967 megawatts as priority for retirement through the ADB's Energy Transition Mechanism or ETM, which is to be launched at COP26 in Glasgow on Nov. 3. In a 119-page report to the ADB penned by Carbon Trust, Asia Group Advisors and Climate Smart Ventures, the three groups were among the shortlisted CFPPs that represent about 5,900 MW or 54 percent of the Philippines' coal-based installed power generation capacity. The recommended shortlist includes 10 out of the country's 28 CFPPs. The CFPPs were analyzed based on how their retirement would affect the power grid's security, whether their operations were economically viable in terms of generating strong cash flows and how their retirement would contribute to carbon emissions reduction. "Plants shortlisted for financial analysis ... have an estimated market value of $7 billion [or about P353 billion]," the consultants said. First to goThe power plants' valuation is expected "to range from $400,000 to $2 million per megawatt, with the smaller plants with more profitable PPAs (power purchase agreements or supply contracts) driving the valuation higher," they added. The report identified as top priority for retirement under ADB's ETM the generators that belong to Palm Concepcion Power Corp.'s or PCPC (135 MW in Iloilo), DMCI group's SEM Calaca Power Corp. (600 MW in Batangas) and state-firm Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corp. or PSALM (232 MW in Misamis Oriental). Other priority CFPPs for retirement were the 1,294-MW Sual; 1,185-MW Pagbilao and 511-MW Quezon Power facilities. "Asset owners are expected to request for full value and alignment with [the value of comparable power plants in the market], with no clear direction from DOE (Department of Energy) on future coal retirement," the report said. Speaking at the United Nations Climate Summit last April, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said the government was studying the possibility of setting up a fund to acquire all coal-powered plants in Mindanao, with the idea of shutting them down as the energy delivery of the Agus hydropower plants increased when they have been rehabilitated. Last Oct. 25, Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi said the DOE was not looking at a phaseout of coal-fired plants in Mindanao. "Most of the coal-fired plants in the region are relatively new, having begun their commercial operations in 2015 to 2017," Cusi said. "Our decarbonization scenario will look into the possibility of converting fossil-fired power plants to other fuels such as biomass, fuelwood, etc." The ADB consultants report explained that they prioritized for retirement those CFPPs that were relatively more mature, of large size and medium level of utilization. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home \</doc>

Dhaka, Dec. 4 -- Early last month marked the 26th round of negotiation or Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The summit was held in Glasgow, Scotland and dragged on for two weeks beginning on October 31. The summit was scheduled to end on November 12 but was extended for an extra day. Emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) have a global impact, unlike some other forms of pollution. Whether they are emitted in Asia, Africa, Europe or the Americas, they rapidly disperse evenly across the globe. This is the reason why efforts to address climate crisis have been going on through international collaboration and agreement. Nearly 200 countries attended the meeting and they produced an outcome document called the "Glasgow Climate Pact" on November 13. According to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres the document "reflects the interests, the contradictions, and the state of political will in the world today". He further added, "It is an important step, but not enough". The document in reality just provided a semblance of progress made in an effort to resolve the global climate crisis. Major rival powers pursued their respective agenda resulting in a half baked document reflecting the lack of agreement even on purely voluntary arrangements to reduce GHG emissions as agreed in Paris in 2015. The Financial Times in an editorial wrote "more hot air than progress at COP26 ". Neither dire warnings of scientists nor the visible everyday consequences of extreme weather have fundamentally altered the very pathetic response to the climate crisis. Since the very late eighteenth century, the world has experienced extraordinary but uneven economic growth largely due to the use of fossil fuels. This process of growth based on the use of fossil fuels which caused GHG emissions leading to the current climate crisis. The crisis is coming at us very hard and fast. We are also losing forests, biodiversity, agricultural land, fisheries at a frightening rate across the whole world. Fresh water shortages and toxic accumulations are reaching at a critical point threatening sustainable living on this planet. Also, in particular the low elevation costal zone population in countries like Bangladesh in developing regions are most vulnerable to sea level rise due to global warming. These regions are vulnerable to coastal hazards such as storm surges, coastal erosion and salt water intrusion. Such climate crisis induced hazards will seriously endanger the economic livelihood of the people in these regions, especially the poor. It is also to be noted that there has been no mention of multinational corporations and national coal and oil companies who are responsible for more than two thirds of global GHG emissions during the Glasgow summit by the mainstream media. Also there was no mention of the role of the US and its war industry's contribution to global warming by continually waging wars in various parts of the world since the end of the WWII. The US war industry has created incalculable amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and toxic waste further adding to the environmental degradation. In fact, the Biden administration aimed to use the summit as part of pushing through its anti-China policy designed to unleash military violence against China. Even the declining days of the US imperial power did not stop President Joe Biden to continue to use the climate summit to achieve the US geo-political and economic objectives. He declared to "turn the climate crisis into an opportunity to put us on a path not only to compete but to win the economic competition of the 21st century against China and every other country in the world". Historically, the US and Europe mostly contributed to CO2 emissions accounting for 75 per cent of cumulative CO2 emissions between 1850 and 1990. Therefore, the primary responsibility for reducing the current and future emissions lie with developed countries. However, since the early 1990s the relative cumulative share of the US and Europe has declined to little above 50 per cent now. The reason for the relative decline is due to emissions of CO2 from developing countries like China, India and others, growing at a faster rate due to increased levels of economic activity as reflected in these countries GDP growth rates. China now stands as the largest emitter of CO2 accounting for 28 per cent in 2018 while the US was responsible for 15 per cent CO2 emissions in the same year. But the US still has one of the highest rates of per capita emissions in the world far ahead of China or India. Bangladesh was responsible for 0.21 per cent of CO2 emissions during the same year. Although climate crisis mitigation agreements emphasising carbon emission reduction have been reached through international approaches, the policy measures to meet the obligations and objectives set by such agreements are implemented at the national or regional level. In this regard Article 6 of the Paris agreement provides the foundation for creating a global carbon market to help deliver on emission commitments. The Glasgow pact further strengthens that market based approach to ensure the functioning of the global carbon market. This market based climate crisis mitigation approach has been described by many as "green capitalism". The main idea behind market based environmental policies is that the market would be used to solve the climate crisis. In other words, the cause of the problem ( i.e., the market) to be used as the solution to the problem. Market based instruments of environmental policy involve carbon taxes, emission trading that allows for the tradable permits to pollute, also known as carbon offset. Advocates of market based approaches believe that environmental policy instruments such as trade of permits to pollute (i.e., carbon offset) could motivate firms to improve their emission levels and could be a new source of government revenue which could be then used to fund public programmes. A carbon tax sets a price on carbon by designing a tax rate on GHG emissions. Carbon pricing, therefore, frames climate crisis as a market failure rather than as a fundamental system problem. Most market failures are inherent in the characteristics of the current market system. The market failure argument emphasises that carbon pricing incetivises firms or actors to seek the lowest cost abatement options for their specific circumstances. As such price on carbon - such as tax or an emission trading permit would internalise the external costs of GHGs. A market based solution postulates that the primary role of the government is to set the right price and leave the rest to the market. Such an argument does not recognise that climate crisis mitigation policy development arena is highly contested and politicised, making the market also a politically contested area. Therefore, carbon pricing strategies are not politically neutral but normative in nature with major distributional consequences. Now if one looks at carbon pricing in developed countries, the political nature of markets becomes very clear. According to the OECD effective taxes on CO2 from energy varies from EUR 107 per tonne in Switzerland to EUR 2.80 in Mexico. Australia a major producer and exporter coal carbon price is EUR 18. It is estimated that about 80 percent of world emissions right now still have effective zero price on them. According to the World Bank, almost a quarter of world GHG emissions are from countries that have a cap on-and-trade system or carbon tax system. There are also concerns that rich countries are foisting green capitalism on developing countries blocking out any other options. Most of the green initiatives like planting forestry and carbon trading initiatives are market based responses to the climate crisis that rely upon the mitigation strategies in the global South (developing countries) to offset industrial and other polluting activities in the global North (developed countries). The global carbon market economy incentivises the privatisation and commodification of common land and forest resources in the global South, thereby promoting a new reclonisation process that can be termed as the "new carbon colonialism". Market based approaches are intended to stimulate the optimisation of the market system rather than transform the system that created climate crisis in the first place. This is akin to having the cause of the problem made into the solution of the problem. Also, many consider that most elements of these approaches are designed as financial instruments which serve the financial industry rather than the environment. Market based environment policies are essentially pro-business with the environmental concerns viewed as secondary to their interests. While rich nations pushed for market based approaches to the climate crisis or what has been dubbed as green capitalism during the Glasgow summit, Bolivian President Luis Arce warned that true solutions to the planetary emergency require moving beyond capitalism or more green capitalism to an "alternative model" that centers on living " well together in harmony with Mother Earth". That will require setting environmental standards to preserve Nature and the environment, protect against damage and repair past damages enforced through regulatory instruments.

Dec. 8 Jakarta(Jakarta Post/ANN)- I had the honor of leading a congressional delegation of United States House of Representative members to Jakarta, the first such visit since the COVID-19 pandemic began nearly two years ago. Our visit came on the heels of a positive meeting between US President Joe Biden and Indonesian President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo at the climate conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, the first in-person meeting since the two leaders took office. Although much has changed since US Congressional members last visited Indonesia, Jakarta's strong voice in ASEAN and leadership role in the broader Indo-Pacific has remained constant. Our high-level meetings with Indonesian cabinet and parliamentary members highlighted Indonesia's economic and strategic prominence both of which will be on further display with Indonesia's Group of 20 presidency in 2022. Given our common interest in promoting a peaceful, prosperous, and stable Indo-Pacific, the US and Indonesia must work jointly to advance our many shared priorities. First is the need for continued cooperation to defeat COVID-19 by vaccinating as many people as possible. The US has donated 16.9 million doses of vaccines to Indonesia this year and committed more than US$77 million to support Jakarta's COVID-19 response. We can further work together to enhance the capacity of the Indonesian pharmaceutical sector one of the fastest growing in Asia to manufacture vaccines and medicines. Second, the US and Indonesia should partner in rebuilding and diversifying global supply chains. The global health crisis caused severe disruptions across many sectors and exposed the vulnerabilities of relying excessively on a select few countries. As the world slowly recovers from the pandemic, the US should work closely with trusted partners such as Indonesia to secure our supply chains and prevent them from being potentially used as leverage. Such investments in the bilateral economic relationship are particularly relevant at a time when Indonesia has sought to lift bureaucratic obstacles that traditionally hampered foreign direct investment. Third is the urgent need to find a durable solution to the crisis in Myanmar. I am particularly concerned by the likelihood of escalated violence from the Myanmar military during the oncoming dry season. Indonesia has been a responsible leader on this issue since the February coup in Myanmar, working tirelessly with other ASEAN countries to finalize the five-point consensus and to try and facilitate constructive dialogue between the Tatmadaw (Myanmar military) and the democratic opposition. Washington should continue to partner with ASEAN countries to ensure humanitarian assistance can get to the Myanmar people and prevent the humanitarian crisis from worsening while supporting ASEAN's central role in responding to the crisis. Fourth, our countries should further our cooperation in the maritime space in defense of Indonesia's sovereignty near the Natuna Islands and our collective rights to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. As certain regional actors continue to assert their unlawful maritime claims and disrupt regional stability, the US and Indonesia should enhance bilateral security cooperation and bolster the region's own capabilities to ensure a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific. Finally, as we look ahead to Indonesia's presidency of the G20 in 2022, the US and Indonesia have an opportunity together to make further progress to combat climate change, the existential crisis of our generation. As one of the first countries in the developing world to sign on to the Global Methane Pledge, Indonesia has demonstrated its commitment to be a climate leader. We should build on the trust and cooperation our two nations have developed through our bilateral climate working group to create opportunities to attract public and private financing required to achieve higher climate ambition. As the second and third largest democracies in the world, the US and Indonesia benefit from building on the momentum created after the recent meeting between President Biden and President Jokowi as well as our fruitful Congressional delegation visit to Jakarta. As chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, I look forward to further strengthening the US-Indonesian Strategic Partnership to advance a peaceful and prosperous Southeast Asia and broader Indo-Pacific region. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Nov. 18 Jakarta(Jakarta Post/ANN)- Many decades from now when the Earth is so much hotter than today, many people in Indonesia and around the world will look back and wonder why countries failed to stem the use of coal, knowing perfectly well that it would accelerate global warming with dire consequences for the environment. They will find stories of how world leaders at their meeting in the United Kingdom city of Glasgow in November 2021 discussing climate change only pledged to phase down, instead of to completely phase out, coal. They will learn that developing countries, led by China and India, decided that coal was irreplaceable as a source of energy to fuel their economy and to lift millions of their people out of poverty. India led the campaign at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow to water down a deal proposed by many other countries to push for a 2030 deadline to phase out coal. Most scientists agree this is what is needed to curb the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the maximum tolerable level to prevent catastrophic environmental destruction. India says it still needs to use cheap coal to fuel economic growth. China pledges its coal use will peak up until 2030. Indonesia, which burns its coal as well as exports some, including to China and India, has made a concession on its commitment when to end it all, albeit with a qualification. Currently, Indonesia plans to end the use of coal by 2056, which is essentially when the last of its existing coal-fired power plants, and many more that are still coming online in the next few years, will retire. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani says Indonesia could move the date forward to 2040 if it can raise up to US$40 billion needed to convert these coal plants into using renewable energy resources. Where is the money going to come from? The Asian Development Bank, which is helping Indonesia craft the coal exit strategy, will finance some of it. But the bulk of the money will have to come from developed countries. That is a big "if" going by Glasgow, where these countries fell short of making the financial commitments of $100 billion by 2020 needed to help developing countries fight global warming. In fact, the move toward net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050 hinges on financing from rich countries, which are largely responsible for the current state of the climate deterioration. Indonesia will find it particularly difficult to kick its coal addiction. Coal is very much part of its energy security strategy, fuelling more than one third of all its power plants. Current high prices of coal in the world market mean that its export is bringing in the dollars to help the economic revival after the pandemic-induced recession. As other countries phase out coal, including China after 2030, Indonesia will be left with a huge surplus that it will have to burn itself. Besides, Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar stated last week that President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo's massive economic development program must not be stopped in the name of zero carbon emission and zero deforestation. Decades from now, when Indonesia feels the brunt of global warming, many of us will look back and ask, has it been worth it? ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Fuel prices in Bangladesh will fall in line with prices in the international market, State Minister for Energy, Power and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid said Saturday, in the aftermath of the shock move to hike the prices of diesel and kerosene by Tk15 - over 23 percent - in one go. The state minister could not say however, when that might happen, since price movements in the international market are dictated by market forces. The IMF in its official blog does not expect the current surge in energy prices to ease until next year. "Our expectation is that these prices will revert to more normal levels early next year when heating demand ebbs and supplies adjust," said the blog post authored by Andrea Pescatori, Chief of the Commodities Unit in the IMF Research Department. Hamid, speaking from Glasgow, tried to justify the hike by pointing out the government has also cut fuel prices in the past, in line with falling prices internationally at the time. 'Fuel prices were cut in 2016. Now fuel prices have been readjusted with the hike in global prices and to prevent smuggling,' he said in a views-exchange meeting with reporters in Glasgow, where he is part of the Bangladesh contingent at COP26 . 'Today (Nov 6) diesel price in India's Kolkata is Rs 89.79, equal to Tk 104 per liter. The number of trucks entering the country everyday through the 26 land ports is also a matter of consideration. There is a possibility of fuel smuggling.' 'We have to go for electric vehicles. If public transports could be made to run on electricity, it will be environment-friendly. These will reduce spending on importing fuel,' he added. The government raised the prices of diesel and kerosene to Tk 80 from Tk 65 at the retail level last Wednesday - a rise of more than 23 percent in one go. An exceptionally rapid global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic-induced recession has seen global gas, coal and electricity prices rise in recent weeks to their highest levels in decades. Natural gas prices have seen the biggest increase, according to the International Energy Agency, with European and Asian benchmark prices hitting an all-time record last week - around ten times their level a year ago at the height of the pandemic. In a statement, the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources said, "Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) has been incurring a loss of Tk 20 crore per day as it is selling each liter of diesel at Tk 13.01 lower than the import price, and each liter of furnace oil at Tk 6.21 lower than the import price." As such, it said the retail prices were being adjusted in line with the surging energy prices on the international market. The association of bus, truck and van owners went on an indefinite strike from Friday in protest against fuel price hike. \</doc>

Jan. 3 Karachi(Dawn/ANN)-Trends point to an unsettled world with global solidarity and leadership in short supply. THE start of the new year is when one looks ahead to identify key global trends and risks in the coming year and consider whether any geopolitical shifts can be expected. What are the newer challenges that may emerge and longer standing ones that will be reinforced? Many think tanks across the world undertake such assessments as do leading international publications and investment firms. The coronavirus pandemic that overwhelmed the world over the past two years will continue to pose a challenge in 2022. The pandemic's new phase triggered in late 2021 by the Omicron variant dampened hopes that the virus would be defeated by vaccination drives. By the start of the year the world braced itself for another surge and emergence of vaccine resistant variants. Europe and the US struggled with a 'tsunami of cases' as fears grew that the new wave would also engulf Asia. 2022 will see countries deal with the multifaceted, disruptive fallout of Covid, and above all, its economic consequences especially stagflation as growth slows and inflation rises across the world. Global supply chain disruptions are expected to continue pushing up prices. Most assessments see inflation as a key global trend in 2022, which will jeopardise economic recovery. The geopolitics of vaccines will continue as will vaccine diplomacy and the grim reality of unequal access to vaccination by rich and developing countries. The lesson of the past year has gone largely unlearnt  that no one is protected unless everyone is protected. Yet vaccine disparities persist, urging the WHO chief to again call for an end to "global vaccine inequity". Tom Standage, editor of the Economist's 'World Ahead in 2022' publication, optimistically counts among the top 10 trends the transition of the pandemic to an endemic as a result of anti-viral pills, upgraded vaccines and antibody treatments. But he concludes tellingly that the virus will remain deadly in the developing world while rich countries will extricate themselves from Covid. The lack of global solidarity witnessed during the pandemic is another trend likely to persist in many areas this year. Despite assertions by the world's big powers to strengthen multilateralism and international cooperation, the reality has been different with competition rather than collaboration being the dominant dynamic. Countries' preoccupation with domestic problems will also weaken global cooperation. The annual Strategic Survey by the London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies identifies "the cooperation gap in various key areas" as a top trend which is already evident. But it also cites some "cooperation successes" including the new START treaty and COP26 (on climate change). The larger picture, however, is of dynamics driving greater division in the world. In similar vein, the Financial Times in a recent editorial described "serious failings of international coordination and cooperation" as a danger in the context of the pandemic. But this is also more widely applicable to a world where the key strategic driver of events is tensions between big powers. Far from abating these have intensified  a trend also expected to assert itself in the year ahead. East-West tensions will continue to contribute to an increasingly fragmented international system. The world's most consequential relationship is that between the US and China. The course of relations between them will be the most significant geopolitical dynamic in 2022. Their confrontation may take a more dangerous turn if tensions over Taiwan spin out of control despite efforts to manage them by high-level bilateral contacts. Most assessments see tensions between them as a top risk with their tech war leading to increasing bifurcation of the digital world. One result of their competition, according to Ian Bremmer, head of the Eurasia group, would be "a decoupling of the vying powers and a world where nations become more commercially aligned with either China or the United States". This in fact may be a key question this year  whether many countries will be obliged to fall into alignments with one or the other even if they may not want to choose between them. A weak geopolitical order is a trend forecast by Control Risks, a UK-based consultancy group. It sees this as emerging from the absence of a dominant global power that sets the terms and conditions for global trade and international security. This in turn has resulted from "America's broader retreat into domestic concerns and pivot towards further east" as also "symbolised by its chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan". One consequence is increased chances of regional or local intra-state conflicts erupting or intensifying. The IISS survey for example sees this trend epitomised by Ethiopia's internal conflict. Others see possibilities of longer-standing regional flashpoints threatening international stability. Technological shifts will continue by leaps and bounds even as Big Tech will be exposed to greater scrutiny for both its monopolistic practices and harmful content. The Wall Street Journal described this as one of last year's main tech events that will shape the future. The Economist report calls it a Techlash. Even so, the digital world that became so pervasive in people's lives in the pandemic will continue to influence the way people work, communicate, entertain themselves and shop. Another trend is of escalating humanitarian crises in different parts of the world which is highlighted in several assessments especially by UN agencies. Humanitarian needs are expected to reach a record level in the year ahead, the result of a combination of conflict, pandemic and climate change. The UN's relief agency OCHA has launched an appeal for an unprecedented $41 billion to help 183 million people who need life-saving assistance across the world. Among these the dire situation in Afghanistan stands out, which has been worsening despite recent international efforts to step up humanitarian aid. The geopolitical consequences of a humanitarian catastrophe are all too apparent. In its list of the top 12 risks for 2022 the Washington-based Atlantic Council points to the danger of state collapse in Afghanistan with far-reaching repercussions for the world. The likely trends in 2022 mean that the world will remain in an unsettled and volatile phase in which overlapping challenges will test governments at a time when international solidarity and leadership will be in short supply. ___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 30 -- Almost eight billion people living on this planet will face an existential crisis in a matter of decades if the global economy continues to be powered by coal, oil, and natural gas. Fossil-fuel-powered development would not only stall, but it will also cause the planet to face an apocalyptic disaster making it inhabitable for any living species if the cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide keep piling up as rapidly as it is doing today. Since 1995, there have been conferences on climate change, now termed climate emergency. Reams of papers have been churned out detailing action plans, mandates, and protocols. The summits resulted in mostly flimsy commitments and acrimonious breakdowns. Despite uproars inside the conference halls and shouts of protests on the streets the rise of greenhouse-gas content in the atmosphere and the warming of the climate continues unabated. Global carbon emissions have risen rapidly and remain too high to avoid severe and irreversible climate change impacts. The only summit that yielded some tenable agreements was held in 1995 in Paris where all parties, rich and poor, committed to keeping the rise in Earth's temperature since the mid-19th century well below 2degC. COP26 climate summit of politicians, diplomats, scientists, activists, the media, and entrepreneurs begins on today (Sunday, October 31). COP stands for 'Conference of the Parties" where governments get together to make crucial decisions about what they will do about the climate crisis. Pundits believe, such a global gathering in Glasgow will be different from those in the past and may force change in the government policies of the countries bound by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Let's hope for the best. Bangladesh is one of the developing countries that is severely impacted by climate change and the least able to afford its consequences. In fact, the whole continent of Asia is the most vulnerable area where about one and a half billion people live in the tropics. Millions of Asians live near the coasts. They will have to bear the heaviest costs of living with floods, storms, heat waves, and droughts unless fossil fuel is replaced by green fuel for their development. They must not wait for what the developed countries aim to ensure zero-emission in the future. It would be suicidal if we the Asians believe that the industrialised countries alone must reduce their emissions to compensate for their historical overuse of fossil fuels in the past centuries. As the world heats up, Bangladesh along with other Asian countries must leave fossil fuels behind. We cannot afford to refuse to embrace carbon neutrality. While contributing less than 0.35 per cent of global emissions, Bangladesh earned plaudits from world leaders for taking long-term initiatives such as Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan up to 2030, National Solar Energy Roadmap, 2021-2041, National Action Plan for Clean Cooking, 2020-2030, etc. Bangladesh is trying to adopt climate-resilient initiatives and adapt to inevitable climate change. But, as to mitigation, Bangladesh is behind many developing countries. In the 'Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC)' to UNFCC submitted in 2015, Bangladesh committed to reducing its Green House Gas-emissions only by 5.0 per cent below business-as-usual level by 2030 using only domestic resources and this reduction level may be extended up to 15 per cent if sufficient external fund is received. Such poor commitment sounds very much non-Bangladeshi. While India plans to reduce 30-35 per cent and many other developing nations are setting greater reduction targets, Bangladesh does not exhibit promising signs in this regard. It is time Bangladesh should keep up with the rest of the world, take concrete actions and frame laws on climate change and shun away from coal and fossil fuel, if not entirely from natural gas. Our people have displayed their indomitable resilience in the face of hurdles to achieve national goals. We have shown spectacular performance not only in cricket but also in achieving many millennial development goals (MDGs). In 2016, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina announced to make Bangladesh free from tobacco by 2040---a gigantic goal even a superpower would not dare to target. The goal is achievable as smoking has already declined in Bangladesh. Why not should we set a target of zero emission of carbon dioxide by 2040, too? It may sound outrageous when Australia sets the target of zero-emission by 2050. Saying goodbye to emissions is difficult as our economic interests are geared towards fossil fuels and carbon-intensive activities, with coal, oil, and natural gas fuelling our economic development. Still, achieving such an audacious goal is possible if we have a resolute and enduring commitment. All countries, developing or developed, should have zero-emission target. We have a hydroelectric power plant and a nuclear power plant in the making. Solar power plants are already in place generating electricity. The government has set a target of generating 1700 MW from utility-scale solar plants and 250 MW from the solar home systems by 2030. With a view to attaining zero-emission, our objectives should be an effective climate policy aligned with growth, more infrastructure investment, higher energy security from non-fossil sources, technological transformation, and a healthier environment. We must go for more solar panels, electric cars, and more forests. By embarking upon a goal of attaining carbon neutrality in two decades Bangladesh may emerge as a trailblazer in the war against carbon emission. Glasgow conference is happening at a difficult time when energy is so hard to come by. Some provinces in China are rationing electricity, Europeans are paying sky-high prices for liquefied natural gas, power plants in India are on the verge of running out of coal, and the average price of gasoline is going up all over the world. The sudden energy crunch hitting the world is threatening already stressed supply chains, stirring geopolitical tensions and raising questions about whether the world is ready for the green energy revolution. Leaders and pundits heading to the Glasgow climate talks have made progress in recent years in their respective countries. Over the past decade, the industrialised nations have started slowing the emissions, thanks to the rapid rise of clean energy. But Earth is still on a dangerous track. Herculean efforts must be taken by governments and businesses of the entire world to shift course to avoid a dangerous rise in global temperatures in the years ahead. Just the other day, 18-year-old Greta Thunberg, an environmental activist, gave the oldies of the world a lecture on what we are doing to the planet using "Blah Blah Blah" like a lightning rod for satire. Greta mugged politicians for being namby-pamby on climate change. Greta was a bit bellicose in her tweet: "We can no longer let the people in power decide what hope is. Hope is not passive. Hope is not blah blah blah. Hope is telling the truth. Hope is taking action." Let's hope Greta Thunberg doesn't come up with another piece of comedy after the COP26 climate summit on Sunday.

International Finance Corporation (IFC) announced on Wednesday that it will partner with two institutional investors- Allianz through Allianz Global Investors, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority- to create a new $3 billion global platform for climate-smart investment aligned with the Paris Agreement. The new program, MCPP One Planet, combines institutional investor contributions with IFC's own funds to scale up climate-responsible financing for private companies in emerging markets, said the multilateral donor agency said in a statement. MCPP One Planet will create the world's first cross-sectoral portfolio of emerging-market loans aligned with the Paris Agreement. The facility enables institutional investors to directly provide capital for sustainable lending in emerging markets - allowing investors to scale up their exposure to this asset class and increase the share of their portfolios aimed at climate-resilient development. MCPP One Planet builds on successful collaboration between IFC and its partners and will mark a further scale-up of IFC's innovative Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Program (MCPP) private debt platform. Since its launch in 2013, MCPP has raised over $10 billion from 11 investors and provided financing to more than 200 firms across 55 developing countries. Announcing MCPP One Planet at COP26 today, IFC Managing Director Makhtar Diop said, "Expanding partnerships with some of the world's largest investors is fundamental to scaling up financial flows to emerging markets for climate-smart solutions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. MCPP One Planet will create a global model for mobilization of institutional investor financing in support of the climate agenda for the most vulnerable communities on the frontlines of climate change - in emerging and developing economies." "Our strong partnership with IFC and engaged investors enable us to shape programs like MCPP One Planet and contribute to climate-smart economic growth in markets of scale. Huge sums need to be invested to bring emerging markets along a Paris-aligned trajectory, and we are keen to help structure these public-private collaborations and mobilize the required capital," said Oliver B\'e4te, Chief Executive Officer of Allianz SE. "In 2016, together with Allianz and IFC, we set up a blueprint to mobilize private capital via the MCPP on infrastructure. Today, we are proud to extend our successful partnership to the MCPP One Planet. It is a great example for effectively scaling private capital for sustainable investing as part of our Development Finance business," said Deborah Zurkow, Global Head of Investments, Allianz Global Investors. "The HKMA has partnered with IFC in the MCPP initiative targeting sustainable investments across emerging markets since 2017. We are very pleased to further our partnership with IFC to develop MCPP One Planet which aligns with the HKMA's commitment to green and sustainable investments', said Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA Climate risk is one of the biggest threats to our planet and future generations. Joining hands with IFC allows the HKMA to tap into the considerable expertise, experience and network of IFC in sourcing investable and climate-responsible opportunities with proper risk management and governance framework. Together with IFC and other like-minded partners, we believe the MCPP One Planet initiative will support emerging markets in accelerating their transition to low-carbon economies and provide the catalytic and demonstrative effect in the scaling of climate-responsible investments,"he added. \</doc>

Oct. 29 Kolkata(The Statesman/ANN)- Monday's warning by the United Nations is as stern as it is relevant for the world at large. Indeed, it forms a template for the next climate change conference in Glasgow, which is aimed at averting dangerous levels of warming. The nub of the matter must be that that greenhouse gas concentrations have hit a record high and the world is what the UN calls "way off track" on capping burgeoning temperatures that have almost incredibly affected even the Arctic. It is a measure of the environmental pollution generally that the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has mentioned that carbon dioxide levels ballooned to 413.2 parts per million in 2020. This is more than the average rate over the past decade despite a drop ~ it has turned out to be temporary ~ in emissions during the almost worldwide lockdowns in the wake of Covid-19. The SecretaryGeneral of WMO has made it explicit that the current rate of increase in "heat-trapping gases" would result in rise in temperature far in excess of the 2015 Paris target of 1.5 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial average. "We are way off track," he said. "We need to revisit our industrial, energy and transport systems." He has called for a dramatic increase in commitments at the COP26 conference beginning on Sunday. In point of fact, the pow-wow at the high table in the Scottish city of Glasgow may be an appropriate opportunity to cap global warming at the 1.5 degree Celsius upper limit, as recommended in Paris six years ago. Yet the target is easier suggested than accomplished. Red herrings across the trail there will be. Which arguably explains the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson's cynicism ~ "it is going to be very very tough this summit. It might go wrong and we might not get the agreements that we need." The Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, will travel to Glasgow to participate, though she is going through the wrapup motions of her place at the helm. The stakes for the summit are high, not least the impact on livelihoods the world over and the stability of the global financial system. Given the parameters, a positive conduct of the summit can be expected to yield results for the "greatest good of the greatest number", as Jeremy Bentham had once observed in another context. And as Mr Johnson has remarked, "It is touch and go. Though it is difficult, I think it can be done". As the world struggles to curb the damage to the environment, President Joe Biden has made an earnest effort to jettison Donald Trump's impervious matrix. There may be hope yet in that Saudi Arabia pledged last weekend to reach "net zero" emissions of greenhouse gas, produced in the main by burning fossil fuel, by 2060. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Dhaka, Dec. 22 -- Rising temperatures and sea levels, droughts and floods, and more frequent and intense natural disasters are impacting billions of people around the world. In response, the World Bank Group -which provides more than half of multilateral climate finance to developing countries and more than two-thirds of adaptation finance - continues to prioritise climate across all its operations. Our work is driven by a relentless focus on results, ensuring that our climate financing contributes to development outcomes that improve people's well-being and also helps set countries toward a low-carbon resilient future. As countries grapple with the health and economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic, focusing on climate and development is more important than ever before, and there is a real opportunity for countries to make climate action a core part of their Covid recovery efforts. To this end, the World Bank has redoubled its focus on Green, Resilient, and Inclusive Development (GRID), pursuing poverty eradication and shared prosperity with a sustainability and resilience lens. We have kept climate at the forefront of our work. In FY21 the Bank delivered record annual climate financing of over $21 billion, an increase of 50 per cent in two years, with half going towards climate adaptation. We also launched our new Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP) 2021-2025 to help countries and the private sector undertake high-impact climate actions that also deliver on their development objectives. The Plan represents a shift from "greening" projects to supporting countries in greening their entire economies, and from focusing on inputs to focusing on outcomes. RAMPING UP CLIMATE OUTCOMES THROUGH IDA Since the start of the Covid pandemic, the World Bank Group has moved into high gear, committing over $157 billion to support countries in the pandemic response and recovery. This includes over $50 billion from the International Development Association (IDA), our concessional fund for the world's 74 poorest countries. As we engage with IDA shareholders to agree on new funding for IDA20, covering July 2022 through June 2025, there is an obvious link to be made in advancing the IDA and climate agendas. Investments in clean energy at scale, for instance, can help countries avoid locking in polluting infrastructure while also achieving their energy access goals. IDA has long focused on such high-level outcomes, aligned with client-country development priorities, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the Bank Group's twin goals of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity. With each IDA replenishment cycle, we have also strengthened our ability to track outcomes through the IDA Results Measurement System (RMS), which provides a robust accountability framework to track and report results at an aggregate level. IDA has played a catalytic role in shaping the Bank's climate agenda, with the RMS tracking this progress. The IDA20 RMS presents the most comprehensive set of climate indicators of any IDA cycle to date. RMS indicators are hardwired to track climate actions within IDA operations, and they complement policy commitments by measuring IDA's contribution to climate mitigation, adaptation, and resilience. Let's take the case of Bangladesh, which today receives the largest amount of IDA funding in the world, and is home to 165 million people who are highly vulnerable to the impacts of a changing climate. With support from IDA, Bangladesh is saving lives and building resilience. On the adaptation side, by building and rehabilitating coastal infrastructure, including 220 km of embankments and nearly 400 multi-purpose cyclone shelters, Bangladesh has increased protection from storm surges and flooding for more than 333,000 people. On the mitigation side, IDA helped increase access to clean and renewable energy for 7.3 million people in remote rural areas, provided 1.8 million rural households with energy-efficient improved cookstoves, and built 1,130 solar irrigation pumps benefitting 35,000 farmers. ADVANCING COUNTRY LEVEL ACTION As we continue to deliver on our ambitious climate agenda and help countries recover from the Covid crisis, we are identifying and prioritizing opportunities for high-impact climate action that enables economic growth. This process requires, among other things, strong analytics and policy advice. A ground-breaking core diagnostic tool that we are introducing this year-the Country Climate and Development Reports (CCDRs)-will help inform country programs financed by the Bank Group, by governments themselves, and by other financiers to advance climate action while also making progress on a country's broader development agenda. These CCDRs, prepared with expertise from across the Bank Group and the IMF, will provide analysis unique to each individual country, highlighting where climate and development intersect. They will include sectoral transitions that could unlock economic opportunities and take into account other key issues like social and economic inclusion. We aim to deliver 25 CCDRs by mid-2022. The Bank Group will also actively engage with governments, the private sector, academia, and civil society during this process. Climate change is a global challenge. While global goals are in the spotlight at forums like COP26 , it is local action, customized to the specific climate goals of each country, that will drive success. The two go hand-in-hand and that is where IDA comes in. As the IDA20 replenishment concludes in December, we will continue to provide countries with the support needed to attain their climate ambition as part of a broader story of development outcomes.

Dhaka, Feb. 17 -- Despite deeper challenges of economic slowdown due to persistent global pandemic Bangladesh remains an outlier in the growth landscape. An update based on the data provided by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics placed at a recent meeting of the ECNEC stated that the GDP growth rate improved significantly at the final count of the fiscal year 2020-21 from the initial estimate. This has sparked a sharp debate among the economists and some of them are having difficulty in 'fathoming' the reasons behind such upturn. A few others, of course, are in alignment with such a robust outcome. I consider this as a healthy debate. Let me dig a bit deeper to unbundle the factors that may have been pushing the growth optimism in Bangladesh. My own feeling is that Bangladesh has been cashing in on the consumption related factors, both domestic and external. It was very cautious in imposing hard lockdown and allowed the RMG factories to operate normally despite significant disruptions in supply chains leading to higher shipping costs. It continued to build the inventories of finished products to respond to external demand as soon as the consumption spree returned in the west. And the rural economy was mostly open allowing movement of agricultural and other goods and services to keep the domestic market vibrant. The government also provided comprehensive stimulus packages amounting nearly to six per cent of GDP. Although the larger entrepreneurs including the RMG factory owners took greater advantage of this emergency support of the government and the central bank, the CMSMEs including those from the farm sector also improved their access to this special support in the second round as the regulator showed innovation and flexibility in its approach. The collaboration between the banks and MFIs, SME Foundation, PKSF and various development banks under the guidance of the central bank proved crucial in providing low-cost financing support to the small entrepreneurs. However, the entrepreneurs at the lower end of the social pyramid have always been well known for their resilience and they continued to show their strength of survival even during this unprecedented pandemic. The greater flow of the remittances to the rural areas from urban and foreign sources in addition to enhanced mobile and agent banking related financial services plus the robust social protection programmes by the government have made the growth in consumption related factors more vibrant creating favourable ground for enhanced inclusive GDP growth process. In fact, the total consumption increased by eight per cent during the last fiscal year. Given this comprehensive perspective, I was not so surprised to see the optimistic outcome of the GDP growth rate at the end of the last fiscal year. Whether we like it or not, GDP growth rate remains the most acceptable universal measure of economic prosperity. Of course, the measure has a lot of limitations. This measure certainly falls short of including the aspects of income inequality, waste and environmental pollution, damages done to the ecological infrastructures through over-extraction, the labour by women for domestic chores, the hidden costs of armaments, flight of capital, illegal income etc. It is not surprising to see that many experts are cautious in accepting the GDP growth rate as the single measure of economic well-being of the people. Nobel laureate economists like Joseph Stiglitz and Amartya Sen are, therefore, in favour of complementing other measures like Human Development Indices with the GDP growth rate to make the well-being indicator more inclusive. Fortunately, many new measures like the Social Progress Indicators, SDGs progress reports or Global Hunger Indicators are now available to complement the conventional measure of economic prosperity. Notwithstanding all these limitations, the GDP growth rate stands unique in comparing the global economic prosperity of the nation-states. Bangladesh is no exception. It may be noted here that Bangladesh was initially projected to grow at 5.43 per cent during the last fiscal year. The COVID situation was still precarious when this projection was made. So, there were uncertainties regarding the pace of economic recovery as business confidence remained subdued. However, things started changing as the government kept on implementing the stimulus packages in right earnest. The global demand of its export products also picked up with increase in vaccination including booster doses. Bangladesh also managed vaccination well. The domestic businesses including RMG factories continued to remain opened following necessary health protocols. The supply chains remained seamless, thanks to the transports remaining on their wheels. And there was hardly any disruption in our agricultural production. The digital marketing facilities continued to flourish encouraged by the e-commerce and digital financing services. The hardworking and inspirational farmers, MSMEs and labourers kept the wheels of the economy moving making best use of the robust demographic and physical connectivity. The sub-regional connectivity, particularly with the Indian counterparts enhanced during the pandemic. All these had a positive impact on the final count of GDP growth rate as released recently by the Planning Ministry. Hence, the outcome of GDP growth rate jumped to 6.94 per cent which was 1.5 percentage points higher than the initial estimate. The per capita gross GDP stood at 2,591 USD during the last fiscal year. It may be noted here that Bangladesh has been holding number one position in this per capita growth rate in the emerging Asia beating China, India, and Vietnam over the last decade. This latest jump did not surprise many observers at the actual bursts of activities going on in the fields. Many of us were arguing that Bangladesh would recover better than many of its peers as it has been relying on consumption-led growth process. Nearly sixty-six per cent of the growth of Bangladesh originates from the consumption related factors. As a result, the domestic demand also remained vibrant in Bangladesh. In fact, if we could further support the SMEs, the country could easily experience another couple of percentage points of growth in line with the robust growth seen in the pre-covid fiscal year. Normally, our international development partners remain more cautious about the GDP growth estimates. They must have been perturbed by the final estimate of the growth rate for the fiscal year 2020-21. IMF, WB and ADB were also conservative about our initial estimate which projected Bangladesh's GDP growth rate at 5.43 per cent. Most of them were highly sceptical about this projection. But as time passed, they too changed their minds and revised their estimates. I am hopeful that they will again revise their estimates of the outcome, and these will not be far from the BBS figures. No doubt, the development partners also use scientific methodologies in making their growth estimates. However, they must rely on BBS data as there is no scope for them to collect information from the fields at this scale for obvious reasons. So, they make a lot of assumptions and readjustments of the empirical information received from the BBS. Primarily, they depend on trade flows while making such projections. Unfortunately, our trade data are not always well recorded and there can be a lot of discrepancies. Given these limitations, I am sure the development partners are forced to make many subjective assumptions to come to concrete projections. At the end of the day, most of them come very near to BBS figures and accept their projections. That Bangladesh's growth story has indeed been exemplary can also be supported by several proxy variables. The variables like more than twenty-six billion Taka transaction of mobile financial services mostly going to the rural areas in addition to the enhanced rural banking services including agent banking services fueled by ever increasing inflow of domestic and foreign remittances, near hundred per cent access to electricity, the thriving growth centres beaming with economic activities till midnight speak volumes about the pace of inclusive growth in Bangladesh. Moreover, digital entrepreneurs are flourishing all over the country including the rural areas that have been flooded with MFS agents, bank branches and sub-branches, union and postal digital centers, retail chain-shops supported by corporates like Liver Brothers, PRAN RFL and ACI etc. These entrepreneurs have been pushing the frontiers of domestic consumption and demand in Bangladesh. Unfortunately, BBS with its limited institutional outreach and lack of technological capability cannot capture fully all these economic activities. If done, the Bangladesh growth rate would probably go up by another couple of percentage points or so. While BBS will certainly come up with more elaboration of the factors that led to such a GDP growth rate, my own hunch is, as I have already alluded to, the consumption factors leading to robust domestic demand have been at the root of this growth process. And, as argued, agriculture, remittances and export-led manufacturing employing millions of rural women have been pushing this pace of domestic demand. There is, no doubt, some danger of uptick in core inflation due to abundance of money supply in the economy. But we still have a lot of scope to keep this within bounds as the economy is yet to be fully heated. I am sure the monetary policy authority is keeping an eye on this challenge. It must also be remembered that this flow of additional money was necessary to keep the economy moving during the pandemic. What is more interesting is that although income inequality increased even during the pandemic period, consumption inequality remained stable indicating an inclusive growth process in motion. In addition to consumption, investment, government expenditures, there is also an element of resource balance between export and import in the growth equation. Certainly, the import expenditures outstripped export earnings leading to the perception of negative impact on growth rate. However, it must also be noted that nearly forty per cent of the import expenditures were for capital and intermediate goods in addition to raw materials for export industries. This component of imports went directly towards growth enhancement. According to BBS, the large industrial units grew at 10.61 per cent during the last fiscal year. The MSMEs grew at 13.89 percentage point. This could grow more if the stimulus package directed to this sector could be further accelerated. Yet, the total GDP at the end of the last fiscal year went up to 416 billion USD compared to initial estimate of 411 billion USD. The trade balance however remains under pressure leading to persistent challenge of Balance of Payment. Consequently, Bangladesh Bank had to inject more than three billion USD into the foreign exchange market to stabilise the exchange rate. We must, therefore, continue to restrain luxury imports and add more support to cash incentives for the remitters to improve the trade balance. The agriculture sector deserves special mention in the growth story. It increased to 3.17 per cent during the last fiscal year compared to 2.37 per cent for the earlier fiscal year. This helped bolster the food consumption, rural employment, and domestic demand despite some reverse flow of urban and foreign migrants to rural areas. So, the modernised and diversified agriculture should continue to get the fiscal support to keep up the growth momentum. I think this mechanical debate on growth figures is immaterial unless we focus more on the real economy including food security, employment, price-hikes, and poverty reduction. Surprisingly, Bangladesh has been doing quite well on all these counts despite some challenges put up by the pandemic. No doubt, Bangladesh will have to go a long way towards sustainable development including improvement in income inequality and better service delivery. The fossil fuel-based energy management with huge implication for fiscal policy management and inflation ought to be reframed for the greater cause of the many and not a few. It must also be noted here that Bangladesh is aware of the need for energy independence and the strategic move that is desirable towards more renewable energy. Yet, the power sector remains vulnerable in the context of financial management, and we will have to think more strategically how to increase renewables and create more storage options. Our Premier indicated her strategic way forward in this direction of green transition at COP26 in Glasgow while launching the 'Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan.' Her receiving of the SDGs Progress Award from the UN last year also indicates Bangladesh's commitment towards sustainable development. Bangladesh's achievement as number one in Asia in the field of women empowerment also augers well. As such, we must not be over complacent on the higher GDP growth rate alone but also be focused on complementary indicators like HDI and SDGs implementation. So far, Bangladesh has been doing well on all these counts despite some limitations in the areas of transparency and just governance.

Dec. 20 Seoul(Korea Herald/ANN)- Income and wealth inequality is unjust, and yet the world continues to tolerate rising injustices, the most recent being inequalities in vaccine distribution. French political economist Thomas Piketty and his colleagues at the World Inequality Lab have just published the World Inequality Report 2022, a real goldmine in data and insights on global inequalities. I found at least three nuggets inside that are blindingly obvious. First, inequality is primarily a political issue. We can all do something about it, but since politics has been captured by money, the few remain more equal than the many. Between 1995 and 2021, the top 1 percent wealthiest people in the world captured 38 percent of the growth in global wealth, whereas the bottom 50 percent had a pitiful 2 percent share. Similarly, the richest 10 percent of world population take home 52 percent of global income, whereas the bottom 50 percent earned only 8.5 percent. The report showed why these inequities could not be reduced despite increases in average income and wealth per capita. The progressive tax rates where the rich paid more than the poor, introduced in the first half of the 20th century to deal with inequality, were dismantled in the 1980s. The neoliberal free market philosophy preached low taxes and small governments to encourage entrepreneurship, but effectively handed more income and wealth to the elite few. Piketty's second historical insight is that Europe and later America got rich on the back of both the Industrial Revolution and colonization. In 1820, between country (inter-country) inequality was only 11 percent of global inequality meaning that most inequality was domestic (intra-country). But inter-country inequality rose when the West advanced with industrialization and resource extraction from the colonies. That peaked in 1980 when it represented 57 percent of global inequality. Since then, the rise in income of China, India and other newly independent countries narrowed the gap with the West, but by 2020, domestic inequality again accounted for 68 percent of global inequality. This meant that the developing countries allowed their own inequalities to worsen, even as they were narrowing the gap with the West. In short, the rich are the same everywhere. They have more and want more. But there is a twist to this story. One reason why the Rest has caught up with the West is that "nations became richer, but governments have become poor." In essence, because the Europe, North America and Japan governments used debt to tackle slow growth since the 1980s, private wealth grew at the expense of public wealth. Privatization policies transferred public wealth such as utilities to the private sector, whereas public sector debt continued to increase. The third insight is that inequalities and climate change are highly co-related. Between 1850-2020, half (49 percent) of historical carbon emission was accounted by North America (27 percent) and Europe (22 percent), China accounted for 11 percent, but has become the largest emitter, although per capita emission remains lower. A recent IMF study pointed out that "the richest countries represent only 16 percent of the world population but almost 40 percent of CO2 emissions. The two categories of the poorest countries in the World Bank classification account for nearly 60 percent of the world's population, but for less than 15 percent of emissions." The COP26 debate was all about whether China, India and other emerging markets that are increasing their carbon emissions should do more on Net Zero pledges. The entanglement between CO2 emission and income and wealth levels suggest that climate warming policies should focus more on making those responsible for carbon emissions pay more for remedial climate action. The bottom 50 percent of population in Europe emits around 5 tons of carbon per person per year, with their counterpart class emitting 3 tons in East Asia and 10 tons in North America. But the top 10 percent in these regions account for 29 tons in Europe, 39 tons in Asia and 73 tons in North America. Indeed, the top 1 percent in the US account for 269 tons of carbon per person per year, compared with 139 tons for the top 1 percent in China. The rich everywhere are the biggest carbon emitters. All these suggest that tackling climate change and social injustice are part of a total political package, cutting across nations. It's one thing to promise to cut carbon to Net Zero, it's another to design the projects and programs to deliver on their promises. Back home, each government will face huge resistance from vested interests that want to delay or just green-wash any action. In other words, talk more and do less. The Report has made some excellent suggestions to tackle inequality, such as progressive tax measures and a global asset register, that are bound to be controversial. But to be effective, they need global cooperation. No single country can impose higher tax rates or tougher action without being undercut by another country. The next Global Summit should be about how to tackle inequalities. Given such complex issues and facts raised by the Piketty and his colleagues, the least we can do is to have a democratic, transparent and constructive dialogue on how those who can afford and emit more carbon should pay more taxes to foster a more sustainable and inclusive world. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 25 -- Greenhouse gas levels hit record, UN agency says Greenhouse gas concentrations hit a record last year and the world is "way off track" on climate goals, the UN weather agency said on Monday, showing the scale of the task facing governments scrambling to avert dangerous levels of warming. A report by the World Meteorological Organization showed that carbon dioxide levels surged to 413.2 parts per million in 2020, rising more than the average rate over the last decade despite a temporary dip in emissions during COVID-19 lockdowns, reports Reuters. Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said that the current rate of increase in heat-trapping gases would result in temperature rises "far in excess" of the 2015 Paris Agreement target of 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average this century. "We are way off track," he said. "We need to revisit our industrial, energy and transport systems and whole way of life," he added, calling for a "dramatic increase" in commitments at the COP26 conference beginning on Sunday. The Scottish city of Glasgow was putting on the final touches before hosting the climate talks, which may be the world's last best chance to cap global warming at the 1.5-2 degrees Celsius upper limit set out in Paris Agreement. The stakes for the planet are huge - among them the impact on economic livelihoods the world over and the future stability of the global financial system. Saudi Arabia's crown prince said on Saturday that the world's top oil exporter aims to reach "net zero" emissions of greenhouse gases, mostly produced by burning fossil fuels, by 2060 - 10 years later than the United States. He also said it would double the emissions cuts it plans to achieve by 2030. Australia's cabinet was expected to formally adopt a target for net-zero emissions by 2050 when it meets on Monday to review a deal reached between parties in Prime Minister Scott Morrison's coalition government, official sources told Reuters. The ruling coalition has been divided over how to tackle climate change, with the government maintaining that harder targets would damage the A$2-trillion ($1.5-trillion) economy. In Berlin, officials from Germany and Canada were set to present a plan about how rich countries can help poorer nations finance the overhaul needed to address climate change. Wealthy countries have so far failed to deliver their 2009 pledge to provide $100 billion per year in climate finance to poorer countries by 2020. A Reuters poll of economists found that hitting the Paris Agreement goal of net-zero carbon emissions will require investments in a green transition worth 2 per cent-3 per cent of world output each year until 2050, far less than the economic cost of inaction. In London, climate activists restarted their campaign of blockading major roads by disrupting traffic in the city's financial district.

The Embassy of Denmark in Bangladesh hosted a 5-day exhibition at Bay's Edge Gallery, in the backdrop of COP26 taking place in Glasgow, to highlight commercially viable green solutions that can support sustainable and inclusive economic growth in Bangladesh. Denmark's ambitious goals to reduce carbon footprint and achieve sustainable growth is globally relevant, especially fast growing economy like Bangladesh, says its Embassy in Dhaka on Thursday. Danish Ambassador to Bangladesh Winnie Estrup Petersen emphasised that ''the 'Green Together' exhibition embodies and shares with a Bangladeshi audience Denmark's understanding of sustainability, which is a holistic approach to the environment and lifestyle, and also includes social goals like responsible business, good governance, equality, and inclusion''. As a frontrunner in green economic growth and a leader in clean technologies, Denmark is well positioned to serve as a knowledge partner for Bangladesh on its journey towards a greener and more sustainable society. 'Sustainable Green Buildings and Future of Urbanization' was the focus at the exhibition's panel on the opening night. The panel members highlighted possibilities for sustainable residential, commercial, and industrial spaces in Bangladesh building on the progress achieved thus far. Attendees from government bodies, top real estate developers and architects, and Danish companies engaged in discussions on how simple technologies, such as energy efficient water pumps and ventilation systems, can be integrated into buildings for more sustainable urbanization. On the second day of the exhibition, the panellists unpacked the 'Future of Sustainable Apparel Production'. With the apparel sector as the biggest contributor to the Bangladeshi economy and Bangladesh most impacted by climate change, the key question was how can the apparel sector remain competitive while responding to demands of the climate crisis. Participants ranging from industrial process experts and international brands from Denmark to leading Bangladeshi RMG manufacturers shared recommendations on how Bangladesh can better position itself as a sustainable manufacturing hub and a producer for high value goods. Ultimately, the Embassy said, becoming greener will make the Bangladeshi apparels sector even more competitive in the international arena. Panellists spoke on the 'Sustainable Future of Food'. Bangladeshi food safety regulators, industrial leaders from the agro-food processing sector, and innovative start-ups together with Danish sector representatives conferred on how to increase access to healthier foods, reduce food loss, and increase food quality for export. Denmark's expertise on sustainability in food production can help improve productivity and build an efficient food and agro sector. The Embassy hosted a discussion on day four of the exhibition to highlight the importance of 'Transition to Sustainable Infrastucture'. Sustainable and green infrastructure development, from digital and physical connectivity to energy and services, is key for a climate vulnerable country like Bangladesh to improve productivity, economic growth, and quality of life. Danish examples of inclusive and sustainable infrastructure were shared with exhibition attendees, who represented local investment agencies, banks and financial institutions, Danish and Bangladeshi infrastructure developers, and the chief guest ICT Minister Zunaid Ahmed Palak. The panellists and guests deliberated on the need for more investment in this sector to help facilitate Bangladesh's green transition. Public and private sector initiatives are key to delivering an efficient response to the climate crisis, they said. Denmark hosts this exhibition to raise awareness and share experiences for new ways forward. In collaborating with Bangladeshi partners, Denmark believes it can accelerate climate action to help us all pass on a prosperous and sustainable world to the coming generations. For the past four decades, Denmark has managed to grow its economy all the while lowering CO2 emissions and resource consumption - proving that it is possible to have a green economy that also creates more jobs, said the Embassy. \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 11 -- Oil prices increased more than $2 on Monday, extending gains as an energy crisis grips major economies amid a pick-up in economic activity and restrained supplies from major producers. Brent crude was up $2.17, or 2.6 per cent, at $84.56 a barrel by 1136 GMT, its highest since October 2018. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose $2.67, or 3.4 per cent, to $82.02 for its highest since late 2014. "Oil prices are likely to continue climbing in the short term," said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch. Prices have risen as more vaccinated populations are brought out of coronavirus lockdowns, supporting a revival in economic activity, with Brent advancing for five weeks and U.S. crude for seven. The pace of economic recovery, combined with cold weather, has increased the demand for energy. On the other hand, pressure on governments to accelerate the transition to cleaner energy has slowed investment in oil projects to boost supplies. World leaders are due to meet in November at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow to flesh out commitments on energy transition. Prices for coal, gas and electricity have also surged to record highs in recent weeks, driven higher by widespread energy shortages in Asia, Europe and the United States. In India, some states are experiencing electricity blackouts because of coal shortages. China's government, meanwhile, has ordered miners to ramp up coal production as power prices surge. "The news from last week that the (US) Department of Energy is not planning to tap into strategic reserves, for now, is keeping the oil market tight and is supporting prices," said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo. US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm last week said the administration was considering tapping the country's emergency oil reserves to cool gasoline prices, though the Energy Department later said it had "no plans to take action at this time". Drillers in the United States added five new oil wells last week for the fifth straight weekly increase in oil and gas rigs. The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies, together known as OPEC+, last week decided to maintain a steady and gradual increase in output. "Depleting stocks, OPEC discipline and the ongoing energy crunch will provide solid price support in the next three months," said Tamas Varga, oil analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.

Bangladesh and the United Kingdom will hold the fourth Strategic Dialogue in London on Thursday to review all aspects of the relations between the two countries with a focus on post-Brexit and post-Covid new strategic partnership. The two sides will discuss the entire gamut of bilateral relations covering political relations, economic and development partnership, security and defence cooperation, and exchanges on current global issues including Afghanistan and Rohingya crisis. Foreign Secretary Masud Bin Momen will lead the Bangladesh delegation while Sir Philip Robert Barton KCMG OBE, Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) will lead the UK side at the dialogue, said an official. The Bangladesh-UK Strategic Dialogue was launched in Dhaka in 2017 while the second Strategic Dialogue took place at the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office in March 2018 and the third one was held in Dhaka on April 24, 2019. The issues related to joint celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations, trade and investment, climate change ( COP26 ), education and skills, good governance, human rights and migration issues will also be discussed. Bangladesh is likely to reiterate its call to review the travel restrictions on Bangladesh and remove it from the red-list. Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen already raised the issue during a recent virtual meeting with his British counterpart Dominic Raab. 'Given Bangladesh's robust vaccine roll-out and significant reductions in Covid infection to 9.82% and sufferings of more than 7000 British-Bangladeshis currently stranded in Bangladesh, the UK should consider removing Bangladesh from the Covid red-list countries," Dr Momen said. However, such decisions are reviewed by the Public Health Experts on a regular basis, according to the UK government. "I would like to assure that given the long standing friendship between our two countries, and based on more frequent genomic sequencing data-uploading by Bangladesh, the British Government will review Bangladesh red list," Raab was quoted as saying. \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 11 -- Featuring a raft of pledges, mostly non-binding, nations which met at the COP26 to reach consensus on solving a number of critical climate impasses are set to conclude their sessions today. Like at the maiden Conference of Parties (COP) at Stockholm in 1972, the 2021 conference virtually wound up hoping to hold further discussions on climate change, especially global warming. The 2016 Paris Accords ended in a mixed mood, dominated by foot dragging on the part of a few industrial powers. In a few weeks, climatologists could read the smokescreen poised to make a swoop on the optimism exuded at the grand Paris assemblage. It became clear that a handful of non-committal nations at the Paris Accords meet were not prepared to deliver on their promises on emission cut. Much before the preparations made for the just-concluded COP, it had been clear the lofty target of capping the carbon emission ceiling at 1.5 degrees Celsius would remain a pipedream. Along with the optimists, the seemingly incorrigible doomsayers also have showed a dominant presence at the climate summits and widely attended general discussions. The latter included both die-hard environmental activists and liberally disposed scientists. Though their number has been on the decline, people like the much-revered British conservationist Sir David Attenborough, the climate crusaders like the ex-American Vice President and climate activist Al Gore et al are still being looked forward to. Sir Attenborough in today's world is a highly senior conservationist armed with experience and wisdom. He is at present the longest-living person in environmental activism and one highly worried about Earth's future. Sir Attenborough may not be fully physically able to remain present at the coming climate events. But Al Gore is vibrant with youthfulness, undertaking travels across the globe tirelessly. He has taken it as a mission to inform the heads of state and corporate leaders about the heavy price which mankind may have to pay if they do not deliver on their promises on carbon emission cut. After the recent global warming and carbon emission meets, these persons are approached for their comments --- especially on the extent to which the ill-prepared countries are vulnerable to climate impacts. To the utter shock and surprise of the climate-conscious people and their local leaders, the world at present has just a handful of climate activists well versed in the pros and cons of the approaching climate disasters. At the same time, perhaps at nature's dictate, dozens of uncompromising youths from different countries have created fronts to battle global warming and climate change. Led by Greta Thunberg, the 18-year-old Swedish activist, youths have shouldered the giant task --- which is no less than saving the whole world from climate change fallout. Thunberg had and an impressive and effective start. In no time, it assumed the shape of a world-stirring movement. In her emergence, seasoned environmental leaders discovered the shaping of an 'hyperactive youth' prepared to wage a war on the quarters responsible for precipitating environmental disasters, finally helping the scourge of climate change to surface alarmingly. Given the moral support Thunberg has been receiving for the last few years world-wide, she is slated to emerge as the leader of an Earth-saving group intent on making nations aware of the excesses of fossil fuel emissions. The older climate activists have long begun feeling the need for the emergence of younger leaders. They are expected to fill the gap created by the retiring seniors. As anticipated rationally, camaraderie among different activists in different nations has never seemed elusive. The emergence of Thunberg is phenomenal, and globally stirring. Thanks to her assertiveness in stopping the nearly catastrophic climate change, the Swedish post-teenage girl has been able to arouse riveting attention. Thunberg has foreseen groups of climate activists flooding the city streets around the world to get their message across. It's simple and crisp: Stand united and save the planet. Thunberg entered the scenario after completing her necessary groundwork like in-depth study and watching the TV footage of climate change-affected countries. Simultaneously, she has been attending the environmental events in the far-flung regions of the world. The most vital contribution the Swedish girl made to the global spread of her movement was her Friday March with school and college students. In full #FridaysForFuture campaign, the march of students every Friday soon engulfed the large European and North American cities. They didn't have seasoned orators or advocacy leaders. But what they were equipped adequately with was their unflinching commitment to save the planet's vulnerable peoples by ensuring a world free of climate change hazards. On her emerging more and more vocal on the climate and related issues, which replicated a worldwide network of climate protection campaigns participated by youths, Thunberg was viewed as a suitable candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. To be specific, Thunberg received first of the three Nobel Peace Prize nominations for climate activism in 2018. Early that year, more than 20,000 students, from UK to Japan, had joined her by skipping school to protest. That was the start of the students' Friday March every week. Greta Thunberg was spectacularly present at the COP26 . How could she avoid being present at the event, which centred round an issue to which she had dedicated all the fun and frolic of youth. It was natural that her appearance at the climate conference venue would raise some eyebrows. But she was not alone. With her presence, Thunberg had brought along with her the indomitable spirit of the young climate leaders and activists from all the countries vulnerable to climate change and global warming. Many of these countries have already started experiencing the early signs of sea-level rise. As could have been assumed, Thunberg didn't find her alone in the global climate-change campaign. It didn't take long for her to discover a trusted companion, a Ugandan young climate warrior, beside her. She was Vanessa Nakate, a 22-year-old graduate from the Makerere Enterprise College. The Ugandan young lady, a resident of Kampala, started quite humbly with her two teenage brothers and three cousins. She called a similar weekly march of young students on Saturdays. Nakate saw the membership of her campaign swell with the joining of similar climate activists. Together, they came up with a symbolic demonstration of their strength and resolve at Davos in 2020. The world has undergone remarkable changes during the last half century since the first-ever COP in 1972. In the bipolar world of the time, the Cold War rivalry still simmering, arresting the climate change was easier than today. What worry climatologists now is the seas' changing nature. In a multi-polar world, every powerful nation has its own view of the ongoing climate change. At the initial stage, the culprit was greenhouse gas emission. At the first two COP meets in the 1970s, the participants made a strong commitment to arrest the harmful emission. With the Cold War then strongly in place, the US and its allies out to overwhelm Soviet Russia with their industrial might, the world largely failed to see any let-up to carbon emissions. It had to wait for the start of the 1990s, when the time was viewed as being ripe to resume climate talks keeping the world environmental situation in view. Eventually the global warming and climate change found their due places on the agenda of issues. Once brought to the notice of committed leaders and activists, the climate change issue couldn't be kept confined to the venues abuzz with representatives from all corners of the world. The results came in the from the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992, and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol meet in Japan. Despite the inclusion of several climate-change prohibitions, these summits could yield little concrete outcome, thanks to the USA's refusal to sign the vital Kyoto Protocol on cutting greenhouse gas emission. It cited damages set to be caused to its huge economy upon giving approval to the £nti-US' Protocol. These narrow biases and squabbles could long have been dealt with effectively. The reason that it didn't happen was the old powers digging in their heels in every matter of climate changes. What the world badly needs now is the infusion of fresh blood, i.e. thoughtful youth spirit, into all remedial measures to be put into effect. It should be done without delay. The seas have already started swelling. HYPERLINK mailto:shihabskr@ymail.com shihabskr@ymail.com Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Climate-related hazards are intensifying in the Asia-Pacific, disproportionately affecting vulnerable rural communities, says a new global report. Policymakers must prioritise climate resilience and adaptation measures to protect rural communities from losing economic advancements, according to a new report released Monday by the UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The Building Climate Resilience in the Asia Pacific Region report reviews the key results and lessons learned from the IFAD-supported Adaptation for Smallholder Agricultural Programme (ASAP) which ran from 2012 to 2017 and invested $305 million in targeted rural development projects that needed support in adapting and mitigating the effects of climate change on rural communities. The ASAP programme made significant progress in the region, supporting more than 510,000 small-scale farming households to adapt to climate change in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Laos, Nepal and Vietnam. The report highlights the diverse, effective, and innovative approaches that IFAD has developed in cooperation with rural communities to adapt to and mitigate the detrimental effects of climate change on rural people's lives and livelihoods. It analyses approaches and actions that were successful and can be "scaled up" in the region, providing a solid foundation for the new phase of the programme called the Enhanced Adaptation for Smallholder Agricultural Programme (ASAP+), potentially channelling an additional $500 million in climate finance to support the climate resilience of 10 million vulnerable people, particularly women and youth. "Small-scale producers often know what they need to be more resilient to the effects of climate change, we can support them by helping them to access the appropriate finance and technology," said Kisa Mfalila, IFAD's regional climate and environment specialist for Asia-Pacific. "The report confirms that farmers have developed many successful adaptation techniques over time. We need to act fast to draw upon local knowledge," she added. There will also be a live event at the IFAD Pavilion at COP26 Wednesday that includes a virtual field trip to Bangladesh to discover what steps small-scale farmers are taking to adapt to climate change. Accompanied by documentary filmmaker Qasa Alom, the audience will virtually travel to the country to meet and interact with farmers who are participants of IFAD-supported projects, to discuss their climate challenges and how they and their rural communities are adapting. The report suggests acting fast, using technology to speed assessment of climate change risks and impacts, and drawing upon the experience, knowledge, and creativity of local people. Smallholder farmers have developed many successful adaptation techniques - these must be identified, refined, rolled out and financed adequately and quickly, it says. Also, the IFAD report calls for using public-private partnerships to add value to and speed up the uptake of solutions created by local people. Public sector initiatives should be combined with efforts from private sector players, providing inputs and machinery, advisory services, technology solutions and market access to be able to market more profitable products, it says. Successful adaptations will be spontaneously adopted in rural communities as long as constraints are removed and finance is available. Smallholder farmers quickly adopt production enhancing innovations if supportive policy frameworks are in place and if public institutions and the private sector provide adequate finance and advisory services. Information and communication technology platforms introduced to support climate-resilient initiatives also protect against other adverse events, including pandemic disruption: technology platforms can help bring together suppliers, producers, buyers, and other stakeholders to facilitate their exchanges and to make farmers and food chains less exposed to external shocks like the Covid-19 pandemic, the IFAD report says. Technology platforms help attract young people to enter the food and farming sector, enhancing the rural economy, it adds. \</doc>

With the newer kind of appreciation of Bangladesh's value in Australia, Dhaka is now making its all-out efforts to become 'economically more pertinent' to Canberra by jointly exploring the vast areas of cooperation keeping the geopolitical imperatives in mind. 'I think there has been a newer kind of appreciation of Bangladesh's value. And particularly in the last three-four years, we actually started shaking the tree by projecting that Bangladesh is no longer a Bangladesh of 2005 or 2010. It's changing very fast. And we see this is getting reflected at various levels,' Bangladesh High Commissioner to Australia Mohammad Sufiur Rahman told UNB in an interview marking the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries that falls on January 31. All these past years, he said, Australia has been supportive and there is no doubt about it. But there was a perception in Australia that Bangladesh is a disaster-prone and aid-dependent country. 'So, we've tried our level best to change it by projecting Bangladesh as a self-assured and self-dependent country which is emerging as a middle economic power in this Indian Ocean region,' said the High Commissioner, adding that it has been their focus in the recent period to change that negative narrative. Highlighting the huge perception change from the Australian side, he said persistent efforts of the Bangladesh Mission over the last three-four years to create a new narrative of Bangladesh in Australia have started paying dividends. Signing of Trade and Investment Framework Arrangement (TIFA), repeated telephone calls from Australian Foreign Minister to Bangladesh Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen and request from Australian Prime Minister for meeting Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina during COP26 in Glasgow indicate a significant change in the approach from the Australian side that has all these years seen Bangladesh as a vulnerable country and a recipient of her development assistance, said the diplomat having a three-decade long career. Founded on bipartisan support, the leadership of Australia quickly recognised Bangladesh on January 31 in 1972, the first among the developed nations that influenced recognition from other countries. The then Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam visited Dhaka in January 1975 and met Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman giving Bangladesh-Australia relations a strong beginning. 'But when we lost our Father of the Nation, I think Bangladesh also lost its path. The momentum in bilateral relations that was created during the visit of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in 1975, the only Australian Prime Minister who visited Bangladesh in the last five decades, couldn't be sustained,' said the Bangladesh envoy, recalling the role of these two giant political personalities. In the subsequent period, High Commissioner Sufiur said, they saw Australian support coming in the reconstruction of Bangladesh and in the field of socio-economic development which he thinks was far below the potential. And in the last 10 years or so, he said, Australia's interest in Bangladesh increased because of Bangladesh's capacity to export in a significant quantum to the Australian market and to absorb Australian exports apart from Bangladesh diaspora's important role in Australian nation building efforts. Geopolitics and Post-Covid Era The High Commissioner said the post-Covid era is going to be an 'uncertain time' for everybody in the regional context and also in the global context with the emergence of intense strategic competition. 'And that will also have an impact on how we produce, how we consume and how we trade. These all are going to happen at the same time. So, we would expect to see greater focus on sustainable consumption,' he said, adding that the production processes will change, sourcing from various countries will also change. And at the same time, the climate change related global consensus, which will also have an impact on how the countries produce, people consume and trade, said the envoy. Apart from all these factors, the High Commissioner said, there are newer tensions in the Indo Pacific and between some countries in the region. 'So, this geopolitical tension is also going to have an impact on how Bangladesh and Australia will try to adjust engagement with each other,' he said, noting that Bangladesh is focused on the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean and would like to see peace and stability in this region to keep Bangladesh's development journey uninterrupted. And it is in that context, he said, that when they engage with Australia now and more in the post-Covid era, they will try to make Bangladesh more economically important to Australia, a major player in the Indian Ocean region. 'Now we're the 29th trade partner of Australia and from there we'd like to be in the first 20 in the next decade.' The two-way trade that the two countries are having now is in the domain of US$ 2 billion and Bangladesh expects that to go to US$ 5-10 billion with the inclusion of newer items and bigger items in the export and import baskets, said the Bangladesh envoy. And similarly for imperatives in the strategic and geopolitical domain, he said, the greater understanding between Bangladesh and Australia will lead to more movement of students, skilled manpower, knowledge transfer, he said sharing his assessment. In the post-Covid era and in the next decade, when the geopolitical tensions will create a new kind of compulsion for countries to look for newer partners, Bangladesh should be able to get into new diversified areas of export and import, Sufiur Rahman said. Intense Cooperation through TIFA The High Commissioner said Bangladesh and Australia are having good growth in terms of trade but depending only on the duty- quota-free treatment of Australia, Bangladesh may not be able to reach where it intends to. 'That's why we felt we should create a legal framework. That was the initial thought but in the process of discussion, it was clear that neither the Bangladesh nor Australian side were ready for an elaborate FTA like legally-binding arrangement,' he said. The envoy said the two countries created a framework and it is not an FTA but it has got important elements built into it. Most importantly, he said, TIFA has created a very positive optics in Australia and also in Bangladesh that the two countries are considering each other as 'important, reliable, trustworthy' trade and economic partners. 'So, that's a huge positive development. If you don't create a positive perception and optics, it doesn't move that easily. We've been able to create a positive optics through this instrument and look forward to the Joint Working Group mechanism under it,' he added. As far as its operationalization is concerned, he said, they would like to see that Bangladesh has value as a production hub for Australian import and a destination of Australian export Australia has more than US$ 1.3 trillion worth of investment abroad and if Bangladesh can secure even a tiny percentage of it, it will be a huge investment for Bangladesh, said the High Commissioner. With all this, he said, they thought of creating this framework and hoped that this positive image and also the discussion between the two parties - both at the government and the private sector levels- will create the path for 'much intense' trade and investment cooperation between the two countries. Recent DFAT Report and Bangladesh The High Commissioner said Bangladesh, in the past, was seen in a slightly negative way though there is no tension between Australia and Bangladesh. He said they have been pushing quite aggressively in recent years as Australia is yet to fully recognise the value that Bangladesh has created thus far. The annual report of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) that actually summarises Australian focus on a particular country, Bangladesh was not mentioned on its own value in 2017-18 and 2018-19. 'But after these three to four years of hard work, now Australia has evaluated Bangladesh slightly differently. I can say that Australia recognised Bangladesh's continued economic progress and good potential for economic relations to grow in its recent DFAT report,' he said. Quoting the DFAT report 2020-2021, the High Commissioner said, 'In addition to our close cooperation with India, we continued to strengthen our relationships with key partner countries in the North East Indian Ocean region.' In addition to India, Australia needs Bangladesh for peace, stability and security of the regions and it is a very high appreciation on part of Australia on Bangladesh's emergence and future value, he said. Responding to a question on a recent policy paper by National Security College (NSC) on Bangladesh, the envoy said it was mentioned that Australia needs to broaden its engagement in South Asia to complement her current focus on India, meaning beyond the QUAD into this whole game. Secondly, Bangladesh is a huge, growing and thriving economy and the potential of Bangladesh in becoming the next Asian tiger has been appreciated in this, he added. It has also said that because of this value, Australia appears keen to develop a defence and security relationship with Bangladesh as part of broader political and economic engagement. In this overall game, when they talk about peace and stability in the Indian Ocean region, one thing Bangladesh can immediately gain is Australian support in combating the problems that Bangladesh faces in the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea-human trafficking, drug trafficking, even gunrunning. Defence Cooperation Responding to a question, the High Commissioner said Bangladesh, at present, would like to see defence collaboration remain in the domain of 'non-procurement and non-interoperability', meaning Bangladesh is not going to have military kind of exercise and certainly non-deployment of forces. 'So, that's not a part of our agenda now, but our agenda is to have greater appreciation of each other's capacity, then better networking among defence related operators and training,' he said. The High Commissioner said when two countries discuss greater trust and security understanding, at some point of time; defence collaboration will come as an important element of it. Defence collaboration, however, is a 'slow-moving' commodity in comparison to trade and investment. Explaining further, the High Commissioner said, 'If you've a greater understanding of the vessels operating in your maritime zone, you understand whether you are secure or not secure.' So, he added, if that awareness of the maritime domain could be created with the help of Australia, Bangladesh will be able to know whether a particular vessel is engaged in illegal activities, whether a fishing vessel has come with hazardous waste and is trying to dump that in the Bay of Bengal or it has all kinds of negative intentions. 'So, for this kind of collaboration, we can have immediate linkages with Australia that are in our interest. The other thing that is in our interest in the collaboration during natural calamities and disasters, Australia is an important player in this and we can benefit from it in the future.' \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 31 -- Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies sit down for a second day of talks on Sunday faced with the difficult task of bridging their differences on how to combat global warming ahead of a crucial United Nations summit on climate change, reports Reuter. The first day of the Rome summit - the leaders' first face-to-face gathering since the start of the COVID pandemic - focused mainly on health and the economy, while climate and the environment is front and centre of Sunday's agenda. Climate scientists and activists are likely to be disappointed unless late breakthroughs are made, with drafts of the G20's final communique showing little progress in terms of new commitments to curb pollution. COP26 " climate summit attended by almost 200 countries, in Glasgow, Scotland, where most of the G20 leaders will fly directly from Rome. "The latest reports are disappointing, with little sense of urgency in the face of an existential emergency," said Oscar Soria of the activist network Avaaz. "There is no more time for vague wish-lists, we need concrete commitments and action." A fifth draft of the G20's final statement seen by Reuters on Saturday did not toughen the language on climate action compared with previous versions, and in some key areas, such as the need to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, it softened it. This mid-century target date is a goal that United Nations experts say is needed to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius, seen as the limit to avoid a dramatic acceleration of extreme events such as droughts, storms and floods. UN experts say even if current national plans to curb emissions are fully implemented, the world is headed for global warming of 2.7C. The planet's largest carbon emitter China, is aiming for net zero in 2060, while other major polluters such as India and Russia have also not committed to the mid-century deadline. G20 energy and environment ministers who met in Naples in July failed to reach agreement on setting a date to phase out fossil fuel subsidies and end coal power, asking the leaders to find a resolution at this weekend's summit. Based on the latest draft, they have made little progress, pledging to "do our utmost" to stop building new coal power plants before the end of the 2030s and saying they will phase out fossil fuel subsidies "over the medium term." On the other hand, they do pledge to halt financing of overseas coal-fired power generation by the end of this year. Some developing countries are reluctant to commit to steep emission cuts until rich nations make good on a pledge made 12 years ago to provide $100 billion per year from 2020 to help them tackle the effects of global warming. That promise has still not been kept, contributing to the "mistrust" which UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on Friday was blighting progress in climate negotiations. The draft stresses the importance of meeting the goal and doing so in a transparent way. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina left London on Tuesday morning for Paris to attend the 75th Anniversary of UNESCO and distribute the first-ever UNESCO-Bangladesh Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman International Prize for Creative Economy. During the Paris tour, Sheikh Hasina will also have meetings with French President Emmanuel Macron and French Prime Minister Jean Castex. "A VVIP flight of Biman Bangladesh Airlines carrying the Prime Minister and her entourage left Heathrow International Airport at 9:24am (local time),' PM's Press Secretary Ihsanul Karim said. Bangladesh Ambassador to the United Kingdom Saida Tasneem Muna saw her off at the airport. Earlier Sheikh Hasina, also the President of Bangladesh Awami League, talked to her party leaders and activists from the expatriate community, who came to her place of residence --Claridge's Hotel-- in London to see off her, said Ihsanul Karim. The PM told them that she could not meet all physically due to the Covid-19 pandemic situation and she would do that when the situation becomes normal. The aircraft will land at De Gaulle International Airport at 11:15am local time, where Bangladesh Ambassador Khandaker Mohammad Talha will receive her. Later, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will be given a warm reception at Elysee Palace, the official residence of French President Emmanuel Macron, when she arrives there. The French President would receive the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina upon her arrival at the palace. A red carpet will be rolled out there to welcome Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina while the Presidential guard will also give a salute to her.

Oct. 29 Jakarta(Jakarta Post/ANN)- President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo is scheduled to attend the Group of Twenty (G20) summit in Rome on Oct. 30-31. At the end of the event, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi will hand over the rotary presidency of the world's 20 largest economies club to President Jokowi. As stated by Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi, the President will raise three main agendas in his acceptance speech on Sunday: the global economy and health, climate change and the environment, and sustainable development. Indonesia has chosen Recover Together, Recover Stronger as the theme of its first-time leadership. According to the Foreign Ministry's official website, it reflects the spirit of collective recovery of the world and is visualized in the logo of the G20 Indonesia presidency. In 2022, the President's foreign affairs agenda will be dominated by G20-related issues, as the country will be in charge of coordinating the group's activities for the whole year. In October next year, Indonesia will host the G20 summit in Bali. The elite group comprises Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States, whose combined economy accounts for 90 percent of the world's gross domestic product (GDP). Leading the prestigious group is both an honor and a challenge, but hopefully, Indonesia's presidency will generate concrete results not only for the country but also for other developing nations. As the world is still grappling with the devastating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the agenda on global health will likely top the priority of Indonesia's presidency. The supply of COVID-19 vaccines remains under the control of rich countries, while poorer nations rely mostly on the generosity of wealthy nations. Equal access to vaccines will ensure a speedy recovery of the world's economy. From Rome, the President will fly to Glasgow, Scotland, to attend the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ). In Glasgow, the President is expected to reiterate Indonesia's ambition to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060 or earlier. The government is drafting a carbon emission exchange mechanism amid public skepticism of the country's commitment to fighting climate change. Prior to the Rome and Glasgow meetings, the President attended the virtual ASEAN summit and met with its dialogue partners such as the US, China, Japan, South Korea and Australia. On Tuesday, Jokowi openly demonstrated his strong leadership as the president of ASEAN's largest member for the first time by telling Myanmar's junta leader Min Aung Hlaing not to play with fire with the regional grouping. ASEAN did not invite Hlaing to the summit. The three successive summits seem to indicate a shift in Jokowi's views of international diplomacy. For seven years since he assumed power in October 2014, Jokowi has never personally attended the annual UN General Assembly. He has fully entrusted his foreign minister to deal with international affairs and prefers to focus on domestic issues. For Indonesia, chairing the G20 is not just a matter of prestige, but a way to benefit from the group to boost its economy, win the fight against COVID-19 and help transform Earth into a better place to live. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Dhaka, Sept. 21 -- US President Joe Biden told the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday he would work with Congress to double funds by 2024 to $11.4 billion per year to help developing nations deal with climate change. The funding would help achieve a global goal set more than a decade ago of $100 billion per year to support climate action in vulnerable countries, reports Reuters. "The best part is, making these ambitious investments isn't just good climate policy, it's a chance for each of our countries to invest in ourselves and our own future," Biden told the annual gathering of world leaders. Biden made the commitment less than six weeks before the Oct 31-Nov 12 COP26 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland. Core elements of his climate change agenda remain tied to the fate of infrastructure and budget legislation under intense negotiation in Congress. The host of the conference, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, said that meeting the climate finance target is key to building trust between developing and developed nations ahead of new negotiations since developed countries have failed to mobilise the $100 billion per year pledge by the original goal year of 2020. Johnson and European Commission President Ursula van der Leyen called out the United States on Monday for lagging behind on delivering its share. A report released last week - ahead of the Biden announcement - by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said that rich countries likely missed the goal last year, increasing funding by less than 2 per cent in 2019. Some environmental groups welcomed the new pledge as a much-needed boost for the Paris climate agreement ahead of November's summit in Scotland. "Climate finance is a central tenet of the Paris Agreement and the US is taking an important step toward making good on its share of responsibility to meet the $100 billion commitment," said Helen Mountford, vice president for Climate and Economics at the World Resources Institute. But as the world's second-biggest greenhouse gas emitter, other campaigners said the pledge still falls short. "The US is still woefully short of what it owes and this needs to be increased urgently," said Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa.

Dhaka, Nov. 5 -- Activists are taking over the UN climate summit in Scotland on Friday, capping off a week of government pledges with a student march, youth-led presentations, and an iceberg shipped from Greenland to Glasgow's River Clyde to dramatise the plight of the Arctic. "We're expecting lots of people to come and join us in the streets, and not only youth but also adults supporting youth, and adults that want climate action," said activist Isabelle Axelsson, 20, with the youth movement Fridays For Future, which is organising the march, to be led by Greta Thunberg. The spotlight has been given to civic groups in an acknowledgement of how young campaigners such as Axelsson, Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate of Uganda have raised public understanding of climate change, and how their future will be affected by the decisions being made now. A few hours later, in Washington, the US House of Representatives is expected to vote on President Joe Biden's mammoth "Build Back Better" legislation, which includes $555 billion of measures designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change, reports Reuters. The COP26 The British president of the conference urged national negotiators to push harder through Friday, with a week left to secure more ambitious commitments to stop the world's slide into climate catastrophe. "It is not possible for a large number of unresolved issues to continue into week 2," Alok Sharma said in a note published by the United Nations. So far, the summit has yielded deals to try to phase out coal over the next three decades, reduce deforestation and curb methane, a far more potent, if short-lived, greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. 'NEW ENERGY, NEW URGENCY' It has also showcased a jumble of financial pledges, buoying hopes that national commitments to bring down emissions could actually be implemented. "Every COP I've been to in history has never had the feel of what I feel here in Glasgow today: new energy, new urgency, a new sense of possibility," US climate envoy John Kerry told a business dinner Thursday night. "We've never had as much corporate presence or commitment as we have today." Elsewhere this week, city mayors have been huddling over what they can do to advance climate action back home. "National governments are slow to communicate - very bureaucratic, internally and between each other. We're just mayors," said Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti, chair of the C40 global mayors' network for tackling climate change. But a clear picture has yet to emerge on how far these voluntary initiatives could moderate global warming. The head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, said on Thursday that emissions cut pledges made so far - if all implemented - could potentially restrict warming to 1.8C. But some UN negotiators and non-profit organisations said that assessment was too rosy, and much more work had to be done. Former US vice president Al Gore and Sharma will sit down on Friday with campaign groups to discuss the progress made so far, and what remains unresolved. Professor Gail Whiteman, founder of the climate activist group Arctic Basecamp, said she hoped protest actions and campaign events could add urgency to the discussions. The Greenland iceberg, shipped by her group via Iceland to the east coast of England, then by truck to Glasgow, now bobs in the water on the Clyde. "Studies are showing that if we lose the snow and ice in the Arctic, we will amplify global warming by 25 to 40 per cent," she said. "We felt that negotiators here had to actually come face to face with the Arctic, so we brought the iceberg." Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Dhaka, Oct. 14 -- Britain's Prince William has criticised some of the world's richest men for using their wealth to fund a new space race and space tourism rather than trying to fix the problems on Planet Earth instead. In comments to the BBC aired Thursday, William voiced his disapproval, a day after the former Star Trek actor William Shatner became the oldest man to fly to space in a rocket built by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, reports AP. "We need some of the world's greatest brains and minds fixed on trying to repair this planet, not trying to find the next place to go and live," said William, who is second-in-line to the British throne. On Wednesday, the 90-year-old Shatner, who is best known for his role as Captain James T. Kirk in the 1960s television series Star Trek, briefly flew into space with Bezos' space travel company, Blue Origin. Billionaires Elon Musk and Richard Branson are also pumping resources into their own space ambitions. William, who is formally known as the Duke of Cambridge, was speaking about climate change ahead of his inaugural Earthshot environmental prize awards ceremony on Sunday and in the run-up to the start of the UN climate summit in the Scottish city of Glasgow later this month. During the star-studded ceremony at Alexandra Palace in London, which will see five sustainability projects win 1 million pounds ($1.35 million) each, William will be joined by his wife Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge. The awards take their inspiration from the Moonshot challenge that President John F. Kennedy set for the US in 1961 to put a man on the moon by the end of the decade - a challenge that was met eight years later. The winners will be chosen by a committee including veteran broadcaster David Attenborough, actor Cate Blanchett and World Trade Organization director Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. William, who has been immersed in environmental issues all his life through the strong interest in them of his father, Prince Charles, and his late grandfather, Prince Philip, voiced his worries about the world his own children will inherit. He said it would be an "absolute disaster" if his oldest son, George, who he said is "acutely aware" of how resources impact the planet, was having to raise the same issues in 30 years' time. "Young people now are growing up where their futures are basically threatened the whole time," William said. "It's very unnerving and it's very you know, anxiety-making." Echoing comments from his father, William urged world leaders to put words into action at the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow, known as COP26 . "I think for COP to communicate very clearly and very honestly what the problems are and what the solutions are going to be, is critical," William said. The summit is scheduled to take place Oct 31-Nov 12. It is being billed by many environmentalists as the world's last chance to turn the tide in the battle against climate change.

Nov. 12\'e2\€  H\'c3\€ N\'e1\'bb I(Vietnam News/ANN) \'e2\€  President Nguy\'e1\'bb n Xu\'c3\£2n Ph\'c3\'bac highly appreciated APEC's role over the past three decades, noting that it has not only been serving as a driver for global growth, facilitating trade and investment, but also playing a pioneering role in responding to natural disasters, developing clean energy, preserving biodiversity, and stepping up trade in environmental goods. Ph\'c3\'bac made the statement at the APEC CEO Summit 2021 under the theme "Sustainable development and climate change". The two-day on-site and online summit took placed on Thursday in Auckland, New Zealand. Ph\'c3\'bac emphasised that: "Our green planet was shaken by accumulative and unprecedented impacts caused by climate change, extreme natural disasters, environmental degradation, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Such severe consequences are far worse than any forecasts, forcing all countries and economies to transform the business and production models, and social interactions and turning people's life upside down. Time is not on our side, for these challenges continue to worsen with every passing day. Thus, we need to work closely together to overcome such hardships." He said responding to climate change was the shared responsibility of all countries and economies. It required innovative and effective international cooperation, enhanced assistance in providing more resources and new technologies, and capacity building for developing countries. Each State needed to pursue long-term interest, and promote a comprehensive approach, ranging from infrastructure, finance, and trade to the protection of the environment, labour force, and society. However, Ph\'c3\'bac noted that all states, given their leading role, should avoid doing the work of other actors in society. They instead should encourage the formulation of suitable institutions and benefits to mobilise resources from businesses and the people, and build upon public-private projects for green growth. He also pointed out three proposals for the business community that each business needs to develop a roadmap to cut emissions in line with the greenhouse gas emission goals and indices of respective countries. These include green gas emission control, energy efficiency, and greening economic sectors, lifestyles, and consumption habits. He reminded businesses to invest in the future by focusing on projects in clean energy, new technology development with increasing "green values", or smart and green agriculture. It is also essential to establish green supply chains and encourage environmentally-friendly behaviours by consumers. He said the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) should draft a "Guideline on promoting APEC sustainable business", focusing on micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Ph\'c3\'bac affirmed that Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam and its businesses and people fully understand the intertwined risks and opportunities. Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam pledged to take bold action to transition to a green growth model and comprehensive response to climate change. At the COP26 In this process, Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam looks forward to the closer cooperation with APEC member economies, countries, and businesses at home and abroad. Apart from further improving its business and investment environment, Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam was also offering incentives for enterprises to seize the opportunities to provide green products and services. In addition, Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam is also ameliorating its institutions and policies pertaining to green and innovative corporations, and eco-industrial parks. These policies, together with our market of 100 million people and vast network of 14 FTAs, will open up opportunities for foreign investors to work with Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam, and together share the fruits of sustainable development, he concluded. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 3 -- The 15th August and 3rd Nov, turned my family's life upside down. I was just a baby at the time so completely oblivious of the darkness that fell upon the people of Bangladesh. My parents were a very young couple, returned from London with baby me in July 1975. Little did they know at the time, that the trajectory of theirs lives was about to completely change. After the killing of Bangabandhu and his family we were all under house arrest and my Grandfather Captain M Mansur Ali was taken by some armed persons. My father, mother and me were the last people my grandfather had a meeting with. We had visited him in Central Jail just a few days before the killing. My father recalled to me that, as we were leaving the Jail and were at the gates, suddenly my grand father ran back towards us, and took me into his arms and kissed me. My father said, my grandfather had behaved as if this was going to be the last time he saw us, sadly that was to be the case. After the killings due to political pressure, my parents had to go to the UK. Everything had been taken away from us, and they had very little resources, but my parents had the full responsibility of supporting the entire family. My father a 27 year old inexperienced lawyer, my mother a 22 year old graduate needed to find jobs fast. Overnight their lives had changed, they became political and economic refugees in an unknown land with no family and friends. I was too small to really understand the struggle that was taking place around me, but being a matured adult now, I recognise that this was no simple feat. At about the age of six I recall being told about my grandfather and his special bond and the loyality he had towards Bangabandhu. As a little child, being told his grandfather was PM of a country was surprising and confusing. My grandpa is a role model to me. My father mentioned to me that my grandpa only took his dinner on a pati (floor matt) as he always led a humble way of living. I decided from then onwards as a tribute to my grandpa I too will take my dinner sitting on a pati. We had a very simple life and lived in a two bedroom house, at the time I didn't realise that the activities in this tiny house would be a part of this huge movement to bring back democracy to our country. Our family life was centred around Awami league. My father worked full time and gave all his free time to political activities, so I hardly saw him. Bangabandhu and the Four National leaders are a symbols of the sacrifice of every person in Bangladesh who fought for our today's freedom. The importance of the future generations' understanding the principles of the Father of the nation is undoubtedly the only way we can preserve our freedoms. The digital revolution has given us so much information, but also fake news, which is diluting, polluting and misguiding the minds of the youth and sadly there is still today a concerted effort to do this propaganda against our true history by anti-Bangladesh groups. Our Prime Minister right now is representing the interests of our country at COP26 to make sure Bangladesh has its say on the policies created on how best to protect our world and country from the climate crisis that is looming. I request everyone to ask themselves this question, "as one of the worst suffering countries of the climate crisis, if today we were not the Republic of Bangladesh, could we have had a seat at this table?" Today we Bengalis will always be indebted to these great leaders, for holding the mantel of democracy for us then, and their blood holding on to it for us now.

Dhaka, Nov. 19 -- It was billed as the greatest show on earth and it did show that the One world doesn't exist. Only the most out of touch with reality global 'civil society' and NGOs would have thought that COP 26 was going to deliver. As reality dictates, it didn't deliver and sent its latest message that there is no such thing as one world except in rock concerts in the West. The global South continues to believe in colonial values expecting the North/Developed /White world to look after its Brown and Black brethren. It didn't and it won't. The need for a separate Southern strategy outside the COP parameter is urgent but the current global leaders are probably not up to the task. The One World fiction Global transactions are based on the falsehood of "One world" and it's impossible to give this up because the same fiction is used for internal governance in the South. Political leaders sell the idea that they rule for the benefit of all and so if they challenge the notion, they may end up challenging themselves. Hence they can't take an independent position on many global issues outside the herd norm. That the states that matter aren't going to be giving up their advantages as it affects their own people is denied by Southern leaders. The rich world's survival depends on continuing the path that led to climate change in the first place so there is almost no chance of emission reduction. Meanwhile, publicly they will continue to uphold noble principles which none follow. Few have said that the COP was a success and it's probably not possible to do so as the lack of interest in it was rather transparent. The rich world is not concerned about saving the poor world. Right now the West's principal anxiety is not global warming but China as the two seem to be inching closer to active hostility. However, both know that their own survival is at stake so actions to cool the global political heat were taken and the US and China have had virtual talks. No solution but keeping the violent end at bay while more wars go on. The concerns of the rich and the poor nations are different and that is historical and given history, there is no chance of any co-operation based on goodwill. Human species are driven by self-interest and the two worlds have no common interest. It is logical that global cooperation will not have much to do with saving the world. The rich will survive but the poor won't. COP 6, coal and economic competition The South had focused their demand on the "Glasgow facility" on "financing loss and damage". But as expected nothing came out. Next year another round of not so useful discussions will take place at COP27 to be held in Egypt. Bangladeshi delegate Saleemul Huq has written, "the COP Presidency chose to call the outcome of COP26 the Glasgow Climate Pact, dropping the word emergency both in name as well as in substance."(Daily Star 11/18/21) It's an emergency for the South but not the North, certainly not in their immediate future. The West's anti-coal position also reflects this anxiety. China's coal dependence is high and it would be a great service to the US/West if China emissions would be costlier due to restrictions on coal, competition would be less difficult for the West hence the focus. It was not a poor South issue who lacked capacity for production of sophisticated low emitting energy but a West driven agenda to put pressure on China and any other global competition. What was interesting and significant was that India too showed no interest in coal use control as it too depends on it making both China and India very unusual allies. An Indo-China led Southern alliance? Yet, it's in this alliance that the future may lie however little that be. China and India are drawn together by common interest and they got together because it served mutual interest even though they are at war of sorts. It's translating this sort of alliance across the South that is important and practical. The South must become more selfish if it wants to survive. There is very little reason to expect the North will take the Southern issue seriously so media and think tanks must stop toeing the global line and the governments must now have a Southern plan. It's useful to have China as the leader and India as the deputy but a global alliance for addressing climate change is killing the South. There is no option except strategic separation from the North. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Dhaka Courier.

Dhaka, Nov. 11 -- Over the past four decades, Denmark has managed to grow its economy while lowering CO2 emissions and resource consumption - proving that it is possible to have a green economy that also creates more jobs. Denmark's ambitious goals to reduce carbon footprint and achieve sustainable growth is globally relevant, especially in a fast-growing economy like Bangladesh. Hence, the Embassy of Denmark in Bangladesh hosted a five-day exhibition at Bay's Edge Gallery, in the backdrop of COP26 taking place in Glasgow, to highlight commercially viable green solutions that can support sustainable and inclusive economic growth in Bangladesh. The Danish Ambassador, H.E. Ms Winnie Estrup Petersen, emphasised that ''The 'Green Together' exhibition embodies and shares with a Bangladeshi audience Denmark's understanding of sustainability, which is a holistic approach to the environment and lifestyle, and also includes social goals like responsible business, good governance, equality, and inclusion.'' As a frontrunner in green economic growth and a leader in clean technologies, Denmark is well-positioned to serve as a knowledge partner for Bangladesh on its journey towards a greener and more sustainable society. As such, the exhibition also included four-panel discussions that highlighted key challenges on this journey and opportunities for the Bangladeshi public and private sector. 'Sustainable Green Buildings and Future of Urbanization' was the focus of the exhibition's panel on the opening night. While we do not think of buildings and installations as sustainable, they have a significant impact on the environment. Indeed, living and workspaces can be designed to be more resource-efficient while offering modern aesthetics and comfort. The panel members highlighted possibilities for sustainable residential, commercial, and industrial spaces in Bangladesh building on the progress achieved thus far. Attendees from government bodies, top real estate developers and architects, and Danish companies engaged in discussions on how simple technologies, such as energy-efficient water pumps and ventilation systems, can be integrated into buildings for more sustainable urbanisation. On the second day of the exhibition, the panellists unpacked the 'Future of Sustainable Apparel Production.' With the apparel sector as the biggest contributor to the Bangladeshi economy and Bangladesh most impacted by climate change, the key question was how can the apparel sector remain competitive while responding to the demands of the climate crisis. Guests ranging from industrial process experts and international brands from Denmark to leading Bangladeshi RMG manufacturers shared recommendations on how Bangladesh can better position itself as a sustainable manufacturing hub and a producer for high-value goods. Ultimately, becoming greener will make the Bangladeshi apparels sector even more competitive in the international arena. Panellists on day three of the exhibition spoke on the 'Sustainable Future of Food'. Bangladesh recently hit the 1 billion mark from the exports of agriproducts. Although a dominant export sector in Bangladesh, agriculture and food production struggles with several challenges around food loss, food safety, and quality throughout the agrarian value chain. Bangladeshi food safety regulators, industry leaders from the agro-food processing sector and innovative start-ups together with Danish sector representatives conferred on how to increase access to healthier foods, reduce food loss and increase food quality for export. Denmark's expertise on sustainability in food production can help improve productivity and build an efficient food and agro sector. Lastly, the Embassy hosted a discussion on day four of the exhibition to highlight the importance of 'Transition to Sustainable Infrastructure.' Sustainable and green infrastructure development, from digital and physical connectivity to energy and services, is key for a climate-vulnerable country like Bangladesh to improve productivity, economic growth, and quality of life. Danish examples of inclusive and sustainable infrastructure were shared with exhibition attendees, who represented local investment agencies, banks and financial institutions, Danish and Bangladeshi infrastructure developers, and the chief guest Honourable ICT Minister Zunaid Ahmed Palak. The panellists and guests deliberated on the need for more investment in this sector to help facilitate Bangladesh's green transition. Public and private sector initiatives are key to delivering an efficient response to the climate crisis. Denmark hosts this exhibition to raise awareness and share experiences for new ways forward. In collaborating with Bangladeshi partners, Denmark believes it can accelerate climate action to help us all pass on a prosperous and sustainable world to the coming generations.

Dhaka, Nov. 26 -- Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has sought investment from the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) partners in Bangladesh's long-term climate projects such as Delta Plan. "I invite all interested ASEM partners to invest in projects under our long-term Bangladesh Delta Plan and Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan," she said. The prime minister said this in a video message aired on the last day of the two-day 13th virtual ASEM Summit streaming from Phnom Penh, Cambodia on Friday. She also called upon Asia and Europe to work in unison to mobilise finances and technology to effectively fight climate change, reports BSS. Marking ASEM's 25th anniversary, the summit brought together the leaders of the European and Asian member countries, the EU, and the ASEAN Secretariat. The overall theme of ASEM13 is "Strengthening multilateralism for shared growth". Cambodia currently holds the rotating ASEM presidency. Sheikh Hasina said Asia and Europe must join hands for mobilizing finances and technology to combat climate change, adding, "We need multilateral cooperation now more than ever for our shared and sustainable development." She said the advanced and industrialized economies need to raise their climate ambitions beyond COP26 The prime minister said that Bangladesh aspires to become a regional connectivity hub, with potential benefits for its neighbours. Bangladesh also offers to be one of the bridges in the EU-Asia Connectivity Strategy, she said. "We welcome Europe's engagements in sub-regional connectivity projects in railways and roads," she continued. Mentioning that our shared growth pursuits need to be supported by sound international security cooperation, the premier said regional platforms like ASEAN Regional Forum should help foster real-time cooperation in counter-trafficking, maritime and cyber security, and fighting terrorism. She went on saying, "A critical test of our multilateral cooperation will be to find a lasting and peaceful solution for Myanmar's forcibly displaced people- the Rohingyas". Mentioning that Bangladesh offered temporary shelter to the Rohingyas and stabilized the situation, the prime minister said, "We continue to amplify the demand for their safe and dignified return to Myanmar." The security situation in the Cox's Bazar camps is getting complicated and the growing violence and crimes can soon spread beyond our borders, she said. The prime minister said, "A provisional response to the crisis will serve little purpose. I urge the international community to give proper attention to the concerns we are raising." Noting that Bangladesh considers itself to be modeled after the best of Asian norms and European values, she said, "Since our early days, our commitment to multilateralism has remained constant". The premier said they are engaged in strategic dialogues with a number of European partners and are looking forward to becoming a Sectoral Dialogue Partner for ASEAN. She also mentioned that, "their present lead in Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), D-8, BIMSTEC and other forums will be used for advancing our shared objectives". She added: "We wish to see ASEM emerge as a force for good in the international system." This year we are celebrating the Golden Jubilee of our independence and the birth centenary of our Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, she said. Noting that the COVID-19 pandemic has put a heavy pressure on the health systems and economies across the world, the premier said, "It has compelled us to divert our development resources for emergency treatments and vaccines." Sheikh Hasina said her government adopted a strategy to save both lives and livelihoods. She also said her government announced 28 stimulus packages worth 5.4 billion US dollars to offset the impacts of the pandemic. "Our priority now is to preserve our hard-earned development gains in reducing poverty and hunger, saving mothers and children, promoting literacy and education, and ensuring safe and healthy living," she said. "We hope to sustain the momentum of our LDC graduation. We shall remain focused on attaining the SDGs by 2030. Our vision is to build an inclusive and prosperous nation by 2041. To achieve these goals, our partnership with Asia and Europe remains crucial," she opined. The premier thanked friends in Asia, Europe and the US for their donations of vaccines. "Bangladesh has the capacity to produce quality vaccines. We seek technical know-how and licenses for the purpose," she added. With its 53 members (30 European and 21 Asian countries plus the EU and the ASEAN Secretariat), ASEM summit is the biggest international leaders' gathering after the UN General Assembly. The European group within ASEM comprises the 27 EU member states as well as Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Prime Minister of Cambodia Hun Sen chaired the summit. President of the European Council, Charles Michel and President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, represented the EU. The Prime Minister of Slovenia, Janez Jansa, represented the rotating EU Council presidency. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Dhaka, Dec. 31 -- Describing the LDC graduation as an important milestone and a remarkable feat for Bangladesh, Director General of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) Ambassador Patricia Danzi has said it is necessary for the country to prepare for the post-graduation era when certain market access preferences may cease to exist. "One of the biggest challenges for Bangladesh going forward will be to ensure that its graduation journey is smooth, inclusive and sustainable, leaving no one behind, '' Ambassador Danzi, who represented Switzerland in athletics at the 1996 Summer Olympic Games, told UNB in an interview. She laid emphasis on addressing various structural reforms to enhance predictability in the market and demonstrate strong economic governance. Currently, Ambassador Danzi said, the whole world is unsettled with the challenges brought by the Covid-19 pandemic which has created new poverty fault lines, upended the global economy and exacerbated inequality. "In this crucial period and under our new Cooperation Programme, Switzerland will continue to work closely with Bangladesh to address poverty reduction and contribute to an inclusive economic development," she said, wrapping up her visit to Bangladesh. Looking to the future, Ambassador Danzi said, Switzerland will continue its "committed partnership with Bangladesh" towards the next stage of its development. "During my visit, I've witnessed a lot of goodwill that Switzerland enjoys in this country and openness in dialoguing and exchanging views," she said. All these ingredients, Ambassador Danzi said, are central and they will want to build on that. "Now let's take this next step together and work to create a prosperous and sustainable future for all." She said climate change is certainly another fundamental challenge and solutions to finance the necessary adaptation and mitigation measures will have to be in place. "Durable and transparent climate financing was one of our priorities during the recent COP26 in Glasgow," Danzi said. Describing Switzerland's relations with Bangladesh as "excellent", she said they nurture a solid and forward-looking partnership in many major areas, including international cooperation, trade and investment, political and cultural spheres. "In 2022, our two countries will celebrate 50 years of bilateral ties. One of the main purposes of my visit to Bangladesh was to kickstart the celebration of this very special occasion," Danzi she said, adding that this milestone indeed allows them to reflect on the past years and look to the future. She listed several areas where the two countries can work more closely to take the relations to the next level. For instance - and that is currently so important -, Bangladesh and Switzerland share a common commitment towards the Agenda 2030 of the United Nations and the vision of a world leaving no one behind, she said. "To that end, my visit marked the launch of the Bangladesh Cooperation Programme of Switzerland for the years 2022-2025." Ambassador Danzi mentioned that Switzerland and Bangladesh will continue to collaborate in multilateral fora. "Since my country is a candidate for a non-permanent seat at the UN Security Council for 2023-2025, I'm sure that this will be a very good occasion to work together to promote peace and security." During her visit, she spent two days in Cox's Bazar and commended Bangladesh for its generosity in hosting over 1 million Rohingya refugees since 2017. "This humanitarian crisis is a challenge for the Rohingya refugees, for the host community and for Bangladesh as a host country," Danzi said. Since the beginning of the crisis, Switzerland has been engaged with Bangladesh and on the international stage. "During this period, we've contributed CHF 49.5 million to the crisis. This makes Switzerland one of the biggest donors per capita, and we remain committed to supporting refugees and host communities until a sustainable, voluntary, safe and dignified return is possible," she said. It is, therefore, essential, Danzi said, under the current circumstances, to keep hopes alive and provide Rohingya with education and livelihood opportunities. Responding to a question, she said international cooperation is a key and historically strong pillar in two countries' bilateral relations. Over the last decades, Ambassador Danzi said, Switzerland has supported Bangladesh with over $1 billion in development cooperation and humanitarian aid in various socio-economic sectors. "This is a testament of our firm and committed partnership with your country. I have visited several development and humanitarian interventions in the last few days and I am proud to say that the Swiss-supported projects are highly context-relevant and have a real impact on the ground." Taking into account the opportunities of the market and the leverage of the private sector - the so-called "market-led approach", she said their projects benefit the poor and the disadvantaged population, who are the ones who need this assistance the most. Giving two examples, Danzi said, between 2018 and 2021, an estimated 1.4 million farmers, entrepreneurs and skills training graduates used new or improved market, social and skills development services with their support. "In addition, over two million people were reached and informed about safe migration practices and migrant rights," she said, adding that a critical feature of our development interventions is that they contribute to empower beneficiaries and enable them to make their own decisions and change their lives. Asked about priority areas, she said they launched their new cooperation programme for Bangladesh on 22 December. Ambassador Danzi said it is guided by Swiss foreign policy priorities and her country's international cooperation strategy. "It is also aligned with the Agenda 2030 and Bangladesh's development priorities. Our overall goal is to support a sustainable LDC graduation, promote a more prosperous, just and resilient society, and contribute to peaceful coexistence," she said. Switzerland will invest around CHF 119 million or Tk 11 billion to implement this programme over the next four years. Bangladesh, with the upcoming graduation, is at a crossroads and their Programme 2022-2025 reflects this and the journey ahead, said Ambassador Danzi. She said it has strong economic development and cooperation components, including a decisive market-led approach, for example in skills development, and a vision to engage more with the private sector, for instance in the field of insurance. "SDGs are certainly at the core of our activities since they will contribute to build back better after the pandemic," Danzi said. In that regard, one SDG that is particularly dear to our hearts is SDG 16 - peace, justice and strong institutions - since it is so closely interlinked with other SDGs, she mentioned. "Indeed, without peace, justice and inclusion, achieving goals such as ending poverty, ensuring education, promoting economic growth seem difficult or even impossible," Ambassador Danzi said. Trade and Investment She said trade and investment relations between the countries are steadily growing and they expect this trend to continue. The Swiss private sector has expertise, know-how, and capacity to offer innovative and technology-based solutions and services to the Bangladeshi market, which will further boost our economic ties and create win-win outcomes for all in the future, Danzi said. "From my perspective, I also see how innovative our program is in terms of economic development. I had a chance to visit a garment factory where, with Swiss support, initiatives - under the impact investing agenda - improve the well-being of the workers and workplace conditions. This is very important and will contribute to make Bangladesh sustainable in the long run," she mentioned. "As I said before, Bangladesh may also lose concessional financing after graduation. Hence, developing the capital market and looking into mobilising resources from the private sector through ways such as impact investment are key," she said. Congratulating Bangladesh for this important anniversary, Ambassador Danzi said over the last five decades, the collaboration between the two countries has been mutually beneficial and rewarding.

Dhaka, Nov. 1 -- Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday urged the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) and Commonwealth members to work in unison as a catalyst for implementing the Paris Agreement as no country is immune to the grave consequences of climate changes. "With more than one-third Member States of the CVF being also members of the Commonwealth, I firmly believe that the joint efforts of the CVF and the Commonwealth members can act as a catalyst for the implementation of the Paris Agreement," she said. The Prime Minister also added that the Commonwealth countries have a long history of commitment and contributions in addressing the challenges of climate change. She said these while addressing the CVF-Commonwealth High-Level Panel Discussion on Climate Prosperity Partnership at the Commonwealth Pavilion in COP26 venue in Glasgow as the chief guest. Sheikh Hasina, also the CVF chair, raised six points for effective collaboration between the CVF and Commonwealth. As the first point, she said, "We need to increase knowledge sharing, research and capacity building and technology transfer among the members for achieving sustainable, green and nature-based solutions for our prosperous future." "Second, our common position can help us secure the annual $100 billion for climate financing by the developed countries for the developing countries, as promised in the Paris Agreement. The climate financing has to be in addition to the existing and future ODA. This amount should be allocated with the ratio of 50:50 between adaptation and mitigation," she said. As the third point, the Hasina said, the issue of climate migrants - the people displaced from their ancestral homes and traditional jobs because of the adverse effects of climate change, including sea-level rise, increasing salinity, river erosion, floods and droughts need to be discussed. "And there has to be global responsibility for the rehabilitation of these people," the PM added. The PM, in her fourth pint, said, "Our united actions can act as a force for the major emitting countries to declare their ambitious and aggressive NDCs to keep the global temperature rise at 1.5 degrees." "Fifth, transfer of clean and green technology to developing countries at affordable costs, including for meeting energy requirements, is very important. At the same time, the development needs of the CVF and the Commonwealth members will have to be taken into account," she said. "Finally," Hasina said, "Together we must try to find pragmatic, inclusive and locally-led solutions to tackle climate change." Mentioning that climate change is a global and cross-border issue now, she said, "No country is immune from its grave consequences. The increased number of climate disasters and their impacts have brought vulnerable countries to a tipping point of unalterable damage. These're affecting global food, energy, health and economic securities." The Prime Minister said the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report gives a clear message that all have to take urgent and decisive actions to save our planet and future generations. She said the 48 members of the CVF account for only 5.0 per cent of the total global emission. "However, the adverse impacts of climate change have posed fundamental threats to our lives and livelihoods." Besides, the Prime Minister said, the Covid-19 pandemic has proved the significance of effective cooperation and collaboration for robust, bold and responsive action by the international community. "Our vulnerability and necessity for adequate climate finance and technology transfer must be recognised by the international community. The major emitting countries need to fulfil their obligations to support us in CVF efforts to cope with the effects of climate change," she said. Hasina said Bangladesh is often referred to as Ground Zero for adverse impacts of climate change. "Despite our vulnerabilities and resource constraints, we have adopted exemplary initiatives to tackle climate change. Recently, we submitted an ambitious and updated NDC to the UNFCCC." Hasina said Bangladesh has launched the "Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan" to transform our climate vulnerability into climate prosperity by following a low-carbon development path.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Tuesday said structural inequalities in human society along with inherent social customs are causing disproportionate impacts of climate change on women. 'Generally, women across the world don't have equal access to resources. In addition, in many societies, they don't have the decision-making power and are often engaged in low-paid and unpaid jobs and activities. All these factors contribute to more adverse impacts of climate change on women than on their male counterparts,' she said. The Prime Minister said this while addressing the Women's Climate Leadership Event- COP26 : High-Level Panel on Women and Climate Change at Scottish Pavilion here. She said most vulnerable and marginalised people around the world are also the greatest victims of the adverse impacts of climate change for a number of socio-economic and cultural factors. 'Women and girls are major among them,' she said. 'We believe recognising the vulnerabilities of women in climate change response is critical,' Hasina said. She said the government is fully committed to making women part of the solutions to climate change by creating space for them to contribute to all aspects of sustainable development. 'I call upon all of you, especially the women leaders, for taking bold and decisive actions in this COP for a global compact to build communities resilient to climate change in a way where everyone -- both man and woman -- can participate equally,' she said. To address the vulnerability of women due to climate change, it is important to create space for them in the decision-making process, said the Prime Minister. 'In a bid to ensure that, Bangladesh has already secured women's leadership from the national Parliament to the grassroots levels of decision-making processes,' she said. Hasina mentioned that the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) of Bangladesh has incorporated gender in a comprehensive manner as part of adaptation solutions. 'We've prepared the National Climate Change and Gender Action Plan to ensure gender equality in climate change-related policies, strategies, and interventions.' She said the current updated Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) includes gender as one of the core strategic areas to undertake practical and action-oriented programmes to tackle climate change. 'Therefore, starting from policy-making to the ground response to climate led disasters, we're ensuring equal participation. In climate disaster prepared programmes, we've engaged 76,000 volunteers and 50 percent of which are women,' she said. The Prime Minister said Bangladesh's disaster preparedness programme is a success story as it reduced the death toll from half a million in a cyclone 50 years ago to only a couple of hundreds in a similar cyclone a year ago. She also said the government is going to implement the 'Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan' named after Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. In this Plan, a strong role of women in the journey of climate vulnerability to climate resilience to climate prosperity has been mainstreamed, she added. Hasina said this is high time to connect the climate change ambition with a future that will be inclusive of both men and women. 'For this, we must reflect the priorities and concerns of women in various climate related policies.' She said women should be included in the driver's role in every level of initiatives, starting from the planning to resource allocation and implementation. 'Therefore, financing gender responsive adaptation and mitigation measures will be the key.' The Prime Minister urged all to amplify the voices of women across the world to ensure equal access to finance to address the needs and priorities of women on climate change issues. \</doc>

Dhaka, Dec. 31 -- Two years since the COVID-19 pandemic began to sweep the globe, life remains upended for hundreds of millions of children. Classrooms have sat empty. Families have struggled through financial crisis. Life-saving immunizations have been halted. Compounding the ongoing devastation of the pandemic in 2021 has been a deadly combination of conflict, poverty and the growing impact of climate change. In Latin America, thousands of migrant children and their families have fled poverty and violence through the Darien Gap - a dense tropical forest that is one of the most dangerous routes in the world for migrants. The world's worst humanitarian crises for children have deteriorated further in Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The number of children suffering from life-threatening malnutrition is rising. And climate change is worsening the scale, frequency, and intensity of emergencies with devastating effects on families. Sadly, the response to these crises is not matching their scale, and tens of millions of children are having their childhoods stolen by forces over which they have no control. In 2021, as always, it has been the children already living through crises who have been hardest hit. They need urgent help. Cyclone Eloise in Mozambique For Mozambique, 2021 started with a powerful storm that hit a region still recovering from the devastation of Cyclone Idai less than two years earlier, destroying homes, displacing families and causing widespread food insecurity. Cyclone Eloise was a stark reminder that children are bearing the brunt of climate-related severe weather events and that action is urgently needed to strengthen the resilience of vulnerable communities. Malnutrition in Yemen Life has become a living hell for many of Yemen's children. Years of armed conflict and economic decline, the COVID-19 pandemic and a severe funding shortfall for the humanitarian response are pushing exhausted communities to the brink, and leaving a growing number of children vulnerable to malnutrition. A warning in February from four UN agencies that hundreds of thousands more were at risk without urgent treatment was just the latest reminder of how dire the situation has become for the country's children. Ten years of conflict in Syria The conflict in Syria has left the lives and futures of a generation of children hanging by a thread. A decade of conflict has had a staggering impact on children and families, with thousands killed and hundreds of thousands suffering from stunting as a result of chronic malnutrition. In March, families in northern Syria were emerging from another long winter - after battling severe weather, including torrential rain and snow - still living in tents, shelters and destroyed or unfinished buildings. Crisis in northern Ethiopia Six months after conflict erupted in northern Ethiopia, families in the region were dealing with multiple crises, with no end in sight. By mid-April, more than one million people had been displaced as fighting continued, separating children from parents and caregivers and leaving them at greater risk of violence. Tens of thousands more children were at risk of life-threatening malnutrition amid extensive, systematic damage to the food, health, nutrition, water and sanitation systems and services that children and their families depend on for their survival. Water under fire in Ukraine A UNICEF report released in May found that eastern Ukraine had experienced around 380 attacks on water infrastructure since 2017. Attacks on water and sanitation facilities and workers in conflicts around the world continue to put the health and lives of millions of children at risk - denying children and families access to critical water and sanitation services - including in Ukraine. Violence in the State of Palestine Gaza's children were left reeling from a violent escalation in conflict in May. Lives were lost and families shattered, with devastating impacts on children. In Gaza, schools and health facilities were damaged and homes and offices were flattened, with many families left displaced. In Israel, schools, homes and buildings were also damaged. South Asia battered by COVID-19 wave A deadly surge in COVID-19 cases in South Asia - home to almost 2 billion people - placed an enormous strain on health and critical care facilities in the region, leaving vulnerable families paying a particularly steep price. At the heart of the crisis was a desperate need for oxygen, and UNICEF responded in India by installing oxygen plants and supplying thousands of oxygen concentrators to support the response on the frontline. Decade of independence marked in South Sudan A decade after South Sudan's independence, more children are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance than ever before. Bouts of violence and conflict, recurring floods, droughts and other extreme weather events fuelled by climate change, and a deepening economic crisis have led to extremely high food insecurity, and one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. Humanitarian emergencies in Afghanistan. Afghanistan was already one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a child. But as the crisis escalated in August, the situation became even more desperate. Conflict, drought, and COVID-19 have collided to create a humanitarian emergency, while too many of Afghanistan's children are living with the emotional and physical scars of scenes that no child should ever see. .and in Haiti A powerful earthquake in Haiti in August devastated homes, schools and hospitals. Even before the disaster, Haiti was facing multiple crises, including growing political instability, growing gang-related violence and insecurity, civil unrest, and rising food insecurity and malnutrition. But the earthquake left tens of thousands of children and their families in urgent need of health care, clean water and shelter. A COVID-induced education crisis In September, UNICEF announced that schoolchildren around the world had lost an estimated 1.8 trillion hours - and counting - of in-person learning since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns. As a result, young learners have been cut off from their education and the other vital benefits schools provide. #DonateDosesNow The development of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines has been a huge step forward in the global effort to end the pandemic and to get back to doing more of the things we enjoy with the people we love. But there is currently a limited number of vaccines, and African countries in particular have largely been left without access to COVID-19 vaccines. In October, influencers and supporters across Africa signed and shared an open letter calling on G20 leaders to honor their promises to urgently deliver doses. Crossing the Darien Gap In October, UNICEF warned that the number of migrant children who cross the Darien Gap - a jungle that separates Colombia and Panama - had hit an all-time high. In this dense tropical forest, migrant families with children are particularly exposed to violence, including sexual abuse, trafficking and extortion from criminal gangs. Children who cross the Darien Gap are also at risk of getting diarrhoea, respiratory diseases, dehydration and other ailments that require immediate attention. Climate crisis = Child rights crisis As extreme weather events such as cyclones and heatwaves increase in frequency and ferocity, they threaten children's lives and destroy infrastructure critical to their well-being. Floods compromise water and sanitation facilities, leading to diseases such as cholera, to which children are particularly vulnerable. UNICEF was at the UN climate conference, COP26 , in November to ensure that the climate crisis is recognized as a crisis for children and their rights. "Hellish conditions" in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Tens of thousands of children living in a remote and inaccessible hilltop camp for displaced people in the province of Ituri, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, are braving "hellish conditions" without adequate food, shelter, protection, security and sanitation, UNICEF warned in early December. The dramatic growth of Rhoe camp followed several attacks on nearby camps by armed groups, forcing thousands of already-displaced people to seek sanctuary there.

Dhaka, Oct. 19 -- When climate change is no longer an abstract scientific concept but a matter of daily experience, the significance of the upcoming climate summit cannot be overemphasised. A lot is being expected from the Glasgow summit of the parties to begin on October 31. To note, the parties signed the 1994's United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Understandably, the summit takes the name, COP26 , as it will be for the 26th time that such an annual Conference of the Parties (COP) is going to be held. But what can climate vulnerable nations like Bangladesh expect from it? COPs apart, many other meetings have also been held so far with agreements reached on the all-important issue of global warming, the main indicator of climate change, triggered by human action. As expected, all such meets had the selfsame objective of reducing carbon emission, the principal cause of global warming, by the nations of the world. For example, the central theme of the 2015's landmark Paris Agreement was to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Interestingly, it was the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) representing developing and least developed countries (LDCs) like Bangladesh that had been pushing for adopting the temperature rise threshold for the world to abide by. The reason CVF members were pressing for the issue is that they, with their over 1.2 billion people, have to put up with the worst consequences of climate change. But what is the progress during the last six years since the 1.5 degrees temperature limit was fixed at the legally binding Paris Agreement at COP21? Nothing reassuring, to be fair. If the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN body to assess climate science, is to be believed, then at the current rate of carbon emission, the temperature threshold will be crossed in little over a decade. If anyone is to blame, then it is certainly not the LDCs of the CVF. The alarm bell has already started ringing. The fast growing economies and the highly industrialised nations have to respond more seriously to the mounting climate emergency. This calls for putting more intense pressure on the rich nations at the Glasgow summit by the climate vulnerable countries so they (the industrialised countries) may agree to drastically cut their carbon emission rate. Consider the increasing frequency of floods striking the country causing an annual economic loss worth US$2.2 billion, according to a keynote presentation made at a recently held virtual dialogue in the city. Further, it predicted that the annual average temperature in Bangladesh will rise by 0.94 per cent by 2030. Small wonder that in recent years the phenomenon of heat wave has been wreaking havoc with the crop fields. Its impact on human health is no less harmful. River erosion is getting worse by the day, while sea level along with salinity in the coastal region is also on the rise. It goes without saying that these developments are highly concerning. Already, such climate impacts have set off city-ward climate migration. These only point to how desperately Bangladesh is in need of the climate-adaptation support fund that rich countries have promised. Confronted with such climate-induced emergencies, Bangladesh in concert with other CVF members would be required to raise its voice at the Glasgow summit seeking support in its climate adaptation efforts. The demands to be made to the rich nations should include reminding them their obligation to provide US$100 billion in climate finance every year over the 2020-2024 period.

Dhaka, Dec. 20 -- Global analysts and financial experts deem it necessary that bond markets and banking systems across the world should provide sufficient funds for high-growth "catch-up" phases of sustainable developments. During last month's COP26 climate summit, hundreds of financial institutions declared that they would put trillions of dollars to work to finance solutions to climate change, but major barrier emerged in the process, as the world's financial system actually impeded the flow of finance to developing countries, thereby creating a financial death trap for many LDC, Middle income and Developing countries all around the globe. According to economic theory, economic development depends on investments in three main kinds of capital: human capital (health and education), infrastructure (power, digital, transport, and urban), and businesses. Poorer countries have lower levels per person of each kind of capital and also have the potential to grow rapidly by investing in a balanced way within them. Now with the changing situation in the modern world, growth can and should be green and digital, avoiding the high-pollution growth of the bygone days and years. In view of that, global bond markets and banking systems should provide sufficient funds for the high-growth "catch-up" phase of sustainable development, as the flow of funds from global bond markets and banks to developing countries remains small, costly to the borrowers. The borrowers of developing-country pay interest charges that are often 5-10 per cent higher per year than the borrowing costs paid by rich countries. Thus, the borrowers of the developing countries, as a group, remain at high risk, because the bond rating agencies assign lower ratings by mechanical formula to countries just because they are in the poor category. It is therefore perceived as high risk, exaggerated, and often has a self-fulfilling prophecy among them. When a government floats bonds to finance public investments, it generally counts on the ability to refinance some or all of the bonds as they fall due, provided that the long-term trajectory of its debt relative to government revenues is acceptable. If the government suddenly finds itself unable to refinance the debts falling due, it likely will be pushed into default resulting in bad faith or of long-term insolvency. This is what happens to far too many developing-country governments. That is why, International lenders (or rating agencies) come to believe, often for an arbitrary reason, that Country X has become creditworthy. This perception results in a "sudden stop" of new lending to governments. Without access to refinancing, government is forced into default, thus "justifying" the preceding fears. The government then usually turns to the International Monetary Fund for emergency financing. The restoration of the government's global financial reputation typically takes years or even decades. This way, rich-country governments that borrow internationally in their own currencies do not face the same risk of a sudden stop, because their own central banks act as lenders of last resort. Lending to the United States government is considered safe in no small part because the Federal Reserve can buy Treasury bonds in the open market, ensuring in effect that the government can roll over debts falling due. The same is true for Eurozone countries, assuming that the European Central Bank acts as the lender of last resort. When the ECB briefly failed to play that role in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, several Eurozone countries (including Greece, Ireland, and Portugal) temporarily lost access to international capital markets. After that debacle - a near-death experience for the Eurozone - the ECB stepped up its lender-of-last-resort function, engaged in quantitative easing through massive purchases of Eurozone bonds, and thereby eased borrowing conditions for the affected countries. Rich countries thus generally borrow in their own currencies, at low cost, and with little risk of illiquidity, except at moments of exceptional policy mismanagement (such as by the US government in 2008, and by the ECB soon thereafter). Low- and lower-middle-income countries, by contrast, borrow in foreign currencies (mainly dollars and euros), pay exceptionally high interest rates, and suffer sudden stops. For example, Ghana's debt-to-GDP ratio (83.5 per cent) is far lower than Greece's (206.7 per cent) or Portugal's (130.8 per cent), yet Moody's rates the creditworthiness of Ghana's government bonds at B3, several notches below those of Greece (Ba3) and Portugal (Baa2). Ghana pays around 9 per cent on 10-year borrowing, whereas Greece and Portugal pay just 1.3 per cent and 0.4 per cent, respectively. The major credit-rating agencies (Fitch, Moody's, and S&P Global) assign investment-grade ratings to most rich countries and to many upper-middle-income countries, but assign sub-investment-grade ratings to nearly all lower-middle-income countries and to all low-income countries. Moody's, for example, currently assigns an investment grade to just two lower-middle-income countries (Indonesia and the Philippines). Trillions of dollars in pension, insurance, bank and other investment funds are channeled by law, regulation, or internal practice away from sub-investment-grade securities. Once lost, an investment-grade sovereign rating is extremely hard to recover unless the government enjoys the backing of a major central bank. During the 2010s, 20 governments - including Barbados, Brazil, Greece, Tunisia, and Turkey - were downgraded to below-investment grade. Out of the five that have since recovered their investment-grade rating, four are in the EU (Hungary, Ireland, Portugal, and Slovenia), and none are in Latin America, Africa, or Asia (the fifth is Russia). An overhaul of the global financial system is, therefore, urgent and long overdue. Developing countries with good growth prospects and vital development needs should be able to borrow reliably on decent market terms. To this end, the G20 and the IMF should devise a new and improved credit-rating system that accounts for each country's growth prospects and long-term debt sustainability. Banking regulations, such as those of the Bank for International Settlements, should then be revised according to the improved credit-rating system to facilitate more banks lending to developing countries. Under the situation, it is therefore necessary that within a new framework, pragmatic strategy has to be enforced under which the G20 and the IMF should use their financial firepower to support a liquid secondary market in developing-country sovereign bonds. The Fed, ECB, and other key central banks should establish currency swap lines with central banks in low-income and lower-middle-income countries. The World Bank and other development finance institutions also should greatly increase their grants and concessional loans to developing countries, especially the poorest. Last but not least, if rich countries and regions, including several US states, stopped sponsoring money laundering and tax havens, developing countries would have more revenues to fund investments in sustainable development in line with global changes.

The climate crisis is a code red for humanity. World leaders will soon be put to the test at the UN Climate Conference - known as COP26 - in Glasgow. Their actions - or inactions - will show their seriousness about addressing this planetary emergency. The warning signs are hard to miss: temperatures everywhere are reaching new highs; biodiversity is reaching new lows; oceans are warming, acidifying and choking with plastic waste. Increasing temperatures will make vast stretches of our planet dead zones for humanity by century's end. And the respected medical journal The Lancet just described climate change as the 'defining narrative of human health' in the years to come - a crisis defined by widespread hunger, respiratory illness, deadly disasters and infectious disease outbreaks that could be even worse than COVID-19. Despite these alarm bells ringing at fever pitch, we see new evidence in the latest UN reports that governments' actions so far simply do not add up to what is so desperately needed. Recent new announcements for climate action are welcome and critical - but even so, our world is on track for calamitous global temperature rises well above 2 degrees Celsius. This is a far cry from the 1.5 degree Celsius target to which the world agreed under the Paris Agreement - a target that science tells us is the only sustainable pathway for our world. This target is entirely achievable. If we can reduce global emissions by 45 per cent compared to 2010 levels this decade. If we can achieve global net-zero by 2050. And if world leaders arrive in Glasgow with bold, ambitious and verifiable 2030 targets, and new, concrete policies to reverse this disaster. G20 leaders - in particular - need to deliver. If governments - especially G20 governments - do not stand up and lead this effort, we are headed for terrible human suffering. But all countries need to realize that the old, carbon-burning model of development is a death sentence for their economies and our planet. We need decarbonization now, across every sector in every country. We need to shift subsidies from fossil fuels to renewable energy, and tax pollution, not people. We need to put a price on carbon, and channel that back towards resilient infrastructures and jobs. And we need to phase-out coal - by 2030 in OECD countries and 2040 in all others. Increasing numbers of governments have pledged to stop financing coal - and private finance needs to do the same, urgently. People rightly expect their governments to lead. But we all have a responsibility to safeguard our collective future. Businesses need to reduce their climate impact, and fully and credibly align their operations and financial flows to a net-zero future. No more excuses; no more greenwashing. Investors - public and private alike - must do the same. They should join front runners like the net-zero asset owners alliance, and the UN's own pension fund, which met its 2021 carbon reduction investment objectives ahead of time and above its target, with a 32 per cent reduction this year. Individuals in every society need to make better, more responsible choices in what they eat, how they travel, and what they buy. And young people - and climate activists - need to keep doing what they're doing: demanding action from their leaders and keeping them accountable. Throughout, we need global solidarity to help all countries make this shift. Developing countries are grappling with debt and liquidity crises. They need support. Public and multilateral development banks must significantly increase their climate portfolios and intensify their efforts to help countries transition to net-zero, resilient economies. The developed world must urgently meet its commitment of at least $100 billion in annual climate finance for developing countries. Donors and multilateral development banks to allocate at least half their climate finance towards adaptation and resilience. The United Nations was founded 76 years ago to build consensus for action against the greatest threats facing humanity. But rarely have we faced a crisis like this one - a truly existential crisis that - if not addressed - threatens not only us, but future generations. There is one path forward. A 1.5 degree future is the only viable future for humanity. Leaders must get on with the job in Glasgow, before it's too late. \</doc>

Describing the UK's admiration for what had been achieved in Bangladesh over the past 50 years, British High Commissioner to Bangladesh Robert Chatterton Dickson on Wednesday said they will continue to work with Bangladesh in its efforts to achieve a smooth and successful graduation. 'Graduation is a milestone, not a finishing line. We'll continue to work with Bangladesh to achieve a smooth and successful graduation,' he said, adding that they have also decided to provide continued duty-free, quota-free access to the UK market for three years after graduation, to 2029. While speaking at 'DCAAB Talk', the envoy said he was delighted that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina would be visiting London and Manchester to engage with British businesses during her visit to the UK. Diplomatic Correspondents Association, Bangladesh (DCAB) hosted the event. DCAB President Pantho Rahaman and its General Secretary AKM Moinuddin also spoke at the event. The High Commissioner reflected on the huge challenge ahead at COP26 and said the UK is looking forward to welcoming Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and welcoming the Bangladesh delegation to Glasgow. 'This was just one sign of the way that the UK was working with an increasingly confident, prosperous and outward-looking Bangladesh on the world stage, as we headed into the next 50 years of partnership,' he said. At the High Commission in Bangladesh, Dickson said his teams were engaged deeply in issues such as climate and biodiversity, maritime security and many other areas, including working with British businesses to build a trade and investment relationship as Bangladesh graduated from Least Developed to Middle Income Country status. Regional Security Challenges The High Commissioner said the UK is working closely with the government of Bangladesh on regional security challenges. A particular challenge is the Rohingya crisis that was created by the actions of the Myanmar army over four years ago, he said. The UK was very clear that the shared objectives were for the Rohingya to go home to Rakhine state, as soon as it could happen in a way that was 'voluntary, dignified and safe'. 'No one wanted to live in a refugee camp. Events in Myanmar were moving in a way that was worrying, so it seemed the Rohingya would likely remain in Bangladesh for some time to come,' said the High Commissioner. The UK is working closely with the government of Bangladesh to ensure the extraordinary generosity in hosting the Rohingyas continued, and that the funding was there to provide the refugees with the healthcare, food, shelter, water and sanitation they needed until they could return to Myanmar. The UK had contributed over \£3320m to the global response, working closely with allies on camp conditions and building resilience, including against Covid-19. The High Commissioner was concerned about recent violence at the Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar. He said the UK was exploring ways that refugees could be given more productive ways to spend their time, with the opportunity for them to volunteer, provide camp services and basic livelihoods, and for children to be educated. On a global stage, he said, the UK also makes sure this crisis is not forgotten. 'The UK is the penholder on the crisis in the UN Security Council and works hard to keep it on the agenda, despite not having full support from all UNSC members.' Dickson said the UK is also using its new status as a Dialogue Partner to ASEAN and supporting the ASEAN Special Envoy to support better outcomes in Myanmar. The High Commissioner said the solution was leadership - leaders needed to lead people away from exploiting division, towards healing it. He said the UK was continuing to support the government of Bangladesh in its response to the Covid-19 pandemic. On vaccines, the envoy said, the UK was providing all its support globally, including to Bangladesh, through the COVAX programme. 'The UK was not on the front page but was a significant part of the effort.' \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 5 -- The human race is on the verge of destruction today due to climate change. Glasgow conference is the last chance to reduce global warming, says the conference chief. The COP 26 conference officially kicked off on Sunday in Glasgow, Scotland, where the world leaders have gathered. British Minister Alok Sharma, who is chairing the conference, said, "If global warming is not brought under control, the whole world will be in a state of catastrophe, just as many countries will be submerged in the sea". He added that steps must be taken now to limit global warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. Earlier in 2015 in Paris, the world leaders agreed to reduce global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, and there was talk of trying to bring it down to 1.5 degrees Celsius. And that's why COP 26 is the last chance. Excessive emissions of carbon dioxide are causing massive changes in the world's climate and are having a devastating effect on the balance of the environment. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), carbon dioxide emissions around the world will rise alarmingly this year. A UNICEF report stated that about 20 million children in Bangladesh are at risk due to climate change. Climate change must be tackled to ensure sustainable global development otherwise it will not be resolved. Carbon emissions are largely responsible for climate change, and countries that are leading the way in emitting carbon must be the first to tackle climate change. There are many countries in the world that are not responsible for climate change but they are cruel victims of climate change. The IEA report says global carbon dioxide emissions will increase by about 5 percent this year. About 3300 crore tons of carbon dioxide emissions could be in 2021. The highest level of carbon dioxide emissions in history was in 2019 but the emission was slightly reduced due to the corona epidemic in 2020, and scientists fear that carbon emissions will increase again in 2021. China and the United States, two world powers, have agreed to work together to tackle climate change. The two countries have agreed to keep the average annual temperature within 1.5 degrees celsius following the Paris agreement. Carbon dioxide is the main cause of climate change, and China and the United States emit about half of this carbon dioxide. The phenomenon of global climate change is an unequal process. For example, one of the causes of climate change is carbon dioxide emissions, but Bangladesh's contribution to that carbon dioxide emission is only 0.28 percent, but Bangladesh is one of the most affected countries. Scientists predict that about 3 crore people in Bangladesh will be at extreme risk by the year 2050 due to rising sea levels. According to another report, by 2030, more than half a million people in Bangladesh will be at risk of various natural disasters every year due to climate change. Coal, oil and mineral gas are the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions and people need to use them with extreme caution, otherwise there will be more damage around the world. Currently half of the carbon dioxide we emit is absorbed by land plants and oceans but this process will be weakened if the oceans become warmer and the land dries up. The climate crisis has already begun to hit the low-lying areas, including coral islands. According to IFRC survey, over four lakh people have died in the last decade due to natural disasters related to weather and climate. Fifty developing countries will have to spend 5000 crore dollars a year to tackle climate change over the next decade. However, the COP26 conference will be a fair solution to the world's climate crisis and the whole world will be considered a healthy habitat for human beings. The problem can only be solved if the largest carbon dioxide producing countries reduce their production of carbon catastrophe.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Friday put forward six proposals to make the world more liveable by bringing down carbon emissions and tackle the people being displaced across the globe due to climate change. She placed her proposals while delivering the pre-recorded speech in the 'Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate', convened by US President Joe Biden. The Prime Minister, in her first proposal, asked the major carbon-emitting countries to take action to reduce their emissions to keep the global temperature rise at 1.5 degrees Celsius. In her second proposal, Hasina renewed her call for fulfilling the commitment of an annual 100-billion-dollar climate fund by the developed countries and distributing it 50:50 between adaptation and mitigation. While transitioning to renewables, stocktaking of respective development priorities of nation-states, according to loss and damage experienced by them should be considered, she said in her fourth proposal. In the fifth proposal, Hasina mentioned that the responsibility of rehabilitating people displaced because of sea-level rise, increased salinity, riverbank erosion, floods and draughts needs to be shared by all countries. The PM finally said the major economies have to work with all the stakeholders globally in partnership for ensuring a sustainable future for the next generation. Regarding Bangladesh, the Prime Minister said it is one of the most climate vulnerable countries. 'In addition to sea-level rise, the rise in salinity, riverbank erosion, floods and draughts, we're facing serious climate impact because of 1.1 million forcefully displaced Myanmar nationals, commonly known as Rohingyas,' she added. She mentioned that Bangladesh is the pioneer in climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. 'We recently submitted an ambitious and updated NDC. Bangladesh has one of the world's most extensive domestic solar energy programmes. With a low carbon footprint, we're also vying for a more sustainable energy mix.' Hasina said Bangladesh is going to implement the 'Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan' - a journey from climate vulnerability to climate resilience to climate prosperity (VRP). As the Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) and the V20, she said, 'Our key focus is to promote the interests of the climate vulnerable countries. We also share the best practices through the South Asia regional office of the Global Center on Adaptation in Dhaka.' Hasina said Bangladesh would like to see strong and significant outcomes of upcoming COP26 , and the major economies play an important role there. \</doc>

Describing the LDC graduation as an important milestone and a remarkable feat for Bangladesh, Director General of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) Ambassador Patricia Danzi has said it is necessary for the country to prepare for the post-graduation era when certain market access preferences may cease to exist. 'One of the biggest challenges for Bangladesh going forward will be to ensure that its graduation journey is smooth, inclusive and sustainable, leaving no one behind, '' Ambassador Danzi, who represented Switzerland in athletics at the 1996 Summer Olympic Games, told UNB in an interview. She laid emphasis on addressing various structural reforms to enhance predictability in the market and demonstrate strong economic governance. Currently, Ambassador Danzi said, the whole world is unsettled with the challenges brought by the Covid-19 pandemic which has created new poverty fault lines, upended the global economy and exacerbated inequality. 'In this crucial period and under our new Cooperation Programme, Switzerland will continue to work closely with Bangladesh to address poverty reduction and contribute to an inclusive economic development,' she said, wrapping up her visit to Bangladesh. Looking to the future, Ambassador Danzi said, Switzerland will continue its 'committed partnership with Bangladesh' towards the next stage of its development. 'During my visit, I've witnessed a lot of goodwill that Switzerland enjoys in this country and openness in dialoguing and exchanging views,' she said. All these ingredients, Ambassador Danzi said, are central and they will want to build on that. 'Now let's take this next step together and work to create a prosperous and sustainable future for all.' She said climate change is certainly another fundamental challenge and solutions to finance the necessary adaptation and mitigation measures will have to be in place. 'Durable and transparent climate financing was one of our priorities during the recent COP26 in Glasgow,' Danzi said. Describing Switzerland's relations with Bangladesh as 'excellent', she said they nurture a solid and forward-looking partnership in many major areas, including international cooperation, trade and investment, political and cultural spheres. 'In 2022, our two countries will celebrate 50 years of bilateral ties. One of the main purposes of my visit to Bangladesh was to kickstart the celebration of this very special occasion,' Danzi she said, adding that this milestone indeed allows them to reflect on the past years and look to the future. She listed several areas where the two countries can work more closely to take the relations to the next level. For instance - and that is currently so important -, Bangladesh and Switzerland share a common commitment towards the Agenda 2030 of the United Nations and the vision of a world leaving no one behind, she said. 'To that end, my visit marked the launch of the Bangladesh Cooperation Programme of Switzerland for the years 2022-2025.' Ambassador Danzi mentioned that Switzerland and Bangladesh will continue to collaborate in multilateral fora. 'Since my country is a candidate for a non-permanent seat at the UN Security Council for 2023-2025, I'm sure that this will be a very good occasion to work together to promote peace and security.' During her visit, she spent two days in Cox's Bazar and commended Bangladesh for its generosity in hosting over 1 million Rohingya refugees since 2017. 'This humanitarian crisis is a challenge for the Rohingya refugees, for the host community and for Bangladesh as a host country,' Danzi said. Since the beginning of the crisis, Switzerland has been engaged with Bangladesh and on the international stage. 'During this period, we've contributed CHF 49.5 million to the crisis. This makes Switzerland one of the biggest donors per capita, and we remain committed to supporting refugees and host communities until a sustainable, voluntary, safe and dignified return is possible,' she said. It is, therefore, essential, Danzi said, under the current circumstances, to keep hopes alive and provide Rohingya with education and livelihood opportunities. Responding to a question, she said international cooperation is a key and historically strong pillar in two countries' bilateral relations. Over the last decades, Ambassador Danzi said, Switzerland has supported Bangladesh with over $1 billion in development cooperation and humanitarian aid in various socio-economic sectors. 'This is a testament of our firm and committed partnership with your country. I have visited several development and humanitarian interventions in the last few days and I am proud to say that the Swiss-supported projects are highly context-relevant and have a real impact on the ground.' Taking into account the opportunities of the market and the leverage of the private sector - the so-called 'market-led approach', she said their projects benefit the poor and the disadvantaged population, who are the ones who need this assistance the most. Giving two examples, Danzi said, between 2018 and 2021, an estimated 1.4 million farmers, entrepreneurs and skills training graduates used new or improved market, social and skills development services with their support. 'In addition, over two million people were reached and informed about safe migration practices and migrant rights,' she said, adding that a critical feature of our development interventions is that they contribute to empower beneficiaries and enable them to make their own decisions and change their lives. Asked about priority areas, she said they launched their new cooperation programme for Bangladesh on 22 December. Ambassador Danzi said it is guided by Swiss foreign policy priorities and her country's international cooperation strategy. 'It is also aligned with the Agenda 2030 and Bangladesh's development priorities. Our overall goal is to support a sustainable LDC graduation, promote a more prosperous, just and resilient society, and contribute to peaceful coexistence,' she said. Switzerland will invest around CHF 119 million or Tk 11 billion to implement this programme over the next four years. Bangladesh, with the upcoming graduation, is at a crossroads and their Programme 2022-2025 reflects this and the journey ahead, said Ambassador Danzi. She said it has strong economic development and cooperation components, including a decisive market-led approach, for example in skills development, and a vision to engage more with the private sector, for instance in the field of insurance. 'SDGs are certainly at the core of our activities since they will contribute to build back better after the pandemic,' Danzi said. In that regard, one SDG that is particularly dear to our hearts is SDG 16 - peace, justice and strong institutions - since it is so closely interlinked with other SDGs, she mentioned. 'Indeed, without peace, justice and inclusion, achieving goals such as ending poverty, ensuring education, promoting economic growth seem difficult or even impossible,' Ambassador Danzi said. Trade and Investment She said trade and investment relations between the countries are steadily growing and they expect this trend to continue. The Swiss private sector has expertise, know-how, and capacity to offer innovative and technology-based solutions and services to the Bangladeshi market, which will further boost our economic ties and create win-win outcomes for all in the future, Danzi said. 'From my perspective, I also see how innovative our program is in terms of economic development. I had a chance to visit a garment factory where, with Swiss support, initiatives - under the impact investing agenda - improve the well-being of the workers and workplace conditions. This is very important and will contribute to make Bangladesh sustainable in the long run,' she mentioned. 'As I said before, Bangladesh may also lose concessional financing after graduation. Hence, developing the capital market and looking into mobilising resources from the private sector through ways such as impact investment are key,' she said. Congratulating Bangladesh for this important anniversary, Ambassador Danzi said over the last five decades, the collaboration between the two countries has been mutually beneficial and rewarding. \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 3 -- China flagged on Wednesday it is targeting a 1.8 per cent reduction in average coal use for electricity generation at power plants over the next five years, in a bid to lower greenhouse gas emissions. The target, announced by China's economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), comes as the world's top climate negotiators have gathered in Scotland for the COP26 climate talks. Average coal use for electricity generation in China fell by about 17.4 per cent in the 15 years till 2020, reports Reuters. NDRC's statement did not refer to the UN event, which Chinese President Xi Jinping is not attending and offered no additional pledges in a written response. By 2025, coal-fired power plants in China must adjust their consumption rate to an average of 300 grams of standard coal per kilowatt-hour (kWh), NDRC said on Wednesday. That compares to 305.5 grams per kWh in 2020. "Further promoting the energy-saving and consumption reduction at coal-fired power units is an effective means to improve energy efficiency and is of great significance for achieving carbon emission peak in the power industry," the NDRC said. China, the world's biggest source of climate-warming greenhouse gases, has vowed to bring its carbon emissions to a peak before 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Last week, China published a roadmap on the peak carbon target, aiming to reduce waste, promote renewables and unconventional fuel as well as reform its electricity network. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the power generation and heating sectors account for more than 40 per cent of total CO2 emissions in China. Average coal use for power generation in China is down now compared with 370 grams per kWh in 2005. "The reduction of coal use helped to cut 6.67 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions from the power sector in 2006-2020, or 36 per cent of total emission reductions in the industry," NDRC said. China's powerful NDRC is in charge of crafting policies on economic development for the country, with plans and orders issued by the agency expected to be carried out by local and regional authorities. "China has built a lot of coal-fired projects and is very good at constructing coal plants and making them efficient, which means we have picked up pretty much all low hanging fruit of making existing coal feeds very efficient," said Li Shuo, senior climate adviser with Greenpeace in Beijing. The NDRC also mandated that new power plant projects adopt ultra-supercritical units that consume coal at an average rate below 270 grams per kWh. It also said that new water-cooling units in power plants that use more than 285 grams per kWh and air-cooling units that consume more than 300 grams per kWh will not be allowed. Further, power plants with average coal use above 300 grams per kWh that cannot be upgraded for energy efficiency improvement will be gradually shut down, NDRC said. "The level of coal use is already set once it is launched unless plants invest huge money to upgrade it. So China's average efficiency target could be slowed to achieve if there are no new units with higher efficiency continuing to join the power fleet," said Zhang Shuwei, a director at Draworld Energy Research Centre. But Zhang also said that Chinese coal-fired power plants would welcome the government policy as reducing coal use would help lower input cost. China's thermal coal prices surged nearly 190 per cent this year, causing drastic losses at power plants and a widespread power outage before Beijing rolled out a raft of measures to tame prices. China is also aiming to upgrade 200 GW of coal-fired power plant capacity in 2021-2025 to give its power system, where an increasing portion of renewable energy is being used, the flexibility to switch sources.

UK's Minister for South Asia, the United Nations and the Commonwealth Lord (Tariq) Ahmad of Wimbledon on Thursday reinforced the UK's commitment to deepening bilateral relations with Bangladesh as he left for London concluding his 3-day visit to Bangladesh. In a busy programme of meetings and visits to places, the Minister reinforced the UK's commitment to deepening cooperation with Bangladesh across a wide range of issues including trade, security, climate change and the Rohingya crisis. Lord Ahmad, who is also the UK Prime Minister's Special Representative on Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict, held meetings with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen and Foreign Secretary Masud Bin Momen, as well as with representatives of civil society organisations and the humanitarian sector. In his meetings, Lord Ahmad discussed the path to Bangladesh's landmark graduation from Least Developed Country Status, which is due in 2026. The Minister set out opportunities for enhanced trade and investment between the UK and Bangladesh, with a particular focus on the service sectors in which the UK is a world-leader, including finance, health and education. Lord Ahmad urged the Government of Bangladesh to implement the relevant rules to allow UK higher education institutions to offer their services in Bangladesh. This would offer young Bangladeshis more choice and support quality improvement across the sector as part of the Bangladesh government's drive to improve the effectiveness and relevance of higher education, he said. Lord Ahmad had the opportunity to discuss the valuable contribution of civil society, media, and academia to the partnership between the UK and Bangladesh. He acknowledged the challenges facing some of these groups, and highlighted the UK's commitment to supporting human rights and democratic values. He also supported their commitment to the democratic process ahead of Bangladesh's upcoming elections. In his meeting with faith leaders, Lord Ahmad highlighted the importance that the UK attaches to freedom of religion and belief. He also encouraged further focus on inter-religious dialogue, with particular attention to the intersection between freedom of religion and belief and gender equality. Lord Ahmad also discussed the outcomes of COP26 and looked forward to strengthening the UK-Bangladesh partnership on climate action, which combines expertise and technology alongside the recently-announced \£3120 million (14.2 billion taka) of UK Aid funding to overcome climate challenges. On Wednesday, Lord Ahmad represented the UK at the Indian Ocean Rim Association Council of Ministers. Speaking in the UK's capacity as Dialogue Partner, Lord Ahmad said that the type of cooperation that IORA did best would be invaluable in the response to the legacy of the pandemic, climate change and the sustainable use of the Indian Ocean's maritime resources. On Tuesday, Lord Ahmad visited Cox's Bazar. The Minister met Rohingya families and community leaders to learn about the persecution they had suffered in Myanmar, and to hear first-hand about the challenges that life in the camps presents. The refugees were clear that they were keen to return home and stressed their gratitude to the Government of Bangladesh for welcoming and protecting them in the meantime. They also explained how important it was that they had access to education and livelihood opportunities while they were still in Bangladesh. The Minister was struck by the well-organised and well-coordinated UN humanitarian operation in the camps. In particular, he noted the importance of properly registering the Rohingya living there, and the link this provided to the regular distribution of food and cooking gas. The Minister was concerned to hear about the challenges during the hours of darkness when deteriorating security presented a much greater threat, particularly for women and girls, said the British High Commission in Dhaka. He was encouraged by the increasing presence of law enforcement agencies and the commitment of the Government to improving security. Lord Ahmad said, 'My heart goes out to all those affected by recent violence in the Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazaar. I was moved by the dignity and fortitude I witnessed amongst the refugees living there." He said the UK has already provided over \£3320 million to the humanitarian response to the crisis, and will continue to work with the Government of Bangladesh to support the Rohingya for as long as necessary until their safe, voluntary and dignified return can be guaranteed. On November 15, Lord Ahmad delivered a speech to an audience at the Bangladesh Foreign Service Academy, in which he celebrated the first 50 years of friendship between the UK and Bangladesh, and set out his ambitions for the next 50 years. Lord Ahmad also announced new UK funding of \£354 million, that will be invested in two new programmes designed to help ensure disadvantaged girls and young people have access to a quality education. Reflecting on his visit, Lord Ahmad said, 'I am grateful to the Government and people of Bangladesh for their warm welcome this week. Over the past three days, I have been inspired by the people I have met and the quality of our conversations.' He was buoyed by the evident strength of feeling, and shared ambitions for the future. 'I wish everyone in Bangladesh the very best for your continued Golden Jubilee celebrations next month, and invite everyone to join me in looking forward to many more years of BritBanglaBondhon.' \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 2 -- Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Tuesday said structural inequalities in human society along with inherent social customs are causing disproportionate impacts of climate change on women. "Generally, women across the world don't have equal access to resources. In addition, in many societies, they don't have the decision-making power and are often engaged in low-paid and unpaid jobs and activities. All these factors contribute to more adverse impacts of climate change on women than on their male counterparts," she said. The Prime Minister said this while addressing the Women's Climate Leadership Event- COP26 : High-Level Panel on Women and Climate Change at Scottish Pavilion in Glasgow, Scotland, reports UNB. She said the most vulnerable and marginalised people around the world are also the greatest victims of the adverse impacts of climate change for a number of socio-economic and cultural factors. "Women and girls are major among them," she said. "We believe recognising the vulnerabilities of women in climate change response is critical," Hasina said. She said the government is fully committed to making women part of the solutions to climate change by creating space for them to contribute to all aspects of sustainable development. "I call upon all of you, especially the women leaders, for taking bold and decisive actions in this COP for a global compact to build communities resilient to climate change in a way where everyone -- both man and woman -- can participate equally," she said. To address the vulnerability of women due to climate change, it is important to create space for them in the decision-making process, said the Prime Minister. "In a bid to ensure that, Bangladesh has already secured women's leadership from the national Parliament to the grassroots levels of decision-making processes," she said. Hasina mentioned that the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) of Bangladesh has incorporated gender in a comprehensive manner as part of adaptation solutions. "We've prepared the National Climate Change and Gender Action Plan to ensure gender equality in climate change-related policies, strategies, and interventions." She said the current updated Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) includes gender as one of the core strategic areas to undertake practical and action-oriented programmes to tackle climate change. "Therefore, starting from policy-making to the ground response to climate led disasters, we're ensuring equal participation. In climate disaster prepared programmes, we've engaged 76,000 volunteers and 50 per cent of which are women," she said. The Prime Minister said Bangladesh's disaster preparedness programme is a success story as it reduced the death toll from half a million in a cyclone 50 years ago to only a couple of hundreds in a similar cyclone a year ago. She also said the government is going to implement the "Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan" named after Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. In this Plan, a strong role of women in the journey of climate vulnerability to climate resilience to climate prosperity has been mainstreamed, she added. Hasina said this is high time to connect the climate change ambition with a future that will be inclusive of both men and women. "For this, we must reflect the priorities and concerns of women in various climate related policies." She said women should be included in the driver's role in every level of initiatives, starting from the planning to resource allocation and implementation. "Therefore, financing gender responsive adaptation and mitigation measures will be the key." The Prime Minister urged all to amplify the voices of women across the world to ensure equal access to finance to address the needs and priorities of women on climate change issues.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, currently the Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), will open the V20 Climate Vulnerables Finance Summit virtually on Thursday. Finance Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal, Chair of the V20, made the announcement at a virtual briefing on Wednesday saying the Summit is poised to become one of the most crucial and eminent platforms for decisive climate action in the lead up to COP26 Glasgow. Formed in 2015, the V20 Group of Finance Ministers is a dedicated cooperation initiative of economies systematically vulnerable to climate change. At present, the Vulnerable 20 (V20) membership extends to 48 countries. The V20 represents the economies of a collective 1.2 billion people with some of the consistently highest growth rates in the world yet facing existential threats from growing perils of climate change. Collectively, V20 countries seek a transformational approach to global economic activities anchored in keeping global warming to below 1.5 degree Celsius while simultaneously maintaining the growth trajectory of the world economy. The summit will feature heads of state/government from Climate Vulnerable Forum member countries including Colombia, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, and the Marshall Islands; V20 finance ministers from countries including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ghana, Haiti, Ethiopia, Fiji, Grenada, Honduras, the Maldives, Marshall Islands, the Philippines, Timor-Leste, and Sri Lanka; along with Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Environment, Forestry and Climate Change of Bangladesh. In close cooperation with the United Nations, international financial institutions and key development partners, the dialogue will shape globally cooperative responses on a global magnitude in order to ensure fast-tracked efforts in building resilience. Partners represented by at least 25 Finance Ministers, UN Secretary General, heads of state/government from Ethiopia, Costa Rica, Colombia and the Marshall Islands, United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, World Bank (WB) President, Asian Development Bank (ADB) President, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) President, European Investment Bank (EIB) President, Global Environment Facility (GEF) CEO, Green Climate Fund (GCF) Executive Director, International Renewable Energy Agency Executive Director, United Nation University's Institute for Environment and Human Security, United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), Insurance Development Forum, and other stakeholders will constitute the parties in attendance at the summit. PM to open V20 Finance Summit Thursday At the press conference ahead of the summit, Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Md Shahab Uddin; Special Envoy of CVF Presidency of Bangladesh, Md Abul Kalam Azad; Secretary of Economic Relations Division Fatima Yasmin and Secretary of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Md Mostafa Kamal were present along with the Finance Minister. Then Bangladesh Finance Minister and V20 Chair Mustafa Kamal said, 'In this summit, there will be a high-level roundtable dialogue of the Ministers of Finance and representatives of V20 with key partner governments from the G7, G20 and international finance and development partners.' He also said the summit outcome 'Communique to articulate' will be the core priorities and initiatives of the V20 member economies following the G7 Summit and ahead of the G20 Climate and Energy Joint Ministerial and G20 Summits which represent a key interval on the road to COP26 in Glasgow. The Bangladesh Finance Minister has invited all the journalists from print, electronic and social media, civil society, academia, regional and international groups associated with climate change to join the first-ever Virtual 'Climate Vulnerables Finance Summit'. \</doc>

UK Minister for the Middle East and North Africa James Cleverly has announced a package of new UK support including \£31.8 million for "Start Funds" in Bangladesh and Nepal to help national and international NGOs anticipate and react to disasters. Meanwhile, \£31.3 million will go to the Start Network for civil society projects in Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, and the Philippines to help develop disaster risk finance systems in these countries. The UK has led a push for the international community to take more action ahead of disasters - rather than responding reactively to them and commits \£33.1 million in aid to minimise the humanitarian impact of disasters. At an event jointly hosted by the UK, Germany and UN OCHA, UK Minister for the Middle East and North Africa, James Cleverly warned that conflict, COVID-19 and climate change are driving unprecedented levels of humanitarian need. He called on donors and aid agencies to 'do humanitarian aid differently' and use technology and forecasting to pre-empt disasters such as flooding, drought, or disease outbreak, and reduce their impact on the most vulnerable. The UK is a recognised leader in anticipatory action, which involves identifying hazards, pre-agreeing action plans and funding, and triggering a response when a 'risk threshold' is crossed. Minister James Cleverly said developments in science, technology and data mean they can identify the risk of disasters better than ever beforehand yet they still too often wait for floods, droughts and diseases to strike before they respond. "We need to do humanitarian aid differently - to act ahead of shocks, to mitigate their impact. In the face of intensifying climate change, the whole aid system needs to come together to stop, minimise, and address the threat of loss and destruction caused by environmental damage. We know that this proactive approach can save lives." Protecting vulnerable communities from disasters, and addressing, minimising and averting the loss and damage caused by the impacts of climate change, is a priority for the UK as it hosts the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, in November 2021. With natural hazards increasing in both frequency and severity as a result of climate change, anticipatory action and disaster risk finance have an increasingly critical role to play, said the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. The 'High-level Humanitarian Event on Anticipatory Action: A Commitment to Act Ahead of Crises' aimed to scale up the use of anticipatory action, galvanise a collective push to act ahead of crises, mitigate their impact and map a common way forward. \</doc>

Oct. 29 Jakarta(Jakarta Post/ANN)- The climate crisis is a code red for humanity. World leaders will soon be put to the test at the United Nations Climate Conference  known as COP26  in Glasgow. Their actions  or inactions  will show their seriousness about addressing this planetary emergency. The warning signs are hard to miss: temperatures everywhere are reaching new highs; biodiversity is reaching new lows; oceans are warming, acidifying and choking with plastic waste. Increasing temperatures will make vast stretches of our planet dead zones for humanity by century's end. And the respected medical journal The Lancet just described climate change as the "defining narrative of human health" in the years to come  a crisis defined by widespread hunger, respiratory illness, deadly disasters and infectious disease outbreaks that could be even worse than COVID-19. Despite these alarm bells ringing at fever pitch, we see new evidence in the latest UN reports that governments' actions so far simply do not add up to what is so desperately needed. Recent new announcements for climate action are welcome and critical  but even so, our world is on track for calamitous global temperature rises well above 2 degrees Celsius. This is a far cry from the 1.5 degree C target to which the world agreed under the Paris Agreement. This target is entirely achievable. If we can reduce global emissions by 45 percent compared to 2010 levels this decade. If we can achieve global net-zero by 2050. And if world leaders arrive in Glasgow with bold, ambitious and verifiable 2030 targets, and new, concrete policies to reverse this disaster. Group of Twenty (G20) leaders  in particular  need to deliver. The time has passed for diplomatic niceties. If governments  especially G20 governments  do not stand up and lead this effort, we are headed for terrible human suffering. But all countries need to realize that the old, carbon-burning model of development is a death sentence for their economies and our planet. We need decarbonization now, across every sector in every country. We need to shift subsidies from fossil fuels to renewable energy, and tax pollution, not people. We need to put a price on carbon, and channel that back towards resilient infrastructures and jobs. And we need to phase-out coal. Increasing numbers of governments have pledged to stop financing coal  and private finance needs to do the same, urgently. People rightly expect their governments to lead. But we all have a responsibility to safeguard our collective future. Businesses need to reduce their climate impact, and fully and credibly align their operations and financial flows to a net-zero future. No more excuses; no more greenwashing. Investors  public and private alike  must do the same. They should join front runners like the net-zero asset owners alliance, and the UN's own pension fund, which met its 2021 carbon reduction investment objectives ahead of time and above its target, with a 32 percent reduction this year. Individuals in every society need to make better, more responsible choices in what they eat, how they travel, and what they buy. And young people  and climate activists  need to keep doing what they're doing: demanding action from their leaders and keeping them accountable. Throughout, we need global solidarity to help all countries make this shift. Developing countries are grappling with debt and liquidity crises. Public and multilateral development banks must significantly increase their climate portfolios and intensify their efforts to help countries transition to net-zero, resilient economies. The developed world must urgently meet its commitment of at least US$100 billion in annual climate finance for developing countries. Donors and multilateral development banks to allocate at least half their climate finance towards adaptation and resilience. The United Nations was founded 76 years ago to build consensus for action against the greatest threats facing humanity. But rarely have we faced a crisis like this one  a truly existential crisis that  if not addressed  threatens not only us, but future generations. There is one path forward. A 1.5 degree future is the only viable future for humanity. Leaders must get on with the job in Glasgow, before it's too late. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Dhaka, Sept. 17 -- Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has urged the major economies of the world to work with all the stakeholders in partnership to ensure a sustainable future for the next generation. "Major economies have to work with all stakeholders globally in partnership for ensuring a sustainable future for the next generation," she said. The prime minister, in a pre-recorded speech aired on Friday in a high-level event titled Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate Summit convened by US President Joe Biden in Washington DC, placed a six-point proposal for the forum's consideration, reports BSS. In her first proposal, she called upon the major carbon-emitting countries to take actions to reduce their emissions to keep the global temperature rise at 1.5 degree Celsius. In her second proposal, Sheikh Hasina said that the commitment of annual 100 billion dollars climate fund by the developed countries has to be fulfilled, distributed 50:50 between adaptation and mitigation. In the third proposal, she renewed her call to the developed countries to come forward with the most effective energy solutions along with technology transfer to the developing countries. In her fourth proposal, she said while transitioning to renewables, stocktaking of respective development priorities of nation-states, according to loss and damage experienced by them should be considered. The premier, in her fifth proposal, said that the responsibility of rehabilitating people displaced because of sea-level rise, increases in salinity, river erosion, floods and droughts needs to be shared by all countries. She has sought a strong and significant outcome of COP26 to be held in November in Glasgow and urged the major economies of the world to play an important role there to this end. The premier said that Bangladesh is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries. "In addition to sea-level rise, increase in salinity, river erosion, floods and droughts, Bangladesh is also facing serious climate impact because of 1.1 million Rohingyas forcefully displaced from Myanmar," she added. She said that Bangladesh has taken the world's most extensive domestic solar energy programmes. The prime minister further said that Bangladesh is going to implement the 'Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan' - a journey from climate vulnerability to climate resilience to climate prosperity. As the Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) and the V20, the prime minister said, Bangladesh's key focus is to promote the interests of the climate-vulnerable countries. She added that Bangladesh also shares the best practises through the South Asia regional office of the Global Centre on Adaptation in Dhaka.

Recognizing the urgent need for action, leaders from the United Nations, the private sector, national and local governments, youth and other organizations issued a joint call recently for countries, businesses, cities and civil society groups to put forward their 'Energy Compacts' to show how they will achieve the goal of clean, affordable energy for all by 2030 (SDG 7) and net-zero emissions by 2050. The Energy Compacts would provide the clearest indication of how countries will ensure that all people have access to clean energy and move toward net-zero emissions. The Compacts will be announced between June and the September UN High-level Dialogue on Energy. The leaders issued their call in a video released recently. 'Global Champion' Ministers from over 30 countries have joined the call for urgent energy action in advance of the High-level Dialogue, along with senior UN officials, climate leaders including the Presidency of the COP26 conference, CEOs, Mayors and youth activists. 'This year's Dialogue is the best chance for governments, businesses and other partners to step up their commitments, if the world is to achieve clean, affordable energy for all by the 2030 deadline,' said Liu Zhenmin, UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs and Secretary-General of the Dialogue. \</doc>

Nov. 3 Seoul(Korea Herald/ANN)- President Moon Jae-in made another overture toward North Korea at a UN climate summit Monday, suggesting planting trees together to reduce carbon emissions on the Korean Peninsula and pledging to make good on a 3-year-old promise in an apparent bid to reengage Pyongyang. "The Republic of Korea will take a leading role in cooperation for reforestation," Moon said in his keynote speech at the 26th Conference of the Parties or COP26 held in Glasgow, Scotland, calling tree planting one of the key solutions to climate change. The remarks were made when Moon reported South Korea's tighter emissions goal in front of some 100 world leaders at the annual UN gathering. Last month, the government decided to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent from 2018 levels by 2030, a sharp departure from its previous goal of 26.3 percent. Forestry cooperation was one of the key commitments made during an inter-Korean summit held in Pyongyang in September 2018. Under the joint declaration, the two Koreas agreed to work together to protect and restore the peninsula's ecosystem, with combating deforestation being the top priority. Four months later, the South Korean government set up a separate task force affiliated with the Korea Forest Service to carry out follow-up measures such as joint research on seedlings and disease prevention. Raising tensions further, Pyongyang blew up an inter-Korean liaison office last year in protest against the joint military drills between Seoul and Washington, cutting off all communications channels with the South unilaterally. Moon's renewed suggestion on forestry cooperation came amid the North's recent mixed signals of rapprochement and back-to-back missile tests. After months of unresponsiveness, North Korea agreed to reopen the severed inter-Korean hotlines in September and hinted at its intention to return to dialogue if certain conditions were met. (The hotlines were cut again briefly but were restored in October.) It remains to be seen how North Korea will respond to the renewed offers of forestry cooperation. The North has been lukewarm on a series of proposals made by Moon, such as humanitarian aid and a COVIID-19 partnership. Tackling deforestation is an urgent issue for North Korea. According to South Korea's National Institute of Forest Science, more than 70 percent of the country's terrain is mountains and forests and about 30 percent of that area is believed to be deforested. During the extreme food crisis in the 1990s, people cut down trees for fuel or to cultivate cropland. After decades of excessive logging, the North suffers from severe damage from flooding every year. Despite regular tree-planting campaigns, deforestation continues, making the floods worse. South Korea's Environment Minister Han Jeoung-ae, who is also in Glasgow, said that a possible forestry cooperation between the two Koreas would be a "win-win." "Of the 40 percent reduction goals, 5 percent is set to be achieved through overseas projects with developing countries. If the North joins the projects and reduces carbon emissions, it would be a win-win for both Koreas." In the meantime, two North Korean officials, including Choi Il, the North Korean ambassador to the UK, were spotted attending the Monday event. They briefly encountered Moon and South Korean officials but no direct contact was reportedly made. North Korea has attended the UN summit every year in an apparent move to be seen as a normal country that is interested in fighting climate change and other global challenges. In 2016, the country also announced its goal of cutting emissions by 8 percent by 2030 and said it could raise the goal to 40.25 percent if international support is given to build nuclear power plants and using renewable energy. In this year's UN report, the North raised the respective figures to 15.63 percent and 50.34 percent. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has said Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was a strong advocate of multilateralism and called the United Nations £s the centre of people's future hopes and aspirations.' On the very first day of Bangladesh's journey in the United Nations, Bangabandhu delivered his maiden speech to the UNGA on September 25, 1974. 'Our goal is self-reliance; our chosen path is the united and collective efforts of our people. International cooperation and the sharing of the resources and technology could, no doubt, make our task less onerous and reduce the cost in human suffering,' the Prime Minister quoted Bangabandhu as saying at the UNGA in 1974. He called for building a world to be free of economic inequalities, social injustice, aggression, and threats of nuclear war. 'These are as relevant today as they were forty-six years ago. As such, we continue to lend our voice and leadership to all those issues that aim to build an inclusive and equal society,' said the Prime Minister. She termed the current the year 2021 a very special year, noting that this year they are celebrating the Golden Jubilee of Independence. 'This celebration coincides with 'Mujib Year', the Birth Centenary of our Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.' The Prime Minister, while delivering her speech at the UNGA for the 17th time, paid her profound respect and homage to Father of our Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, whose selfless, lifelong struggle and visionary leadership brought us our long-cherished Independence. She also paid pay her deepest tribute to the valiant freedom fighters for their courage and sacrifices to free our motherland. Plantation of 47 Trees As a part of the celebration of Mujib Year and 47th Anniversary of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's historical speech in Bangla at the UN, the Bangladesh High Commission, Port Louis, Mauritius and the City Council of Port Louis, jointly planted 47 trees at Plaine Verte, Port Louis. Vice Prime Minister of the government of Mauritius and Minister of Local Government and Disaster Management, Mohammad Anwar Hasnu graced the occasion as the chief guest. Kavydass Ramano, Minister of Environment, Solid Waste Management and Climate Change was present as special guest. High Commissioner Rezina Ahmed paid her deepest tribute to the greatest Bengali of all time Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. She briefly elaborated the significance of the day and said it was a matter of great prides that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina alike her father addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations in Bangla. As the Chair of Climate Vulnerable Forum, Bangladesh along with CVF member countries has taken bold and far reaching initiatives to the adaptation to climate change and mitigating adverse effects. The High Commissioner has said that may these trees will grow with our good wishes and commitment to securing environmental resilience. Vice Prime Minister of the government of Mauritius Mohammad Anwar Hasnu highly appreciated the prosperous manoeuvre of the Mission of tree plantation programme in the memory of Bangabandhu, and said the environment of the park would be refreshing and revitalized with this great initiative. Kavidash Ramano highly commended the Bangladesh High Commission for organizing such an innovative programme like tree planting. The minister has mentioned that Mauritius is preparing for participating in COP26 and looking forward to the outcome of the conference. He added that the saplings would one day become full-fledged trees and thus will make the environment of the park more pleasant. \</doc>

Nov. 3 KARACHI(DAWN/ANN)  Karachi is exposed to all climate risks. World leaders gather in Glasgow, Scotland, for the COP26 meet, discussing ways to tackle the climate change threat, a phenomenon respecting no territorial boundaries. A country like Pakistan, contributing little to the global greenhouse gas load, is amongst the worst affected by climate change impacts. Cities stand at the forefront in the battle against climate change. They house the mass of humanity, and critical human activities contributing to climate alteration happen in the urban space. Cities aiming to become more resilient and reducing their carbon footprint, invest in preparing a Climate Change Adaptation Strategy. Pakistan, though rapidly urbanising, has unfortunately made no such progress. Karachi, our largest city, is exposed and vulnerable to impacts of all four possible climate change scenarios  flooding, drought, extreme heat events and sea level rise. The city needs a comprehensive Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, laying the groundwork for required action. Such a strategy accurately identifies the critical vulnerabilities of 'people' and £ssets' at possible risk and details the required action. Presently, Karachi's resiliency and capacity for adapting to climate change scenarios is severely compromised. If we consider 'flooding' then communi ties likely to be in the od hazard zone also fit the profile of enhanced vulnerability. These include residents of katchi abadis, hill settlements and low-lying localities. Critical assets such as industrial zones are at risk. Vulnerabilities can be accurately identified if probability is linked with establishing a flood risk zone.Vulnerability factors are combined to produce an index of od vulnerability and plotted using census data to map vulnerability. The absence of identified odplains for either the Maliror Lyari river basin make it difficult to establish a viable od risk zone for Karachi. Green spaces acting as filtration basins for rainwater thus reducing the potential inundation threat are fast vanishing. Karachi has faced serious droughts. From 1995 to 2003, water supply from the rain-fed Hub Dam was reduced to almost zero due to lack of rains. Droughts expose to risk our rural hinterland and the associated communities and livelihoods. Our water system is very stressed with a high supply and demand gap. The sole water provider, KWSB faces bankruptcy and has shown an inability for contingency planning by not initiating water conservancy measures or availing options such as waste-water recycling or recharging groundwater resources. The city has witnessed heatwaves at a cost. The data is insufficient to indicate how pervasive 'extreme heat' has become. Factors including unplanned densification, increasing automobile load and lack of vegetation can indicate the prevalence of the urban heat island effect but regular surface temperature mapping needs to be done to identify trends. Extreme heat leads to increased use of water and power, two services already stressed, with severer implications for the urban poor. Sea level rise and tidal flooding pose serious threats. Human settlements at high risk of exposure and vulnerability are fishing communities and the facilities sustaining their livelihoods. Critical installations of national importance are located along the coast. They include the Karachi harbour, fisheries, naval installations and Port Qasim Authority to name a few. Any disruption in their functions even for a day costs the nation billions of rupees. A road map for a strategy document has to start with working on probabilities and trends and translating them into physical jurisdictions  climate change risk zones. This requires investing in continuous research. Actions can be a mix of policy, institutional stren\£dgthening, strategic projects and financial investments. We need flood-risk zoning, regulations preventing housing and commercial development in risk zones, an urban forestation programme, replenishing groundwater reservoirs, prioritising public and non-motorised transport, strategic compact development and conservation practices  these are just a few in many steps that need to be taken. However, there is a fundamental challenge facing Karachi and that is an existing dysfunctional governance framework with substantial capacity deficits. The entity best suited to lead this effort in any city is the office of the mayor that for Karachi is struggling to remain relevant in the overall scheme of urban governance. The government can take the lead but the process has to be inclusive, creating a shared vision and strategically merging resources and competencies. The strategyis not an end in itself. This will be a living document, evolving as the science around it evolves, new technologies surface and governments and communities adapt to changing scenarios. We need to take the first step. We are already behind the clock. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

The COP26 concluded with ringing an alarm bell for the global demise of fossil fuel. Coal is in the ventilation unit while oil and gas are in the CCU and ICU respectively. It is only a matter of time, precisely by 2030, 2040 and 2050, when these fuels would be laid to rest making way for the renewable energy in the world. The recent developments in the world energy scenario have triggered serious tremor in the energy sector of most developing countries as well as in the middle-income ones. The global anxiety on the climate change and the need to contain the emission of greenhouse gases have shaken the energy world and coupled with the distortion in the energy demand and supply emanating from the two years of pandemic pushed the fossil fuel prices to an exorbitantly high level which is seen by many as the tip of ice-berg that may be ahead to bring the energy sector to a fathomless ocean of troubles. Bangladesh cannot be a case in isolation under such scenario. This is more so when the country has been relying on mono-fuel like natural gas for a long time for its electricity generation. Now with the fast-depleting natural gas and having no sign of discovering a new gas field of world standard and world leaders' summit on climate change declaring holy war on fossil fuels; paradigm shift from the coal, natural gas and oil to renewable energy sources is inevitable. Green energy project should be taken up without any loss of time for the incremental demand of electricity through harnessing offshore wind energy, pumped energy from river water, solar and other conceivable and implementable green sources of energy which need to be dovetailed with writing off the fossil fuel-based power stations. While different form of renewable sources of energy are being talked about as replacement of fuels, most of the sources are new for Bangladesh. As such detailed techno-economic feasibility study must be religiously undertaken for all the available options before jumping into the band wagon of renewable energy. The popular choice of renewable sources of energy are solar, wind, wave, small hydro, hydrogen, storage battery and nuclear. Many countries of the world are moving ahead with solar and wind while other sources are also getting attention and practiced by some circles. The choice is constrained by the availability of solar power, lands, speed of wind and other physical characteristics including but not limited to geographical location as well as terrain conditions. In Bangladesh till now Solar Home System has gained much popularity but sustainability of such mode of electricity may still be doubtful when examined from the point of view of long-term seamless supply of electricity. In fact, detailed techno-economic feasibility study is a must for all the renewable energy options available for consideration in Bangladesh before deciding on the type of sources that need to be taken up for meeting the electricity need after 2050. Needless to mention that the nature of renewable energy sources may not allow to replicate the process imported from other places without considering the local conditions. Small hydro may be an attractive choice for Bangladesh. Small hydro by definition is not the common dam-based hydroelectricity requiring high head of water, reservoir, dam and other water controlling mechanisms which may not always be environment friendly. Small hydro is related to harnessing energy from the water flow that moves from the glaciers to the sea. Globally water in the perineal rivers is used for many purposes though electricity generation from such flow is still to gain popularity. As the flowing water has some energy, it must be possible to use the same for electricity generation. Therefore, the basic principle in hydropower generation involves conversion of potential energy of river or stream water into electrical energy. The amount of hydropower that can be generated at a river site is directly proportional to the flow of water and the vertical elevation drop at the site. This indicates that an extensive hydrologic analysis is required, especially in the absence of significant flow monitoring data, to accurately estimate river flow. Two types of hydropower plants, namely the run-of-river type and the impoundment type plants have been extensively studied in many countries. The run-of-river type plant diverts a portion of the flow from the main channel through one or more turbines, and the impoundment type plant stores water in a reservoir system making more water available to run the turbine(s) for a longer period. The run-of-river type plant is suitable for small scale energy production and have less adverse impact to the environment and the population compared to the impoundment type systems. With the general success of large hydropower as the world's leading source of renewable energy, it is only reasonable that countries consider small hydro, that is run-of-river and development of energy from river flow as well. Large hydro dams are costly to build, and new facilities require extensive timelines for consultation, planning, environmental assessments and construction. In addition, most of the more favorable hydropower sites in Bangladesh like Kaptai, Shangu and other sites in Chittagong areas have been developed or in the process of development. Globally, an old technology with many recent innovations, small hydro is appealing for its reduced environmental impacts, potentially cheaper development, and plentiful prospective sites. Although not yet cost comparable to large hydro, small hydro is still capable of yielding lower costs per kWh than some other sources. Small hydro is likely to gain a stronger presence in coming years if research and development (R and D) becomes more of a priority. Small hydro as compared to rooftop solar has enormous potential as there is no requirement of land which is hindering the solar and wind power addition. Unbelievable as it may appear, but the smallest of canals and distributaries those criss-crossed the country can contribute enormous amount of decentralized energy at a negligible cost. This yet-to-untapped asset can make up for the renewable energy shortfall being faced at present. Lift irrigation and piped irrigation water can irrigate vast stretches of parched fields. Trains of these micro power houses in the slow-moving man-made canals which are still untapped in our country can contribute enormous amount of renewable energy at a negligible cost. These small power houses are being rigorously investigated all over the world as they can be put up in the shortest possible time frame. The Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Meghna river systems in Bangladesh comprise one of the biggest combined catchment areas of the world and create the biggest Bengal basin. With the ever-increasing incidents of severe losses of landmass along with other assets into the mighty rivers, it is time to give serious thought on the way out for stopping the river bank erosion permanently and make use of the river water flow that meets the Bay of Bengal without any contribution to the energy needs of the country. Some of the approaches, among others, could be (i) making a high permanent embankment all the way from uppermost tip of Padma and Jamuna within the territory of Bangladesh up to the confluence of the rivers in the south before these stream meet the Bay of Bengal (ii) controlling the river flow through constructing barrage (iii) installation of a hydro electricity generation system in an around the barrage for supply of electricity to the people of Bangladesh and (iv) setting up close grid canals with small hydro power generation facilities all over the country taking the feed water from suitable points of the river protection embankments. These projects, related to control of river flow, should be able to erase river erosion problems for good and provide adequate electricity from small hydro power stations in the country. It is time that these projects' feasibilities are taken up for expeditious implementation. Uncontrolled flow of water in Padma and Jamuna leads to crisis for Bangladesh that needs to be controlled and converted into opportunities at the earliest. \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 15 -- India's economy, which contracted by 7.3 per cent due to the Covid-19 pandemic, is expected to grow by 9.5 per cent in 2021 and 8.5 per cent in 2022, according to the latest projections released by the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday. India's growth projection released by the latest World Economic Outlook remains unchanged from its previous WEO (World Economic Outlook) update of July this summer but is a three-percentage point in 2021 and 1.6 percentage point drop from its April projections, reports India Today. According to the latest WEO update, released ahead of the annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank, the world is expected to grow at 5.9 per cent in 2021 and 4.9 per cent in 2022. The United States is projected to grow at six per cent this year and 5.2 per cent the next year. China, on the other hand, the IMF said is projected to grow at 8 per cent in 2021 and 5.6 per cent in 2022, reports India Today. Gita Gopinath, Chief Economist of the IMF, said that compared to their July forecast, the global growth projection for 2021 has been revised down marginally to 5.9 per cent and is unchanged for 2022 at 4.9 per cent. However, this modest headline revision masks large downgrades for some countries. "The outlook for the low-income developing country group has darkened considerably due to worsening pandemic dynamics. The downgrade also reflects more difficult near-term prospects for the advanced economy group, in part due to supply disru India Todayons," she said. "Partially offsetting these changes, projections for some commodity exporters have been upgraded on the back of rising commodity prices. Pandemic-related disru India Today ons to contact-intensive sectors have caused the labour market recovery to significantly lag the output recovery in most countries," the Indian-American economist added. Observing that the dangerous divergence in economic prospects across countries remains a major concern, she said aggregate output for the advanced economy group is expected to regain its pre-pandemic trend path in 2022 and exceed it by 0.9 per cent in 2024, reports India Today. "By contrast, aggregate output for the emerging market and developing economy group (excluding China) is expected to remain 5.5 per cent below the pre-pandemic forecast in 2024, resulting in a larger setback to improvements in their living standards," she added. Noting that a principal common factor behind these complex challenges is the continued grip of the pandemic on global society, Gopinath said that the foremost policy priority is, therefore, to vaccinate at least 40 per cent of the population in every country by end-2021 and 70 per cent by mid-2022. "This will require high-income countries to fulfil existing vaccine dose donation pledges, coordinate with manufacturers to prioritise deliveries to COVAX in the near-term and remove trade restrictions on the flow of vaccines and their inputs," she said. At the same time, closing the USD 20 billion residual grant funding gap for testing, therapeutics and genomic surveillance will save lives now and keep vaccines fit for purpose. Looking ahead, vaccine manufacturers and high-income countries should support the expansion of regional production of Covid-19 vaccines in developing countries through financing and technology transfers, she said. Gopinath said that another urgent global priority is the need to slow the rise in global temperatures and contain the growing adverse effects of climate change. This will require more ambitious commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, reports India Today. "A policy strategy that includes an international carbon price floor adjusted to country circumstances, a green public investment and research subsidy push, and compensatory, targeted transfers to households can help advance the energy transition in an equitable way. Just as importantly, advanced countries need to deliver on their earlier promises of mobilising USD 100 billion of annual climate financing for developing countries," Gopinath said.

Jul. 9 Singapore (The Straits Times/ANN)- In the global quest to tackle climate change and the extinction of wildlife species, there are many opportunities for Singapore and the European Union to collaborate, such as in the areas of green finance and urban greening. These potential partnerships, which also include the research, development and deployment of low-carbon energy options, were a topic of discussion between European Commission executive vice-president Frans Timmermans and three Singapore ministers during a meeting on Thursday (July 8). Mr Teo Chee Hean, Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security and chair of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change, met Mr Timmermans with Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, and Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu. Mr Timmermans said in a statement that he is in Singapore to discuss climate change and biodiversity in the run-up to the United Nations' climate change conference, called COP26 , scheduled to take place in November in Glasgow. "During Covid-19, we have demanded a high degree of solidarity from our young generation," he said. "This should remind us that we owe it to our children and grandchildren to leave them decent living conditions on our planet. We must take decisive climate action and preserve biodiversity and the environment." The EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement provides a framework to advance the joint sustainability and development agenda, the statement said. "Singapore and the EU are committed to close cooperation in areas ranging from low-carbon energy technologies to carbon services and solutions," it added. Both the Republic and the EU have set prior environmental commitments. In February, for instance, the Republic announced the Singapore Green Plan 2030  a road map with sustainability targets that aims to help the country reach net zero emissions as soon as viable. The Republic also collaborates with other countries on climate change issues and provides training to developing countries on climate change and environment-related matters, said the statement, jointly issued by the EU in Singapore, Singapore's National Climate Change Secretariat, and the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment. As for the EU, it presented the European Green Deal in December 2019 as its growth strategy, bringing together environmental, economic and social sustainability. The deal combines financial and regulatory tools to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, boost the efficient use of resources by moving to a clean, circular economy, and restore nature and biodiversity. The EU aims to reach net zero emissions by 2050. "I believe that we now all have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to use the singular fiscal efforts to recover from the pandemic to 'build back better'. We stand ready to work with Singapore to this end," he added. "Singapore is a strong supporter of global climate action and is committed to working with all parties, including the EU, for a successful outcome at COP26 ," she added.

The global climate crisis is destroying the human rights of those least responsible for the same, according to a British newspaper report co-authored by Bangladesh Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen. "There is no time to lose. The longer we delay action to support people who are vulnerable to climate breakdown, the worse the consequences are likely to be, making responses even more complex and costly," Dr Momen and Patrick Verkooijen wrote in 'The Guardian'. Patrick Verkooijen is the CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation, while Bangladesh is presiding over the Climate Vulnerable Forum this year. Quoting UNHCR prediction that the number of climate refugees and displaced people could reach 200 million a year by 2050 -- nearly double the number than that of today, the authors called on the United Nations to urgently appoint a special rapporteur on climate change and human rights "to galvanise action on the biggest threat to fundamental freedoms". "The special rapporteur will have a duty to witness the impact of climate breakdown on human rights first-hand, visiting countries affected by climate disasters and galvanizing action across the family of UN organisations and the wider public sphere." The UN's top scientists warned in August that "even if we were to succeed in reining in emissions, we still face many decades of climate disruption because of the greenhouse gases that are already trapped in the atmosphere". "This decision to appoint a UN special envoy on climate and human rights is long overdue. The UN Human Rights Council, currently in session, could take this decision now," Dr Momen and Verkooijen wrote. This is precisely what the CVF has called for in its manifesto for Cop26 . By doing so, the authors said the Council would demonstrate that UN bodies can take decisive climate measures, a much-needed positive impulse for the Glasgow summit on which our planet's fate hinges. "That move is also the international community's strongest signal it is prepared to staunch the climate emergency's hemorrhaging of human rights. We sincerely hope it will," they wrote. Two million people have died as a result of a five-fold increase in weather-related disasters in our lifetimes, according to the write-up. "And given that 90% of these deaths have occurred in developing countries, which have contributed the least to global heating, the climate crisis is also making a mockery of the notion that we are all born equal - as the UN Declaration of Human Rights and numerous national constitutions assert." UNHCR estimates that 21.5 million people are displaced by climate change-related disasters every year - more than twice the number of those forced to flee conflict or violence, the authors said in their write-up. "The climate crisis is setting back the clock on human progress. More than two billion people live in countries with high exposure to climate-related hazards. "Their capacity to recover when disaster strikes is limited. And when those affected are refugees and displaced populations, the impact is simply heartbreaking," they wrote. When flooding and landslides struck the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh this summer, thousands of people relived the nightmare of losing everything and being displaced yet again. "We believe it's time to train the spotlight on the impact our climate emergency is having on human rights. It may sound obvious, but it is not happening," they wrote. \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 26 -- World business leaders want the upcoming United Nations climate summit to resolve issues that have so far hindered the use of carbon pricing to cut worldwide emissions, looking to boost the role that companies play in slowing global warming. Executives, trade groups and policy experts say hopes for a deal are growing after negotiators at the 2019 summit in Madrid failed to settle how countries can account for international carbon trading as called for under Article 6 of the Paris climate agreement, reports Reuters. A lack of international agreement has held back the development of systems for putting a price on carbon. Having some way to measure the economic cost of emissions is a top priority of companies across many industries whose leaders want to cut greenhouse gasses, said Rich Lesser, global chair of Boston Consulting Group. For executives, "if you had a global price on carbon, then it would be economically rational to pursue solutions and alternatives", Lesser said. Dan Byers, who will represent major trade group the US Chamber of Commerce at the summit in Glasgow, called the final resolution of Article 6 "long overdue" to resolve technical issues such as how countries can monitor and verify carbon emissions. He added that a factor favoring a deal is the climate focus of US President Joe Biden, who returned to the terms of the 2015 Paris climate agreement after predecessor Donald Trump pulled out of the accord. "Having the Biden administration backing Paris, and at the table, is hugely important over the long run," Byers said. Other issues that business leaders will track at the meeting starting Oct 31 include what new pledges national leaders might make to cut emissions, and how much money will be set aside to finance sustainable development in emerging markets. Carbon pricing plans can range widely including carbon taxes that charge companies for emissions, or emissions trading markets that cap how much companies or countries can emit but allow them to trade permits to exceed those levels. Many corporations expect carbon pricing plans will help them fulfill the now widespread "Net Zero" pledges, said Kelley Kizzier, a vice-president at the Environmental Defense Fund, a Washington advocacy group, and a onetime co-chair of the negotiating group over Article 6 at previous climate summits. Specific issues to resolve in Glasgow for Article 6 include how to prevent two countries counting the same emissions cut, and how new carbon markets might help fund developing countries' efforts to adapt to climate change, she said. Even if a deal is reached, companies will still be left with the work of cutting their emissions, she added. Just because a goal is set, "It's not rainbows and butterflies," Kizzier said. DIVISIONS REMAIN Beyond carbon pricing, leaders are more divided on other topics that will be center stage in Glasgow such as the future role of fossil fuels in the world economy. For instance, an investor group including PIMCO, State Street Corp and French asset manager Amundi has called on countries to take steps including raising their emissions-reduction commitments and ending fossil subsidies, and there have been separate calls for international banks to stop funding fossil fuel projects. But energy executives say fossil fuels still have a role to play in the energy transition. New natural gas facilities in emerging markets would produce fewer emissions compared with existing coal-fired generation, said Aaron Padilla, a policy director for the American Petroleum Institute, whose members include big energy companies ExxonMobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell and Norway's Equinor. "There's still significant room for natural gas especially to displace coal as a source of production," Padilla said. Financial companies face their own pressures. Companies with a combined $90 trillion in assets known as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero have called for governments to set broad net-zero targets, for instance, and to price emissions. But the group includes banks that still back fossil fuel projects, drawing criticism that they and the alliance's chair, UN special envoy Mark Carney, are missing a chance to force harder action. Richard Brooks, climate finance director for the activist group Stand.earth, said more should follow the example of France's Banque Postale, which said it would stop serving the oil and gas sectors outright by 2030. "Many of the banks who are part of the alliance are getting kudos and green cover but not changing their day-to-day financial practices," Brooks said. Asked about the criticism, Carney said in an emailed statement that member banks must set interim 2030 carbon reduction targets and decarbonization plans. "GFANZ has launched an ambitious body of work to accelerate implementation and action, which will be outlined at COP26 ," he said.

Climate-related disasters have affected the lives of at least 139.2 million people and killed more than 17,242 since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, says a new global analysis. The analysis is published by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, on the compound impacts of extreme-weather events and COVID-19. Through new data and specific case studies, the report shows how people across the world are facing multiple crises and coping with overlapping vulnerabilities. The paper also highlights the need of addressing both crises simultaneously as the COVID-19 pandemic has affected livelihoods across the world and has made communities more vulnerable to climate risks. Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the globe are not only responding to those overlapping crises but also helping communities to prepare and anticipate climate risks. In Bangladesh for instance, the Red Crescent Society has used IFRC's designated funds for anticipatory action to disseminate flood related Early Warning Messages through loudspeakers in vulnerable areas so people can take the necessary measures or evacuate if necessary. The IFRC President, Francesco Rocca, who presented the new report at a press conference in New York said the world is facing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis where the climate change and COVID-19 are pushing communities to their limits. In the lead up to COP26 , we urge world leaders to take immediate action not only to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but also to address the existent and imminent humanitarian impacts of climate change'. The report comes a year after an initial analysis of the overlapping risks of extreme-weather events that have occurred during the COVID-19 crisis. The pandemic continues to wreak havoc, with direct health impacts for millions of people around the world, but also a massive indirect impact, in part due to the response measures implemented to contain the pandemic. Health systems are pushed to their limits and the most vulnerable have been the most exposed to overlapping shocks. In Afghanistan, the impacts of the extreme drought are compounded by conflict and COVID-19. The drought has crippled agricultural food production and diminished livestock, leaving millions of people hungry and malnourished. The Afghan Red Crescent Society has ramped up relief, including food and cash assistance for people to buy food supplies, plant drought-resistant food crops and protect their livestock. Julie Arrighi, associate director at the RCRC Climate Center said: 'Hazards do not need to become disasters. We can counter the trend of rising risks and save lives if we change how we anticipate crises, fund early action and risk reduction at the local level. Finally, we need to help communities become more resilient, especially in the most vulnerable contexts.' The COVID-19 pandemic has had a lasting impact on climate risks. Governments need to commit to investing in community adaptation, anticipation systems and local actors. 'The massive spending in COVID-19 recovery proves that governments can act fast and drastically in the face of global threats. It is time to turn words into action and devote the same energy to the climate crisis. Every day, we are witnessing the impact of human-made climate change. The climate crisis is here, and we need to act now,' Rocca said. \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 9 -- The jury is still out on whether world leaders are ready to turn words into actions at COP26 . At stake is life as we've known it for millennia. The recent IPCC report is unequivocal. Many of the climatic changes we are seeing around us are irreversible. We can still avert the worst-case scenarios with ambitious and dedicated decarbonisation measures, but more extreme weather events and persistent environmental stress are now inevitable. The bad news is that no country is really prepared. The pandemic could have been met with a coordinated global response, to preserve lives and livelihoods, but instead revealed the frailty of global governance. As a consequence, health systems are again under stress in several countries and economic recovery is pushing parts of the world further behind, threatening to preserve and intensify the deep divisions in our world and undermining resilience to future shocks. Far from building back better, this type of response ushers in a new normal of recurring and reinforcing health, environmental and economic crises. The good news is that we still have time to change. The pandemic has been a brutal learning experience, but we can use it to build a different future. In the Trade and Development Report (TDR) 2021, UNCTAD calls for more effort on climate adaptation and a transformative approach based on scaling up public investment to adapt to existing and future threats and to leverage private investment towards sustainable development, green industrial policies to diversify economies and create good jobs, and a new vision of multilateral cooperation to empower that approach. The last 50 years have seen a surge in natural disasters that has hit all regions, but its economic impacts have been very uneven. Low-income countries have suffered losses that are three times greater, relative to the size of their economies, than high-income countries. Persistent inaction has been costly with estimated adaptation costs for developing countries rising sharply over the last decade. Economic and climate shocks are compounding each other, locking developing countries into an eco-development trap of repeated disruption, economic precarity and debt dependency. The greater the rise in global temperatures, the greater the damage inflicted. With underfunded health care systems, weak infrastructure, undiversified economies and ever-shrinking policy space, these countries are more exposed not only to large-scale environmental shocks but also a more permanent state of economic stress. Prevailing policy prescriptions provide, at best, only partial relief and tend to a one-size-fits-all approach: strengthen resilience by improving data gathering and risk assessment and by providing temporary financial support when shocks materialise. But this approach ignores the systemic nature of climate change, the unpredictability of natural disasters, and their reinforcing vicious development cycles. Our report shows that adaptation is less a matter of risk management and more one of development planning. Risk management measures do not change the structures that leave developing countries in a state of permanent vulnerability, a more forward-looking strategy for economic transformation is needed. Proposed market-based mechanisms and de-risking strategies may provide some temporary benefits but offer no guarantees that change will take place on the necessary scale and timeline. The safest option is, instead, a climate retrofit of the state, empowered to implement green industrial policies, to leverage private green finance through better regulations and enhanced coordination and working with public banks to support investments for development. But it will take more than these national-level efforts to make lasting progress. At COP this year, we need to see the green shoots of a new global governance regime that is ready to move beyond aspirational speeches and deliver visionary leadership. Currently, the internationally agreed target of climate finance to be provided by developed countries for developing countries is $100 billion per year by 2020, now pushed to 2023, but new estimates show we can no longer pretend it is sufficient. The first-ever UNFCCC needs assessment of developing countries to implement climate plans recently put the cost closer to a cumulative $6 trillion by 2030, while previous UNCTAD reports estimate that $2.5 trillion per year, over the next two decades, is the necessary investment target for securing Paris Agreement commitments, with one third for adaptation purposes. Fortunately, we have options, and if there is one thing the pandemic has taught us, it's that advanced countries face very loose financial constraints, free as they are to borrow in their own currency, at historically low-interest rates and over long periods. They can finance ambitious public investment programmes at home and abroad. To start, G7 countries can meet the 0.7 per cent Official Development Assistance (ODA) target missed in 2020, providing an additional $155 billion. Redistributing Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) and planning for bigger allocations could see another liquidity boost in the hundreds of billions for developmental ambitions. Debt relief will also be necessary, particularly for climate-vulnerable countries, to guard against resources being siphoned into unsustainable debt servicing that forecloses adequate response to existing and future climate impacts. Grants and concessional financing from multilateral development banks can be scaled up for adaptation and well-regulated green bond markets can form an important part of the financing mix. Stabilising the climate and rebalancing the world economy is within our power: it is a matter of conviction, will and leadership. In a matter of days, we will negotiate the future our children and grandchildren will inherit. If we get it right, Glasgow will be remembered as the place where we stopped stalling and started transforming.

Nov. 9 SINGAPORE(Straits Times/ANN)  Two new public artificial intelligence (AI) programmes have been launched as part of the Republic's strategy to use the technology to effect social and economic good. These come as Singapore allocates an additional $180 million to accelerate AI research, on top of the $500 million it has committed to it so far. The first programme is the National AI Programme in Finance. It includes an industry-wide AI platform  dubbed NovA!  which generates insights about financial risks. NovA! is a collaboration between Singapore-based banks and local fintech firms, and aims to help financial institutions better assess companies' environmental impact and identify emerging environmental risks. More than 450 firms in the global financial industry at Glasgow's COP26 climate change conference last week committed to align over US$130 trillion worth of assets under their control with a net-zero emissions target by 2050. NovA! was unveiled by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat at the sixth edition of the Singapore FinTech Festival x Singapore Week of Innovation and Technology on Monday (Nov 8). He launched Singapore's national AI strategy at the 2019 version of the flagship fintech and innovation event. Singapore has five national AI programmes, noted Mr Heng, among them Selena+, an AI system under the healthcare programme that detects major eye conditions from retinal scans. "Selena+ managed to achieve a similar diagnostic accuracy as experienced human graders. We have since rolled this project out nationwide, to screen seniors and diabetic patients for eye diseases more efficiently. This has allowed us to provide early intervention more quickly and accurately," said Mr Heng. The second AI programme that was launched on Monday is the National AI Programme in Government, which aims to improve the delivery of public sector services. "One area is in the use of AI text analytics for better sense-making of the large amount of feedback that our front-line agencies receive each year. This will allow us to better understand the pain points and serve citizens better," said Mr Heng. AI will also be used to improve job-matching on the national jobs portal, MyCareersFuture, he added. "This is particularly salient during the pandemic, where many have been displaced and are looking to switch to other industries. We are using AI to develop more personalised jobs and skills recommendations. Based on our pilot, this new tool has improved total job placements by 20 per cent." The Government Technology Agency, or GovTech, is developing JumpStart, an AI-enabled platform with recommendation engines to complement career coaches. Jobseekers can access JumpStart's recommendations from a range of Government products, including the MyCareersFuture portal. The platform has facilitated more than 2,000 job placements so far. Mr Heng added that Singapore's AI strategy also involves building a vibrant ecosystem for sustained innovation and a strong commitment to AI research and development (R&D). He said the Republic will invest more funds in resource-efficient AI: "As a small country, our datasets are also small. So we need to better train our machines to learn from small but high-quality datasets. "Our investment in AI R&D is not large relative to global investments in this field. But by focusing on where we can make the greatest impact, we can make every effort count." It is also critical for various stakeholders to work together, he said. "This is a common thread that runs through our national AI Strategy, as we seek to apply AI widely and invest systematically." Mr Heng noted that the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the pace of change of science and technology. Singapore can maximise the impact of innovation in a time of rapid change by building momentum around technologies that can yield a step change and apply them widely, he said. It must also create the right market factors for innovation to scale, and double down on ensuring that innovation improves lives, he added. He noted that Singapore is contributing to the ethical use of AI in various ways and one example is Veritas  a framework for financial institutions to ensure that their use of AI and data analytics is fair, ethical, accountable and transparent. The Republic will also launch eGiro on Monday. Giro is a direct debit mechanism that allows an individual to set up a standing instruction for a billing organisation to make deductions from his or her bank account.

Bangladesh has demanded preferential trade facilities from Canada till 2030 to help the country tide over the post-pandemic challenges. Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen held a virtual meeting with Canadian Minister of International Development Karina Gould on Wednesday and made the request. They expressed optimism regarding the co-chairmanship of Bangladesh and Canada in the preparatory process of the upcoming 5th UN Conference on Least Developed Countries (LDC-5) to be held in Doha in January next year. On climate change, Foreign Minister Momen sought Canada's support in COP26 in terms of realising the demand that each country must implement their respective nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Bangladesh has taken various adaptation and mitigation measures, including the 'Mujib Prosperity Plan' envisaging using renewable energy to meet 40% of its energy needs. Momen also urged Canada to consider providing financial assistance to the regional Global Adaptation Centre (GAC) established in Bangladesh in order to effectively address climate change through adaptation measures in the region. The Canadian Minister appreciated Bangladesh's decision not to build any more coal-based power plants, citing climate change risks as an existential threat for the globe. She concluded by underscoring that Canada remains committed to work with Bangladesh, including on Rohingya, climate change and LDC issues. She also expressed optimism that she would be able to visit Bangladesh in person in near future on a request from Momen. The Foreign Minister also reiterated Bangladesh's strong expectation that Nur Chowdhury, the convicted killer of the Father of the Nation, would be sent back to Bangladesh, underscoring that this would ensure justice and the rule of law. Canadian Minister Karina Gould congratulated Bangladesh on the occasion of the birth centenary of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the Golden Jubilee of Independence. She stated that the co-chairmanship of both countries in the preparatory process of the LDC-5 Conference is a good opportunity to work together. Expressing Bangladesh's appreciation to the important message of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the occasion of the birth centenary of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the Golden Jubilee of the Independence, Foreign Minister Momen said the bilateral ties between the two countries "continue to remain very strong". \</doc>

Nov. 1 Dhaka(The Daily Star/ANN)- Bangladesh can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 21.85 percent by 2030 if provided with $175.9 billion as the country joins in the efforts to keep alive a target of capping global warming at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and avert a climate disaster. If things go on as usual, Bangladesh will emit about 409.4 million tonnes (MtCO2e) in 2030. But it can be brought down to 319.94 million tonnes with internal imitative measures and external help, it said in its updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC). For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. The NDC will be submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ahead of COP26 , where about 200 countries will highlight their plans to slash emissions by 2030 as agreed in the Paris Agreement in 2015 as part of the efforts to keep global warming well below 2C above pre-industrial levels. In the NDCs, Bangladesh details two types of plans for mitigation: unconditional and conditional. In the unconditional part of NDC, only those mitigation measures were considered that would be implemented based on current local-level capacity and financed through internal resources. The conditional emission reduction will be implemented based on international funding and technological support. In the unconditional scenario, GHG emissions would be brought down by 27.56 Mt CO2e (6.73 percent) below business-as-usual (BAU) in 2030 in the respective sectors. For that, the country will have to fork out $32.25 billion over ten years. In the conditional scenario, GHG emissions would be reduced by 61.9 Mt CO2e (15.12 percent) below BAU in 2030 in the respective sectors and for that Bangladesh needs an additional $143.67 billion. To bring down emissions in Bangladesh by 21.85 percent, the highest amount of investment is required in the energy and transport sectors: $168.27 billion. With the financing, the country will implement renewable energy projects of 4,114.3 megawatts, use improved technology for power generation from coal (as 12,147 MW), install a new combined cycle gas-based power plant (5,613 MW), improve the efficiency of existing gas turbine power plant (570 MW) and install prepaid meters and bring down total transmission and distribution losses to a single digit by 2030. Electric buses would be rolled out in major cities, and a charging station network would be established. Besides, the money will be sent on the improvement of road traffic congestion (15 percent improvement in fuel efficiency), widening of roads (two- to four-lane) and improving the road quality, construction of non-motorised transport and bicycle lanes, introducing electronic road pricing or congestion charging, reducing private cars and encouraging electric and hybrid vehicle use. The industry subsector's target would be to achieve 20 percent energy efficiency through measures according to the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Master Plan (EECMP). It will also promote green industry and carbon financing. The agriculture and forestry sectors need a total of $3.27 billion from both sources. The money in the agriculture sector will be needed for the reduction of methane emission reduction from rice fields with Upscaling Alternate Wetting and Drying in dry season rice fields in 100,000 hectares of croplands and rice varietal improvement for 2,129,000 hectares of croplands. The funds will also be spent on 627,000 hectares of cropland management (leaf colour chart, soil test based fertiliser application, less tillage barn management etc.), improvement of fertiliser management (deep placement of urea in rice field, training, awareness) in 150,000 hectares, bringing more area under pulse cultivation among others. In the forestry sector, the fund will be used to reduce deforestation, introduce reforestation/afforestation initiatives, measures for forest restoration and maintain forest and tree cover The waste sector needs about $4.3 billion for improving municipal solid waste management, ensuring the 3R (Reduce-Reuse-Recycle) principle for waste management and improvement of sewerage treatment. "The initiatives in the NDC are positive," Khondaker Golam Moazzem, research director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue, told The Daily Star. But the government is not solely responsible for implementing those, he said, adding that participation from the private sector is needed as well. "Globally, the private sector showed interest in mitigation measures." The commitment from the developed countries and global companies that they will invest in some bankable projects such as electric bus and car manufacturing is also important, he added. The developed countries, especially the G-20 countries, must take an active lead in all global initiatives to tackle climate change, said Md. Shahab Uddin, minister for environment, forest and climate change ministry, which prepared the NDCs. The world leaders need to work on a long-term plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he said, while calling on the Green Climate Fund and Global Environment Facility to address the existing problems so that the developing countries can receive $100 billion a year in aid under the Paris Climate Agreement. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 9 -- We are all aware that the climate is changing and the extraordinary impact this is having on nations and their policy considerations is clear. The latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis, predicts that the global mean sea level will continue to rise over the 21st century. Even under large net negative CO2 emissions, it would take several centuries or more for global mean sea level to reverse course. What this means for coastal nations around the world is also well known by now - increased flooding, storm surges, salinization, and land loss. No countries will experience these impacts more dramatically than Pacific Island states. And among them, low-lying atoll countries are at the most extreme risk - facing land loss, the inundation of islands, existential questions about access to vital resources, and even the possibility of becoming wholly uninhabitable. And it is now clear that we cannot simply engineer a way out of this. Conventional adaptation options - such as climate-proofing infrastructure, constructing seawalls and supporting natural mangrove ecosystems - are all important for the success of short- and medium-term adaptation, however they will not be sufficient in the long-term and in the face of already rising seas. The pace and nature of change is unprecedented; and with this comes unprecedented legal and policy considerations. It is with this in mind that the World Bank's new report, Legal Dimensions of Sea Level Rise: Pacific Perspectives, was produced. In writing the Legal Dimensions of Sea Level Rise report, we aimed to address critical questions for policymakers such as: What are the legal implications of changes in coastal baselines? Why does this matter? Will countries shrink or disappear? How might a state defend its existing territorial and maritime resource access entitlements in accordance with international law, particularly if coastlines change? What are the legal implications of an island state becoming uninhabitable? Building on an earlier World Bank Working Paper on the Maritime Right of Coastal States, the report aims to address these and other unprecedented legal and policy questions, and presents the latest developments in relevant international law. Our research found that while there exists a range of legal and policy tools that island states could use to protect their maritime entitlements, addressing sea level rise impacts will also require re-examination of the current paradigms of international law. For example, the question of how measurements that determine territorial rights and rights of resource access are approached is a significant one. As highlighted in the report, the wording of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea allows for two different interpretations to determine the baseline of a country's territory - one of which would 'fix' these measurements, and the other would shift as coastlines shift, and as a result, would change as sea levels rise. Issues such as these play a crucial role in determining a state's maritime claims and borders and may ultimately determine a state's survival. Those interested in the legal and existential challenges sea level rise poses to coastal, small island and atoll states will likely find value in the report. The issues are wide ranging and vitally important, covering maritime zones, resources access, human mobility and resilience building. And as we move towards COP26 , we hope the Legal Dimensions of Sea Level Rise report proves useful to those doing the important work of determining future policy in the face of this threat. The report "Legal Dimensions of Sea Level Rise: Pacific Perspective" authored by David Freestone and Duygu Cicek was prepared as a collaboration between the Environment and International Law Practice Group (LEGEN) and the Building Resilience in Pacific Atoll Island Countries Study task team (GPURL) with financing from the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR).

Dhaka, Nov. 14 -- UN climate talks ended Saturday with a deal that for the first time targeted fossil fuels as the key driver of global warming, even as coal-reliant countries lobbed last-minute objections. While the agreement won applause for keeping alive the hope of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius, many of the nearly 200 national delegations wished they'd come away with more, reports Reuters. "If it's a good negotiation, all the parties are uncomfortable," US climate envoy John Kerry said in the final meeting to approve the Glasgow Climate Pact. "And this has been, I think, a good negotiation." The two-week conference in Scotland delivered a major win in resolving the rules around carbon markets, but it did little to assuage vulnerable countries' concerns about long-promised climate financing from rich nations. The British COP26 There was last-minute drama as India, backed by China and other coal-dependent developing nations, rejected a clause calling for the "phase out" of coal-fired power. After a huddle between the envoys from China, India, the United States and European Union, the clause was hurriedly amended to ask countries to "phase down" their coal use. India's environment and climate minister, Bhupender Yadav, said the revision reflected the "national circumstances of emerging economies." "We are becoming the voice of the developing countries," he told Reuters, saying the pact had "singled out" coal but kept quiet about oil and natural gas. "We made our effort to make a consensus that is reasonable for developing countries and reasonable for climate justice," he said, alluding to the fact that rich nations historically have emitted the largest share of greenhouse gases. The single-word change was met with dismay by both rich countries in Europe and small island nations along with others still developing. "We believe we have been side-lined in a non-transparent and non-inclusive process," Mexico's envoy Camila Isabel Zepeda Lizama said. "We all have remaining concerns but were told we could not reopen the text . while others can still ask to water down their promises." But Mexico and others said they would let the revised agreement stand. "The approved texts are a compromise," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. "They reflect the interests, the conditions, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today." CARBON MARKET BREAKTHROUGH Reaching a deal was always a matter of balancing the demands of climate-vulnerable nations, big industrial powers, and those like India and China depending on fossil fuels to lift their economies and populations out of poverty. Sharma's voice broke with emotion in response to vulnerable nations' expressing anger over the last-minute changes. "I apologise for the way this process has unfolded," he told the assembly. "I am deeply sorry." The overarching aim he had set for the conference was one that climate campaigners and vulnerable countries said was too modest - to "keep alive" the 2015 Paris Agreement's target to keep global temperatures from rising beyond 1.5C (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. Scientists say warming beyond this point could unleash irreversible and uncontrollable climate impacts. In asking nations to set tougher targets by next year for cutting climate-warming emissions, the agreement effectively acknowledged that commitments were still inadequate. National pledges currently have the world on track for about 2.4C of warming. The talks also led to a breakthrough in resolving rules for covering government-led markets for carbon offsets. Companies and countries with vast forest cover had pushed hard for a deal, in hopes also of legitimising the fast-growing global voluntary offset markets. The deal allows countries to partially meet their climate targets by buying offset credits representing emission cuts by others, potentially unlocks trillions of dollars for protecting forests, expanding renewable energy and other projects to combat climate change. 'THE ERA OF COAL IS ENDING' Jennifer Morgan, executive director of the campaign group Greenpeace, saw the glass as half-full. "They changed a word but they can't change the signal coming out of this COP, that the era of coal is ending," she said. "If you're a coal company executive, this COP saw a bad outcome." Developing countries argue rich nations, whose historical emissions are largely responsible for warming the planet, must finance their efforts both to transition away from fossil fuels and to adapt to increasingly severe climate impacts. The deal offered a promise to double adaptation finance by 2025 from 2019, but again no guarantees. A U.N. committee will report next year on progress towards delivering the $100 billion per year in promised climate funding, after rich nations failed to deliver on a 2020 deadline for the funds. Finance will then be discussed again 2024 and 2026. But the deal left many vulnerable nations despondent in offering no funding for climate-linked losses and damages, a promise made in the original pact called the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992. While Glasgow agreement laid out a pathway for addressing the issue by establishing a new secretariat dedicated to the issue, vulnerable countries said that represented a bare minimum of acceptability. "This package is not perfect. The coal change and a weak outcome on loss and damage are blows," said Tina Stee, climate envoy from the Marshall Islands. Still, "elements of the Glasgow Package are a lifeline for my country. We must not discount the crucial wins covered in this package."

Nov. 11 Dhaka(The Daily Star/ANN)- To cap Bangladesh's golden decade of development marking an amazing turnaround story, the government, led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, has introduced a global award with UNESCO to recognize contributions to "Creative Economy". The award takes the Bangladesh success story to the global stage and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is set to hand over the prize at a ceremony in Paris on Thursday. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. The Prime Minister will also deliver her remarks before announcing the winner's name and handing over the prize. PM Hasina's presence at the first award-giving ceremony coincides with the Golden Jubilee of Bangladesh's Independence. Audrey Azoulay, who was re-elected on Tuesday to the post of Director-General of UNESCO with the massive support of the Organization's 193 Member States, will deliver welcome remarks at the function, said an official. MoTIV, a Uganda-based integrated creative studio was named the winner of the first edition of the "UNESCO-Bangladesh Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman International Prize for the Creative Economy," the official told UNB. The laureate was selected by Audrey Azoulay, UNESCO Director-General, on the recommendation of an international jury established for the prize. The US $50,000 Prize is awarded on a biennial basis, initially for three iterations of the Prize. The first award ceremony will be held on the occasion of UNESCO's 41st General Conference and subsequent award ceremonies will be held on the occasion of the Conference of Parties to the 2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions. Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen said the UNESCO-Bangabandhu award will help spread the ideology of Bangabandhu globally with further internationalisation of his work, life and achievements. "Bangladesh and Bangabandhu are one and unique which was reflected in the name of the award. This award will play a role in branding Bangladesh and boosting its image globally," he said. "We all are very proud that a UN Agency has introduced an award in the name of Bangabandhu for the first time," Dr Momen said. "UNESCO agreeing to institute the prize at the initiative of the Bangladesh government is significant. It rips apart the narrative of Hasina's detractors that much of Bangladesh's development claims are hot air," said Sukharanjan Dasgupta, who has followed the Bangladesh story since the 1971 Liberation War. Dasgupta, known for his book " Midnight Massacre" on the 1975 Bangladesh coup, says Hasina as Prime Minister has turned her father Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's " Sonar Bangla" (Golden Bengal) dream into a reality. Now getting UNESCO to jointly institute a prize for Creative Economy in her father's name is something that will make all Bangladeshis proud, he said. The BBC recently hailed Hasina as one of the top five global influential dealmakers at COP26 Summit at Glasgow and dubbed her as the "voice of the vulnerable". Then she received a warm welcome on her arrival in France. In September, Hasina addressed the biggest gathering of world leaders at the recently held UN general assembly in Bangla, following the legacy of her father who had delivered his first UNGA speech on September 25, 1974 in Bangla. Twenty-five years later, his daughter Sheikh Hasina, during her first tenure as the premier back in 1996, moved UNESCO, in 1999, to secure recognition for February 21 as International Mother Language Day. Bangabandhu secured global recognition for Bangla, currently the sixth most spoken language in the world and his daughter secured institutional recognition for Bangla, the only language to have produced a Nobel laureate in literature in South Asia. Bangabandhu's UNGA speech not only announced the birth of a new nation but one based on linguistic and cultural identity rather than religion. Much of Bangladesh's turnaround economic success from a "basket case" (Kissinger) to an 'emerging Asian Tiger' owes to anchoring the young nation-state on secular Bengali linguistic and cultural identity during Hasina's second tenure in power (Jan 2009 onwards). BBC credited Prime Minister Hasina with "putting a human face to the challenge of climate change". Columnist Ajoy Dasgupta says Hasina's success in creating an alternate model of governance focused on inclusive growth is also "rooted in the strength of Bengali culture" which prioritises humanism over religious radicalism. Two decades of military rule following the 1975 coup had derailed the values of the 1971 Liberation War but Hasina finally managed to restore that after assuming power in January 2009, he said. Winner MoTV The purpose of the UNESCO-Bangladesh Bangabandhu Prize is to recognise and reward exceptional initiatives of an individual, institution, an entity or non-governmental organization which/who, devised and delivered innovative projects or programmes that promote youth entrepreneurship in the area of creative economy. MoTIV was selected among 69 nominations submitted for the creative economy prize and will receive $50,000 USD in recognition of its innovative work to promote youth entrepreneurship in the creative economy. Located in Kampala, Uganda, MoTIV is an integrated creative studio that fosters collaboration in an impactful and sustainable way through providing tools and training. It works across different domains such as product and fashion design, helping entrepreneurs to refine and scale up their businesses. MoTIV has a design academy that provides learning opportunities for young innovators, designers, and business owners. The students are also paired with MoTIV mentors with professional experience who can provide guidance and best techniques and practices for their respective fields. The design community also has a very strong commitment to gender equality. The target engagement of women in each of MoTIV's projects is 70%. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Nov. 17\'e2\€  H\'c3\€ N\'e1\'bb I(Vietnam News/ANN) \'e2\€  Many factories, including about 200 contracted factories that make sportwear for Nike Corporation, resumed production in Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam earlier this month. However, if this return is to be resilient and long-lasting, a range of changes to business practices and relationships may have to be realised. Nobel Kinder, Sustainable Development Director of Nike Corporation, committed to continuing to invest and expand production in Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam when he met Prime Minister Ph\'e1\'ba\£1m Minh Ch\'c3\£dnh on the sidelines of the COP26 Conference in Glasgow, Scotland on November 2. As of November 1, as many as 1,324 of 1,412 enterprises in the export processing zones and industrial zones of HCM City have registered to resume operations. Of these, 216,000, or 88 per cent, of employees have returned to work. More than 83 per cent of businesses in C\'e1\'ba\£7n Th\'c6\£1 have also returned to production. As of November, 2,975 manufacturing enterprises have resumed operations. A representative from an industrial park in HCM City told local media that plants operated by Samsung Electronics and Intel will "provide assistance so that both companies' facilities will return to full production this month." B\'c3\'b9i T\'e1\'ba\£1 Ho\'c3\~ng V\'c5\£9, director of the Department of Industry and Trade, HCM City, told local media: "With the implementation of different solutions to support enterprises to restore production, the industrial production situation in the city has gradually improved." The October IIP index of H\'e1\'bb Ch\'c3\£d Minh City increased by 23.6 per cent compared to September, while the processing and manufacturing industry in October also increased by 19.7 per cent from the previous month. To continue to support businesses in restoring production, V\'c5\£9's department will strengthen connections between banks and businesses, provide each industry with preferential support packages, implement programs to stimulate investment, support enterprises in renewing machinery, equipment, and technology to improve product quality and increase trade promotions to support enterprises in expanding into domestic and export markets. Though similar actions have happened in most industrial parks around the country, local clusters, enterprises, and production facilities have faced difficulties in terms of raw material and labour costs. According to PwC, the spread of COVID-19 is still being felt globally across operations in ways that are difficult to model and assess. Supply chains in every country, including Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam, are affected. As the country has moved from crisis response to recovery, experts from PwC have encouraged local businesses to better prepare their supply chains for future shocks. According to the firm's survey in May, the supply chain of tomorrow no longer centres around efficiency and cost management but rather on building a secure and resilient supply chain that can handle changes in the relationship between employees and employers. Request to change corporate governance Nguy\'e1\'bb n Thanh M\'e1\'bb\'b9, chairman of Rynan Technologies Joint Stock Company, says that it is time for enterprises to introduce policies that allow for uncertain situations, that maintains production and does not disrupt supply chains. He told Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam News: "Enterprises need to adjust their pace with specific five-year and ten-year plans and an adjustable roadmap to fit any context." Many experts consider the business situation at present as long-lasting, adding that if enterprises want to rebuild as before, they must change themselves. A few months ago, they needed to fit with the new working method of three-one-site. Now that production activities have been restored, they are struggling to solve labour shortages and build a defence system against the risks of the next possible COVID-19 wave. In particular, to adapt to the new situation, enterprises must solve the problem of renewing business models and creating new cultures in factories and workshops, said the experts. Nguy\'e1\'bb n H\'c3\~ Trang, Human Resources Director of Pepsico Foods Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam, pointed out that, with empathy and concern, the company was able to preserve uninterrupted production and business activities. Trang told Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam News: "We always paid attention to employees so that nobody felt abandoned during the pandemic, so they can work with peace of mind and take care of their families." The firm set up health hotlines and gave welfare gifts to employees' homes, said Trang, adding the activities have not only helped employees overcome difficulties, but also demonstrated the corporate culture of solidarity, attachment and mutual support in corporate governance and operation. Nguy\'e1\'bb n Minh Tu\'e1\'ba\£5n, Human Resources Director for Southeast Asia of Avery Dennison RBIS Company, said most of the employees felt the inconvenience of not being able to go home in the pandemic. Understanding from the company leadership played an important role in giving great motivation to the employees in such a difficult time. As CEO of the human resource firm of Talentnet, Ti\'c3\£au Y\'e1\'ba\'bfn Trinh said that businesses will no longer operate like a machine, but will organise flexibly like a "living entity". Corporate governance methods should be operated in a circular model where the leader will easily cover all activities of the business by connecting, interacting and supporting all staff. Trinh said it would help eliminate unnecessary boundaries between leaders and employees, encouraging them to stay with the company. As an example, T\'c3\£2n \'c4\'e1\'bb Garment, with 18,000 workers, has launched a mobile app in October to connect all its employees from all nine factories in Th\'c3\£1i B\'c3\£cnh and H\'c6\'b0ng Y\'c3\£an provinces. Nguy\'e1\'bb n Ti\'e1\'ba\'bfn Ph\'c6\'b0\'c6\£1ng, chairman and CEO of T\'c3\£2n \'c4\'e1\'bb Garment Company, told Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam News: "The app is to help his workers get updates on the company's policies and to connect them as a family." As part of its long term and sustainable development plans, Ph\'c6\'b0\'c6\£1ng's firm has been recruiting local employees in Th\'c3\£1i B\'c3\£cnh to work in the plants in the province, so it does not have to face the issue of workers leaving in the crisis. \'e2\€  VNS ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Dhaka, Jan. 21 -- In two weeks' time, China will celebrate the advent of spring in the lunar new year, the Year of the Tiger. In Chinese culture, tiger symbolizes bravery and strength, as the Chinese people often refer to spirited dragon and dynamic tiger, or soaring dragon and leaping tiger. To meet the severe challenges facing humanity, we must "add wings to the tiger" and act with the courage and strength of the tiger to overcome all obstacles on our way forward. We must do everything necessary to clear the shadow of the pandemic and boost economic and social recovery and development, so that the sunshine of hope may light up the future of humanity. The world today is undergoing major changes unseen in a century. These changes, not limited to a particular moment, event, country or region, represent the profound and sweeping changes of our times. As changes of the times combine with the once-in-a-century pandemic, the world finds itself in a new period of turbulence and transformation. How to beat the pandemic and how to build the post-COVID world? These are major issues of common concern to people around the world. They are also major, urgent questions we must give answers to. As a Chinese saying goes, "The momentum of the world either flourishes or declines; the state of the world either progresses or regresses." The world is always developing through the movement of contradictions; without contradiction, nothing would exist. The history of humanity is a history of achieving growth by meeting various tests and of developing by overcoming various crises. We need to move forward by following the logic of historical progress, and develop by riding the tide of development of our times. Notwithstanding all vicissitudes, humanity will move on. We need to learn from comparing long history cycles, and see the change in things through the subtle and minute. We need to foster new opportunities amidst crises, open up new horizons on a shifting landscape, and pool great strength to go through difficulties and challenges. First, we need to embrace cooperation and jointly defeat the pandemic. Confronted by the once-in-a-century pandemic, which will affect the future of humanity, the international community has fought a tenacious battle. Facts have shown once again that amidst the raging torrents of a global crisis, countries are not riding separately in some 190 small boats, but are rather all in a giant ship on which our shared destiny hinges. Small boats may not survive a storm, but a giant ship is strong enough to brave a storm. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the international community, major progress has been made in the global fight against the pandemic. That said, the pandemic is proving a protracted one, resurging with more variants and spreading faster than before. It poses a serious threat to people's safety and health, and exerts a profound impact on the global economy. Strong confidence and cooperation represent the only right way to defeat the pandemic. Holding each other back or shifting blame would only cause needless delay in response and distract us from the overall objective. Countries need to strengthen international cooperation against COVID-19, carry out active cooperation on research and development of medicines, jointly build multiple lines of defense against the coronavirus, and speed up efforts to build a global community of health for all. Of particular importance is to fully leverage vaccines as a powerful weapon, ensure their equitable distribution, quicken vaccination and close the global immunization gap, so as to truly safeguard people's lives, health and livelihoods. China is a country that delivers on its promises. China has already sent over two billion doses of vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations. Still, China will provide another one billion doses to African countries, including 600 million doses as donation, and will also donate 150 million doses to ASEAN countries. Second, we need to resolve various risks and promote steady recovery of the world economy. The world economy is emerging from the depths, yet it still faces many constraints. The global industrial and supply chains have been disrupted. Commodity prices continue to rise. Energy supply remains tight. These risks compound one another and heighten the uncertainty about economic recovery. The global low inflation environment has notably changed, and the risks of inflation driven by multiple factors are surfacing. If major economies slam on the brakes or take a U-turn in their monetary policies, there would be serious negative spillovers. They would present challenges to global economic and financial stability, and developing countries would bear the brunt of it. In the context of ongoing COVID-19 response, we need to explore new drivers of economic growth, new modes of social life and new pathways for people-to-people exchange, in a bid to facilitate cross-border trade, keep industrial and supply chains secure and smooth, and promote steady and solid progress in global economic recovery. Economic globalization is the trend of the times. Though countercurrents are sure to exist in a river, none could stop it from flowing to the sea. Driving forces bolster the river's momentum, and resistance may yet enhance its flow. Despite the countercurrents and dangerous shoals along the way, economic globalization has never and will not veer off course. Countries around the world should uphold true multilateralism. We should remove barriers, not erect walls. We should open up, not close off. We should seek integration, not decoupling. This is the way to build an open world economy. We should guide reforms of the global governance system with the principle of fairness and justice, and uphold the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its center. We should make generally acceptable and effective rules for artificial intelligence and digital economy on the basis of full consultation, and create an open, just and non-discriminatory environment for scientific and technological innovation. This is the way to make economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all, and to fully unleash the vitality of the world economy. A common understanding among us is that to turn the world economy from crisis to recovery, it is imperative to strengthen macro-policy coordination. Major economies should see the world as one community, think in a more systematic way, increase policy transparency and information sharing, and coordinate the objectives, intensity and pace of fiscal and monetary policies, so as to prevent the world economy from plummeting again. Major developed countries should adopt responsible economic policies, manage policy spillovers, and avoid severe impacts on developing countries. International economic and financial institutions should play their constructive role to pool global consensus, enhance policy synergy and prevent systemic risks. Third, we need to bridge the development divide and revitalize global development. The process of global development is suffering from severe disruption, entailing more outstanding problems like a widening North-South gap, divergent recovery trajectories, development fault-lines and a technological divide. The Human Development Index has declined for the first time in 30 years. The world's poor population has increased by more than 100 million. Nearly 800 million people live in hunger. Difficulties are mounting in food security, education, employment, medicine, health and other areas important to people's livelihoods. Some developing countries have fallen back into poverty and instability due to the pandemic. Many in developed countries are also living through a hard time. No matter what difficulties may come our way, we must adhere to a people-centered philosophy of development, place development and livelihoods front and center in global macro-policies, realize the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and build greater synergy among existing mechanisms of development cooperation to promote balanced development worldwide. We need to uphold the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, promote international cooperation on climate change in the context of development, and implement the outcomes of COP26 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Developed economies should take the lead in honoring their emissions reduction responsibilities, deliver on their commitment of financial and technological support, and create the necessary conditions for developing countries to address climate change and achieve sustainable development. Last year, I put forward a Global Development Initiative at the UN General Assembly to draw international attention to the pressing challenges faced by developing countries. The Initiative is a public good open to the whole world, which aims to form synergy with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and boost common development across the world. China stands ready to work with all partners to jointly translate the Initiative into concrete actions and make sure that no country is left behind in this process. Fourth, we need to discard Cold War mentality and seek peaceful coexistence and win-win outcomes. Our world today is far from being tranquil; rhetorics that stoke hatred and prejudice abound. Acts of containment, suppression or confrontation arising thereof do all harm, not the least good, to world peace and security. History has proved time and again that confrontation does not solve problems; it only invites catastrophic consequences. Protectionism and unilateralism can protect no one; they ultimately hurt the interests of others as well as one's own. Even worse are the practices of hegemony and bullying, which run counter to the tide of history. Naturally, countries have divergences and disagreements between them. Yet a zero-sum approach that enlarges one's own gain at the expense of others will not help. Acts of single-mindedly building "exclusive yards with high walls" or "parallel systems", of enthusiastically putting together exclusive small circles or blocs that polarize the world, of overstretching the concept of national security to hold back economic and technological advances of other countries, and of fanning ideological antagonism and politicizing or weaponizing economic, scientific and technological issues, will gravely undercut international efforts to tackle common challenges. The right way forward for humanity is peaceful development and win-win cooperation. Different countries and civilizations may prosper together on the basis of respect for each other, and seek common ground and win-win outcomes by setting aside differences. We should follow the trend of history, work for a stable international order, advocate common values of humanity, and build a community with a shared future for mankind. We should choose dialogue over confrontation, inclusiveness over exclusion, and stand against all forms of unilateralism, protectionism, hegemony or power politics. Last year, the Communist Party of China (CPC) celebrated the 100th anniversary of its founding. Through a century of tenacious struggle, the CPC has rallied and led the Chinese people in accomplishing remarkable achievements in the advancement of the nation and betterment of people's lives. We have realized a moderately prosperous society in all respects and won the battle against poverty, both according to plan, and found a historic solution to ending absolute poverty. Now, China is marching on a new journey of building a modern socialist country in all respects. China will stay committed to pursuing high-quality development. The Chinese economy enjoys a good momentum overall. Last year, our GDP grew by around eight percent, achieving the dual target of fairly high growth and relatively low inflation. Shifts in the domestic and international economic environment have brought tremendous pressure, but the fundamentals of the Chinese economy, characterized by strong resilience, enormous potential and long-term sustainability, remain unchanged. We have every confidence in the future of China's economy. "The wealth of a country is measured by the abundance of its people." Thanks to considerable economic growth, the Chinese people are living much better lives. Nonetheless, we are soberly aware that to meet people's aspiration for an even better life, we still have much hard work to do in the long run. China has made it clear that we strive for more visible and substantive progress in the well-rounded development of individuals and the common prosperity of the entire population. We are working hard on all fronts to deliver this goal. The common prosperity we desire is not egalitarianism. To use an analogy, we will first make the pie bigger, and then divide it properly through reasonable institutional arrangements. As a rising tide lifts all boats, everyone will get a fair share from development, and development gains will benefit all our people in a more substantial and equitable way. China will stay committed to reform and opening-up. For China, reform and opening-up is always a work in process. Whatever change in the international landscape, China will always hold high the banner of reform and opening-up. China will continue to let the market play a decisive role in resource allocation, and see to it that the government better plays its role. We will be steadfast in consolidating and developing the public sector, just as we are steadfast in encouraging, supporting and guiding the development of the non-public sector. We will build a unified, open, competitive and orderly market system, where all businesses enjoy equal status before the law and have equal opportunities in the marketplace. All types of capital are welcome to operate in China in compliance with laws and regulations, and play a positive role for the development of the country. China will continue to expand high-standard opening-up, steadily advance institutional opening-up that covers rules, management and standards, deliver national treatment for foreign businesses, and promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. With the entry into force of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP) on 1 January this year, China will faithfully fulfill its obligations and deepen economic and trade ties with other RCEP parties. China will also continue to work for the joining of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA), with a view to further integrating into the regional and global economy and achieving mutual benefit and win-win results. China will stay committed to promoting ecological conservation. As I have said many times, we should never grow the economy at the cost of resource depletion and environmental degradation, which is like draining a pond to get fish; nor should we sacrifice growth to protect the environment, which is like climbing a tree to catch fish. Guided by our philosophy that clean waters and green mountains are just as valuable as gold and silver, China has carried out holistic conservation and systematic governance of its mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, lakes, grasslands and deserts. We do everything we can to conserve the ecological system, intensify pollution prevention and control, and improve the living and working environment for our people. China is now putting in place the world's largest national parks system. Last year, we successfully hosted COP15 to the Convention on Biological Diversity, contributing China's share to a clean and beautiful world. Achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality are the intrinsic requirements of China's own high-quality development and a solemn pledge to the international community. China will honor its word and keep working toward its goal. We have unveiled an Action Plan for Carbon Dioxide Peaking Before 2030, to be followed by implementation plans for specific sectors such as energy, industry and construction. China now has the world's biggest carbon market and biggest clean power generation system: the installed capacity of renewable energy has exceeded one billion kilowatts, and the construction of wind and photovoltaic power stations with a total installed capacity of 100 million kilowatts is well under way. Carbon peak and carbon neutrality cannot be realized overnight. Through solid and steady steps, China will pursue an orderly phase-down of traditional energy in the course of finding reliable substitution in new energy. This approach, which combines phasing out the old and bringing in the new, will ensure steady economic and social development. China will also actively engage in international cooperation on climate and jointly work for a complete transition to a greener economy and society. Davos is known as a heaven for winter sports. The Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games will open soon. We are confident that China will present a streamlined, safe and splendid Games to the world. The official motto for Beijing 2022 is "Together for a Shared Future". Indeed, let us join hands with full confidence, and work together for a shared future. Xi Jinping is the president of the People's Republic of China. This article is his message on the occasion of the 2022 Davos Agenda of the World Economic Forum (WEF).

Dhaka, Sept. 22 -- China's pledge to stop building coal-fired power plants overseas could cull $50 billion of investment as it slashes future carbon emissions, analysts said, although Beijing's own domestic coal programme is still propping up the dirty fossil fuel. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a pre-recorded address at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday that China would help developing countries build green energy production and halt construction of coal power plants abroad. China has been under international pressure to announce an end to overseas coal financing as part of its updated package of national climate pledges to be submitted to the United Nations. Beijing is the largest source of financing for coal power plants globally, and Xi's announcement will have a far-reaching impact on coal power expansion plans in countries like Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam and South Africa. The announcement could affect 44 coal plants earmarked for Chinese state financing, totalling $50 billion, according to Global Energy Monitor (GEM), a US think tank. That has the potential to reduce future carbon dioxide emissions by 200 million tonnes a year, GEM told Reuters. "China's announcement is one of the most significant developments on the climate front this year, as it may well mark the end of international public financing for coal plants," said GEM's coal program director, Christine Shearer. "We'll find many countries turning to alternative sources of power generation instead, and hopefully they are supported to ensure it's clean energy." Environmental groups also said it would force big coal financiers like the Bank of China, linked with 10 gigawatts of overseas coal power capacity, to draw up a timetable to withdraw from the sector. China's pledge followed similar moves by South Korea and Japan this year, turning off the taps of the last three major public financiers of overseas coal power plants. It came hours after US President Joe Biden vowed to double spending on helping developing nations deal with climate change, to $11.4 billion by 2024, as world leaders put down markers ahead of the COP26 United Nations climate change summit starting in November. "DOMESTIC COAL ADDICTION" Despite widespread optimism about Xi's announcement, his carefully worded statement revealed few details and left room for existing projects to continue. There are more than 20 Chinese financed coal-fired power units under construction in South Africa, Pakistan, Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe, Serbia and the United Arab Emirates, according to data from the Boston University Global Development Policy Centre. Another 17 are in the planning stage. "The details of the overseas coal exit have not been defined yet, including timetable, eligibility, and separation between public and private financing," said Yan Qin, lead-carbon analyst at Refinitiv, a financial data provider. "But I am less worried about the details. When China's leader announced this goal, the statement can be this simple and short, but it will be implemented thoroughly." The new commitment also doesn't address China's plans to expand its own coal-fired power plants. China's domestic programme accounts for more than half of all the coal-powered plants under construction throughout the world, according to a report published this month by E3G, a European climate think tank. While Xi has promised to "strictly control" new domestic coal power capacity over the 2021-2025 period, the country will not begin to reduce coal consumption until 2026. "With the new direction set for overseas coal, China needs to work harder now on its domestic coal addiction," said Li Shuo, senior climate advisor at Greenpeace.

Oct. 27 Karachi(DAWN/ANN ) The trouble for those who are determined to uphold the global status quo is that this very status quo is unsustainable. KARACHI: The recent energy crunch in Europe and power shortages in China prompted expressions of glee in certain quarters. It was a 'we told you so' opportunity for the fossil fuel lobbyists, whose strategy has lately shifted from defending coal as indispensable to arguing it will remain essential as a source of electricity for decades because renewable sources of energy remain unreliable. Such fatuous arguments tend to gloss over the consequences of carbon dioxide emissions. Even if every country were to meet the emissions reduction targets it voluntarily committed to at the Paris climate conference six years ago, global emissions would still increase by 2030, and the planet would be on course for a 2.7 degrees Celsius temperature spike by the end of the century. And given the recent trends in climate change, that is probably a highly optimistic projection. Climate-related catastrophes in the recent past have been overshadowed by Covid-19, but they portend a fairly horrific future in the short term, even as nations struggle to come to terms with the idea of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. Net zero does not mean the end of fossil fuel emissions, but merely their mitigation, invariably through proposed measures that may not add up to very much  such as planting trees or halting land clearing, which count as positive but ultimately inadequate initiatives at this stage  or on the basis of technologies that either remain largely untested or are yet to be invented. For instance, Australia, a leading coal producer and exporter, has struggled with a net zero commitment, coming up with an unconvincing one only on the eve of next week's COP26 summit in Glasgow. Resistance to even minimalist climate action has served as a trigger for toppling governments. The present prime minister, in his capacity as treasurer a few years ago, infamously carried a lump of coal into parliament to demonstrate his fondness for that particular fossil fuel. He somewhat reluctantly succumbed, though, to the pressure from the US, once it switched from the Trump to the Biden administration, to at least pay lip service to the idea of net zero. The shift has nevertheless been supplemented by the bright idea that, hey, there's no need to do anything right away, because technologies will emerge closer to 2050 that will make it much easier to curb carbon emissions. Meanwhile, there are elections to win. This is precisely the variety of nonsense that relentless young Swedish activist Greta Thunberg has lately called out as "blah blah blah". And Australia's Scott Morrison may aspire to greater heights of idiocy than some of his counterparts, but he is by no means the only culprit. Among his closest allies, Britain's Boris Johnson blathers about turning Britain into the "Saudi Arabia of wind" or the "Qatar of hydrogen", but it's hardly a secret that windbaggery is his forte. Joe Biden's rhetoric is decidedly different from that of his immediate predecessor, but whether it amounts to very much in practice remains to be seen. He has so far been struggling to win congressional approval even for the inadequate green measures in his stimulus package, which are likely to be rendered pretty much meaningless by the time they become law. If it ever comes to that. The visible roadblocks consist of Democratic senators Joe Manchin and Krysten Sinema, but in the background there's arguably the world's heaviest-hitting fossil fuel lobby. The industry's profitability guarantees there are untold millions of dollars to throw at legislators, enough of whom find the temptation irresistible. Biden himself steered clear of endorsing the potentially transformative New Green Deal that a bunch of more far-si\£dgh\£dted Democrats came up with, only to progressively retreat even from the milder alternative before heading for Europe. And this is despite US intelligence agencies painting a dire picture of the potential geopolitical consequences of climate change, including conflicts and mass migration within nation states as well as internationally. Over the centuries, capitalism has proved considerably more resilient than its invariably well-intentioned adversaries assumed, not least because of its mutability. But whether it can transcend neoliberalism  the delta variant of virulent greed  is open to question. But Glasgow is an unlikely venue for that debate. More blather and blah is a far likelier prospect. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Natural gas is still dominating as the commercial fuel for power generation in Bangladesh. Around 60% of the total power generation depends on gas. In the two Power System Master Plans (PSMPs) adopted over the past decade, gas was supposed to generate only 25% and 35% of power respectively. But the government has moved out of these plans and continued with gas. Though the country has no obligation, yet on its own, it volunteered to phase out coal. The government has not, however, officially announced that there will be 'No Coal Policy'. But initiatives are being taken to go for LNG for generating power that would fall short, around 8,500 MW, due to abandoning 10 coal projects. This may force relying on gas till 2050 or even beyond, and make Bangladesh exclusively dependent on gas. The main challenge of such a situation would be that a major portion of the gas requirement will have to meet through imports from the volatile energy market. Bangladesh has now started formulating an 'Integrated Energy and Power Master Plan' with the assistance of Japan. On the other hand, some projects for setting up infrastructure for increasing LNG supply by 2031 through import are being implemented. Endeavors for exploration of new gas resources and increasing production from existing gas fields through application of modern technology is also progressing. Talking to EP, officials at the Energy Division, Petrobangla and relevant companies have claimed that fears are no more persisting about the gas reserves depletion completely by 2031 even if no new gas field is discovered. They argued that the projects already taken up by BAPEX, BGFCL and SGFL would boost production by 900 MMCFD within 2031. The IOCs would contribute another 600 MMCFD. That would make it possible to retain 2600-2800 MMCFD production from the country's own resources. In 2031, the gas demand is projected to be 4200 MMCFD. In such a situation, imported LNG contribution would be kept at 1200-1400 MMCFD. The Energy and Mineral Resources Division (EMRD) was, however, continuing its efforts to set up infrastructure for importing upto 4200-4500 MMCFD of LNG. Most of these projects are still at preliminary stages though. Present Status and Future Perspectives of LNG FSRU Revisited The EMRD, after taking a decision for another FSRU, has advised Petrobangla for negotiating and concluding contracts with Summit Group. Relevant sources confirmed signing this agreement in 2-3 months under a special act for power and energy supply. The FSRU would come into operation within 18 months of signing the agreement. The energy division expects that it would come into operation within the middle of 2023. Within this period, Excelerate Energy may also increase its capacity from 500 MMCFD to 630 MMCFD through implementing Dry Docking. As such, in Moheshkhali, the regasification capacity of LNG would increase to 1630 MMCFD by 2023. The Energy Division and GTCL have assured that two pipelines together can evacuate the RLNG without any issue. But this may require some work in some areas of the gas grid. Plans have been made for completing these within the time frame. LNG Supply in the Western Region Despite constructing a gas transmission pipeline with huge investment, there are no other places in the southern region, other than Bhola, where gas supply has started even. In Khulna, the dual-fuel power plants are using furnace oil only. NWPGCL is working to complete the work of 800MW power plant. It has finalized plans for setting up of a 3,600MW gas-based power plant at Payra under joint venture. Initially it planned to import LNG for its Khulna and Payra plants. But now they abandoned that idea. They now want Petrobangla to supply them RLNG from its gas grid. Energy division is now considering four proposals for gas supply in the southern region. Two of these proposals are importing RLNG by pipelines from India. The first one was Indian Oil Company and Petrobangla under G2G initiatives importing gas through pipelines at Jessore or Satkhira. The two years old discussion did not achieve much headway. However, talks have again resumed for finalizing the Gas Sales Agreement (GSA). The Energy Division on principle accepted a proposal of Indian Private Sector Company H Energy. RPGCL has been tasked with discussing and concluding agreements. A source of RPGCL informed the EP that two companies want to deliver 300 MMCFD each. But talks are at a very early stage. A source in the RPGCL said that after 3 months it would be clear whether these two proposals would at all see the lights to the end of the tunnel. Saudi Arabian Company Engineering Dimension International Investment LLC has submitted a proposal for supplying 500-1000 MCFD gas through pipeline importing LNG into India. EP came to know that this proposal is now at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh. LNG Import via Payra Chinese company CMC, German Technology Giant Siemens and British IOC BP expressed interest in partnering with NWPGCL in its 3,600 MW gas-based power plant at Payra. BP on behalf of the JV started carrying out a feasibility study for LNG supply at Payra. But at one stage, BP left and US company Excelerate Energy stepped in. They started working through bringing some changes in the original plan. Their plan includes supplying LNG through subsea pipelines and setting up an LNG terminal at deep sea. Side by side they proposed supplying RLNG through a pipeline to Khulna. This proposal stated 500 MMCFD RLNG supply. Sources said the price of RLNG proposed is less than what Bangladesh is getting from FSRUs at Maheshkhali. Later a similar proposal was submitted by Summit Group. A committee at EMRD is now examining the two proposals. The report of the committee may be given in a month or two. Land Based Terminal (LBT) at Matarbari In addition to FSRU, the government has decided to set up a land-based terminal at Matarbari. Tokyo gas has been engaged as a consultant for preparing a tender document for it. In the meantime, 12 companies responded to the Expression of Interest for EPCM type contract. Of them, 7 companies have been shortlisted for sending the tender document. The RPGCL source informed the EP that the tender document is now ready. The proposal would be requested for submission in March 2022. Later after receipt of proposals, evaluation, approval, negotiation with the evaluated bidder it may be possible concluding agreement by 2023 for the LNG Terminal at Matarbari. It may be possible to bring the 1000 MMCFD import capacity terminal into operation by June 2026. It is being said that within a year of operation the capacity may be increased by another 500 MMCFD. LNG Import EMRD envisions increasing LNG regasification capacity from 1000 MMCFD to 4200-5000 MMCFD in phases from 2023 to 2031. Sensing the volatility of global market price of LNG, it has been decided to limit reliance on imported LNG. The essence of present thought is limiting LNG import to 1,000-1,200 MMCFD. For this, EMRD has worked out plans for increasing supply of gas from its own source (up to 2023 short term plan, 2026 mid-term plan and 2031 long-term plan). Some proposals for purchasing LNG under long-term purchase are also under consideration sensing challenges of purchases from the spot market. Qatar and Oman have decided to reduce the sale of LNG under long-term contracts from 2022. This has created additional stress for EMRD. EMRD Plans Increasing Supply from Own Sources National Gas Company BAPEX EMRD source informed the EP that national gas company BAPEX along with BGFCL and SGFL would carry out exploration works on a standalone basis, joint venture and also through engaging drilling contractors in onshore areas till 2031. During this period, a total of 24 exploration wells, 35 development wells and 33 work overs would be accomplished. 7-8 TCF new gas discovery is expected. BAPEX during this period would carry out exploration at Soriatpur, Togbi, Sreekail North, Sreekail North 1A, Elsha, Sylhet 10, Sreekail deep, Mobarakpur Deep, Titas Deep, Bakhrabad Deep, Dupitila, Batchia, Haragach, Rashidpur Deep, Kachalong, Sitapahar, Soilakupa, Savar-Singair, Sunetra 2, Titas 33, Titas 36, Rashidpur 13 and Rashidpur 14 structures. One BAPEX official expressed optimism that if present support of EMRD continues, it may be possible to achieve the target. But Prof Dr. Ijaz Hossain, former professor of BUET considered this as highly ambitious and unlikely to be achieved. IOC Initiative Chevron is the main IOC operating gas fields in Bangladesh onshore now. Around 50% of the total gas production is coming from its three under operation gas fields. Bibiyana is the largest gas field. Initiative has been taken for drilling a gas well in the flank with a view to maintaining the production of the field at the present level. More wells would be drilled subject to success from the first well. Petrobangla approval has been sought for installation of Inlet Compressor at Jalalabad Gas Field. Besides these, Chevron has proposed for fresh exploration at Blocks 12, 13 and 14. One source claimed that delay by the EMRD to respond to it is impeding the progress of work on this initiative. Offshore Exploration Bangladesh could not start exploration in a long time after the resolution of maritime boundary disputes with India and Myanmar in the Bay of Bengal. The initiative for launching a fresh bidding round in deep water in 2019 was frustrated by the COVID outbreak. Santos and Daewoo have wrapped up their operations in Bangladesh. Indian company ONGC is now working in two offshore blocks. They are drilling a well at Kanchon. After drilling down to 3,200 meters there was no gas found at two expected layers. Gas at further depth is expected. ONGC has plans for drilling two more wells. These may start in June 2022. It is to be noted that commencement of drilling was delayed for a year for resolving tax complexities of NBR. Petrobangla sources claimed that drilling like work would suffer if such attitude is not changed. IOCs would be discouraged. Multi-Client Surveys At long last, a contract could be concluded with Tgs and Schlumberger JV for carrying out multi-client surveys before the outbreak of COVID pandemic. But work has not started yet. Before the start, they tried to check with intending bidders for data sales. But getting little or no response, they did not start the work. Petrobangla sources informed that it organized meetings with 19 IOCs in 2019. They proposed to bring some amendments in the updated model PSC. But EMRD negated that proposal stating about the approval of updated PSC in the not too distant past. Recently RFP has been invited to engage a consultant for amending the PSC. It is expected that by mid-2022 a consultant can be engaged and PSC can be amended. Based on that, a fresh bidding round may be launched by end 2022. IOCs are turning around from pandemic impacts. Experts have genuine apprehensions about positive responses from them now. When asked, Petrobangla officials said the possibility of getting a positive response is remote now. But we must not keep our fingers crossed. For creating any momentum or dynamism in exploration activities, we must get out of bureaucratic tangles. Otherwise no IOC would make risky investment in Bangladesh offshore. Conclusion The developed world has emphasized on natural gas as a transition fuel for getting out of coal. Consequently, the demand for gas and LNG has shot up significantly. The COP26 could not reach a consensus on phasing out of coal. China and India have announced to reach net zero targets by 2060 and 2070 respectively. But no clear plans have been announced on how they would do that. Recent media reports indicated that China and India have increased their own coal production. Contrary to that Bangladesh has shelved 10 coal power projects. For political decisions, coal exploitation remains in suspended animation. It is uncertain whether the techno-economic analysis on own coal would be done or not at all. Consequently, natural gas is the only primary fuel option for Bangladesh. Experts are not at all optimistic about the 10-year gas exploration plan. Over the past 20 years, 14 TCF gas from the discovered proven reserves has been used. The addition of gas over this period is only about 3.0 TCF. Hence there is an apprehension over the possibility of discovering new gas. BAPEX and IOC sources informed that without positive support of EMRD, necessary momentum in exploration activities cannot be created in this regard. Again, there appears no proven record of Petrobangla's intention about exploring and exploiting its own resources. The highly ambitious initiative of drilling 108 wells by BAPEX in 5 years died its natural death. Petrobangla and EMRD became laughing stocks. The experts, however, expressed the optimism that this time the BAPEX, BGFCL, SGFL and, at the same time, Chevron initiatives would yield positive results - new gas resources would be discovered and production would increase. Can Bangladesh keep its exportable commodities competitive in the world market after absorbing the price shock of imported LNG in the event of the EMRD and Petrobangla's failure in exploring and discovering new gas resources? There is no doubt that many new challenges would emerge in Bangladesh being a developing economy if sustainable energy security cannot be ensured at an affordable price. \</doc>

The present government has already completed the third year of its third consecutive term. Year 2021 was the golden jubilee of Bangladesh's independence. The nation also celebrated the birth centenary of the Father of the Nation. The country has achieved some significant milestones over the past 50 years. Providing access to power to 99.75% of the population and achieving the recognition of graduation to a developing nation from the LDC status are two of the major milestones. However, the year 2022 is expected to be a challenging one from the point of view of stocktaking and consolidating the successes. From 2026 onwards, Bangladesh would no longer get preferences as a least developed country (LDC) like access to concessionary loans of the development partners. Bangladesh would require doing everything possible to ensure sustainable energy security for the industries so that local products remain competitive in the global market. It has to revamp its underperforming energy sector organizations and institutions for embracing challenges. A right choice of fuel mix, energy efficiency and conservation would be the key for ensuring quality power and energy supply to all at affordable cost. The global energy world is experiencing a paradigm shift from traditional fossil fuels to green, clean energy. The world came closer than ever before in agreeing that much greater pledges, commitments and actions have become essential for saving the world from catastrophic disasters out of global warming. The Glasgow Climate Summit ( COP26 ) recognized the requirement for much greater universal actions for limiting global warming below 1.5 degrees C by 2100. Bangladesh, although not possessing a mentionable carbon footprint, is among the major climate vulnerable countries. It's energy generation is still about 97% dependent on fossil fuel. Easily available own natural gas supplied at much lower than economic price provided the backbone of Bangladesh economy. But the proven reserve of natural gas is fast depleting. For lack of appropriate planning and bold political decisions, Bangladesh has possibly missed the opportunity to exploit a significant reserve of superior quality coal. Bangladesh lags far behind technologically in developing renewable energy potential. Bangladesh has no obligation to limit emissions. By adopting modern technology, it can still rely on fossil fuel till 2050. Unfortunately for lack of timely decision on mining its own coal and continued failure of Petrobangla in championing exploration of petroleum resources, Bangladesh is increasingly turning into an exclusively imported-fuel economy. If it goes business as usual, Bangladesh would become 60% dependent on imported fuel by 2030 and over 90% by 2041. The country with a shallow coastal area is also not suitable for setting up enabling infrastructure for imported fuel like Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Moreover, Bangladesh economy at this stage cannot absorb price shocks of volatile global fuel market. Even after all these, Bangladesh needs a smooth supply of primary fuel for feeding its burgeoning industries. Graduation of Bangladesh from LDC status to developing economy has also presented multi-dimensional challenges. Many advantages available for a LDC would no longer be available from 2026. Between 2022 and 2025, Bangladesh needs to do an awful lot to prepare a solid foundation for a resilient economy. Bangladesh will have to compete with other developing and developed economies through much more efficient management of resources and skillful operation of infrastructure. Bangladesh would require expanding its own resource base of primary fuel (gas, coal and renewables), achieve energy efficiency, reduce cost and develop human capital. Year 2022 is the penultimate year of the third consecutive term of the present government. The PSMPs of 2010 and 2018 have failed to achieve objectives. Time would come when economists through analysis would establish that due to poor coordination among all stakeholders, Bangladesh has so far failed to achieve expected economic benefits out of providing access to 99.75% population under power supply. In the changed global scenario, Bangladesh would have to launch an all-out drive in 2022 for implementing a comprehensive power and energy system master plan, take final decision on mining coal, much aggressive exploration initiative for petroleum resources development, launch initiatives for developing all kinds of RE development. For all these human capital development programs must be better coordinated and qualified line professionals must be placed at decision-making positions of the power and energy sectors. Energy Sector Challenges in 2022 and 2023 The government must have realized by now that the mere increase in power generation capacity without comprehensive and integrated power and energy system plan and intensive coordination among all segments of power and energy value chain produced only marginal benefits. Failure in own fuel exploration and development (coal and gas) has led to unbalanced and unaffordable fuel mix. Delays in implementation of mid-term baseload power plants led to continuation of short-term rental and quick rental power plants. Failure of PGCB in implementing power transmission projects on time also created embarrassment. These left BPDB with no other options but to account for a huge payment of capacity charges. People would not believe that COVID-19 is the main reason for the delays. It is sad that even with 22,000MW installed power generation capacity, the power system cannot effectively manage a power market of 15,000MW. BPDB can utilize only 50% of the capacity of Payra Power Plant and PGCB accounts for the capacity charge. Concerns have been raised whether PGCB can evacuate power from Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant on time in 2024. Anyway, 2022 and 2023 must see expedited works of power transmission and distribution projects for ensuring operation of modern efficient and reliable power system. We are aware that Bangladesh has shelved 10 medium-to-large coal power projects. The hurriedly taken decision had little imagination. We are not sure whether LNG would benefit at all. The LNG shock in recent times must have broken the day dreams of the policymakers. The big worries over 2022 and 2023 would be expediting its own gas exploration campaign, commencement of offshore exploration. Hope the policymakers would also give a fresh look at mining their own coal. Few people are advocating for more nuclear power plants. We must see techno-economic benefits of Rooppur Nuclear Power Plants for a while before jumping the gun, though we believe additional units at Rooppur and one more modern plant in the Southern region can be an ideal baseload generation by 2041. Bangladesh could achieve about 3% contribution from renewable energy (mostly solar) by now. Achieving 20% contribution from RE by 2030 would be a huge challenge. Bangladesh must transform SREDA into a corporate entity for RE and Energy Efficiency for reaping benefits. China, India, Australia apart from Western European countries are growing big in RE. Even Saudi Arabia is developing huge solar facilities. Offshore wind can be a potential area. Using power generated from offshore wind and through generating green hydrogen from seawater, hybrid power can be an area of research and development. Setting up power grids in the BBIN region and cross border power trading initiatives must be launched over the next two years. There are even more opportunities for importing solar from adjacent Indian states. These days, major advances in batteries and storage facilities have brought the cost of solar power within affordable limits. Hope Bangladesh would keep all avenues open for formulating pragmatic fuel mix in under preparation Integrated Power and Energy Master Plan. Supply quality and reliable power at affordable cost must be the main objective. Without reliable power supply at affordable cost the widely talked about mega investment in the Special Economic Zones may not happen. For Bangladesh commodities remaining competitive in the world market, the cost of power and fuel must be kept below the affordable limit. Reviewing and Restructuring Petrobangla Companies In 2021 the government must review and restructure Petrobangla companies for creating dynamism. It has been reported that Petrobangla companies do not enjoy the autonomy of companies formed per companies act. The company boards are overwhelmingly dominated by EMRD dictating plans and actions. The government must objectively assess the performance of Petrobangla and its companies from 2009 -2021. It must try to find out reasons why BAPEX, although being authorized for carrying out sole responsibility of exploration of Petroleum in onshore areas, could not achieve the desired success? Assessment must also be made whether BAPEX only policy was the right choice? Why did Petrobangla fail to convince the government policymakers about mining its own coal? Why proper coordination with the power sector could not be made before letting BPDB construct additional generation units at the mine mouth of Barapukuria? On what type of feasibility studies GTCL was made to invest heavily in gas transmission infrastructure without assured provisions of gas supply? GTCL owned gas transmission infrastructure can handle 5,500-6,000 MMCFD now while the gas available including about 850 MMCFD RLNG is about 3,000 MMCFD. Some gas transmission segments are being operated well below the design capacity. Still Petrobangla would require constructing a large diameter pipeline for feeding gas based large power plants at Meghnaghat. There must be an objective assessment of the poor planning and lack of coordination. Illegal connections and unauthorized use of gas in gas distribution companies grew alarmingly from 2010-2018. Very few persons responsible for such acts could be taken to task. For failures of Petrobangla companies, equitable supply of primary fuel to different regions of the country could not be achieved. Even in the gas franchise areas, there exists disparity between metered consumers and unmetered consumers. Millions are enjoying unauthorized use of gas. Safety is again a huge concern as very often-fatal gas accidents are being experienced. Officials of Petrobangla companies report about major brain drain as pay and benefits of Petrobangla companies now are well below the same of power sector companies. Bright young officials after recruitment cannot be retained. Activities of some companies like SGFL and BGFCL are shrinking. There is a school of thought of merging BAPEX, SGFL and BGFCL making it into an international level exploration and production company. On the other hand, activities of TGTDCL have grown so enormous that it has become almost impossible to manage activities by one company having head office at Dhaka. Similarly, GTCL operation expanded all over the country requires expansion of its organogram with emphasis on operation and maintenance of facilities. In 2022 the government must review, plan and implement restructuring of Petrobangla companies. Exploration of Petroleum The government must objectively assess the competence and capabilities of BAPEX for shouldering the entire responsibility of exploration onshore. Given the limited autonomy and resources it has done admirably well. But given the existing and emerging challenges of the energy sector BAPEX is not adequately equipped for shouldering the exclusive responsibility. It would struggle in exploration in deeper prospects and high-pressure zones. It could not take required initiatives over the years in further exploring the tight structures in Chittagong Hill Tracts. However, it is also not fair engaging foreign companies in non-transparent manner for doing BAPEX works. The government in 2022 must assess how the proceeds of the Gas Development Fund were utilized. BERC created this provision for spending on exploration of new resources. It goes without saying that failure in even initiating offshore exploration after successful resolution of maritime boundary dispute would continue hurting Bangladesh. In 2022 Bangladesh must go for a fresh PSC bidding round for offshore exploration. In the name of reviewing model PSC no further time should be wasted. The bidders must be given options for submitting bids proposing flexible gas prices. That should be settled through negotiation. There is a possibility of getting aggressive offers as gas market would remain volatile in the changing paradigm. At the same time for exploration at high-pressure region drilling contractors of international repute must be engaged through a transparent bidding process. Bangladesh must not risk a blowout type situation trying their luck with BPAEX. However, BAPEX must also remain partners in such operations. All Out Actions Must Continue Against Delinquent Gas Use After commencement of LNG import every drop of gas is like lifeblood. Bangladesh can no longer let lakhs of illegal gas connections and thousands of kilometers of illegal gas lines existing in gas franchise. For years TGTDCL board has been headed by the Energy Secretary. Additional Secretaries also spearhead boards of KGDCL and BGDCL. There are reports that massive illegal gas use mushroomed over the three terms of the present government. The frequent fatal gas accidents are also taking place mainly due to illegal gas use and poor maintenance of gas distribution utilities. In 2022 the government must continue its crackdown on illegal gas use. Serious consideration must be given whether domestic supply of gas can be phased out together replacing with LPG. We know for a democratic government taking major actions in the last year of any term (here in 2023) would be very challenging. But the present government so far has taken so many courageous initiatives. For ensuring sustainable energy security, it must give a fresh thought on mining its own coal, expediting exploration of petroleum at onshore and offshore in 2021. Bangladesh would never achieve sustainable energy security without exploring and exploiting its own primary fuel resources to full potential. It must also objectively assess the capacity and capabilities of Petrobangla companies. Professionals must be given more freedom; companies must be allowed to operate under autonomy. Year 2022 must be the year to set the bearings right. Bangladesh may be in serious challenges from 2026 in its early years as a developing nation if foundations are not set for it in 2022. \</doc>

Dhaka, Sept. 17 -- Climate-related disasters have affected the lives of at least 139.2 million people and killed more than 17,242 since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, say a new global analysis. The analysis is published by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, on the compound impacts of extreme-weather events and COVID-19. Through new data and specific case studies, the report shows how people across the world are facing multiple crises and coping with overlapping vulnerabilities. The paper also highlights the need of addressing both crises simultaneously as the COVID-19 pandemic has affected livelihoods across the world and has made communities more vulnerable to climate risks. Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the globe are not only responding to those overlapping crises but also helping communities to prepare and anticipate climate risks. In Bangladesh for instance, the Red Crescent Society has used IFRC's designated funds for anticipatory action to disseminate flood related Early Warning Messages through loudspeakers in vulnerable areas so people can take the necessary measures or evacuate if necessary. The IFRC President, Francesco Rocca, who presented the new report at a press conference in New York said the world is facing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis where the climate change and COVID-19 are pushing communities to their limits. In the lead up to COP26 , we urge world leaders to take immediate action not only to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but also to address the existent and imminent humanitarian impacts of climate change". The report comes a year after an initial analysis of the overlapping risks of extreme-weather events that have occurred during the COVID-19 crisis. The pandemic continues to wreak havoc, with direct health impacts for millions of people around the world, but also a massive indirect impact, in part due to the response measures implemented to contain the pandemic. Health systems are pushed to their limits and the most vulnerable have been the most exposed to overlapping shocks. In Afghanistan, the impacts of the extreme drought are compounded by conflict and COVID-19. The drought has crippled agricultural food production and diminished livestock, leaving millions of people hungry and malnourished. The Afghan Red Crescent Society has ramped up relief, including food and cash assistance for people to buy food supplies, plant drought-resistant food crops and protect their livestock. Julie Arrighi, associate director at the RCRC Climate Center said: "Hazards do not need to become disasters. We can counter the trend of rising risks and save lives if we change how we anticipate crises, fund early action and risk reduction at the local level. Finally, we need to help communities become more resilient, especially in the most vulnerable contexts." The COVID-19 pandemic has had a lasting impact on climate risks. Governments need to commit to investing in community adaptation, anticipation systems and local actors. "The massive spending in COVID-19 recovery proves that governments can act fast and drastically in the face of global threats. It is time to turn words into action and devote the same energy to the climate crisis. Every day, we are witnessing the impact of human-made climate change. The climate crisis is here, and we need to act now," Rocca said. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is expected to focus on the issues relating to equity in vaccine sharing, sustainable recovery, climate change and Rohingya crisis at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). "Covid-19 vaccines should be a public good without any discrimination," said Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen on Thursday sharing the key engagements of the Prime Minister. State Minister for Foreign Affairs M Shahriar Alam and Foreign Secretary Masud Bin Momen were, among others, present at the press conference. Prime Minister Hasina leaves here on Friday morning on a two-week official visit to attend the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York and other engagements with a stopover in Helsinki, Finland. The theme of this year's UNGA is 'Building resilience through hope-to recover from Covid-19, rebuild sustainably, respond to the needs of the planet, respect the rights of people, and revitalize the United Nations.' Dr Momen said the Prime Minister will address the UNGA on September 24 in Bangla and in-person. The Prime Minister will highlight Bangladesh's impressive development journey, inclusive economic development, and success in the health sector, said the Foreign Minister. He said Bangladesh will host a side event on the Rohingya issue titled 'Rohingya crisis: Imperatives for a sustainable solution' where many countries are expected to voluntarily join. The OIC, ASEAN and European countries have already responded positively. Dr Momen said there will be a number of bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the UNGA. The Prime Minister will deliver a speech at a programme titled 'UN Common Agenda: Action to achieve Equality and Inclusion.' Vaccine equity, Rohingya, climate change on top of Hasina's UNGA agenda A high-level meeting titled 'UN Food Systems Summit' will also be held this year. Another high-level meeting titled 'International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons' will be held on September 28. On September 22, the Prime Minister will deliver her speech at 'White House Global Covid-19 Summit: Ending the pandemic and building back better.' The Prime Minister is expected to plant sapling on the UN headquarters premises, marking the birth centenary of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Ahead of the COP26 "We would seek to keep the global temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius, funding for both mitigation and adaptation,' said Dr Momen. The Prime Minister is scheduled to leave for New York from Helsinki, Finland on September 19 after her stopover there on September 17-18. Wrapping up her official visit to New York, the Prime Minister will visit Washington DC where she will stay from September 25 to 30. Hasina is scheduled to leave Washington for Dhaka on September 30 and will return home on October 1 after a stopover in Finland. This is going to be Prime Minister Hasina's first overseas visit since the outbreak of the Covid-19 in March 2020. Earlier, she addressed the UNGA for 17 times and this would be her 18th joining the UNGA. The Covid-19 pandemic has proved to be the most challenging period the world has seen since the Second World War, said the UN Secretary-General on Tuesday. Newly sworn in General Assembly President, Abdulla Shahid of the Maldives, opened the new 76th session, noting that his country's flag is 'flying at the highest peak today'. He spoke of near-universal 'collective anxiety' and hopelessness, not all of which is pandemic-related, saying: 'The narrative must change' and that the General Assembly 'must play a part in this'. \</doc>

With such significant events as the G20 Environment, Climate and Energy Ministerial Meeting, the first ever UN High-level Dialogue on Energy and the two-years-long awaited UNFCCC COP26 in Glasgow, United Kingdom next month, 2021 has been dubbed as a year that will 'make it or break it' on climate action. Coming on the back of the 'lost year' of 2020, which will not only be remembered for the most devastating pandemic in modern history, but also as the hottest year in recorded history, it is no wonder that the fight against climate change has reached a palpable frenzy. Today, the percentage of countries that consume more resources than their ecosystems can regenerate is as high as 74%[1]. In contrast, 789 million people are living without access to electricity and hundreds of millions more lack access to clean cooking fuel. These stark realities diminish the progress made on Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), and certainly the SDG7 of 'Affordable and Clean Energy'. They also highlight why the world needs to go ahead and assume its responsibility to provide access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. There are lives at stake. To compound the challenges further, just as the wheels of global economy were whirring to a much anticipated start after a painful wait of 18 months, unprecedentedly high gas prices are now fomenting concern from Europe to Asia and elsewhere with the winter season looming large in the northern hemisphere. These recent developments, which sadly affect the entire strata of society still reeling from the devastation caused by COVID-19, validate the long-held position of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) on a balanced approach to managing the energy transition. The Forum, an intergovernmental coalition of 18 countries that represent the largest share of proven natural gas resources, production and trade in the world, has formally registered its efforts to the international pursuit of attaining the UN Sustainable Development Agenda 2030, eradicate energy poverty, and provide uninterrupted access to modern energy sources, especially for the most vulnerable communities, most recently through its statement to the UN High-Level Dialogue on Energy. Our Forum has reserved its most exceptional efforts to analyse, assess, and evaluate the different pathways in the energy transition context. We believe that technology will have a significant role in decarbonising the entire energy sector. Based on available science and recognised research, the GECF advocates the environmentally friendly credentials of natural gas, which is an efficient pathway to achieve immediate carbon emissions reduction by substituting the more carbon-intensive fuels. This positive effect has already been demonstrated in several major economies, which have reduced their carbon intensity by improving the penetration of natural gas. Currently, the gas industry is envisioning a deep decarbonisation of natural gas, including through carbon capture, utilisation and sequestration and natural gas-led hydrogen. These options add to other existing and novel technologies to improve efficiency that range from digitalisation and electrification of gas-related processes to detection and reduction of methane leakages. Al these technologies will be instrumental in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas-related operations and along the entire supply chain. In the same spirit of continuous excellence, the GECF has established its Environmental Knowledge and Solutions (EKS) initiative to foster a supportive and collaborative platform where best practices will be exchanged and support will instigate improved capabilities that can confront gas-related environmental issues head on. Gas was, is, and will remain the most realistic option to attain the energy transition, spur economic growth and social progress by providing competitive prices and a secure and abundant energy source. These benefits are further reinforced by the diversification of gas production centres and routes and the emergence of small-scale LNG solutions. The latter enables gas to reach regions with underdeveloped infrastructures, improve energy access and enlarge the potential of this fuel in different sectors such as road transport, bunkering, and small industrial projects. This vision is in complete alignment with SDG7 and is rooted in the 2019 Malabo Declaration of the GECF Heads of State and Government, which supports the fundamental role of long-term gas contracts as well as the gas pricing based on oil/oil products indexation, to ensure stable investments in the development of natural gas resources. Such principle provides a solid base for, most importantly, natural gas buyers as well as supplies protection against price volatility. The Declaration implores the Forum to 'promote cooperation with African countries, where hundreds of millions have no access to electrification and clean cooking fuel, to use gas as the core source of energy in their development programmes and climate change policies.' The GECF is encouraging and supporting global investments in energy efficiency and sustainability, innovation and digitalisation. The Forum joins the momentum to promote the circular carbon economy, which looks at the CO2 resulting from hydrocarbon sources as a real opportunity to capture more value through innovative technologies and practices. In this regard, the GECF views CCS (carbon capture and storage) and CCUS (carbon capture, utilisation, and storage) as promising routes for reducing the environmental footprint of natural gas supply chains, building on the huge existing synergies and knowledge capital developed by the oil and gas companies. The Forum disagrees with the attempts to use climate agenda to perpetuate energy inequality, introduce unfair discriminatory practices, and instigate 'green protectionism' mechanisms that harm global trade in gas-related products and investments. The industry is deeply concerned about the aggressive and unilateral policies elaborated under the climate agenda that aim to impose restrictions on trade, such as Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms. We consider these approaches as discriminatory and without the moral principles of 'energy for all' and environmental justice that should drive the global effort to fight climate change. Notwithstanding the ongoing reductionism and cancel culture, the GECF aspires to present a balanced energy-transition roadmap for a constructive debate that will enable policymakers to instigate, avoid market fluctuation and unnecessary economic hardship, and lead a realistic energy transition that actually benefits all. \</doc>

Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen will have a meeting with his British counterpart Dominic Raab in London in between his visit to Switzerland and the Netherlands, and discuss ways to further strengthen the relations between the two Commonwealth countries -- Bangladesh and the United Kingdom. Dr Momen said Bangladesh High Commissioner in London Saida Muna Tasneem informed him that there has been no meeting with the British Foreign Minister for a long time and Dominic Raab has already given an appointment to sit in a meeting in London. 'I'll also have a separate meeting with Alok Sharma (President of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in London,' the Foreign Minister told UNB. 'Things are being finalized,' he said, mentioning that he will visit London in between his visit to Switzerland and the Netherlands. Dr Momen will also attend programmes like a meeting with businesspeople during his busy stay in London, a senior official at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told UNB. He will leave here on Sunday morning beginning his tri-nation visit, said the official. The UK will host the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow on October 31 to November 12. Apart from the bilateral issues, vaccine cooperation and removing Bangladesh from the red list (for entering England amid the pandemic) are likely to be discussed, said a diplomatic source. Bangladesh finds no justified reason to see it on the red list as the Covid-19 situation is not that much bad compared to other countries which are not on the red list, said an official. If anyone from a red listed country enters the UK, he or she must book a quarantine hotel and coronavirus (Covid-19) tests which is quite expensive. Strategic Dialogue On September 9, Bangladesh and the United Kingdom will hold the fourth Strategic Dialogue in London and discuss the entire gamut of bilateral relations covering political relations, economic and development partnership, security and defence cooperation, and exchanges on current global issues. Foreign Secretary Masud Bin Momen, who is scheduled to reach London on September 8, will lead the Bangladesh delegation while Sir Philip Robert Barton KCMG OBE, Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) will lead the UK side at the dialogue. The third Bangladesh-UK Strategic Dialogue was held in Dhaka on 24 April 2019 and it takes place once every two years. The Foreign Minister will leave here on Sunday morning beginning his tri-nation tour, another senior official told UNB. Engagements in Switzerland, Netherlands In Geneva, Dr Momen will attend the Asia-Pacific regional review meeting on the implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action in preparation for the fifth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries (UNLDC-5) on August 30 to September 2.? Dr Momen said Bangladesh and Canada will co-chair the event in Geneva. The 5th United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries (LDC5) will be held in Doha on January 23-27, 2022. In the Netherlands, Dr Momen said he will attend the board meeting of the Global Centre on Adaptation apart from his other engagements there. There will be another event on 'How can floating development help adaptation to climate change?' which will bring together Dutch experts with experts on vulnerable housing in the South to discuss how to upscale innovative floating development adaptation solutions. The Foreign Minister is likely to return home on September 8. \</doc>

Dhaka, May 24 -- Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday urged the Commonwealth to play its crucial role in eradicating poverty and minimising climate vulnerabilities of the underprivileged segment of the population. "I strongly believe that the Commonwealth can play a pivotal role towards sustainable and nature-based solutions for a prosperous future," she said while addressing a virtual roundtable of the Asia Regional Commonwealth heads of government, reports UNB. Prince of Wales Charles Philip Arthur George, the eldest son of Queen Elizabeth II, convened the roundtable. As a member of the Commonwealth and the Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum-CVF, Sheikh Hasina suggested three measures ahead of COP26 , including promotion of green and sustainable economic growth worldwide and investing in a circular economy for building back better. The two other measures are giving emphasis on carbon-neutral technologies with a provision of knowledge and technology transfer among members of the Commonwealth with particular attention to the vulnerable countries, and supporting the climate-vulnerable countries to get access to climate finance for adaptation measures. The Prime Minister also urged everyone to focus on providing shelter to the homeless which is the best strategy to eradicate poverty and minimise climate vulnerability of the underprivileged segment of the population. "Every year, we're spending about 5 billion US dollars from our own resources for adaptation and climate resilience," she said. As the CVF Chair and the host of the South Asian regional office of GCA, Bangladesh is promoting the interests of the vulnerable countries and locally-led adaptation solutions, and rehabilitation of uprooted people from their homes due to riverbank erosion and erratic climate change with climate-resilient houses, she added. Hasina said Bangladesh has adopted "Mujib Climate Prosperity Initiatives" marking the birth centenary of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to deal with the adverse impacts of climate change. As the second-largest exporter of readymade garments, Bangladesh is also exploring efficient options of circular fashion and textiles as part of the overall circular economy, she said. Noting that the world is going through an unprecedented and yet uncertain pandemic situation of which Bangladesh is also no exception, the Prime Minister said her government has adopted policies and measures focusing on lives and livelihoods. "By the grace of the Almighty, Bangladesh has been able to continue with its socio-economic development minimising the impact of the pandemic," she said. Hasina extended her sincere thanks to the Royal Highness convening the roundtable with 'mother nature' at the heart of the dialogue. She reaffirmed Bangladesh's wholehearted solidarity with your Terra Carta Sustainable Markets initiative and your leadership fostering unity, ambition, sustainability and collective action by our Commonwealth at COP26 and beyond. Sheikh Hasina paid special tributes to the late Duke of Edinburgh and his legacy as a conservationist and quoted him as saying that if nature doesn't survive, neither will men. "Indeed, in our war against nature, we'll only lose unless we unite to harness the power of nature for an equitable, resilient and greener post-Covid-19 recovery for our succeeding generations and vulnerable communities," Hasina added.

Aug. 11 Colombo(The Island/ANN)- Sri Lanka is the best in South Asia as regards efforts being made to mitigate the effects of the climate emergency, Ken O'Flaherty, says Ambassador for Asia-Pacific and the South Asia Region at the United Nations Office for Climate Change ( COP26 ). The Ambassador invited the Minister of Environment and the Ministry Secretary to represent Sri Lanka at the International Conference on COP 26 Climate Change to be held in Belgrade in November this year. The Ambassador also briefed the Minister on the manner in which the Sri Lankan government had implemented the decisions taken by the United Nations Conference on Climate Change to Prevent the Impact of Climate Change. The Minister said that a number of policy decisions had been taken so far to tackle a number of issues that could contribute to climate change, in line with the Prosperity Vision Policy Statement presented by the current President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Amaraweera said that President Rajapaksa had decided against the construction of new coal-fired power plants and that 70 percent of Sri Lanka's electricity needs would be met from renewable energy from 2030. It would also increase the use of hydro power as well as solar and wind power to generate electricity. "We will build two LNG power plants and encourage the import of electric cars, and increase the country's forest cover to 30 percent by 2030", Minister Amaraweera told the visitors. The Minister also said one of the objectives of the government was to improve the national transport services which are responsible for increasing air pollution.He also pointed out that the importation, manufacture, distribution and sale of a number of polythene and plastic-based products that caused environmental pollution had been banned in the country. Amaraweera said that all those decisions had been taken on the instructions of President Rajapaksa to protect the environment. Sri Lanka is also an island and could face more adverse conditions due to the adverse global impact, the Ambassador said. However, he emphasised that Sri Lanka was ahead of other countries in the South Asian region in complying with international recommendations on climate change mitigation. Ambassador O'Flaherty congratulated the government on such successes. Several officials of the Ministry were also present on the occasion. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home \</doc>

Oct. 29 Kathmandu(Kathmandu Post/ANN)- October is the month of festivities. It is the season of Dashain that different communities of Hindus in Nepal celebrate in their distinctive ways. Then it is the turn of five-day-long Yam Panchak combining Dhanwantari Jayanti. For the Newa community, Mha Puja is the worship of the self as a manifestation of the supreme being, which also marks the first day of Nepal Sambat. After Yam Panchak, it's the turn of Chhaith in Mithila when devotees light earthen lamps to pay homage to the setting sun and then pray to the rising sun the next morning for the health and wealth of the family. Minorities in Nepal, too, mark the autumn in their own ways. This year, Eid-ul-Milad-un-Nabi honouring the birth of Prophet Mohammed, may peace be upon him, was observed with piety by the Muslims. For some women of the Hindu community, there was Karwa Chauth, and Christians will be celebrating Halloween. In this part of the world, relatively calm October, with several varieties of evergreen trees sprouting fresh leaves as the old ones fall off their branches, can sometimes feel even better than the dry and windy month of April. The best part of autumn used to be cloud-like cotton balls kiting untethered in the blue sky. But the clouds turned out to be darker this year. Lord Indra, the Hindu deity of rain, used to come to Kathmandu to steal night jasmine, get caught and be released with a promise of prosperity. This autumn, he left his troops to devastate the land with unseasonal downpour resulting in the unexpected flooding of paddies just as the ripening rice crop was ready to be harvested. Fallen paddies Experts estimate that losses due to the unseasonal rains of October would run into billions of rupees. The projected GDP of the year is likely to fall by up to 0.6 percentage points. These numbers, however, tell only part of the story. Cultivation of rice is a significant part of the farming culture, and the sight of ripening paddies going waste in the flooded fields brings tears to the eyes. The numerical expression can't match the year-long association of subsistence farmers. The cycle begins when the ripe crop is reaped, and the best of the produce is separated for the seeds. The straw sustains the livestock during the grassless winter in Madhes. Spring is for clearing the rice fields and ploughing the ground while the soil is still moist. Summer months are for preparing seedbeds, dumping manure and irrigating seedlings so that the plants survive the scorching sun. Come monsoon, and it's time for muddying the paddies and transplanting seedlings in the softened puddle. Floods of the late monsoon do sometimes wash away rice paddies, and occasional dry spells play havoc with the harvest. But rice is a crop of hope. Farmers pray and plant again, and when the yellowing plants turn green and then yellow with grains, it's an occasion to bow in reverence to the forces of nature. The sight of freshly planted paddies being washed away by monsoon floods can be distressful, but to see ripened rice fall and rot due to autumnal rain is devastating. When grains grow seedlings while still on their stems, it signifies the end of the natural order of everything in life. I have been a farmer once, and my eyes welled up as I typed this sentence. This October, the downpour turned the cooling relief from the humid heat of September into drenching grief of over 100 lost lives. The government of Province 2 has announced token relief. Nobody is even talking about adequate compensation to the aggrieved families. Many agriculturists will blame their fate and get on with life. But it appears that the unseasonal rains may be an early sign of looming uncertainties. A lay farmer may not comprehend the complexities of climate change. Still, the depressing sight of fallen crops and the ominous smell of rotting grains is enough to alarm them of the consequences of the uncontrollable fury of nature. Broken lives Almost a million people had left Kathmandu for their homes in the villages and towns of Nepal to celebrate autumnal festivals. At least 173 of those are reported to have lost their lives, and nearly 1,600 were injured in road accidents due to the risk of traffic rush and ill-designed carriageways compounded by damage caused by the inclement weather. Excesses of the law and order machinery claimed at least four lives in Rupandehi while dozens of protestors were denied justice in Nepalgunj who had trekked over 500 kilometres to bring their grievances to the attention of the nation. Instead of a prompt hearing, all they got initially was arbitrary detention. Mercifully, an investigation has since been ordered into the cases of suspicious disappearances of Nakunni Dhobi and Niramala Kurmi; but as goes the adage, justice delayed is justice denied. Caste-based hate crime took the form of the brutally beating of a Dalit to death in Chitwan. An alternative narrative is being built through a section of social media that seeks to blame the victim for his "drunkenness". The wheels of justice move excruciatingly slow when the perpetrators are from the dominant groups, and the victim comes from one of the several minority communities of the country. The Covid-19 pandemic is projected to turn endemic even after the vaccination drive. Better management of health infrastructure will be needed to face fresh challenges. History bears testimony that the unpredictability of weather and consequent natural disasters induce apocalyptic changes in polity and society. The impact of climate change upon the lives of the people living in the fragile region of the Himalaya is being observed, documented and analysed. Hopefully, the warming of the Himalaya and its catastrophic consequences will come up for serious deliberations during COP26 that Premier Sher Bahadur Deuba is scheduled to attend. Combating the catastrophic effects of climatic change will require a concerted effort of the global community. The poor have to bear the greatest burden of climate change. Their suffering can somewhat be alleviated through better governance. This autumn has been such a season of doom and gloom that just the prospect of the chilling winter ahead appears frightening. This Deepawali, light a lamp in memory of the fallen paddies, lost hopes and broken families. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home \</doc>

Dhaka, Sept. 26 -- Recently, an EU-US Summit convened on June 15, 2021 marked the beginning of a renewed trans-atlantic partnership not only through the establishment of the EU-US Trade and Technology Council (TTC) but also outlining an ambitious joint agenda for post-COVID EU-US cooperation. Analysts have pointed out that the Biden Administration, consistent with interactive engagement, has offered the EU the opportunity to re-vitalie transatlantic relations, which reached the lowest point since World War II under the Trump Administration. This initiative was undertaken to address the bilateral disputes and tensions that gradually emerged, partly as a result of Trump's 'America First' policies. The TTC will aim to deepen EU-US relations on trade and investment and also to avoid the creation of new technical barriers to trade by cooperating on key policies such as technology, digital policy issues and supply chains. The first meeting of the TTC is scheduled on September 29-30 2021. It may be recalled that the EU had already demonstrated its keenness to 'reset' trans-atlantic relations after Biden's election victory in November 2020. The European Commission and the High Representative (HR) published on December 2, 2020 the Joint Communication on "A new EU-US agenda for global change" where it was stressed that while EU-US relations were tested under the Trump Administration through geopolitical power shifts, bilateral tensions, and unilateral tendencies, the new Biden administration would "present an opportunity to design a new trans-atlantic agenda for global cooperation based on our common values, interests and global influence". This would help create stronger bilateral and multilateral cooperation to address the COVID-19 issues, climate crises; solve the EU-US bilateral trade disputes; improve cooperation on technology, trade, and tech standards; and work together "towards a safer, more prosperous and more democratic world". The EU also decided to set up the TTC to address mounting competition from China as it sets its own standards in tech and digital trade. The TTC aims to deepen EU-US relations on trade and investment, and to avoid new technical barriers to trade by cooperating on key policies on technology, digital policy issues and supply chains. In this context the TTC is expected to cover numerous issues-- technology standards, regulating Artificial Intelligence (AI), climate and green tech, ICT security, data governance and technology platforms, export controls, investment screening, digital technologies and challenges in global trade. The EU is eager to reboot trans-atlantic trade relations and to end the trade disputes triggered by the previous Trump administration. However, at the same time the EU is considering a realistic and careful approach for trans-atlantic trade cooperation focusing on specific issues of shared interest-- solving the bilateral trade disputes and irritants, cooperation on WTO reform, and strengthening regulatory and standards cooperation. It is generally understood that the EU and the US will try to use trade to help fight climate change, protect the environment, promote workers' rights, expand resilient and sustainable supply chains, continue to cooperate in emerging technologies and create decent jobs. In addition, both parties aim to uphold and reform the rules-based multilateral trading system and to stand together to protect businesses and workers from unfair trade practices created by non-market economies that are undermining the world trading system. The last factor obviously refers to China. It is clear that the EU and the US intend to not only share information regarding cyber security concerns and other areas relevant to non-market practices in the civil aircraft sector but also cooperate on the screening of inward and outward investment in this sector. However, strategists have noted that if the EU and the US cannot agree on what type of subsidies are allowed in this sector, it will be very difficult for them to challenge China's subsidy programmes to its own civil aircraft industrial segment. Despite the efforts from the European Commission to have the US suspend its Section 232 tariffs, nothing formal has been agreed to till now. Commission President von der Leyen has however stated that Brussels and Washington needed "a little bit more of time" to settle the Section 232 dispute, and that she is confident that a solution would be reached before the end of the year. It is indeed crucial that an agreement be found before December 1, when the postponed second tranche of EU rebalancing tariffs will kick off. This will have the potential for escalating the existing dispute. Nevertheless, economists feel that it is unlikely that the Biden administration will swiftly terminate the Section 232 tariffs this year. This is so because Biden is trying to carefully avoid a conflict with America's steelworkers on this issue. Some in this sector are also drawing attention to the structural problem of global excess capacity driven largely by China's trade practices both in the steel and aluminium sector. Legal and political constraints limit the possibility to find a creative solution. Another key priority for the trans-atlantic trade agenda will be cooperation on WTO reform. The European Commission intends to pursue reform of the WTO across all of its functions, in particular updating its 'rulebook' and restoring its Dispute Settlement Mechanism (DSM) and Appellate Body (AB). The Commission wants a reformed Appellate Body, improved functioning of the WTO system, and modernised rules in areas such digital trade, agriculture and competitive neutrality. Economists feel that the EU's priorities for WTO reform are very much in line with those of the US. However, it is unlikely that the EU and the US will be able to reach an agreement on multilateral or plurilateral agreements before or during the Ministerial Conference to be convened later this year. Possible exceptions could be an agreement on fishery subsidies. The EU-US is now both trying to enhance their relationship regarding trans-atlantic climate cooperation. Both Parties have agreed on two platforms-- the "EU-US High-Level Climate Action Group" and the "Transatlantic Green Technology Alliance". They have also indicated that both sides will try to agree on a broad agenda on climate cooperation, including sustainable finance and addressing the risk of carbon leakage. It may be recalled in this context that on his first day in office, President Biden signed the reintroduction of the US into the Paris agreement. Later in April 2021, the US convened a "Leaders Summit on Climate", bringing together leaders from across the globe to initiate climate action ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow ( COP26 ). The US has also announced its target of climate neutrality by 2050, and a reduction in emissions by 50-52 per cent by 2030. This aspect has also been reiterated by US Climate Envoy John Kerry. It is being hoped that both sides will be able to usher in a constructive engagement and common approach during multilateral negotiations with the help of the two newly created platforms- ahead of COP26 . The first factor that will receive attention will be the question of designing effective governance rules for digital services associated with online content on social media platforms and marketplaces. It may be recalled that the impact of disinformation was acutely felt in the EU during the European Parliament elections in 2019, as well as earlier during the Brexit referendum campaign in 2016. The European Commission has since drafted a Digital Services Act which aims to target these issues by creating a governance framework that improves transparency about the algorithmic activity and business models of digital platforms, e-commerce, and other digital services. The lack of common rules and minimum standards for transparency online has, according to the EU, undermined fair trade, consumer trust, and most crucially, democratic resilience online. The US has however, despite the January 6 events in the Capitol Hill been unable to draft anything similar to the European Commission's Digital Services Act. The EU is also attaching significance to both sides boosting fair competitive practices in digital markets. The European Commission has already drafted the Digital Markets Act which aims to reign in the so-called 'gatekeeping' activity by big 'GAFAM' companies (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft), among others. This measure has been taken because dominant online platforms and services harvest vast troves of data by monitoring user activity across their platforms. These data translate into crucial insights - also referred to as "data power" - that potentially give these companies unfair advantages, while stifling innovation, competition, and growth through investment for SMEs. However, as most of the big tech companies are based in the US, the EU's efforts are causing uneasiness among US big techs. The last point of contention relates to digital taxation. Differences between the US and the EU on the regulation of the digital economy surfaced in 2019 regarding digital services tax. Strongly advocated by France, this measure has been fiercely opposed by the US, whose tech giants would be affected by a European digital tax regime. The USTR has already announced in June 2021 the conclusion of the one-year Section 301 investigations of the Digital Service Taxes (DSTs) previously adopted by several EU Member States (Austria, France, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Spain) and other countries. According to the investigations, these tax schemes are designed to apply only to companies with very high revenues, effectively targeting primarily US companies. This, the USTR considers as discriminatory. In response the USTR wants to impose additional tariffs on certain goods from these countries, while suspending the tariffs for up to 180 days. A definitive framework for the transfer of EU data to the US is necessary, but the 2018 US Cloud Act has been an obstacle and the main reason for the latest ECJ ruling on July 16, 2020. This piece of legislation allows US intelligence agencies to access data hosted by US firms, regardless of the jurisdiction in which the data server is physically located. This is being construed as being against the citizens' right pertaining to data protection and privacy. Both sides are taking on several difficult issues within their trans-atlantic agenda. It is clear that all of these aspects will require strong commitment from both sides. One now has to wait and see what happens.

Dhaka, Dec. 22 -- As Bangladesh marks 50 years of independence, it is being hailed as a rising economic star, and rightfully so. The 1971's War of Liberation, apart from claiming three million lives, had also left the country's infrastructure and economy in tatters. At that time around 80 per cent of Bangladesh's population was living in extreme poverty and the country was characterised as economic basket case. But in the last five decades Bangladesh has undergone tremendous transformation and become one of the fastest growing economies of the world. Our socio-economic progress, human development indicators and achievements of MDGs are widely acclaimed. Especially in last 13 years under the visionary leadership of our Honorable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh has become a global model of development. Our per capita income has reached USD 2,554 from USD 676 in the FY 2008-2009, which is one of the highest in South Asia. Poverty rate declined to 20.5 per cent, both way trade increased from USD38 billion to USD82 billion during the same time. Foreign exchange reserve is crossing the records every month which is now at USD 45 billion. How has this happened? Certainly, it was not a case of simply waving a magic wand! Well, the success story has largely been woven by the ready-made garment (RMG) industry. And those of us involved in this sector can take some pride in our remarkable contribution to the development of the country. Let's look at a few facts and figures. The apparel sector contributes 11 per cent to GDP and supports over 4 million jobs directly. With 3,500 active clothing factories at present, it accounts for $20 billion in investment, and generates export revenue of 31.4 billion that is about 81 per cent of total export from Bangladesh. The impressive growth of Bangladesh RMG industry has made it the world's second largest garment supplier, with its products going to 167 countries. Figures aside, the RMG industry truly embodies Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's dream of building a self-reliant nation. In his first speech to the independent Bangladesh, Bangabandhu had said, "Our independence will be futile, if the people of my Bengal are not fully fed. Our independence will not be fulfilled, if the mothers and sisters of this country do not get clothes for the protection of their modesty. Our independence will not be fulfilled, if the people of this country, the youth, do not find employment." The RMG industry is leading from the front in making Bangladesh self-reliant. It is a vital cog in Bangladesh economy and also the largest formal employment sector, especially for women. Approximately 60 per cent of garment workers are women, mostly within the age group of 18-30 years. As a result, the industry has not only immensely contributed to women empowerment and poverty reduction, but also brought about numerous positive changes in the society like drop in early marriage and early motherhood, increase in female literacy rates, curb in population growth, and increase in environmental and personal hygiene awareness etc. Moreover, the RMG sector provides economic opportunities to thousands of backward and forward linkages. Even beyond this tangible socio-economic contribution, the apparel industry itself has gone through massive transformation and grown manifold since its inception. The technology features, workplace safety, product quality and range, and environmental sustainability-- all have improved significantly. The industry's high level of adaptability has been so impressive and successful in making the business sustainable that perhaps other industries can take some lessons from it. Since the very beginning the successive leaderships of BGMEA worked hard to take the industry forward amid myriad challenges. We humbly remember their contributions and show our deep respect to all the leaders, especially former Presidents of BGMEA. As we look back, broadly there are four areas in which significant advancements have taken place and of which we can all be really proud of. First, the advancement in workplace safety and value chain responsibility. Today Bangladesh's RMG industry can boast of having been transformed into a state-of-the-art, safe, secured and green hub of sustainable and ethical manufacturing. The sector insiders' relentless pursuit for staying competitive in the global supply chain has helped the industry make great strides in safety and sustainability. After the introduction of Harkins Bill of Child Labour elimination in 1994, we have made an unprecedented success in eliminating Child Labour from the RMG industry in 1995 and rehabilitate them through 'earn and learn programme'. We, the entrepreneurs, have committed ourselves to turn around and rebuild the industry to make it safer, risk-free and sustainable for our workers and employees, especially after the tragic building accident of 2013. We have engaged ourselves with the government, ILO, local and international labour federations and brands through the initiatives titled 'ACCORD', 'Alliance' and 'National Action Plan'. Bangladesh made a joint declaration with ILO, EU, USA and Canada called the Sustainability Compact in 2013 to monitor the progress of the transformation. The three initiatives as I named before have carried out safety inspection in all the export oriented RMG factories in Bangladesh in the area of fire, electrical and structural safety. The response from the industry in terms of remediation works was phenomenal. Since the tragic building collapse incident in 2013 a paradigm shift has happened. All the factories have gone through robust remediation programme and installed all the required safety equipment as per the standards. To complete the safety remediation plan, a factory on an average spent around USD 500,000. And in the case of relocation or rectification, the cost was even 4-6 times higher. Not only that, the factory inspections reports were disclosed online which has set a unique example in the world on the issue of workplace safety Then we have formed RMG Sustainability Council (RSC) to build local capacity as a national safety monitoring regime, involving equal number of representatives from industry bodies, brands and unions in its governance. Thanks to these unprecedented strides over the years, the industry has earned global recognition. McKinsey & Company has termed Bangladesh RMG industry as "a front-runner in transparency regarding factory safety and value-chain responsibility", while QIMA ranked Bangladesh 2nd in its ethical manufacturing audit 2020. Second, the advancement in environmental sustainability. Today the factories are not only safer, but also have become more dynamic, modern, energy-efficient and environment-friendly. Bangladesh has by far the highest number of green garment factories in the world. US Green Building Council (USGBC) certified a total of 152 Bangladeshi factories as LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), among them 44 are LEED platinum-rated and 94 are LEED gold-rated units. Moreover, 500 more factories are in the pipeline for certification. Factories are increasingly opting for modern, energy-efficient technologies. Besides, an increasing number of factories from Bangladesh are joining UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), the German Green Button initiative, and a circular fashion project with GFA, which testifies the industry's strategic vision and committed efforts toward environmental excellence. I also want to proudly share with the readers that BGMEA has been recently honored with USGBC Leadership Award 2021, which is by far the first of its kind for any associations in Bangladesh. In the recently ended COP26 , we have reaffirmed our commitment to climate action. Third, technological advancement. Our factories are increasingly moving from semi-automatic to more automatic mode using sophisticated machines, technologies and software to prepare the industry for next phase of growth. Energy and resource-efficient technologies like low liquor dyeing machine, Ozone washing machines, Jacquard machines, auto trimming, ERP are increasingly being used in factories. These machines are not only resource-efficient but they also enhance efficiency in production. Most of our new generation factories are equipped with sophisticated technologies, able to handle top quality products of diverse styles, making the product price competitive as well. Moreover, we are using many environment-friendly technologies like-- rainwater harvesting, daylight saving, solar energy etc. which save our natural resources and reduce the environmental pollution. As far as transparency and traceability of the supply chain management is concerned, different types of supply chain tools are used. Some factories are using technology like -- IOT to analyse sewing motion, radio-frequency identification RFID for production and inventory tracking system, smart dying system, automatic dosing system, smart garment measurement system, finishing roll QC system, mobile apps for QC etc. Automated screening tools are being used to detect organic and zero hazardous chemicals which reduce the consumption of water and energy. Fourth, and perhaps the most important, is our ability to manufacture world-class products. Today our products compete with the best in the world. Apart from being meticulous in product development, our unfailing commitment to deliver quality products on time also gives Bangladesh a competitive edge. Moreover, our manufacturing quality is steadily improving and our products are increasingly winning hearts and minds of global consumers. Still, there is a lot of work to be done. We need to enhance our value addition capacity so that our products can become more competitive both in terms of cost and quality. Considering all these areas of impressive advancement, there is no denying that Bangladesh RMG industry has come a long way. In our journey of almost four decades, we have gone through various challenges and currently, as the whole world suffers from the pandemic of the century-- Covid-19, our manufacturers are also confronted with an unprecedented situation. However, with the support from Honorable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, we have been able to successfully fight the initial blow and as a result of mass vaccination around the world, our export is rebounding. The potential of the industry is much larger and we must aspire to reach the very top. However, the question is- what will it take? In simple words the misconception about the industry needs to be changed, and it must be seen as an important economic growth driver for Bangladesh. Yes, factories are required to address workplace safety, wage and environmental issues. Over the years, these issues have been dealt with successfully, thanks to the action taken by the government and the industry. Another important thing to do is - we have to carve out a niche for ourselves in high-end garment products, especially with a focus on harnessing the potential of man-made fibre (MMF). The global market for MMF products is huge. About 75 per cent of the total consumption of global textiles is non-cotton, where the share of Bangladesh is only 25 per cent. Bangladesh is also heavily dependent on imports to meet the demand for non-cotton fabrics. So, rapid localisation of MMF will provide a big opportunity for the RMG sector. The share of 5 core items -- trousers, T-shirts, blouses, sweaters and underwear -- is 82.04 per cent, whereas we have huge scope in items like active-wear, athleisure, suits and high-end formal-wear, outerwear, lingerie etc. The next phase of business sustainability will also require advancement in the area of 4th industrial revolution. We must make continuous effort to cope up with the global fashion trends and realign our business strategies accordingly. The industry is now more focused on product diversification, especially on non-cotton and high-end apparel products like suits/blazers, lingerie, jackets, swimwear, sportswear, uniform, work-wear etc. Thus we must strive to remodel our business from labour intensive to a value-added one through innovation, modern manufacturing, diversification, technology upgrading, up-skilling and re-skilling of our workforce. One of the major sources of Bangladesh's competitiveness is the young and vibrant workforce. Bangladesh has a vibrant population, 70 per cent below 40 years of age. Being a highly populated country, we have to focus on our people to achieve our desired economic development. Better utilisation of human resources for maximising value to the economy requires a critical analysis and appropriate policy. Considering the potentials of emerging as a middle income country, we have to take a People Centric Approach in devising our strategies and policies. It is encouraging that significant investment in skill development and R&D is already taking place in factories. While individual factories are working on their own to develop and design high-end products for exports, BGMEA with the support of the commerce ministry has set up the Centre for Innovation, Efficiency and OSH for garment factories to enhance competitiveness of the industry. It is hoped that the Centre will contribute to industry's preparedness to keep pace with the changing demands. Last but not least, as the nation aspires to be a developed country by 2041, the RMG industry has a lot more to contribute and will play a pivotal role in the journey. Therefore, the government and the industry must continue to work together to keep up the growth momentum of this vital sector in the days to come. If everything goes well, achieving the target of $50 billion export earnings from this sector is well within our reach.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has already fulfilled one of the dreams of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman - ensuring access to power for all. At the same time, all out endeavors are directed for achieving his other unrealized visions, which are exploration and exploitation of own primary fuel resources. However, we need to mitigate the increasing reliance on imported fuel for achieving sustainable supply of power at affordable price. Abul Kalam Azad, Special Envoy to the Presidency of Climate Vulnerable Forum, made the observation in an exclusive interview with Energy and Power Editor Mollah Amzad Hossain. What are your views about Bangabandhu's Energy Vision Bangabandhu was a leader of mass people. He could accurately fathom the needs of the masses. During the campaign for general election in 1970, he strongly advocated for rural electrification alongside flood control and river training. At that time, there was a huge disparity in power generation and availability between East and West Pakistan. Bangabandhu returned to Independent Bangladesh on January 10, 1972. He had to start everything from the scratch. His first task was to formulate the constitution. Article 16 of the unique historic constitution was guaranteeing constitutional rights to all citizens of power supply. The installed capacity at that time was 500MW, but actual generation was 200MW. His efforts could soon increase the actual generation to 500MW. Power and energy sectors of Bangladesh still stand on the foundation Bangabandhu laid in only his three and half years of term. He created Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission (BAEC), BIDS for research, BPDB and BWBD, BOGMC and BMDC. For establishing the rights of Bangladeshis over natural resources, he encouraged development of model Production Sharing Contract (PSC) through amending the Petroleum Act. The offshore exploration campaign for oil commenced. Before launching the exploration campaign, Territorial Water and Maritime Act was formulated in 1974. Five major discovered gas fields were acquired from Shell BV 9 August 1975 at a nominal price of \£34.5 million almost 50 crore taka that time. An agreement was signed with Soviet Union for increasing power generation. Works for two units of 55 MW each thermal power plant at Ashuganj started. Agreement with Soviet Union for 2X210 MW power plant at Ghorashal was also signed. Another 3 unit of 20mw power plant construction work started during that time If you look back realistically, Bangabandhu had successfully launched all those were essential for making a vibrant, dynamic power and energy sector. Bangabandhu was very vocal about exploration and development of energy and mineral resources of the then East Pakistan right from the time he was part of Jukto Front Cabinet. Do you think his works in independent Bangladesh were a follow up of his vision The East Pakistan Small Industries Corporation (EPSIC), now BSCIC, was launched when Bangabandhu was in charge of Ministry of Industries. He realized that there is no alternative to uninterrupted power supply for ensuring development. He played the pioneering role for acquisition of land at Rooppur, Pabna for the Nuclear Power Plant. He had in his mind all what he would do if opportunity ever comes in an independent country. It was possible for him to initiate everything in such a short time as he did what he believed in the depth of his heart. For establishing absolute control of Bangladeshis over its energy and power resources, Bangabandhu stressed on creation of required institution and development of own competent human resources for championing the growth and operation of energy and power sector. The sector is still heavily relying on that foundation. Do you think his party is successfully following his vision I believe his party is sticking along his vision. Championing the creation of Petrobangla, the then Bangabandhu government had started exploration of Petroleum in the Bay of Bengal under Production Sharing Contract. The present government has strengthened BAPEX. Translating the vision of Bangabandhu into reality, the access to power grid has been ensured for 100% population. Bangabandhu initiated actions for exploring coal and mineral resources. But for protecting the interest of the people, open pit mining could not be given green signal yet. A large number of people would require to be relocated for that. Extensive studies are also required for mine water management, aquifer management for open coal mining. But we need to be more pro-active for offshore exploration of Petroleum. That would relieve us of excessive reliance on imported fuel. The energy security may be severely stressed from supply disruption arising from global geo politics and affordability due to price shock if Bangladesh becomes exclusively reliant on imported fuel. That is why priority attention must be given on exploration of own primary fuel. Though we are talking about net-zero carbon emission, the global energy sector would still rely 70% on fossil fuel until 2050. The board of directors of all power and energy companies are under absolute control of ministry officials. Relevant professionals are not there. There are allegations that these companies cannot be run with due autonomy. What are your views Without looking for who are there and who are not, I would like to know about the outcome. The PGCB has been created from BPDB; distribution utilities like DESCO, DPDC, WZPDCO, NESCO have also been created out of it. NWPGCL, EGCB, CPGCBL and APCL have been created for power generation. System loss has been reduced from 40% to single digit. Subsidy has been reduced. Installed generation capacity of 5,000MW in 2009 has been increased to 24,000MW in 2021. Efficiency of BPDB is also being enhanced like all other companies. The board of directors has been formed taking into considerations various aspects. Momentum has been created, presence of secretary and senior officials of the ministries in the board has expedited many actions. Efficiency of energy companies has also increased; huge capacity building activities both in Power and Energy sector is continuing. But people's expectations are even more. Higher pay scale for power sector officials could be successfully introduced. The present successes could be achieved for expedited decisions of the respective boards. Professionals have not been ignored rather due participation of experts on Power-Energy, administration, finance, legal, private sector etc. are ensured. Bangladesh is lagging way behind other regional countries in oil and gas exploration. It is being told that success would be achieved if it is possible to take actions through special arrangements and under special allocations, stepping aside the government procurement process. That would reduce requirements for importing LNG. What are your views Please note that whenever the Awami League government got opportunity, it stressed upon exploration of own primary fuel. But those were not enough to match with the demand growth. The special act has not been made for the power sector alone. It was equally applicable for energy sector as well. Energy sector could utilize it like power sector. Capacity building of BAPEX are being continued. We know identification of primary fuel reserve and its exploration is time consuming and specially off shore drilling is very much expensive. We have to see how much it can be expedited. The SDG 7 talks about sustainable power and energy supply to all at affordable price. It is rather a reflection of Bangabandhu's Energy Vision. His plan was ensuring this through exploration and exploitation of own primary fuel and mineral resources. But the present government has moved out of mining own coal while the exploration of petroleum resources lost dynamism. How then supplying power at affordable cost would be possible The prices of power and energy in Bangladesh are still the cheapest as compared to other Asian countries. Much before the SDG 7, Bangabandhu had started working on supplying power at affordable cost. The present government is also following his footprint. Of course, the growing reliance on imported coal, liquid fuel and LNG would put price pressure. Work is going on to ensure how the import reliance can be kept under control. Use of nuclear power and power import would be relatively less expensive. Off-shore wind power, floating solar, wave energy, run-off river etc. can reduce necessity of primary fuel. Exploration for own petroleum especially offshore exploration must be given the highest priority. There is no denial that we are lagging way behind here. What actions do you think needs to be taken for completely materializing Bangabandhu Energy Vision towards achieving sustainable energy security? There is no option now but to increase manifold the renewable energy use. We achieved commendable success in Solar Home System (SHS). Efforts are ongoing for expanding the grid connected solar. Wind map surveys have been conducted. More surveys need to be made. Under Mujib Climate Prospective Plan, onshore, offshore and wind power development have been included. Rooppur nuclear power plant is now a reality. It will start operation from 2023. How you will evaluate the role of Bangabandhu's daughter for implementing this milestone project Some people would always criticize any action. Bangladesh took initiative for nuclear power plant at the most appropriate time taking the nuclear security with most high importance. At the same time, right actions have been taken for developing competent own human resources to operate the plant. The human capital development plan was initiated from 2015. By the time the plant is ready, our own human resource hopefully would be in a position to gradually take over the responsibility of operating the plant. Side by side the assistance of NRB experts is also being taken. Bangladesh is blessed with substantial reserve of superior quality bituminous coal. But for lack of political decision, this resource remains unexploited. The anti-coal movement in Bangladesh also gathered momentum. But coal still remains the cheapest fuel for power generation. What are your views? There is no doubt that coal mining needs to be technically sound, economically feasible; then a political decision. Our Prime Minister is a people's leader. Mining coal is in her vision. But environment and rehabilitation also rank high in the government agenda. Again, net zero global vision also is an impediment for mining coal. Our negligible carbon footprint does not cause any obligation for not mining coal. But for carbon emission control, we cannot go against the global popular opinion so easily. We need to access our coal resource, but going against local and global sentiment, it would not be easy taking decision for mining own coal. What Bangladesh needs to do doing for achieving net zero global vision? Is Bangladesh riding along the right track? Please note that our carbon footprint is negligible in the context of global emission. Hence we have no obligation towards reducing global warming. But the question is that the industrial operations and automobiles movement would not reduce carbon emissions. Rice cultivation would increase carbon emission. But we have to have a way of neutralizing this through increasing oxygen generation. Bangladesh wants doing this through increasing afforestation. We are actively considering how the carbon emissions from power plants can be neutralized through creating green belt around each power plant. Carbon capture from the power plants, Hydrogen Fuel and renewable energy will increase oxygen contribution at the same time decrease carbon emission. Under Mujib Climate Prosperity plan 2030 we will work for net zero. What preparation Bangladesh is taking for COP26 Our Prime Minister has repeatedly pledged for limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C. She announced this in October 2020 as well as at the Leaders' Summit. Bangladesh has reiterated it NDC. The main focus of COP26 would be confirming proceedings of Green Climate Fund (GCF) up to US$ 100 billion annually. I expect that the GCF and Mitigation-Adaptation 50:50 would also be achieved from COP26 . \</doc>

Oct. 18 SINGAPORE (The Straits Times/ANN)  For the first time in the 120-year history of the scientific world's most prestigious award, the Nobel Prize in physics was given to climate scientists. During the award's announcement on Oct 5, three scientists were lauded for their efforts in shining the spotlight on humanity's role in causing the planetary crisis, and developing tools that can help countries deal with the impacts of climate change. The award comes in the lead-up to the United Nations' climate change conference at the end of this month  underscoring the urgency of nations taking stronger climate action to limit impacts. The conference, called COP26 , aims to finalise details that will help nations implement the 2015 Paris Agreement, under which nations make pledges to limit global warming to well below 2 deg C, preferably to 1.5 deg C, compared with pre-industrial levels. One of the laureates, Japanese-born American scientist Syukuro Manabe, 90, was among the first to show that pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere would raise earth's surface temperature. He had projected in the 1960s that the doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere would cause global temperature to rise by over 2 deg C. The senior meteorologist at Princeton University had also built the earliest computer climate model in the 1960s. Scientists today are continuing to fine-tune such models, which can help nations take action to reduce the impacts of climate change. Climate models show how the earth system responds to factors such as the amount of planet-warming emissions. The models will then project how things such as temperature, rainfall and sea levels will be affected. This link is crucial in helping scientists detect the fingerprints of climate change  which refers to long-term changes to the earth's systems  in weather events, such as heatwaves and droughts, The New York Times reported. Prof Hasselmann's work also proved that the increased temperature in the atmosphere was due to human emissions of carbon dioxide. Decades later, in August this year, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) declared mankind's role in climate change to be "irrefutable". Planet-warming carbon dioxide is emitted whenever humans burn fossil fuels or clear forests. The other half of the Nobel Prize in physics went to Italian Giorgio Parisi, 73, who unscrambled and made sense of disordered physical systems, from atomic to planetary scales. The earth's climate is an example of a complex physical system  and his work helped provide some structure for scientists studying disorderly systems. The physicist from the Sapienza University of Rome has also dealt with questions such as why the earth has periodically recurring ice ages. Ice ages were caused by changes in how the planet moved around the sun, affecting how much sunlight it receives. But while the climate has changed before due to natural causes, humans are warming the planet at an unprecedented rate. The laureates' work has had rippling effects through the generations  and inspired climate scientists in Singapore. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) senior research fellow Dhrubajyoti Samanta, who is from the university's Asian School of the Environment, was especially excited by Prof Hasselmann's Nobel win. Dr Samanta had previously applied the laureate's climate model while studying how the surface temperature of the western tropical Pacific ocean changes every 100 years. Prof Hasselmann's model explained how fast-changing weather patterns, such as changes in wind speed, can lead to slow-changing ocean characteristics, such as temperature. Singapore Management University's Associate Professor Winston Chow, who is also an IPCC author, recalls having read Prof Manabe's 1967 paper while pursuing his PhD in geography at Arizona State University. "It was definitely ahead of its time," said Prof Chow of the paper that outlined the meteorologist's climate model. "(His work) laid a strong foundation of how (climate science) developed over the next 50 years, and enhanced our understanding of the causes of climate change." Weather and climate scientist Koh Tieh Yong from the Singapore University of Social Sciences said the Nobel Prize "signals the growing significance of climate science", and could help spur developed countries to pump in more research funding for the field. "This means a less bumpy career path for the next generation of climate scientists," he added. At a press conference, The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences' secretary-general Goran K. Hansson said the award underscored the fact that declarations of the climate crisis were grounded in science. The academy selects the laureates across the fields of physics, medicine, chemistry, peace, literature and economic sciences. This year's chemistry prize, given to two scientists who developed a new tool to build molecules for various uses such as drug-making, also had environmental links. The tool lessens the impact of chemistry on the environment by reducing waste, for instance. As for the Nobel Prize in medicine, key contenders had been Hungarian-born Katalin Kariko and American Drew Weissman  the brains behind the mRNA technology used in Covid-19 vaccines such as the ones by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. Instead, the award went to two scientists for their discovery of receptors in the body that can sense temperature and touch. Science journal Nature noted that nominations had to be sent in by Feb 1  soon after mRNA vaccines were rolled out. Their impact on the pandemic was still unclear then. But scientists are positive that mRNA will be recognised down the road, Nature reported. Dr Hansson said: "The development of mRNA vaccines is a wonderful success story that has had enormous positive consequences for humankind... We want to give credit to the right people. And for the right discovery... So stay tuned." ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen recently said Bangladesh firmly believes strict implementation of the Paris Agreement is the only way forward for a sustainable future. The foreign minister made the remarks while addressing the \' Climate and Development Ministerial\' organized by the UK as the Presidency of COP26 .  We suggest that CVF-COP prosperity partnership may be a way forward, he said adding that they need political commitment to Build Back Better for a sustainable, prosperous and resilient future through shared responsibility and concerted actions. Dr Momen said Bangladesh has adopted excellent adaptation and mitigation activities to enhance its climate resilience. He said Bangladesh, as the first LDC country, established a Climate Change Trust Fund where the government has allocated nearly $443 million from her own resources. The minister said this year, as part of the celebration of birth centenary of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh is planting 11.2 million trees across the country.  We are going to implement the \' Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan\' to achieve low carbon economic growth for optimised prosperity and partnership, the foreign minister said. The country has also established a Regional Global Adaptation Centre in Dhaka with a view to disseminate local based innovative adaptation strategies, he said. \</doc>

Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen has sought support in the form of climate financing, rehabilitation of climate migrants, and transfer of green technology to address the challenges of climate change. He made the request when he met the Head of IMF and the Dutch Ministers in separate bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the meeting of the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) in Rotterdam, the Netherlands on Monday. He sought Dutch advice and assistance in building embankments and dykes in this regard. Dr Momen also suggested that the Dutch government may support Bangladesh in water management in the Special Economic Zones (SEZ) that are being developed in different places in Bangladesh. Minister Barbara Visser assured Foreign Minister Momen of continued Dutch support for the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100. It was also agreed that the two sides would work together to address the challenges of climate change. Trade Supports The Foreign Minister held a bilateral meeting with Tom De Bruijn, Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation of the Netherlands. At the meeting, Dr Momen urged the Dutch Foreign Trade Minister for continued preferential access of Bangladeshi products to the Dutch market for a period after the graduation of Bangladesh from the group of LDCs. He informed the Dutch Minister about the exportables of Bangladesh, and suggested that the Dutch importers may explore different Bangladeshi products and services, including pharmaceuticals and ICT service. Minister Momen also briefed De Bruijn about the different initiatives of Bangladesh in the area of climate change. He requested for Dutch development cooperation in the area of renewable energy and transfer of green technology. Dhaka seeks support to address climate change challenges Meeting with IMF In another bilateral meeting with Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Foreign Minister Momen sought support of the IMF in addressing the challenges of climate change. Dr also mentioned the steps taken by the government of Bangladesh under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in addressing those challenges. He flagged that Bangladesh is a global leader in the area of climate change adaptation. Dr Momen informed that Bangladesh had undertaken several projects to become climate resilient, and he requested support from the IMF for funding those projects. Georgieva appreciated the role of the government of Bangladesh in addressing the challenges of climate change. She also referred to the humanitarian position of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina by providing shelters to the Rohingyas who had fled persecution in their own country, Myanmar. Georgieva assured that her office would be ready to work with Bangladesh in the area of climate change. GCA Meetings Foreign Minister Momen is now in the Netherlands to attend the meeting of the Global Center on Adaptation, the Dutch initiative to develop and share knowledge and best practices for climate change adaptation. Dr Momen is the Board Member of the GCA, while Ban Ki Moon, the immediate past Secretary General of the United Nations is the Chairman of the organisation. The floating office of the GCA Headquarters, the largest floating office in the world, was inaugurated this afternoon in Rotterdam by King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands in presence of Board Members, Ministers from different countries, and several Heads of International Organisations. In the GCA meeting, Foreign Minister Momen stressed the importance of ambitious nationally determined contributions (NDCs) in the area of climate change by the major polluting countries. He insisted that it was the responsibility of the international community, particularly the major carbon emitting countries to rehabilitate the climate migrants, the people displaced from their homes and traditional jobs because of the effects of climate change. Dr Momen also highlighted the importance of ensuring the climate finance of at least 100 billion dollars every year, with equal importance given to mitigation and adaptation. Earlier in the morning, he chaired a meeting of the Ministers of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), the platform of 48 countries severely affected by climate change. In the meeting, the recent activities of the CVF were reported, and also the possible actions leading up to the 26th UNFCCC Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to be held in Glasgow, UK in November 2021 were discussed. \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 12 -- The full impact of the chain of events kicked off by the shocking hike in fuel prices - and the disproportionately higher transport fare hikes that followed in the immediate aftermath are just the start really - is something that will be felt, and recorded, over months. Higher energy prices are a reality that the country has gotten used to over the course of the 12 years that the Awami League has been in power, a deal we signed up to in exchange for a solution to the electricity crisis the country was mired in when it came to power in 2009 and the progressively greater scale of economic activity in the country that we have witnessed during this period. Even so, the way that it was done this time, and the why, the reasons put forth by the government, cannot but invite questions. With the view to arresting the losses of the state-run Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) in the face of surging global energy prices, the government on November 4 decided to hike the prices of diesel and kerosene by 23 percent, the biggest jump in one go in well over a decade, and in nominal terms, (Tk 15), equalling the highest increase ever in 2007. The move prompted the mass transport operators to call a strike the very next day, causing great suffering to the common people and bringing the conveyance of goods to a standstill. Three days later, to appease the transport sector the government agreed to a hike in bus fares by as much as 28 percent and launch fares by up to 43 percent. The transport owners then called off their strike. It all happened so quickly and sequentially, that you couldn't help but wonder if the actions were all coordinated according to some prior roadmap. "This is neither logical from the economic point of view nor is it in line with government policy. We are saving money from one place but its impact will be everywhere," said Mustafizur Rahman, distinguished fellow of the CPD, at a media briefing styled "Fuel price hike: how necessary was it?" According to CPD, there was a lack of political foresight behind the move that failed to foresee the domino effect it would set off in the economy. "How come a state that is so powerful in all aspects increase the price this way just because of a two-day strike? The price was increased unreasonably because of pressure from one group -- it is not a politically enlightened decision," Rahman said. CPD put forward an analysis that put the lie to the assertion that the government had no option but to raise prices. If the global oil price continues to escalate, the government would need Tk 20 crore per day and Tk 7,200 crore a year to offset the maximum amount of loss, said Khondaker Golam Moazzem, research director of the CPD. According to the CPD's calculations, the government will generate additional revenue of Tk 7,838 crore from the BPC in the form of import duty and value-added tax. The government could have temporarily withdrawn the import duty and VAT to adjust the losses, according to Moazzem. "The decision to raise the fuel prices is not a politically timely one and the government should back down from this decision. There was an opportunity for the government to subsidise it and offset the rise in world oil prices," he said. It was also galling to see the decision being made with both Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and State Minister for Energy and Power Nasrul Hamid out of the country, away in Glasgow attending COP26 . Although the prime minister has not spoken on the matter, the junior minister did try to address the issue and assuage public anger, by promising that the prices would be readjusted back down agaion as soon as they fall in the international market. Naturally however, the state minister could not say when that might happen, since price movements in the international market are dictated by market forces. The IMF in its official blog does not expect the current surge in energy prices to ease until next year. "Our expectation is that these prices will revert to more normal levels early next year when heating demand ebbs and supplies adjust," said a blog post authored by Andrea Pescatori, Chief of the Commodities Unit in the IMF Research Department, along with two others. Hamid, speaking from Glasgow, tried to justify the hike by pointing out the government has also cut fuel prices in the past, in line with falling prices internationally at the time - but that was just a Tk 3 cut in January 2016. "Fuel prices were cut in 2016. Now fuel prices have been readjusted with the hike in global prices and to prevent smuggling," he said in the views-exchange meeting with reporters in Glasgow. The state minister maintained that the government refixed the prices of diesel and kerosene in the greater national interest, and pointed out the diesel price is still lower than in some neighbouring countries. "Today (Nov 6) diesel price in India's Kolkata is Rs 89.79, equal to Tk 104 per liter. The number of trucks entering the country everyday through the 26 land ports is also a matter of consideration. There is a possibility of fuel smuggling." An exceptionally rapid global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic-induced recession has seen global gas, coal and electricity prices rise in recent weeks to their highest levels in decades. Natural gas prices have seen the biggest increase, according to the International Energy Agency, with European and Asian benchmark prices hitting an all-time record last week - around ten times their level a year ago at the height of the pandemic. In a statement, the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources said, "Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) has been incurring a loss of Tk 20 crore per day as it is selling each litre of diesel at Tk 13.01 lower than the import price, and each litre of furnace oil at Tk 6.21 lower than the import price." Perhaps taken in by the atmosphere at the climate change conference, Hamid also talked about converting all vehicles in the public transport sector to run on electricity, something that he expanded on later in a Facebook post. "We have to go for electric vehicles. If public transports could be made to run on electricity, it will be environment-friendly. These will reduce spending on importing fuel," he said in the interaction with reporters. According to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), nearly half of the northern region's 691,437 hectares of land under irrigation, or 48.5 percent to be more precise, rely on diesel-run pumps. Reportedly, production cost in the agriculture sector has already increased by at least 30 percent in the northern region of Bangladesh. This will not only impact the ongoing harvest of Aman, but also the production of winter vegetables and Boro paddy. Shooting yourself in the foot Another strange aspect of the hike was actually how it took place. In a country where the police taking up a case and working on it seriously requires the intervention of the prime minister, how could such a move be implemented in her absence? Was she kept at all in the loop? And did she approve it beforehand? One suspects the entire delegation now in Glasgow would have some questions to answer on their return. But the prime minister was not the only one who could have leant any hike a measure of acceptance on the part of the public. If the decision was made with consultation with all the stakeholders and through a public hearing by the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC), as the law requires, the public could have been brought on-side. Instead, what we got was that BPC, which had logged profits of Tk 43,136 crore between fiscals 2014-15 and 2020-21 on the back of low oil prices in the international market, wrote to the ministry seeking an increase in the prices and it was done, according to CPD. That is not a good template for the present, and it does not bode well for the future. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Dhaka Courier.

Dhaka, Sept. 29 -- China's pledge to end overseas coal finance will impact 44 coal plants totalling 42,220 megawatts (MW) of capacity, according to Global Energy Monitor's updated Global Coal Public Finance Tracker. This will lead to cumulative lifetime savings of $130 billion and reduce yearly global coal demand growth by 30 million tonnes, adding up to 1,100 million tonnes over the lifetime of the plants, according to a press statement. GEM's newly updated coal public financing map depicts what is now at stake for the future of proposed coal plants outside of China as Beijing deliberates the precise terms of its pledge to stop building new coal plants abroad. Chinese President Xi Jinping made the pledge at the United Nations General Assembly last Tuesday. The news was followed by an announcement from the Bank of China on Friday that it would no longer provide financing for new coal plants and coal mining projects outside China starting October 1, 2021. Based on a September 2021 survey by GEM, 44 coal plants totalling 42,220 MW of capacity are currently under consideration for public financing from state-owned Chinese institutions, and could therefore be affected by China's announcement. The proposals are spread across twenty countries in Asia, Africa, South America, and eastern Europe. Among the affected countries in Asia, cancellation of plants with proposed Chinese financing would reduce their coal plant proposals by over 40 per cent. The biggest effects would be in Bangladesh and Mongolia, as the number of proposed coal plants in each country would decrease by over 90 per cent, making them nearly eligible for the "No New Coal" pledge. Currently, Bangladesh and Mongolia have the sixth and eighth highest pipeline of proposed coal plants in the world, respectively. If China's announcement excludes any future public financing, all 44 coal plants are at risk of being cancelled, given the lack of other financing options for new coal plants. Japan and South Korea pledged to stop public lending for overseas coal power earlier this year. Five of the projects are being considered for funding from the Bank of China, and are therefore at risk of having their financing from the bank cancelled as soon as next week The 44 coal plants represent over 40 per cent of the 103,000 MW pipeline for new coal plants in the twenty countries. If the coal plants are cancelled, it would result in savings of over $130 billion -$50 billion in construction costs and over $80 billion in fuel and operational costs over the lifetime of the plants. In Africa, the cancellation of the plants would cut the amount of proposed coal power by half, as China has been a major financial supporter of new coal plants in the continent. Cancellation of the projects would also eliminate the pipeline for new coal plants in Kenya, Madagascar, and the Ivory Coast. The reduction would make the three countries eligible for entry into the recent "No New Coal" alliance, a UN pledge for countries to stop building new coal plants. China's announcement will also have a major impact on the global coal market, as many of the twenty countries import the majority of their coal. Together the twenty countries were home to over 10 per cent of thermal coal imports in 2019, totalling 130 million tonnes. If the 44 coal plants are cancelled, it will reduce future coal demand in the countries by about 30 million tonnes a year, dealing a major blow to the prospects of coal exporters. In all, future global coal demand growth would shrink by 1,100 million tonnes over the 44 plants' lifetimes preventing an estimated 8,000 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from being emitted. "China's announcement is the death knell for overseas public financing for coal, and many proposed coal plants will be cancelled, given the lack of alternative financing options," said Christine Shearer, GEM's Coal Program Director. "The good news is China's move will save several countries from pouring billions of dollars into coal plants that will quickly become stranded assets, given the declining costs of renewables and public momentum for carbon restrictions." "Before last week, the world's coal producers were still planning over 390 new coal mines. But China's announcement just threw a wrench in the works," said Ryan Driskell Tate, Researcher and Analyst for GEM's coal mine tracker. "The coal industry is going to feel this cold splash of reality from head to toe." "China's announcement is a step in the right direction. It is also acknowledging the reality on the ground since investing in new coal plants no longer makes financial sense as other forms of energy are much cheaper," said Russell Gray, GEM's coal finance researcher. China is still home to by far the largest amount of proposed coal capacity on the globe, with nearly 97,000 MW under construction and another 163,000 MW in planning, according to GEM's Global Coal Plant Tracker. COP26 at Glasgow. According to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, pathways for limiting global warming to 1.5C require a virtual phaseout of coal power by 2040.

The CVF member nations include Colombia, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, and the Marshall Islands; V20 finance ministers from countries including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ghana, Haiti, Ethiopia, Fiji, Grenada, Honduras, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Philippines, Timor-Leste, and Sri Lanka; along with Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Environment, Forestry and Climate Change of Bangladesh. Formed in 2015 the V20 Group of Finance Ministers, Mustafa Kamal said, this forum is a dedicated cooperation initiative of economies systematically vulnerable to climate change. The finance minister said the V20 represents economies of a collective 1.2 billion people from 48 countries which are the most affected by the climate change and they are facing existential threats from its growing perils. He said that collectively, V20 countries will seek a transformational approach to global economic activities anchored in keeping global warming to below 1.5 degree Celsius while keeping the global economy on its growth path. 'We are going to set a clear pathway overcoming the real crisis of Covid-19 and climate change towards a recovery and climate prosperity as a whole. He said government and international agencies must seize every opportunity for protection of the most vulnerable communities through a close cooperation with the United Nations sand key development partners in order to ensure fast-tracked efforts in building resilience. Responding to a question, Kamal said there is almost zero emissions in the coal-fired power plants which Bangladesh is building for its economic needs. 'We use the highest quality coal in these plants'. He also claimed that Bangladesh has been spending more than $2 billion every year to mitigate climate vulgarities. Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Md. Shahab Uddin; Special Envoy of CVF Presidency of Bangladesh, Md. Abul Kalam Azad; Secretary of Economic Relations Division Fatima Yasmin and Secretary of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Md. Mostafa Kamal, also spoke at the press briefing. \</doc>

Bangladesh and the UK agreed to remain engaged on a durable solution to the Rohingya crisis, together with relevant regional and international actors. The two countries discussed the bilateral, regional and global issues at the 4th Strategic Dialogue held in London on Thursday. Both delegations exchanged views on the evolving situation in Afghanistan. Foreign Secretary Masud Bin Momen led the Bangladesh delegation at the talks while his British counterpart Sir Philip Barton, Permanent Under-Secretary of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) led the UK side. The Bangladesh Foreign Secretary urged the UK to review the current travel restrictions on Bangladesh as a matter of priority, considering the steady improvement in the Covid-19 infection and vaccination rates. Bangladesh and the United Kingdom reaffirmed their historic and multidimensional ties at the 4th Strategic Dialogue. 'Bangladesh at 50 and the UK post-Brexit have the opportunity to further energize our bilateral relations in line with our efforts at resetting our foreign policy pursuit towards deeper strategic engagement with key international partners', said Masud Momen. Barton underlined the importance of the two democracies engaging with each other on a range of bilateral, regional and global issues. The two sides recalled the founding of the bilateral relations during Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's visit to London on January 8, 1972 on his way to the newly independent Bangladesh, when he was received by the British Prime Minister Edward Heath. Indo-Pacific: UK sees Bangladesh as "critical stability provider" Photo:Courtesy Both Bangladesh and the UK renewed their commitment to climate action, including by combining forces of the UK's COP26 Presidency and Bangladesh's leadership of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF).

Sep. 27 Kolkata(The Statesman/ANN)- Last week President Joe Biden, in announcing on video the Australia/United Kingdom/United States deal called Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison "that fellow from Down Under" in what appears to be a senior moment. The military alliance has upset a lot of people from China, France and even their own commentators. Has Australia, one of the four advanced OECD countries from the Asian region (Japan, South Korea and New Zealand) seriously thought through AUKUS implications on her Asian neighbours? First, do eight nuclear submarines by 2040 make serious military sense for Australian security? We can understand that a maritime power in the South Pacific with lots of coastal waters to patrol needs a strong navy. But as former Prime Minister Paul Keating rightly pointed out, China is a land-based power and being over 2,000 miles away from Australia, does not present a military threat to Australia. Assuming that the nuclear submarines will be similar to those planned by the United States, which will acquire 12 of the Columbia class nuclear submarines for $128 billion by 2030 (US GAO), Australia may be paying at least $85 billion for equipment that may be obsolete by the time they come onstream. By 2040, even the US Director of National Intelligence has admitted that China's GDP (22.8 per cent of world GDP) would outclass the US (20.8 per cent). Twenty years is a long time to improve defences against submarine attacks. Submarines have at best deterrent effects in conventional warfare, but their real threat comes from carrying nuclear missiles. But even the potential of carrying such missiles would invite enemy nuclear retaliation. This is exactly why Asean countries like Malaysia and Indonesia showed serious concern that the AUKUS deal may become a catalyst to the nuclear arms race. If that is the case, Australia would lose her status as a haven for nuclear-free living, something that New Zealand cares seriously about, which is why she distanced herself from the deal. Second, which businessman would spend nearly the same amount of money that he earns to point a gun at his best customer? China imported $100 billion in 2020 from Australia, with the latter earning a trade and service surplus of $55.5 billion. Then to spend $85 billion (with likely huge over-runs based on past experience) on defense against your top trading customer defies business logic. Third, the Anglosphere military alliance created a split in Europe, already sore after Brexit and Kabul. France is not only the first foreign ally of the United States (helping in the US Independence War against Britain), but also has serious Indo-Pacific interests with 93 per cent of her maritime economic exclusivity zone (10.2 million sq.km), the second largest in the world, located there. Fourth, you have to ask whether Australian military intelligence is an oxymoron when they recently ordered 70-tonne US Abram tanks that are too heavy to carry by train nor across Northern Territory bridges by road to defend the Northern Australian coast. Her Asian neighbours would be much happier if Australia took the lead in the Asia-Pacific region on climate change, rather than spending on arms. Amongst the rich countries, Australia has the highest per capita emission rate, similar to the US. But out of 200 countries, Australia ranks fifth or sixth as the biggest global emitter, so her voice on fulfilling the requirements of the Paris Accord matters. Unfortunately, given the huge influence of the mining lobby, Australia may not even achieve her Paris agreement goal to cut emissions by 26-28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, let alone improve on that commitment by COP26 . The latest World Bank model suggests that the global decline in biodiversity and collapse in ecosystem services such as wild pollination, food from marine fisheries and timber from native forests could result in a $2.7 trillion decline in global GDP by 2030. The injustice is that the poorest countries, including those in Asia-Pacific will bear most of such eco-system and GDP losses. In particular, many indigenous people whose livelihood depends on nature will bear the costs of loss of habitat and livelihoods. Why are we not surprised that on 13 September 2007, when the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was adopted by 144 member countries, the four votes against were the Anglosphere countries of Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States? In these four rich countries, the record of treatment of Indigenous People has been shameful, such as the unmarked graves of indigenous school children in forced assimilation schools in Canada. According to Human Rights Watch, Aboriginal and Torres Islander people comprise 29 per cent of the Australian adult prison population, but just 3 per cent of the population. In the US, states with large native populations have incarceration rates for American Indians up to seven times that of whites. The AUKUS military alliance essentially signals to the world that money spent on war is preferred to money spent on social justice at home and concerns for people and planet. Who really profits from the nuclear submarine contract? Look no further than the exclusive submarine suppliers such as General Dynamics (US) and British Aerospace (UK). The AUKUS deal confirms essentially that Australia opts to sink or swim with their rich Anglosphere few, rather than the global many.

Vulnerable economies on Thursday called upon the rich nations to avert global climate-Covid economic threat. The 48 most vulnerable economies demand '2020-2024 delivery plan' for the missing $100 billion annual Paris Agreement climate assistance. Led by Bangladesh as chair of the V20, the world's most climate vulnerable economies met virtually as heads of state and government, ministers of finance and economy, together with leaders of the United Nations, partner economies and the global financial system to address the compound, destabilizing effect of climate disasters and the Covid-19 pandemic on low- and middle-income economies. The 'Vulnerable Twenty' (V20) Group of Finance Ministers released a Communique that called for leadership by industrialized nations and cooperation to urgently transform and align the global economic system with the goals of the Paris Climate treaty for a more robust, greener, and equitable recovery. The first 'Climate Vulnerables Finance Summit' was opened by Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. She said every country must pursue an ambitious target to curb Greenhouse gas emissions to keep global temperatures from rising to 1.5\'baC. "This target has been approved through a global consensus, but we have not observed any visible action', said the Prime Minister adding that 'I urge all, particularly the G20 nations to show their actions.' She indicated that the tragedies faced by the most vulnerable will haunt the world economy if urgent action is not taken and the economic and financial support needs of the V20 are not met, stating that 'Developed nations need to articulate a concrete delivery plan on how the shortfall of annual climate finance will be met between 2020 and 2024. They should facilitate the green recovery of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF)-V20 by providing monetary assistance, transferring technology, and building capacity. Dedicated support in the form of guarantees required for reducing the cost of capital and encouraging private sector participation. Affluent nations must help CVF-V20 countries by closing the existing financial gaps including in protection against climate-induced disasters. To this end, our countries need financial support to introduce smart insurance premium subsidies and capitalization of insurance products.' The V20 Communique urged individual developed countries that have failed their contributions towards ensuring the collective $100 billion per year in climate finance support to take urgent steps to fulfil their part of the agreed funding well prior to COP26 , for the sake of international climate action and cooperation. Developed countries were specifically called upon to indicate how and when they will catch up with a concrete 'Delivery Plan' outlining the way in which the entirety of the agreed financing will be met during and over the years 2020-2024. The V20 also urged developed countries to align their contributions under UN agreements by allocating public international climate finance to ensure at least 50% of resources for urgent adaptation needs as the climate crisis continued to disproportionately plague economies most exposed to its risks amid the COVID pandemic's shocks. The Communique indicated that annual levels of loss and damage caused by climate consequences in the V20 were already more costly than any amount of climate finance received or promised by the richest, most responsible nations. The V20 also highlighted several joint initiatives with the G20, Asian Development Bank, World Bank, and UN agencies it is spearheading to respond to actual climate financing needs of economies systemically vulnerable to climate change, including: A new program of national 'Climate Prosperity Plans' to diffuse climate threats on economic progress and seize transition opportunities by prioritizing climate-resilient and low carbon development investments while maximizing socio-economic benefits for 1.2 billion people living in countries most vulnerable to climate change. A 'Climate Prosperity Recovery Agenda' towards fit-for-purpose Bretton Woods system for climate frontline economies, which pointedly called upon the IMF to practice more systematic surveillance of climate risks of all kinds so as to hold accountable those that finance pollution rather than focus on further penalizing economies facing disproportionate climate risks, and to ensure better access to crisis assistance. The Accelerated Financing Mechanism (AFM) to bring down the cost of capital by unlocking at least USD 30 billion of private sector investments through optimized financial de-risking for resilient infrastructure and renewable energy, working through MDBs and national banks. The Sustainable Insurance Facility to provide climate-smart insurance for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and part of the InsuResilience Global Partnership to provide financial protection for 500 million people in vulnerable developing countries by 2025. The V20 encouraged economic partners and multilateral financial institutions to cooperate for the success of these programs while also launching its 'Vision 2025.' This V20 Vision sent a clear signal on vulnerable economies' intentions to leverage trillions in new green investments, overcome capital cost challenges, close the financial protection gap, boost job growth in a just transition for workers, and, to rapidly deploy renewable energy to power economic activities. Bangladesh also presented the first V20 'Mujib' Climate Prosperity Plan - Decade 2030, named in honour of the birth centenary of the country's 'Father of the Nation', Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, which aims to secure its economic future threatened by climate risks while supporting robust delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals. A blueprint for future Climate Prosperity Plans to be implemented among V20 countries, the V20 jointly highlighted how implementation of prosperity plans would create important opportunities for green economic and resilient cooperation and investment partnerships. Commenting on the Climate Prosperity Plan announcement at the V20 Summit, Prime Minister Hasina said the CVF initiated a new Climate prosperity program to move from climate vulnerability to climate resilience and then turn climate resilience into climate prosperity. "The program aims to leverage green growth opportunities to the maximum. Through this summit, I would urge Honorable Finance Ministers, Development Partners, International Financial Institutions, and Multilateral Development Banks across the globe to find innovative financing solutions for climate prosperity.' Presiding the V20 Ministerial Dialogue that put forward the Communique, Bangladesh Finance Minister and V20 Chair AHM Mustafa Kamal said they are setting a clear pathway through the dual crises of COVID-19 and climate towards a just and green recovery through the Climate Prosperity Agenda. He said governments and multilateral organizations must seize every opportunity to save the planet and strengthen protection for the most vulnerable communities. "This V20 Summit provides the opportunity to chart a pathway forward, with speed and scale for bold and concerted new economic and financial responses that truly deliver for vulnerable people and economies around the world.' The V20 Summit was opened by the Heads of State/Government of Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Colombia, Costa Rica and the Marshall Islands, together with some 30 finance and economy Ministers and senior representatives of the V20 and G20, the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry, World Bank President David Malpass, 8th Secretary-General of the United Nations and Chair of the Board of the Global Center on Adaptation Ban Ki-moon, the heads of the Asian Development Bank, Asian Infrastructure Development Bank, European Investment Bank, Global Environment Facility, Green Climate Fund, as well as high level representatives of the International Monetary Fund and a range of UN and international partners of the V20. It was also indicated by Bangladesh during the V20 Summit that the CVF-V20 member states are working through a series of regional and global member dialogues to prepare with a view to ultimately launch at UNFCCC COP26 the 'Dhaka-Glasgow Declaration' to further put forward the perspectives of the climate threatened nations for a successful outcome to the OctoberNovember 2021 Glasgow conference. \</doc>

Children in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India are among those most at risk of the impacts of climate change, threatening their health, education, and protection, according to a new Unicef report launched Friday. Bangladesh ranked second among South Asian countries and 15th globally in Unicef's index "The Climate Crisis Is a Child Rights Crisis: Introducing the Children's Climate Risk Index." The index, first of its kind, ranked countries based on children's exposure to climate and environmental shocks, such as cyclones and heatwaves, as well as their vulnerability to those shocks based on their access to essential services. Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and India are among four South Asian countries where children are at extremely high risk of the impacts of the climate crisis, with global rankings of 14, 15, 15, and 26. Nepal is ranked 51, Sri Lanka is at 61st place. Bhutan is ranked 111, with children at relatively lower risk. South Asian countries are among the most vulnerable globally to the impacts of climate change. Extreme climate-related events - heatwaves, storms, floods, fires and droughts - affect more than half of the region's population every year and continue to burden their economies. Worse, before they can recover from one disaster, another one strikes, reversing any progress made. Also, rising global temperatures and changing weather patterns have put the futures of millions of children living in climate-vulnerable areas in South Asia at constant risk. Around 1 billion children live in one of the 33 countries classified as "extremely high-risk," including the four South Asian countries. "For the first time, we have clear evidence of the impact of climate change on millions of children in South Asia. Droughts, floods, air pollution and river erosion across the region have left millions of children homeless and hungry, and without any healthcare and water," said George Laryea-Adjei, Unicef regional director for South Asia. South Asia is home to over 600 million children and has the highest number of young people globally. The report found that these South Asian children are in constant danger from riverine floods and air pollution, but also that investments in child health, nutrition, and education can make a significant difference to protect children from climate change. "Together, climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic have created an alarming crisis for South Asian children. The time to act is now - if we invest in water, healthcare and education, we can protect their futures from the impacts of a changing climate and degrading environment," Laryea-Adjei said. The report also reveals a disconnect between where greenhouse gas emissions are generated, and where children are enduring the most significant climate-driven impacts. The 33 extremely high-risk countries, including four from South Asia, collectively emit just 9% of global CO2 emissions. Conversely, the 10 highest emitting countries collectively account for nearly 70% of global emissions. "The frightening environmental changes we are seeing across the planet are being driven by a few but experienced by many in South Asia," Laryea-Adjei said. "We must urgently reduce greenhouse gas emissions and work together as a community to build greater resilience in South Asia. Children and young people are at the heart of this change, with almost half of 1.8 billion people below the age of 24 in South Asia." Compared to adults, children require more food and water per unit of their body weight, are less able to survive extreme weather events, and are more susceptible to toxic chemicals, temperature changes and diseases, among other factors. Without the urgent action required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally, children will continue to suffer the most. So, Unicef urged governments, businesses and relevant actors to increase investment in climate adaptation and resilience in key services for children and cut greenhouse gas emissions. Countries must reduce their emissions by at least 45% (compared to 2010 levels) by 2030 to keep warming to no more than 1.5\'b0C, it said. Also, the Unicef report suggested providing children with climate education and green skills, critical for their adaptation to and preparation for the effects of climate change and including young people in all national, regional and international climate negotiations and decisions, including at COP26 . \</doc>

South Korean Ambassador to Bangladesh Lee Jang-keun on Thursday handed over a frame containing copies of historical documents to Bangladesh that demonstrates Korea's official recognition of the newly-independent Bangladesh on May 12, 1972. Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen received the documents from the Ambassador during their meeting at State guesthouse Padma. Ambassador Lee expressed his sincere gratitude for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's commitment to send a video message for the upcoming 2021 P4G Seoul Summit on May 30-31. P4G (Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030) is a global platform aimed at delivering inclusive and transformative solutions to meet the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement. S Korean envoy shares historical documents with FM Momen The Summit will be the first multilateral Summit on environment to be hosted by Korea and will serve as a stepping stone for several important climate-related summits this year, including the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in November, said the Korean Embassy in Dhaka. More than 60 world leaders, including Prime Minister Hasina, will participate in the Summit. Ambassador Lee underscored the importance of Bangladesh's participation in the 2021 UN Peacekeeping Ministerial to be held in Seoul on December 7-8 this year. Recognising Bangladesh's active support for the UN peacekeeping operations as the largest contributor of peacekeeping forces, Ambassador Lee invited Minister Momen to the upcoming Ministerial. Ambassador Lee requested Minister Momen's support for including all Korean nationals residing in Bangladesh in Bangladesh's COVID-19 vaccination programme with priority once the country's vaccine supply is normalised. S Korean envoy shares historical documents with FM Momen Korea seeks Bangladesh's reciprocal consideration as Korea has committed to vaccinate all foreigners, including around 20,000 Bangladeshis living in the. Recalling that Korea and Bangladesh will jointly celebrate the golden jubilee of their diplomatic ties in two years, Ambassador Lee expressed his commitment to make the occasion a meaningful year for the two countries and looked forward to working closely with the Bangladesh Government in this regard. \</doc>

Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen on Saturday called on the youths and the civil society to join hands with the government in building a sustainable and resilient future. "The government is doing its best to tackle the climate challenges,' said Momen, adding 'I strongly believe that participation from the youth and civil society can bring the best results for Bangladesh to achieve sustainable solutions." He was addressing at the Climate Camp 2021, where Nahim Razzaq, MP and Abul Kalam Azad, Special Envoy of Bangladesh Presidency of the CVF also spoke. READ: COP26 : Alok Sharma discusses climate issues with FM The foreign minister said to create awareness at community level is the first step to bring result in national level. Individuals, activists, community leaders and youth led organisations can bring solutions through sharing best practices for better adaptation and mitigation, he said. Dr Momen said, it is the responsibility of every citizen to save the environment, rivers and ponds from pollution. "Please, don't throw plastic items, plastic bottles, polythene bags indiscriminately,' he pleaded. 'Stop food waste and food loss, and try to conserve natural resources to help biodiversity. If we all do our part, we are little careful and conscious, we can help our planet earth," he said. Dr Momen said climate change is a global phenomenon that needs to be addressed through collective efforts and innovative solutions not only internationally or nationally, but also at local and regional levels. The impacts of climate change on the environment, the peoples and economies are being felt by every country on earth, he said. Bangladesh, he said, is experiencing extreme climate change impacts that are affecting national economy and development as well as lives and livelihoods of the people. On the other hand, Dr Momen said, the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has brought greater negative impact on livelihoods of the people as well as the economy of Bangladesh. Even during COVID 19, he said, Bangladesh has experienced severe floods due to the climate change. Heavy monsoon rains in upstream regions continue to cause flooding in 30 districts in the north, north-west and south-west of the country, affecting 54 million people. READ: FM mourns death of Ex.

Dhaka, Nov. 2 -- As the COP26 United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference takes place in Glasgow (UK), serious reflections are needed on rich countries' broken promise "to a goal of mobilising jointly US$100 billion per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries" made 12 years ago at the COP16 in Copenhagen. While minuscule compared with the investment required to avoid dangerous levels of climate change, non-transparency and double-counting make it harder to monitor the rich countries' broken promise. Meanwhile, poor countries are increasingly falling into debt traps trying to cope. Ironically, poor countries, though less responsible for climate change, are bearing disproportionate impacts and paying more for adaptation, recovery and redevelopment loans. The COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated their debt pressures. The UN warns that world faces disastrous 2.70C temperature rise on current climate plans. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) highlights "unequal burden of rising temperatures" on poor countries. CREATIVE ACCOUNTING, FUDGING NUMBERS: Rich countries' COP16 climate finance pledge of US$100 billion include finance from public and private sources. However, it does not specify the proportions of financing from different sources, nor indicates how different financial instruments, such as grants and loans, should be counted. Thus, the UN Independent Expert Group on Climate Finance notes that ambiguity and non-transparency in reporting allow double counting and inclusion of non-grant, non-concessional loans in climate finance. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), made up mostly of rich countries, reported US$80 billion in climate finance to developing countries in 2019, up from US$78 billion in 2018. The was based on reports from the wealthy nations themselves. However, the OECD's numbers are vastly inflated. For example, Oxfam estimated public climate financing at only US$19-$22.5 billion in 2017-18, around one-third of the OECD's estimate. Reporting by rich countries includes non-concessional loans while only grants and lending at below-market rates should be counted. Some rich countries also count development aid, e.g., for road construction, as going towards climate projects even when they do not exclusively target climate action. India disputed the OECD's estimate of US$57 billion climate finance during 2013-14, while the real figure was paltry US$2.2 billion, thus describing it as "deeply flawed, unacceptable". Other developing countries have collectively questioned creative accounting and green-washing of existing fund flows to paint a rosier rather a real picture. Moreover, the long-standing issue of whether funds are 'new and additional', as has been promised at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, has not been resolved. The diversion of development assistance counting as climate finance, for example, would be funding reallocated rather than additional or new. Thus, developing countries are losing out on funds for education, health and other public goods. CHAOS GALORE: Developing countries expected that the funds promised in Copenhagen would be dominated by public grants directed through the new UNFCCC Green Climate Fund. Thus, their own representatives would be empowered to help decide the direction of these flows. There was also an expectation that climate fund would be better coordinated and targeted. Instead, climate funds are funnelled through over 100 channels, such as developed countries' aid and export promotion agencies, private banks, equity funds and corporations, and lending and granting arms of multilateral institutions like the World Bank and regional banks. Very few of these are controlled in meaningful ways by developing countries. There are also several UN agencies supporting climate action, including the UN Environment and Development Programmes and the Global Environment Facility; but these are chronically underfunded and require pledges to be 'replenished' regularly by contributor governments facing other demands on their federal budgets. This makes funding insecure and future planning difficult. PRIVATE FINANCE: Negotiations since Copenhagen have also been characterised by a growing focus on private sector engagement in climate financing though blended finance. This raises questions about what types of private finance can be said to have been mobilised by developed countries, as was promised. The OECD estimates that private climate finance has been stagnating, at US$16.7 billion in 2014, US$10.1 billion in 2016 and US$14.6 billion in 2018. Statements on private climate finance mobilised by developed countries in poor countries are even more contested. There is no centralised body with the capability to ensure that private finance reaches countries most in need, or responds effectively to priorities such as climate adaptation and damages beyond repair. The OECD report reveals that only 3 per cent of mobilised private finance is helping poor countries adapt to climate impacts. As widely anticipated, private investments go where money is to be made or emission reductions can be counted. PROFIT BEFORE PLANET AND PEOPLE: The priority for the poorest developing countries is to receive adaptation finance to help them build resilience and adapt their infrastructure to the effects of extreme weather. But funding £daptation' projects - such as sea walls, early warning systems, or better infrastructure - is expensive and usually does not produce a tangible financial return. So, adaption projects have been shunned by donors in favour of easy wins elsewhere. Even though the Paris Agreement aimed for a balance between 'mitigation' and adaptation, most of the climate finance has gone to projects to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. For instance, in 2019, only US$20 billion went to adaptation projects, less than half of the funds for mitigation projects, according to the OECD report. Donors favour mitigation projects because success is clear and measurable - e.g., quantified by the avoided or captured carbon emissions - thus expedient for domestic politics, whereas it is less easy to define successful adaptation. Donors also become more visible globally for mitigation, e.g., helping to reduce green house gas emissions. The bias towards mitigation is also due to money being increasingly provided as loans rather than grants, and through blending with private finance. Helping people adapt to climate change does not generate money. So, private finance, in particular, does not have much interest in adaption and almost always goes to mitigation projects, such as solar farms and electric cars, that can generate returns on investment. Most of the climate finance is also going to middle-income countries, not the poorest, most-vulnerable countries. Also, these vulnerable poor countries are not receiving sufficient capacity-building exercises and training. For instance, the International Institute for Environment and Development reported that only US$5.9 billion went to the UN's 46 'least developed countries' (LDCs) between 2014 and 2018, less than 20 per cent of the amount developed countries said they had given for adaptation projects. It notes, "If this trend continues, this would equate to less than 3 per cent of (poorly) estimated LDCs annual adaptation finance needs between 2020-2030". And again, very little trickles to down to the actual needy - poor, vulnerable and worst affected communities. As the UN Independent Expert Group notes, the COVID-19 pandemic has further reduced climate finance delivery; thus this trend will continue or may worsen. DEBT TRAP: 'CRUEL IRONY': Climate finance provided in the form of loans rather than grants can push poor countries deeper into debt. It is a "cruel irony" that those less responsible for climate change are being made to pay a larger share of the price. When extreme weather disaster strikes, it is often followed by sharp spikes in borrowing due to their limited fiscal space. However, loans for vulnerable low-income countries (LICs) are, on average, more expensive than for high-income countries. Therefore, high climate change vulnerability and high borrowing cost means "climate debt trap". For examples, in 2000 and 2001, Belize was struck by two devastating storms; its government debt-GDP ratio doubled from 47 per cent in 1999 to 96 per cent by 2003. Grenada's debt-GDP ratio also rose from 80 per cent of GDP to 93 per cent when hurricane Ivan struck in 2004. Mozambique had to borrow US$118 million from IMF for recovering from cyclone Idai and cyclone Kenneth. The most damaging disasters since 2000 - 80 per cent of them - have been tropical storms and the worst of these disasters pushed up government debt in 90 per cent of cases within two years (if debt relief was not granted in the aftermath). As many of these LICs are already indebted, climate disasters and the increased indebtedness that they bring with them, are creating serious challenges for development. LICs spend five times more on debt than coping with the impact of climate change and reducing carbon emissions. FUNDING GAP: The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's estimate that US$1.6-3.8 trillion is required annually to avoid warming exceeding 1.5degC. Based on nationally determined contributions (NDCs), i.e., countries' own long-term goals for mitigation and adaptation, the UNFCCC's Standing Committee on Finance, reports that developing countries need cumulatively US$5.8-5.9 trillion until 2030. The UN estimates that developing countries already need US$70 billion per year to cover adaptation costs, and will need US$140-300 billion in 2030. The US$100 billion pledge has long been seen as a minimum, to increase over time. In July, the 'V20', a group of finance ministers from 48 climate-vulnerable countries called for a clear plan, setting out how the pledged amount will be met, including more grant-based finance, and at least 50 per cent of funding to go to adaptation. The Chief of the UNFCCC also said, "We need clear signals that commitments made by developed countries to developing countries will become a reality,. We still don't have those US$100 billion with clarity on the table." The fragmented climate finance system needs coordination and strategic targeting of support to areas and nations most in need, in line with their domestic priorities.

Jun. 10 Seoul(Korea Herald/ANN)- If emissions continue at the current rate, the Earth has about six years and 235 days before the effects of global warming become irreversible. That is what the Climate Clock installed on the roof of Herald Corp. headquarters shows as of June. To turn back the Climate Clock, Herald Corp., which owns South Korea's two major news outlets  The Korea Herald and The Herald Business  holds its first H.eco Forum on Thursday in Seoul. To give an overview of where we stand in terms of climate change and discuss what solutions exist to avert a climate catastrophe, the forum brings together policymakers, businesspeople, scholars and activists to share their insights, experiences and action plans. The forum's three sessions will explore the role of governments, businesses and individuals in fighting climate change. A special session is also to be held featuring celebrated artists who took part in the climate impact project. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, H.eco Forum 2021 is held in a hybrid format, with speakers based in Seoul set to give speeches in person and foreign speakers to participate virtually from where they are  from Colombia, Switzerland to the UK. Under the theme "We face the Climate Clock," the forum opens with a video introducing the Climate Clock  the science behind it and what it tells us  and the behind-the-scenes story of bringing the monument-sized clock to Seoul, which is the third to be built in the world. Last month, Herald Corp. installed the Climate Clock at its headquarters in central Seoul, as part of a campaign to raise awareness of climate crisis and send a direct visual warning that the Earth has a deadline. The first session looks closely into government policies, and the importance of international cooperation and political leadership in tackling climate change. Opening the first session is Yun Sun-jin, co-chairperson of Korea's 2050 Carbon Neutrality Commission, who is to present on the country's road to a green transition and net-zero emissions. Juan Manuel Santos, who was president of Colombia from 2010 to 2018 and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2016, will share Colombia's experience in protecting biodiversity and highlight the need for a global green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. John Murton, the UK government's envoy for the 26th round of vital UN Climate talks, called COP26 , is to speak about the UK's efforts to push governments around the world to strengthen their carbon-reduction targets in the lead up to the COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, in November, and four areas to focus on to overcome the climate crisis. The second session, which resumes after lunch, touches on industry efforts for a green transition and best practices will be showcased. Matthias Bausenwein, president of Orsted Asia Pacific, is to share experiences of the Danish firm's remarkable transformation from a traditional fossil-fuel company into a renewable energy giant and its vision for the world that runs entirely on green energy. Sam Kimmins, who is leading the Climate Group's global RE100 campaign, is to introduce how their initiative is accelerating change toward zero carbon grids at scale and why more companies should join it for their own survival. The session ends with Oh Jeong-hwa, director of Amorepacific's Sustainability Division, who is to talk about the cosmetics firm's eco-friendly drive to cut emissions in their production lines. Following the second session, a special session is to be held involving artists, who created a series of experimental artworks called "Heartbeat of the Earth," in collaboration with the Google Arts & Culture Lab and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Using their creative interpretation, the artists are to showcase their take on climate data to visualize rising sea levels, acidifying oceans and more. The third session is dedicated to underscoring the role of climate change activism. Yoon Hyeon-jeong, teenage activist for Youth 4 Climate Action, is to address the audience on how young people are excluded from making decisions surrounding climate change. American rapper Prince Ea, who has made motivational video content on various topics such as climate change, racism and spirituality, is to talk about how individual actions and changes to our lifestyles, habits and mindset can make a difference for the planet. Closing the H.eco Forum 2021 is a panel discussion moderated by Greenpeace campaigner Jane Yu. Activists including Kim Seo-gyung, who is a member of a global group of K-pop fans fighting for climate change, Jo Eun-byeol and film director Kim Jae-han will join the talk on the importance of solidarity for climate action. The event will be livestreamed on the H.eco YouTube channel at HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/33dCF4G https://bit.ly/33dCF4G To mark Herald Corp's first H.eco Forum, President Moon Jae-in, Vice Environment Minister Hong Jeong-kee and Rep. Kim Sung-joo, lawmaker of the Democratic Party of Korea and head of the National Assembly's ESG forum, are to give congratulatory remarks. Juan Carlos Caiza Rosero, Colombian ambassador to Korea, and Kim Dong-yeon, chairman of the Joyful Rebellion Foundation and former deputy prime minister, are also to present at the forum. With its new mission to take the lead in addressing environmental problems and the climate crisis, H.eco Forum aims to grow as a platform for insights and solutions to the climate emergency, an official from Herald Corp. said. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Dhaka, Sept. 17 -- Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is expected to focus on the issues relating to equity in vaccine sharing, sustainable recovery, climate change and Rohingya crisis at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). Prime Minister Hasina left Dhaka on Friday (Sept 17) morning on a two-week official visit to attend the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York and other engagements with a stopover in Helsinki, Finland. This is the Prime Minister Hasina's first overseas visit since the outbreak of the Covid-19 in March 2020. Earlier, she addressed the UNGA for 17 times and this would be her 18th joining the UNGA. The theme of this year's UNGA is "Building resilience through hope-to recover from Covid-19, rebuild sustainably, respond to the needs of the planet, respect the rights of people, and revitalize the United Nations." The Prime Minister will highlight Bangladesh's impressive development journey, inclusive economic development, and success in the health sector, said the Foreign Minister. Bangladesh will host a side event on the Rohingya issue titled "Rohingya crisis: Imperatives for a sustainable solution" where many countries are expected to voluntarily join. The OIC, ASEAN and European countries have already responded positively. "Covid-19 vaccines should be a public good without any discrimination," Dr Momen said adding that Bangladesh will strongly raise the issue. He said there will be a number of bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the UNGA. The Prime Minister will deliver a speech at a programme titled "UN Common Agenda: Action to achieve Equality and Inclusion." A high-level meeting titled "UN Food Systems Summit" will also be held this year. Another high-level meeting titled "International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons" will be held on September 28. On September 22, the Prime Minister will deliver her speech at "White House Global Covid-19 Summit: Ending the pandemic and building back better." The Prime Minister is expected to plant sapling on the UN headquarters premises, marking the birth centenary of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Ahead of the COP26 "We would seek to keep the global temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius, funding for both mitigation and adaptation," said Dr Momen. The Prime Minister is scheduled to leave for New York from Helsinki, Finland on September 19 after her stopover there on September 17-18. Wrapping up her official visit to New York, the Prime Minister will visit Washington DC where she will stay from September 25 to 30. The Covid-19 pandemic has proved to be the most challenging period the world has seen since the Second World War, said the UN Secretary-General on Tuesday. Newly sworn in General Assembly President, Abdulla Shahid of the Maldives, opened the new 76th session, noting that his country's flag is "flying at the highest peak today". He spoke of near-universal "collective anxiety" and hopelessness, not all of which is pandemic-related, saying: "The narrative must change" and that the General Assembly "must play a part in this". Programme Schedule Besides, Sheikh Hasina will attend the opening session of the UNGA general debate on September 21 and other sideline events in the UN headquarters (UNHQ) on September 20-24. She will also have talks with a number of leaders during her stay in New York. The PM is expected to return home on October 1 next. On September 20 (Monday), the PM will attend a closed-door meeting for a small group of HOSs/HOGs on climate change at the UNHQ at 9am, plant a tree and dedicate a bench at the UN Gardens at 11:30am in honour of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on the occasion of his birth centenary, and lay a floral wreath at the Peace Memorial at the North Lawn of UNHQ at 11:50am. On Monday, Sheikh Hasina will sit in two separate bilateral meetings with EU Council President Charles Michel at 12:30pm (local time) and with Barbados Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley at 2:45pm at her place of residence. Besides, she will join a virtual event of Sustainable Development Solution Network at 4:00pm. On September 21 (Tuesday), the PM will attend the opening session of the UNGA general debate at 9:00pm, sit in a bilateral meeting with Denmark Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in the afternoon and join Business Roundtable on US-Bangladesh Business Council at 4:00pm at the place of residence. On September 22 (Wednesday), Sheikh Hasina will virtually attend three events. The events are the high-level meeting of the UNGA to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action at 9:00am, White House Global Covid-19 Summit: Ending the Pandemic and building back better, and a high level side event on Rohingya crisis: imperatives for a sustainable solution at 3:00pm. On September 23 (Thursday), the Bangladesh PM will attend two programmes by sending her prerecorded statements. These are the Leaders' Network on 'delivering on the UN common agenda: Action to achieve equality and inclusion' to be organised by Swedish Mission to the UN at 8:00am, and the Food Systems Summit, as part of the decade of action to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs) by 2030, convened by the UNSG at 1:00pm. On Thursday, Sheikh Hasina will sit in four separate bilateral meetings with Queen Maxima of the Netherlands at the place of residence, UN Secretary-General Ant&#243;nio Guterres at 1:30pm, Maldives President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih at 2:00pm and Vietnam President Nguy&#7877;n Xuan Phuc at 2:40pm at the UNHQ. On September 24 (Friday), the Bangladesh Prime Minister will address the UNGA 76 general debate in the morning, sit in a bilateral meeting with Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte at UNHQ, and will virtually join a community programme. On September 25 (Saturday), Sheikh Hasina will depart New York for Washington DC by a Biman flight at 8:00am. She will stay in Washington DC from 25 to 30 September. Hasina is scheduled to leave Washington for Dhaka on September 30 and will return home on October 1 after a stopover in Finland.

Bangladesh and the United Kingdom (UK) have reiterated the urgent need for all countries to take ambitious action to combat climate change. The UK as President-Designate of COP26 , and Bangladesh, as Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, pledged to use their leadership roles to raise global ambition on climate action, according to a communique issued on Monday. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) issued the communique based on the recently held Strategic Dialogue between Bangladesh and the UK. The UK commended Bangladesh's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and strongly encouraged further leadership in the coming years on a low carbon development pathway. The UK recalled its priority encouraging all countries to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Bangladesh welcomed the UK's actions to secure international climate finance from all sources, noting this was essential for climate-vulnerable countries like Bangladesh, and for preserving critical ecosystems such as the Sundarbans mangrove forest. Bangladesh, UK issue collective call for £mbitious action' against climate change Both countries expressed appreciation for the UK-Bangladesh Climate Partnership, launched in January 2020, which facilitated the exchange of expertise and whole-of-society engagement. They said they look forward to strengthening this partnership through concrete actions. Rohingya Repatriation Recalling atrocities committed against the Rohingya people by the Myanmar military in Rakhine State in August 2017, the UK commended Bangladesh for continuing to accommodate over one million Rohingya. The UK and Bangladesh noted that this population placed a significant burden on Bangladesh, particularly for communities living adjacent to camps. The UK and Bangladesh reiterated their commitment to the goal of safe, voluntary, dignified, and informed returns to Myanmar as soon as the situation allows. Both countries acknowledged that the military coup in Myanmar has further complicated the situation. Both countries committed to working with the international community, including ASEAN and the UN, to resolve the crisis. Both countries recalled the Conference on Sustaining Support for the Rohingya Refugee Response, co-hosted by the UK, US, EU and UN in October 2020. The UK stressed the need to focus on Rohingyas' well-being, and noted that access to education and livelihoods would help prepare the Rohingya for return to Myanmar and to live more fulfilling lives while in Bangladesh. The UK committed to continuing work towards a political solution to the crisis that would enable Rohingya to return to Myanmar when it was safe to do so. Bangladesh, UK issue collective call for £mbitious action' against climate change The UK and Bangladesh agreed to explore the option of a high-level meeting that provides an opportunity for the regional and international community to discuss a collective approach to durable solutions, noting the need for international pressure on Myanmar and for support to the humanitarian response. Commonwealth Both countries reaffirmed their support for the Commonwealth and for commitments made by leaders at the 2018 Heads of Government Meeting. Both countries highlighted their commitment to shared Commonwealth values including human rights, democracy, the rule of law, sustainable development, environment, gender equality and women's empowerment, education and health, and international peace and security, as set out in the Commonwealth Charter. The UK acknowledged Bangladesh's commitment to protecting the oceans by tackling marine plastics via membership of the Commonwealth Clean Oceans Alliance. Bangladesh proposed exploring opportunities for promoting the Blue Charter Initiative. Development Partnership The UK congratulated Bangladesh on being recommended by the United Nations to graduate from its Least Developed Countries category in 2026. The UK reiterated its commitment to support Bangladesh achieve a smooth and successful graduation and continue its export-led growth by providing duty-free, quota free access to the UK market until 2029. The UK committed to work with Bangladesh to deliver free and fair trade by improving the functioning of the WTO and modernising global trade rules. The UK, as the second largest cumulative investor in Bangladesh, welcomed the inauguration of the UK-Bangladesh Trade and Investment Dialogue in February 2021. The UK hoped that the Dialogue, especially improvements to the business environment and tackling market access barriers, would promote free and fair trade between the UK and Bangladesh and help UK companies realise the potential of Bangladesh's impressive economic growth, to the benefit of both countries' prosperity. The UK noted the potential role of the City of London in helping Bangladesh raise the private capital required to fund the next stage of growth. Both countries agreed a dialogue on the future shape of their development partnership as Bangladesh consolidates middle income status. Bangladesh welcomed the UK's support in areas such as knowledge, innovation, and skill development, enhanced co-operation between British and Bangladeshi universities, and in harnessing the Blue Economy. In light of the pandemic, both countries agreed to collaborate more actively so that Bangladesh continues progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. This would include new and ongoing UK technical assistance and programmatic interventions to support the economic recovery and trade capacity building, improve learning outcomes in primary and secondary education, strengthen public health services, and tackle the climate change crisis. The UK welcomed Bangladesh's ambitious 8th Five-Year Plan and its prioritisation of recovery from the pandemic and highlighted the need for progress on development, including on poverty reduction, youth and female employment, and malnutrition. The UK stressed the importance of Bangladesh putting in place economic policies and systems to achieve its ambition of rapid, sustainable and green economic development; and pledged its ongoing cooperation. Bangladesh expressed interest in connectivity cooperation including for climate resilience and environmentally friendly infrastructure Both countries recalled Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's historic visit to London on 8 January 1972, including his meeting with Prime Minister Edward Heath, before returning to lead a newly independent Bangladesh. The UK commended Bangladesh's contribution of troops to UN Peacekeeping Operations. The UK reaffirmed its commitment to assisting Bangladeshi investigative, prosecuting, and judicial authorities in combating crimes, and highlighted the importance of compliance with human rights, including to ensure that those accused of criminal offences are not able to escape justice by crossing national borders. Both countries welcomed the sustained progress made in aviation security in Bangladesh including at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport and recommitted to continue close cooperation in further strengthening aviation security especially in the areas of sharing of best practices, training and capacity building. Dhaka and London also agreed to observe the 50 years of the establishment of their diplomatic relations in a befitting manner, including through exchange of visits at the highest political level. Bangladesh welcomed the UK's 'BritBanglaBondhon' initiative and expressed interest in jointly organising events involving the peoples of both countries. The two countries also discussed possibilities for enhancing sport cooperation and cultural exchanges. \</doc>

The main issue of discussion in the COP26 would be on the global commitment for achieving net zero emission by 2050, action plans and other related matters. The impact of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission has already rocked the world. At the US Climate Summit in April 2021, US President Joe Biden has urged the countries across the world to speed up their respective carbon neutral pledges. However, Bangladesh is not a polluting country and its carbon footprint is not even noticeable. Yet, it is a climate vulnerable country - one of the worst victims of global emission. It does not have any obligation to commit for reduction of emission. It has already made a commitment to reduce emission by 5% using its own resources and by 10% more subject to getting financial and technological support from the global community. Harsh Realities The earth is now 1.1 degree Celsius warmer than what it was at the start of the industrial revolution. It is not on track to meet agreed targets in the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, which stipulated keeping the global temperature increase well below 2 degrees C or at 1.5 degrees C above the pre-industrial levels. 2010-2019 was the warmest decade on record. If we go business as usual with CO2 emissions, the global temperature would increase by 3.5 degrees C by the end of 2100. To avoid that situation of warming (maximum 1.5 degrees rise), the world would need to reduce fossil fuel production by 6 percent per year between 2020 and 2030. Countries, on the contrary, were planning and projecting an annual increase by 2 percent annually. Climate action is not a budget buster or economy-wrecker: In fact, shifting to a green economy will add jobs. It could yield a direct economic gain of US$26 trillion through to 2030 compared with business-as-usual. And this is likely to be a conservative estimate. What is Net Zero? What is Carbon Neutrality? We are talking about net zero. But many countries still have no firm commitment, no concrete action plan or roadmap for achieving it. Only a few countries are contributing to major emissions, most countries have negligible carbon footprints. Approaching the target in an unplanned and uncoordinated manner has already created a global fuel market crash. Prices of fossil fuels - oil, coal and gas have skyrocketed. Impacts on the economies of developing and underdeveloped countries are being felt. Net zero emission refers to achieving an overall balance between GHG emissions produced and GHG taken out of the atmosphere. There had been too much harm done in the past. We are atoning for that now. We now have to tip the balance in the other way now to repair the damage already done. The irrational use of fossil fuels in unscientific manners needs to be controlled in a phased manner. We need to deal with all the emissions that have already been done over the years. That is the difference between zero and net zero. Following the agreed roadmap to achieving net zero, there would still be emissions but processes would be put in place to offset these that would neutralize the GHG to the atmosphere. These are like planting and developing new forests or drawdown technologies like direct air capture. The more CO2 that is produced, the more actions like sequestrations would be required for achieving net zero. To meet the goal of net zero, the new emissions of GHG must be as low as possible. There must be an agreed roadmap and action plans for phasing out fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas and transition to renewable energy. Is Net Zero Considered Important? Why is Net Zero Important? Net zero is balancing carbon emissions by absorbing the equivalent amount of CO2 from the atmosphere. All signatory countries of the Paris Agreement are committed to keeping the global temperature to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. A growing number of countries are making commitments to achieve carbon neutrality of 'net zero' emissions within the next few decades. It is not an easy task at all. Net zero by 2050 is the goal. Countries need to demonstrate by their actions that they are following their roadmap and these must be complemented with adaptation and resilience measures and mobilization of climate financing for the developing countries. Who are Major Emitters? Most emissions come from just a few countries. 100 less-emitting countries together contribute only 3% of the global emissions while 10 large emitters contribute over two thirds (68%) of the global emissions. Three top emitters - the USA, China and the European Union - together contribute 46% of the global emissions. So it is upto the major emitters acting quick to bring down their emissions to tolerable limits and assist generously the other developing and least developed countries with financial, technological and human capital in achieving net zero goals. How the World Can Move Towards Net Zero? Rapidly developing technologies are great news in global endeavors to achieve net zero and these are becoming more and more affordable. We have to power economies with clean energy, replacing polluting fossil fuels based power generation with renewable sources such as solar and wind energy. These dramatically reduce emissions. Renewable energy is steadily getting cheaper than fossil fuels. But these transitions would not happen overnight. It must be done smartly in a planned manner. Switching to electric transports, powered by renewable energy, would greatly contribute to lowering emissions. These would definitely improve the air quality of major cities of the world. Electric vehicles are getting relatively cheaper, more efficient and affordable. Many countries have already announced plans for phasing out the sales of fossil fuel cars. Other major harmful emissions come from agriculture livestock. These produce significant levels of methane, a greenhouse gas. These can be reduced drastically if we eat less meat and more plant based foods. Here again, it is encouraging to note that 'plant based meats' are now being sold in major international fast food chains. How to Manage Remaining Emissions? We must remove carbon from the atmosphere to achieve the net zero goal. The required solutions are also at hand. The nature-based solutions are forests, peat bogs, mangroves, soil and even underground seaweed forests. These are highly efficient in absorbing carbon. That is why the world is making huge efforts now for saving forests, planting trees, rehabilitating peat and mangroves as well as improving farming techniques. Who is Responsible for Getting to Net Zero? Every single person - me, you and us are responsible, in terms of changing our habits and nature in the way we live, which must be sustainable, causing less harm to mother nature and making the kind of lifestyle changes promoted by the UN's Act Now campaign. The private sector is into the act already through the UN Global Compact, which aligns businesses with the UN's environmental and social goals. National governments would be the main driving force through changing legislation and regulations for reducing emissions. By the end of 2021, countries representing more than 65 percent of global CO2 emissions and more than 70 percent of the world economy, have made ambitious commitments to carbon neutrality. The European Union, Japan and the Republic of Korea, together with more than 110 other countries, have pledged carbon neutrality by 2050; China says it will do so before 2060. How Much the Nations Serious to Their Pledges? Now it is being widely discussed how serious are the nations to their pledges? We have seen an infographic from National Public Utility Council, highlighting the world's carbon neutral pledges. The timeline of carbon neutral targets by country raises questions as to whether the countries are acting quickly enough following their NDCs to achieve the pledged targets? Is the world community realising that it would not be fair pressing developing countries to having negligible carbon footprints too fast. They need funding from the Green Climate Fund (GCF); they need generous technology support from the developed countries. Five countries have proposed legislation in the works, including Canada and South Korea as well as the EU. Meanwhile, 24 countries have their climate targets set as official policy. They include Brazil, China, Germany and the US, some of the world's largest emitters. 99 of the 137 pledges are only under discussion at this time, or more than 72%. That means that they have no official standing as yet, and are harder to act on. But as time started to pass, pressure on countries to act on their carbon neutral pledges started mounting. Bangladesh and Net Zero Goals Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has made a firm pledge for achieving the net zero target by 2050. The PSMP 2010 had included a vision for achieving a renewable target of 10%. It was doing extremely well as the global leader of Solar Home System (SHS) until becoming aggressive in executing its power for all vision. The nationwide extension of the power transmission grid has put paid to the SHS program. Some mini and micro grids, solar irrigation projects, rooftop solar using net-metering and a 187 MWp grid solar together added up to 3% of total generation capacity now. SREDA has announced a plan for achieving an ambitious 10% contribution of renewables by 2030. It will require a huge national movement. Rooftop solar mostly industrial rooftop, floating solar particularly in the southwestern region, solar irrigation, offshore wind are the options and opportunities. These days, solar technology is fast growing. Batteries have improved a lot. Even grid solar does not need huge land as used to be the case in the past. Bangladesh must launch renewable energy as a social movement to proceed along the national pledge for net zero by 2050 though Bangladesh's carbon footprint is nothing to worry about at this stage. It can still have coal power generation by adopting less polluting modern technology, it can still generate gas based power for another 20 years at least. In the transition phase, Bangladesh has to be extremely careful in choosing fuel mix. It must not try to do anything harsh. There is no mandatory requirement for reducing emission. Bangladesh's carbon footprint is not even noticeable at all. It can still mine its own coal by ensuring environmental safeguards and set up mine-mouth coal-based power plants using modern ultra-super critical technology. It can still implement all its imported coal fired power projects. But it must replace the liquid fuel-based power plants and old fuel inefficient power plants. Bangladesh also must measure methane emissions from waste dumps and animal farms. It must encourage use of vegetable-fed meat. There can be research done whether IRRI cultivation is creating methane emissions? Bangladesh must also aggressively develop energy efficiency. Many think Bangladesh can save 20% electricity through ensuring energy efficiency alone. That would cause less emissions. SREDA must star-rate all energy-consuming appliances as soon as possible. Required incentives must be given for promoting energy efficient appliances. Energy auditing must be done for monitoring consumption patterns. \</doc>

Dhaka, July 19 -- With global temperatures rising, along with changing weather patterns, sea-level rise, increases in droughts and floods, the world's most vulnerable populations are facing ever-increasing risks, food insecurity and have fewer chances to break out of poverty and build better lives, according to ICCB quarterly News Bulletin (April-June'21) published Monday. While the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), The world business organization welcomes announcements at the US Leaders' Climate Summit and G7 meetings of increased pledges for climate change mitigation and finance, these pledges do not yet place the world on track to achieve committed UN Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC) Paris Agreement actions. According to Climate Action Tracker, the sum of all the targets submitted so far would limit global warming to an estimated 2.4degC by the century's end. This is still short of limiting global temperature rise by 2degC - ideally 1.5degC - by the end of the century as per the Paris Agreement. More than a decade ago, developed countries committed to jointly mobilize $100 billion per year by 2020 in support of climate action in developing countries. But according to UN, the $100 billion target is not being met (the latest available data for 2018 is $79bn), even though climate finance is on an "upward trajectory." So, there is still a big gap in finance. The annual $100bn commitment, "is a floor and not a ceiling" for climate finance, according to the UN. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) estimates that adaptation costs alone faced by just developing countries will be between $140 billion to $300 billion per year by 2030, and $280 billion to $500 billion annually by 2050. This troubling gap should give the international community impetus to consider how to unleash and engage further action both now and over the longer-term across society. In the run-up to the next, UNFCCC COP26 in Glasgow, and over the course of the Paris Agreement five-year review cycle, governments have the unique opportunity to widen the circle of implementation for inclusive ambition, with a particular focus on countries' Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) as a vehicle. ICC - representing more than 45 million companies in over 100 countries and in its roles as Permanent Observer to the UN General Assembly and official UNFCCC Focal Point for Business and Industry - believes that UNFCCC and Paris Agreement Parties should revisit the scope and implementation of their climate policy strategies to assess how to enhance involvement of businesses of every sector, size and jurisdiction, in particular in NDC development, implementation and tracking at both national and international levels. The pandemic and its disruptive impact on societies, economies and businesses have compounded the difficulty of developing and delivering on NDCs, which makes it even more important to design practical and inclusive NDCs. Overcoming these challenges will require mobilization and agreement to commit to redoubled efforts across society and in particular from governments and businesses. While the involvement of multinational corporations and major international business groups in international climate action efforts has grown substantially, they are still an incomplete picture of what the broader business community, including MSMEs is capable of contributing at national and global levels. MSMEs are the foundation of global economic system- they make up 90 per cent of businesses worldwide, comprise an estimated 80 per cent of employment in many countries, collectively employ two billion people. Yet, they are not a dominant voice and presence in the UNFCCC process. It is suggested, governments to encourage MSMEs to take on appropriate climate mitigation and adaptation measures; develop good practices that are flexible to innovation across NDCs, in particular for MSMEs tackling the social and economic impacts of the pandemic and create a dedicated and recognized space inside the UNFCCC for enhanced consultation and dialogue with business and employers, inclusive of MSMEs. This private sector platform could also provide for practical and realistic dialogue on converging climate and recovery agendas.

Dhaka, Aug. 1 -- Projected reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are apparently falling short of what is required for achieving the targets of the Paris Agreement. This has led the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to launch its 'Climate Action: NDC Scorecard' on February 26. The report is supposed to assess countries' progress in meeting climate mitigation, adaptation and financing goals. This, according to Alison Kentish, is being done so that the NDC can assist nations to build resilience to climate change. Those plans will subsequently be critical towards fulfilling the goals of the Paris Agreement, in particular-- the significant target of keeping global average temperatures well below 2 degrees celsius above the preindustrial levels. The report has since indicated that "for limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius, carbon dioxide emissions need to decrease by about 25 per cent from the 2010 level by 2030 and reach net zero around 2070". It seems that "the estimated reductions fall far short of what is required." This has led climatologists to suggest that all Parties need to further strengthen their mitigation commitments under the Paris Agreement. It is a fact that many countries have registered mitigation measures in industry, agriculture and waste as priorities to achieving their targets. Some have also resorted to another pillar of mitigation through the adoption of renewable energy generation. This has been undertaken to provide clean power to populations and also facilitate transition to more efficient modes of transport. In this context, Adaptation Plans are being prepared to be consistent with already agreed Sustainable Development Goals-- primarily related to food security, disaster risk management, coastal protection and poverty reduction. These measures have assumed significance within a matrix where the world is still fighting the Covid pandemic and trying its best to find a common recovery effort. It is, however, important to note here that, as of now, despite efforts being undertaken in this regard, relevant data from some of the world's largest greenhouse gas emitters are absent from this report. This includes India, the United States and China. It would also be pertinent to refer here to a comment made by Marco Lambertini, Director General at the World Wide Fund for Nature earlier this year following the Fifth Session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-5) convened by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) -- "we are currently witnessing a catastrophic decline in our planet's ecosystems and biodiversity, and an accelerating destabilization of the climate." He has also correctly underlined saying, "what is new is that this awareness is beginning to reach mainstream political, corporate and public debate and the narrative is also shifting. Conserving nature is not only being seen as an ecological and moral issue, but also an economic, development, health and equity issue. This is a true cultural revolution in our civilization." We need to remember that tackling environmental sustainability is one step towards reducing poverty and its different dimensions. Interestingly, despite criticism from various environmental economists from different parts of the world regarding the manner in which Brazil is handling this problem, Marcus Henrique Morais Paranagua, Brazil's Deputy Minister for Climate and International Relations has pointed out that Brazilians believe in not only in economic development but also balanced preservation of the Amazon forest. He has stressed that "the Amazon forest alone occupies 49 per cent of our territory and over 60 per cent of our territory is covered today with natural vegetation." This has now led "Brazil to implement innovative public policy to balance nature conservation and the promotion of sustainable development." Many have, however, refrained from accepting that the Brazil Administration is taking all the required steps associated with an equitable and nature-positive framework. In the meantime the European Commission has unveiled an ambitious plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55 per cent from 1990 levels by 2030. EC President Ursula von der Leyen presented the EU's new climate policy with EU Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni beside her in Brussels, Belgium, in mid-July. This will involve sweeping new legislation aimed at turning green goals into concrete action. The proposals by the EU's executive branch, the European Commission, range from the de facto phasing out of gasoline and diesel cars by 2035 to new national limits on gases from heating buildings. It has been undertaken to become an example for the world's other big economies to follow. In this context Ursula von der Leyen has astutely stated that "the infernos and hurricanes we have seen over the last few weeks are only a very small window into what our future could look like." It is this probability that has persuaded Europe to be the first continent to declare to be climate neutral in 2050. Such an effort has obviously been treated with respect against the backdrop of dramatic weather events-- the recent flooding that has resulted in havoc and nearly 200 deaths in Germany, Netherlands and Belgium. The European plan involves a do up of the bloc's emissions trading scheme under which companies will have to pay for carbon dioxide they emit and also introduce taxes on shipping and aviation fuels for the first time. The new legislation will involve about a dozen major proposals - most of them building on laws already in place to meet the EU's old goal of a 40 percent cut in gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. It will however have to be endorsed by the 27 EU member States. We need to recall that world leaders agreed in 2015 in Paris to keep the increase of global warming to below 2 degrees celsius (3.6 degrees fahrenheit), and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees C (2.7F) by the end of the century. Scientists and climatologists are however observing after the spate of wild forest fires in different parts of the world that both goals might be missed by a wide margin unless drastic steps are taken to begin cutting greenhouse gas emissions. This is pertinent and appears to have led the EU to propose their latest measure. Von der Leyen has reflected on this by a clear statement-- "the principle is simple - emission of CO2 must have a price, a price on CO2 that incentivises consumers, producers and innovators to choose the clean technologies, to go toward the clean and sustainable products." However, given the nature of the proposed legislation, it is quite possible that it will face anti-lobbying from different industrial conglomerates over the next few months. Such opposition will be most likely from member countries like coal-reliant Poland and nuclear-dependent France. They, in all likelihood, will try to subvert this effort by pointing out that imposition of duties on foreign companies will increase the price of certain goods - notably steel, aluminum, concrete and fertiliser. The media has reported that the EU's sustainable finance strategy is based on a pragmatic realisation that the scale of investment required for achieving the desired goal will need a sustainable financial framework supported by private financial flows. They are hoping that harnessing of banks and markets will funnel hundreds of billions of Euros annually into sustainable investments and financial instruments. EU authorities and the European Central Bank are expected to calibrate the right pace for the transition by setting intermediate targets for the financial sector. Such a framework will be pertinent for assessing the effect on pension funds, asset management and those who have become reliant on insurance. The European Commission has consequently confirmed that it will publish taxonomy rules later this year for agriculture, certain industries and possibly nuclear energy. It will also consider new legislation to support energy sources that could help cut emissions, including gas power plants. As mentioned above, we have noticed some positive steps in terms of institutional thinking. However, G 20 Ministers who met in the fourth week of July in Naples, Italy appear to have failed to agree on timetables needed to reach net-zero global emissions by 2050 and keep global warming at 1.5 degrees celsius. United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry was present in the meeting. This has been seen as another setback. Instead, the Ministers only recognised "the impacts of climate change at 1.5degC are much lower than at 2degC." That obviously was not enough. This all happened while flood battered Germany agreed to roll out a US Dollar 470 million relief package to those affected by the devastating floods in that country. Strategic climate analyst Tom Evans has made a suitable comment-- "failure to agree a G-20 climate communique will be a stark warning for COP26 - where Ministers have failed, it will be nearly impossible to see how COP26 can possibly deliver on its stated mission of keeping the 1.5-degree goal alive". Those monitoring the evolving dimensions of climate change and the required measures for reducing the impact have highlighted the difficulty of reaching agreement on climate at the highest levels. They have observed that some countries have agreed to stop funding the use of coal overseas but have at the same time failed to halt its domestic use. Progress has been blocked by last-minute nerves, political tensions and a shortfall of funding. Both the recent summit of G-7 leaders in London and that of the G-20 were seen as staging posts along the path to the Glasgow talks. However, time for a pro-active ambitious positive scenario appears to be receding and running out. While the Biden Administration has taken some executive actions to tackle climate change at home and abroad, through upgrading and building infrastructure, and committing to halve US greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, we have not seen as yet any particular impact. Experts are stating that it will take possibly another nine years to halve greenhouse emissions. However, as evidenced by the recent fires and floods, the disasters are getting stronger. This makes it clear that governments need to re-strategise and develop immediate climate mitigation and adaptation actions that can be achievable in shorter timeframes. Alongside re-strategising, all government ministries and agencies and sectors also need to re-examine how vulnerable these sectors are to climate change.

Jun. 23\'e2\€  HANOI (Vietnam News/ANN) \'e2\€  Vietnamese foreign minister B\'c3\'b9i Thanh S\'c6\£1n has asked his UK counterpart Dominic Raab to support Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam in getting access to COVID-19 vaccines as well as consider transferring vaccine production technology. The two ministers held talks on Tuesday as the UK First Secretary of State and Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs Dominic Raab was on an official visit to H\'c3\~ N\'e1\'bb i, a trip S\'c6\£1n believed would help boost the Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam-UK bilateral ties. The UK diplomat reaffirmed the wish to strengthen the strategic partnership with Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam as the UK is implementing its 'Indo-Pacific' policies. The two sides expressed pleasure at the positive development in the two countries' relations, especially since 2020 when the two issued the Joint Statement on the Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam-UK Strategic Partnership: Development Orientation in the Next 10 Years and the signing and entry into force of the UK-Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam Free Trade Agreement (UKFTA). The two sides agreed to soon resume the exchange of delegations and key cooperation mechanisms such as the Strategic Dialogue, the Joint Committee on Economic and Trade Cooperation (JETCO), and Defence Policy Dialogue. The two ministers emphasised the need to take advantage of great opportunities afforded by the UKVFTA to create stronger changes in trade and investment cooperation, especially in potential fields such as digital economy, financial services, and renewable energy, contributing to post-pandemic economic recovery. The two sides also discussed directions to promote cooperation in the fields of security-defence, health, development cooperation, education and training, science and technology, as well as cooperation between the two foreign ministries. Vietnamese and UK diplomats hold talks in H\'c3\~ N\'e1\'bb i on Tuesday. \'e2\€  VNA/VNS Photo L\'c3\£2m Kh\'c3\£1nh Minister B\'c3\'b9i Thanh S\'c6\£1n requested that the UK, in the spirit of a strategic partnership, continue to support Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam in COVID-19 vaccine access as well as review the possibility of transferring technology for the production of COVID-19 vaccines to Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam. The two ministers highly valued Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam-UK cooperation in multilateral forums, especially the coordination at the United Nations Security Council during Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam's tenure as a non-permanent member (2020-21) and within the framework of the Asia-Europe Cooperation Forum (ASEM). The Vietnamese diplomat said Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam would work closely with the UK in ensuring the success of the COP26 conference on climate change hosted by the UK in November this year. The UK foreign secretary thanked Vi\'e1\'bb t Nam for its support for the UK's ambition for 'ASEAN Dialogue Partnership' status and accession into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) trading bloc. The two sides also exchanged perspectives on international and regional issues of mutual concern, jointly underlining the importance of the upholding of freedom of navigation, overflight along with maintenance of security and peace in the East Sea (known internationally as the South China Sea), promoting the role of international law and considering the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 (UNCLOS 1982) as the legal framework that governs all maritime activities. ___ (c)2021 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at HYPERLINK http://www.asianewsnet.net/home www.asianewsnet.net/home / Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \</doc>

Nowhere is the climate crisis more pressing or more potentially catastrophic than Bangladesh, for the simple fact that nowhere else do we see a greater swathe of humanity under threat from its worst effects. According to the Environmental Justice Foundation, by 2050, with a projected 50 cm rise in sea level, Bangladesh may lose approximately 11% of its land, affecting an estimated 15 million people living in its low-lying coastal region. It isn't something the country brought upon itself. As a late comer to industrialisation, the country's contribution to anthropogenic climate change, for which the Industrial Revolution that started in 19th-century Britain was a catalyst, has actually been minimal. That is why as the current chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a group of 48 countries that are most disproportionately affected by the consequences of global warming, it is working hard for a fair and equitable deal to be reached at the next UN-led conference on the issue ( COP26 ), set to be held in Glasgow in December. Experts have long bemoaned the fact that the wealthier, industrialised countries - the ones who have historically contributed the most to the depletion of the ozone layer - still put up a reluctant front when it comes to taking responsibility now for addressing the problem. 'Bangladesh has been hit hard with extreme weather caused by climate change for years. Climate change is a global phenomenon that needs a global solution through collective efforts,' noted climate expert Dr Ainun Nishat on the occasion of World News Day. Dr Nishat said they have been talking about climate finance for several decades for combating climate change impacts, but sufficient funds have not been allocated globally. 'It's necessary to sensitise global leaders regarding climate financing and keep their commitment to reducing carbon emission. The upcoming COP-26 Summit will create an opportunity to do this,' he said. World News Day is being observed in Bangladesh as elsewhere across the world today (Tuesday), highlighting the critical importance of credible journalism in providing trustworthy information about the climate crisis. They point out that per capita carbon dioxide (CO2) emission in Bangladesh is 0.46 tonne per year while it is about 10 to 15 tonnes per year in the developed countries. Alongside reducing carbon emissions, the analysts said developed nations must help Bangladesh with mitigation and adaptation efforts, necessary funds, resources and technology to prepare it for the inevitable losses of lives, livelihoods, habitable land, and the resulting human migration. Dr Nishat said Bangladesh has been witnessing frequent natural disasters like flash floods, cyclones, storms, increasing incidents of lightning strikes and landslides due to the rise in global warming, causing huge losses to human lives and natural resources. According to a recent report of Global Climate Risk Index 2019, Bangladesh was the seventh most-affected country in the world by 'extreme weather events' over the 20 years from 1998 -2017. A study by Brac, a Dhaka-based international NGO, said two-thirds of the country's land is less than five metres above sea level, and floods are increasingly destroying homes, croplands and damaging infrastructure. Besides, around 10,000 hectares of land is lost every year due to riverbank erosion, the report said. Food security at stake Bangladesh has long been witnessing an abnormal shift in its traditional six seasons due to changes in temperature, wind-flow and rainfall patterns, threatening the country's future food security. Renowned environmental expert Dr Atiq Rahman, who was recognised by the UN as one of the Champions of the Earth in 2008, said the country's farmers are facing immense difficulties with the cultivation of various crops due to abnormal weather events. Citing an example, he said, farmers face problems in the process of 'retting' required for jute plants, for lack of rainwater, while they cannot plant their paddy during the traditional monsoon period for lack of adequate rainfall. Dr Rahman, executive director of the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies, said the winter is getting less biting gradually in the country, but at the same time getting foggier. 'Crops are being affected adversely by the increased fog. The overall uncertainty in crop production in Bangladesh is on the rise.' Dr Nishat thinks wind-flow and precipitation patterns always play a role in breeding of animals and plants. 'The rise in temperature and changes in wind-flow and rainfall patterns ultimately lead to disarray in the agricultural calendar that has long been followed by the farmers of the country. It's also harming the food chain.' Besides, he said flash floods and droughts caused by global warming are affecting crops production in the country Rise in sea level and salinity At the high end of the estimates across both local and international studies, around 30 million people are 'predicted to be at risk' from sea-level rise in Bangladesh by 2050. Dr Nishat said the annual rise in sea level in Bangladesh ranges between 6mm and 20mm: 'It has a serious impact on the country as salinity is increasing, contributing to rising in climate-induced migration.' He said people in the coastal district of Satkhira are already migrating to different places being displaced by rising salinity - another pernicious problem that is also threatening the rich ecosystem of the Sundarbans - the world's largest mangrove forest, and a World Heritage Site nestled in the south-west corner of Bangladesh, right on the Bay of Bengal. Salinity mainly affects land and water in coastal areas. With the consequence of climate change, it gradually extends towards inland water and soil. This scenario of gradual salinity intrusion into the coastal areas of Bangladesh is very threatening to the primary production system, coastal biodiversity and human health, said researchers. The total amount of salinity affected land in Bangladesh was 83.3 million hectares in 1973, which increased to 102 million hectares in 2000 and thereafter to 105.6 million hectares in 2009 and continues to increase, according to the country's Soil Resources Development Institute (SRDI). In the last 35 years, salinity increased around 26 percent in the country, spreading into non-coastal areas as well. A study conducted by the World Bank indicates that climate change will cause significant changes in river salinity in the southwest coastal region during the dry season (October to May) by 2050, and will likely lead to shortages of drinking and irrigation water and cause changes in aquatic ecosystems. Sundarbans under threat According to environmentalists and geologists, if the sea level rises by just 1 meter, 70 percent of the Sundarbans, which also provides a natural protective shield against natural disasters (mostly the cyclones that originate in the Bay), will be submerged, destroying its biodiversity and environmental balance. As per the climate model projections, the Sundarbans area will face a 2-3\'b0 C rise in temperature during the 2050s. If the sea level continues to rise, approximately 491 sq.-km (11 per cent) of the Sundarbans (Bangladesh part) will be inundated by 2050, along with the flora and fauna, which will be disrupted throughout the forest and beyond. Dr Nishat said the Sundari tree, one of the most extensively found mangrove species in the Sundarbans, will disappear after 20-30 years if the salinity continues to rise. "Other plants and animals that can't tolerate salinity will also die gradually.' A study titled 'Combined effects of climate change and sea-level rise project dramatic habitat loss of the globally endangered Bengal tiger in the Bangladesh Sundarbans', warned that the Sundarbans' famed 'Royal Bengal Tigers' could be gone within 50 years, especially from the Bangladeshi part, because of constant rise in sea levels and climate change. A clarion call for the most vulnerable In her address to the UNGA last week, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina urged the rich and industrialised countries to cut emissions, compensate for the loss and damage, and ensure adequate financing and technology transfer for adaptation and resilience building. Addressing a closed-door leaders' meeting arranged for a small group of heads of state and governments on Climate Change at the Trusteeship Council of the UN Headquarters, she placed a six-point proposal before the global leaders with COP-26 just a few months away. The proposals include strict implementation of the Paris Agreement to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5 degree Celsius (from pre-Industrial times), and realisation of annual $100 billion climate fund from the developed countries (with 50 percent going towards adaptation and resilience for the most climate-vulnerable countries). Despite being a climate-vulnerable country with resource constraints, Hasina said, Bangladesh has emerged as a global pioneer on adaptation and resilience - thanks to the ingenuity and quest for survival of its people living on the frontlines of the crisis for generations. They are the people most at-risk as month after month and year after year we witness new temperature records being set that should leave no one in doubt: the problem is very real. We have only one planet. Now do we care to save it? \</doc>

, May 26 -- The UK financial sector's amount of carbon emissions exceeded the net annual output of most countries in 2019 as a result of worldwide investments, green groups claimed on Tuesday. A study by Greenpeace and the UK arm of the World Wildlife Fund comes ahead of the COP26 UN climate summit to be held in Glasgow in November. "As the host of this year's pivotal global climate summit, the (British) government can no longer turn a blind eye," said Greenpeace UK's Executive Director John Sauven in comments published alongside the report. "Rather than relying on self-regulation we need legislation that forces all banks and asset managers to align all financing activities with the goals" of the 2015 Paris accord to keeping the global temperature increase to under two degrees Celsius and ideally closer to 1.5C by 2050. "That would be genuine climate leadership," Sauven added. The report noted that banks and asset managers in the UK were together responsible for financing 805 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2019. This would have made The City of London - commonly referred to as the UK financial sector - as the ninth biggest emitter of CO2 if it were a country, higher than Europe's biggest economy Germany in tenth place, it added. Responding, the City of London Corporation said that while it "is showing leadership in the fight against climate change", it recognise "that there is no room for complacency. "London is consistently ranked as the leading global centre when it comes to green finance, a key part of the solution to tackling climate change," it added in a statement. Sauven said "banks and investors are responsible for more emissions than most nations", claiming that "the UK government is giving them a free pass". Greenpeace explained it had taken a sample of British and foreign banks and investors listed in the UK, adding that the study excludes insurers. The study found that UK financial institutions in 2019 funded projects worldwide that contributed to carbon emissions almost double that of the country's annual net total. "Trying to set a path to net-zero emissions without tackling the UK financial sector is like sticking a plaster when the patient needs open heart surgery," said WWF UK's chief executive Tanya Steele. Also reacting to the report, trade association UK Finance said "lenders take their responsibility to wider society very seriously and, together with the government and Bank of England, are playing a leading role in the shift to net zero finance". It pointed to the country's six largest UK banking groups last month becoming founding members of the UN's new Net Zero Banking Alliance, committing to net-zero emissions from their portfolios by 2050 or sooner. The report comes after the Group of Seven wealthy nations on Friday agreed to end state financing of coal-fired power plants by the end of this year, and to "mostly decarbonise" electricity supplies in the 2030s. Ahead of a leaders' meeting in Britain next month, G7 countries' climate and environment ministers have reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris accord.

Dhaka, Aug. 14 -- Climate change triggered by the increased emissions of green-house gases is undoubtedly the biggest challenge facing humanity in the twenty first century. Admittedly the failure of the international community to check the continued rise in temperature caused by the emission of green-house gases, can lead to catastrophic consequences. Therefore as repeatedly reiterated by the UN Secretary General it is absolutely essential to make peace with the nature, meaning thereby that there was no escape from keeping the rising temperatures below 1.5 centigrade as emphasized by the scientists and environmental experts. A report released by UN on Monday August 8, 2021 called ' Code Red for Humanity' says that the earth was getting so hot that temperatures in about a decade would probably blow past a level of warming that the world leaders have sought to prevent. The Climate change phenomenon has already started having devastating impact globally and Pakistan is among the top 10 countries which have been bearing the brunt of this climatic onslaught during the last twenty years. While the world is still indecisive-- and some countries including the major pollutants are even showing reluctance to cut down on the green house emissions preferring industrial growth over it-- the developing countries including Pakistan perforce have to devise their own strategies to minimize the impact of the climate change till such time a collective will and commitment of the global community crystallizes into concrete actions to deal with the challenge. Pakistan, under the stewardship of Prime Minister Imran Khan has given top priority to putting in place steps and measures that can be helpful in lessening the debilitating impact of the climate change. The central theme of the effort is to make Pakistan clean and green. It has launched a number of initiatives including the landmark 10-Billion Tree Tsunami which has won international acclaim, including from the World Economic Forum. Pakistan can also rightly boast about myriad of other initiatives including green economic stimulus, Eco-system Protection, Wild life management, Protected Areas initiative and Pakistan Clean Air Programme.Prime Minister Imran Khan has also inaugurated the world's biggest Miyawaki urban forest near Lahore on 9, August as part of monsoon drive under the 1o-billion Tree Tsunami Project. All the foregoing steps in the words of Prime Minister are driven solely by his commitment to future generations of a clean and green Pakistan to mitigate the impact of climate change. It is pertinent to note that Pakistan besides the measures mentioned above has also launched the initiative to produce 60 per cent of all energy in the country through renewable resources by the year 2030. It has already scrapped two coal power projects which were supposed to generate 2600 MW of electricity and replaced them with hydro-power units. Prime Minister Imran Khan has been a vociferous advocate of collective action by the world community on climate change. In recognition of his discourses at the Convention of Biodiversity, in the UN General Assembly and the nature based solutions devised by his government, UNEP approached Pakistan for hosting the UN Environment Day 2021. Prime Minister Imran khan addressing the moot apprised the world community regarding future plans of this government to deal with climate change, including Recharge Pakistan designed to divert flood water to wetland to recharge water table and Mangroves forestation which absorb carbon besides green-house gases. Explaining the threat faced by Pakistan due to climate change, he also urged the need for the world to pay attention to reducing carbon emissions which cause glacier melting posing threats to countries like Pakistan and Central Asia where rivers were fed by glaciers. He also called on the world community to assist the poor countries including Pakistan which were bearing the brunt of this phenomenon. Pakistan also co-chaired the multibillion-dollar Green Climate Fund, established to support climate actions in developing countries, last year. Pakistan as Vice President of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has also been playing a pro-active role in shaping the global discourse on fighting global warming. Perhaps a cursory glance at efforts at the international level to deal with the climate challenge would be quite relevant here.The first ever international Agreement on restricting emissions of green-house gases known as KoyotoProtocal was adopted on 11 December 1997. The Protocol operationalized the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by committing industrialized countries and economies in transition to limit and reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions in accordance with agreed individual targets. Those targets were stipulated to be met in two phases. But regrettably the required cooperation from the participating countries did not come forth. New Zealand, and Russia did participate in Kyoto's first-round but did not take on new targets in the second commitment period. Canada withdrew from the Protocol in 2012 and the USA did not ratify it at all. The second international agreement known as Paris Agreement, was signed on December 12, 2015 during the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC) 21st Conference of the Parties. The Paris Agreement marked a historic turning point for global climate action, as the world leaders were able to evolve a consensus on its framework and goals. But regrettably President Donald Trump pulled out of the Agreement like he did in case of other international commitments by US. However it is satisfying to note that President Biden has announced to rejoin the Paris Agreement. Not only that, in view of the urgency involved he also convened Leaders Summit on Climate on 22-23 April, 2021 attended by 41 countries including Pakistan.The Summit underscored the urgency and the economic benefits of stronger climate action. Its deliberations are considered to be a key milestone on the road to the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) this November in Glasgow. While Pakistan celebrates its 74th Independence Day this year on 14th August, the nation apart from other moves initiated by the government to achieve the objectives of independence, can rightly take pride in the fact that it has not only set the ball rolling in the right direction in regards to saving the country from the vagaries of the climate change but has also made a sterling contribution to this global cause.The initiatives taken by Pakistan are surely worth emulating by the world community, particularly the developing countries.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Thursday placed a five-point proposal, including the green recovery of climate vulnerable countries with support from the developed nations, as the climate change has brought them to a threshold. 'Developed nations should facilitate the green recovery of the CVF-V20 countries. Dedicated support is required for reducing the cost of capital and encouraging private sector participation,' she said while placing her proposals in the first V20 Climate Vulnerable Finance Summit. Sheikh Hasina, also the President of Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), opened the Summit organised by Finance Ministers of the Vulnerable Twenty (V-20), joining it virtually from her official residence Ganobhaban. 'Fund flow must be predictable, balanced, innovative and incremental. Development partners and international financial institutions should adopt a user-friendly process of fund allocation and disbursement. There must be synergies among various climate funds,' she said in the third proposal. 'Rich nations must help CVF-V20 countries by closing the existing financial gaps in protecting climate-induced disasters. Financial support is needed to introduce smart insurance premium subsidies and capitalization of insurance products for CVF countries,' said Hasina, placing the fourth proposal. 'Finally, every vulnerable country may actively consider adopting a 'climate prosperity plan' like our 'Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan.' I request the international community to provide all-out support to realize our plans,' she said, putting forward the fifth proposal. The Prime Minister said Earth is in a dire state. 'We must be sensible in our actions. Let's work together to build a strong climate resilience world.' She urged the finance ministers, development partners, international financial institutions, and multilateral development banks to find innovative financing solutions for climate prosperity. Hasina said the disastrous impacts of climate change mainly caused by GreenHouse Gas emissions are loudly visible around the world. 'We must reverse these for our survival and survival of our future generations,' she added. The 48 countries under CVF-V20 account for only five percent of the total global emission. But they are the worst victims of the manmade crisis, she said. Besides, the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has added new miseries claiming lives and affecting the livelihoods of millions. 'At this critical juncture of human history, we must forge a unity and extend cooperation to face the ongoing and future crises,' said. 'The world community should recognize the vulnerability of our people, our common aspirations, the need for technology transfer, and additional funding to tackle the impacts of climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic,' said the CVF president. The international community and the developed countries should play their historical responsibilities and their moral and legal obligations, she said. Turning to Bangladesh, the Prime Minister said Bangladesh is ranked 7 amongst the worst victims of climate change, according to the Climate Risk Index 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic, prolonged floods and the Super Cyclone Amphan in 2020 took a heavy toll on the lives and livelihoods of millions in Bangladesh, she said. Noting that Bangladesh is a global leader in disaster management and locally-led adaptation and mitigation measures, she said the country is hosting the South Asia Regional Office of Global Center on Adaptation. 'Every year we spend around 5 billion US dollars, around 2.5 percent of our GDP, on climate change adaptation and resilience building,' she said. 'During the current pandemic, my government has launched 23 recovery packages worth over 15 billion US dollars, approximately 4.2 percent of our GDP,' she added. Bangladesh is preparing the National Adaptation Plan and about to finalize the Nationally Determined Contribution-NDC. 'In a bid to raise green coverage, we're planning around 30 million saplings across the country this year marking the birth centenary of our Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,' said Hasina. She mentioned that her government has also prepared 'Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100' with the vision of achieving a safe, climate resilient and prosperous Bangladesh. 'We're one of the founding donors of the new CVF and V20 Joint Multi-Donor Fund under the United Nations.' 'Our National Parliament declared a 'Planetary Emergency' and called everyone to work 'on a war footing'' to stop climate change. We expect similar actions from the rest of the global leaders,' the PM said. 'We're implementing the world's largest climate refugee rehabilitation project named 'Khurushkul Special Shelter Project' rehabilitating 4,409 families at 139-multi-storey buildings,' she added. The CVF initiated a new climate prosperity programme to move from climate vulnerability to climate resilience and then turn climate resilience into climate prosperity. 'As the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, I'm delighted to declare 'Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan - Decade 2030' in honor of the birth centenary of the Father of the Nation,' she said. Hasina called upon the developed countries to reduce their carbon emissions drastically. 'We also count on the delivery of the agreed $100 billion per annum as climate finance. We also request a COP26 -CVF joint program along with the Dhaka-Glasgow declaration,' she said. UN Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres, Colombian President Iv\'e1n Duque M\'e1rquez, Ethiopian President Sahle-Work Zewde, Costa Rica President Carlos Alvarado Quesada, acting President of the Marshall Islands Christopher Loeak, Chair of the Global Centre on Adaptation Ban Ki-Moon, US special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry, President of World Bank Group David Malpass, President of Asian Development Bank (ADB) Masatsugu Asakawa and President of European Investment Bank Werner Hoyer, among others, spoke at the opening session of the virtual summit hosted by Bangladesh. Finance Ministers of the V20 countries, and representatives from the G7 and G20 countries, heads of IFIs and MDBs and partners attended the summit. \</doc>

Bangladesh has set a goal of generating 40 per cent of electricity from renewable sources in the next 20 years, but a roadmap on how to reach that lofty target is absent. The government has adopted a mega plan on power: to boost electricity production to 60,000 MW by 2041 with renewable energy's share rising to 24,000 MW, which now stands at 700 MW. Energy experts and stakeholders in the green energy sector believe a comprehensive and inclusive roadmap is necessary to reach the target of 24,000 MW of electricity from renewable sources in the next 20 years. State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid unveiled the government's latest vision on renewable energy during a Bangladesh-UK Climate Partnership Roundtable on June 2 in the city. President of COP26 Alok Sharma, Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen, and Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Shahabuddin Uddin were present at the function. Earlier, Bangladesh had set a plan to generate 10 per cent of electricity from renewable sources by 2020. But it could raise it nearly 3 per cent only. Data available from the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (Sreda) shows the country now generates 730 MW from renewable sources, including solar, wind and hydro. About the new target, Nasrul said he is confident of achieving the goal as the government is determined to do this as part of its commitment to the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) where Bangladesh is the chair. 'A deal is ready to be signed with Nepal for importing 700 MW hydro power from Nepal while negotiations are on with Bhutan to import hydro power from the Himalayan nation,' he claimed, adding that if such moves become successful it would hugely boost the country's renewable energy generation. Nasrul thinks the technologies on green energy are changing so fast that no long-term plan should be followed. 'Instead, the country should work out a short-term plan for two or five years as a dynamic one to adopt new technologies,' he told UNB. Nasrul said the new target will be aligned with the next Power System Master Plan (PSMP). The CVF countries pledged to transit to 100 per cent renewable energy by 2050. It was made at the 22nd Conference of Parties (COP22) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2016. Experts believe that Bangladesh's 40 per cent renewable energy goal is impossible to achieve provided there is a detailed plan. They said there are various sources of renewable energy like rooftop solar, floating solar, ground mounting solar, hydro, wind, bio-gas, biomass and ocean waves. 'We should have a roadmap to define how much we want to harness from which sources for better implementation of the plan,' said Dipal Barua, President of Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association (BSREA), a platform of the private firms involved in renewable energy business. Agreeing with him, Munawar Misbah Moin, President of Solar Module Manufacturers Association of Bangladesh (SMMAB), said it is very encouraging that the government set a target for generating 40 per cent electricity from renewable sources in line with the global trend towards green energy for achieving a zero-emission target. 'But any goal needs a comprehensive roadmap involving the private sector players beside the public sector,' he said, adding that there must be a year-wise budget and financial planning to implement a mega plan which needs a billion-dollar investment. Eminent energy expert Dr M Tamim said the country's plan on the power and energy sector should be short-term and home-grown one instead of following a third-country model. Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (Sreda) statistics shows that the country's current production of 700 MW renewable energy is now coming from different sources as the PV solar leads the sector with 466.68 MW generation capacity, while it is followed by hydro with 230 MW capacity, 2.9 MW from wind, 0.63 MW from Bio-gas and 0.4 MW from Biomass. Official sources at Power Division said in the current Power System Master Plan (PSMP) 2016, a total of 36 grid-connected solar park projects of total 2110.65 MW capacity were drawn up to implement in public and private sectors in the last 5-6 years. But only 5 projects have been implemented so far although contracts were awarded to 26 projects. The five implemented projects having total capacity of about 88.5 MW, are 50 MW Gauripur, Mymensingh, 7.5 MW Kaptai, 8 MW Panchagarh, 20 MW Teknaf, and 3 MW Sharishabari solar parks. Sreda Chairman Mohammad Alauddin said renewable energy is now passing its take-off point. He informed that the country's 100-year Delta Plan, which is now at the drafting stage, envisions implementing different projects to reach renewable energy's generation to 30,000 MW. \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 1 -- Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's attendance at this year's pared-down General Assembly of the United Nations, the annual gathering of world leaders in New York City that isn't always choc-a-bloc full of tangible or concrete gains for the participating delegations. Nobody really comes home from the UNGA touting multi-billion dollar deals for infrastructure or generous packages of aid, and certainly not arms purchases or security contracts. This isn't the stage or the occasion for counting in the conventional sense what a nation 'gains' from its leader's taxpayer-funded visits abroad. Held every year since 1945 (except 2020, no prizes here for guessing why) to coincide with the arrival of autumn in New York, it is too frequent and too large to allow for any specificity in aims or actions, and the same really goes for whatever passes for a nation's 'gains' in orthodox usage. Forged and then reimagined in the shadow of two World Wars, it probably felt imperative in the early days to have every member-state turn up at an annual roll call and reaffirm their commitment to fraternity among nations - or at least those nations that have managed also to scrape together a state they can call their own. Turn up, and you are guaranteed the opportunity to have your say with a speaking slot -officially 15 minutes, but obviously nobody will dare to cut off a world leader for going over the time allotted. People like Fidel Castro, the late Cuban leader, would go on for hours at the height of their revolutionary pomp. Absence at this forum probably wouldn't cost a country its bridges or natural resources, but it would signal an isolation or withdrawal. Generally it is unheard of without some great strife or emergency. So the question from an 'expatriate Bangladeshi journalist' at a press conference organised by the Awami League's US chapter certainly had flimsy foundations, and should have been easily dealt with. Was he suggesting the PM, and by extension Bangladesh, should have skipped the UNGA? Even though the list of 100 in-person attendees was decided by UN headquarters? Could he specify what he understood as 'gains' by pointing to some other nations' gains from the event? The reaction it instead invoked inside the venue for the presser was an embarrassment to the US-Bangladeshi community, a blot on its generally good name, and for the nation as well. The NYPD has been roped in to investigate a charge of assault against the journalist in question, Farid Alam of the community-based outlet NCN, and the US State Department acknowledged the incident had come to their knowledge, though its reaction sounded more mealy-mouthed than anything it would really care to follow up on. A major reason that Bangladesh was chosen among the 100 in-person attendees - around half its membership -had to do with its current chairing of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, which brings together on a single platform the 48 countries that suffer most disproportionately from the impacts of anthropogenic climate change. With this year's UN-led climate conference in Glasgow ( COP26 ) shaping up to contain the biggest push for progress on behalf of the planet since Paris 2015, Dhaka's stewardship of the CVF comes at a crucial juncture, and its presence in forums leading upto Glasgow will of course be vital for 'climate justice' for the most vulnerable. Indeed, that its presence is also felt, on behalf of 47 other CVF members. So it came as no surprise that the PM's first engagement of note during her stay in New York was to attend a closed-door leaders' meeting arranged for a small group of heads of state and governments on Climate Change, that was held at the Trusteeship Council of the UN Headquarters on September 20. "Finally, we need a 'whole-of-the-world' approach to leave a sustainable future for our next generations," she said at the meeting convened by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and UN Secretary General Ant&#243;nio Guterres. Hasina reiterated what should be the most compelling point in getting rich nations to cough up their share in tackling the climate crisis, in accordance with what they have sown while causing it. Climate-vulnerable countries still contribute the least to the global Green House gas emissions. "Yet, they're the worst victims of the impacts of climate change." She mentioned that the recent IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report has provided a grim picture about their future. "If the global temperature goes above 1.5 degree Celsius, they'll face permanent damages. The international community has a special responsibility to support these countries in their adaptation and mitigation efforts." Despite being a climate vulnerable country with resource constraints, Hasina said, Bangladesh has emerged as a global pioneer on adaptation and resilience. Recently, she said, Bangladesh has submitted an ambitious and updated NDC (Nationally Determined Contribution - what a country plans to do about the climate crisis) to the UN. Besides, she mentioned, it has adopted the "Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan," focusing on green growth, resilient infrastructure and renewable energy. "We're on our journey from climate vulnerability to climate resilience to climate prosperity (VRP)," she announced. Hasina also said that as the Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) and V20, her key focus is on promoting the interests of the climate vulnerable countries. "We're also sharing the best practices and adaptation knowledge with other climate vulnerable countries through the GCA South Asia regional office in Dhaka," she said. The proposals put forward by the premier include strict implementation of the Paris Agreement to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5 degree Celsius, realisation of annual $100 billion climate fund from the developed countries, 50% of this fund should go to adaptation and resilience, especially to climate vulnerable countries. The other proposals are: Forging new financial mechanisms and transfer of green technology to the developing countries, addressing loss-and-damage issue, and displacement of large-scale population due to climate change and capacity building of CVF countries to tackle the double jeopardy of pandemic and disaster, particularly with the increased frequency of climate-induced disasters. In her address to the UNGA, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina urged the rich and industrialised countries to cut emissions, compensate for the loss and damage, and ensure adequate financing and technology transfer for adaptation and resilience building. At the end of the closed-door meeting however, most assessments were pretty glum. Sources told the AP that leaders made "faint signs of progress" on the financial end of fighting climate change, in what they said was a 'feet-to-the-fire meeting.' But they didn't commit to more crucial cuts in emissions of the heat-trapping gases that cause global warming. Among the two convenors, Guterres told CNN that US climate czar John Kerry's negotiation efforts "have largely failed" because of China's reluctance to cooperate with the United States. Prime Minister Johnson meanwhile, confessed in a statement released by his office to being "increasingly frustrated" over commitments made by many countries that were "nowhere near enough". "It is the biggest economies in the world that are causing the problem, while the smallest suffer the worst consequences," he reiterated. Covid Diaries Addressing the UNGA for the 17th time as the leader of Bangladesh, she placed six proposals before the delegates at the hallowed General Assembly Hall of the UN headquarters in New York. She forcefully demanded appropriate global actions for universal and affordable vaccine access for all, if the world wants to truly defeat Covid-19. Hasina also urged the world leaders to address vaccine inequality, address Covid-19's disproportionate impacts on the countries most adversely impacted by the climate crisis, ensure education recovery, to treat migrants fairly, and to work constructively for a permanent solution to the Rohingya crisis. She also touched upon the situation unfolding in Afghanistan since the Taliban's return to power following the withdrawal of U.S. forces that for twenty years largely propped up a puppet government. Hasina said that Afghans should decide their future course for themselves. "For a Covid-free world, we must ensure universal and affordable access to vaccines for people across the world," she said in her UNGA address in Bangla as previous years, following in Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's footsteps. She placed several proposals to contain the global pandemic, saying only a meaningful collaboration towards a resilient and inclusive recovery could combat the pandemic though it so far brought to the fore the inadequacy of the global preparedness to tackle emergencies. Sheikh Hasina said that the Covid-19's impact on Bangladesh was much less than feared as the health system was equipped and strengthened from the grassroots to combat the pandemic. She said some 40 out of Bangladesh's over 160 million populations were covered under the assistance in the form of cash and other means since the pandemic's outbreak. 'Our well-timed intervention and our people's resilience helped us achieve over five percent economic growth in 2020,' Sheikh Hasina said. Bangladesh's permanent representative to the United Nations Rabab Fatima was on rotation chairing the session as one of the elected vice presidents of the forum for this year, when the turn came for the Bangladesh prime minister to be introduced and invited to deliver her address in-person. The Climate Crisis, Rohingya repatriation stalling, Palestine and Afghanistan issues concerning the global as well as Bangladesh perspectives were featured in Sheikh Hasina's speech. She said Bangladesh's calls for vaccine equality were in keeping with its longstanding priorities in such multilateral forums, 'Our firm position against any form of injustice as against the Palestinian people, resolution of the Rohingya crisis, and promoting climate justice - (which) are a few examples of our global commitment'. The prime minister said that 'Hope' being the theme of the 76th UNGA when Covid-19 was claiming lives across the globe and battering the economies and health system across the world by recurring waves of new variants. 'No country, rich or poor, is immune from the destructive effects. We, therefore, call upon the rich and industrialised countries to cut emissions, compensate for the loss and damage, and ensure adequate financing and technology transfer for adaptation and resilience building,' she said. Sheikh Hasina, also the Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum and the Vulnerable Twenty Group of Ministers of Finance, said her government has launched the 'Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan - Decade 2030' outlining a transformative agenda from climate vulnerability to climate prosperity. Outlining the Covid challenges like other parts of the globe, Sheikh Hasina said that the pandemic also severely disrupted Bangladesh's education system while UNICEF reported that half the world's students were affected by partial or full school closures. 'We need a global plan to prioritise education recovery by investing in digital tools and services, access to internet, and capacity building of teachers. We also call the UN system to rally partnership and resources to make that happen,' she said. Sheikh Hasina, however, said that Bangladesh largely managed to be on track for its graduation from the Least Development Countries category 'despite the unprecedented challenges by the Covid pandemic'. But, she said, the pandemic still risked the graduation prospect and aspiration of many countries and so 'we look forward to receiving more support from our development partners for an incentive-based graduation structure'. As one of the co-chairs of the preparatory committee of the LDC 5 conference, the premier sought 'concrete outcome' of Doha conference enabling more countries to sustainably graduate out of the LDC category. Sheikh Hasina described migrants' workers as frontline contributors during the pandemic in health and other emergency services and urged the migrant receiving countries to treat them fairly and protect their jobs, health, and well-being. She said that the pandemic hit hard many migrant workers throwing them out of jobs and exposing them to salary cuts, lack of access to health and other social services and forcible return. The problem from hell The prime minister wanted the global community's enhanced focus and active support to find a durable solution to the Rohingya crisis despite the uncertainty created by the recent political developments in Myanmar. 'Myanmar must create the conditions conducive for their return,' Sheikh Hasina said. But, she added, 'International community must work constructively for a permanent solution of the crisis through safe, sustainable, and dignified return of the Rohingyas to their home in the Rakhine State.' The prime minster particularly expected the ASEAN leadership to step up their ongoing efforts alongside the rest of the international community to support all the accountability processes. She frankly narrated that her government recently relocated some Rohingyas to Bhashan Char, something that had been sticking point for the UN agencies. But latest developments indicate the UN is by-and-large coming around to the move. The prime minister said 'peace' was a pre-eminent focus of Bangladesh foreign policy and as a proponent of the flagship resolution of the culture of peace, Bangladesh remained deeply committed to combat terrorism to maintain social peace. She said as precautions Bangladesh continued to spearhead a 'zero tolerance policy' against terrorism and violent extremism as the menaces were jeopardising peace and security in many parts of the world. Bangladesh, she said, 'Also takes pride as the leading peacekeeping nation and our contribution to global peace. Despite the pandemic, our peacekeepers are serving in some of the most difficult circumstances across the globe with utmost dedication and professionalism.' 'The international community must do everything possible to ensure their (peacekeepers) safety and security,' she said. Sheikh Hasina said that Bangladesh's constitution obligates the country to be steadfast supporter of complete disarmament and 'we firmly believe the ultimate guarantee of international peace and security lies in the total elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction'. 'It was from that conviction we ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which entered into force earlier this year,' she said. Mujib would be proud The prime minister said that Bangladesh's founder Shiekh Mujibur Rahman called for building a world free of economic inequalities, social injustice, aggression, and threats of nuclear war and told the session that the 76th UNGA was coinciding with his birth centenary and the golden jubilee of Bangladesh's independence. She added, 'These are as relevant today as they were forty-six years ago, as such, we continue to lend our voice and leadership to all those issues that aim at building an inclusive and equal society.' The prime minister said that her government had been working hard to fulfil the unfinished dream of Sheikh Mujib. 'We are now among the five fastest growing economies in the world, ranking 41st in terms of GDP. Over the past decade, we have reduced the poverty rate from 31.5 per cent to 20.5 per cent,' she said. Bangladesh's per capita income jumped to more than threefold in just one decade to USD 2,227 while its foreign currency reserve has reached all time high to USD 48 billion. Bangladesh made impressive progress in socio-economic sphere and women empowerment during last decade adding that the infant mortality rate has been reduced to 23.67 per 1,000, maternal mortality rate to 173 per 100 thousand live births; and the average longevity of people rose to 73 years. She pointed out that the World Economic Forum ranked Bangladesh in 7th position regarding women's political empowerment of women Bangladesh, much ahead of its regional neighbours since 2014. The prime minster said that the Digital Bangladesh initiative stimulated transformative impacts on socio-economic development, education, disaster risk reduction, women's empowerment, and so on.

Dhaka, May 2 -- United States President Joe Biden has correctly identified for the rest of the world that we have ahead of us a 'decisive decade' and we need to tackle the emerging challenges with seriousness and commitment. He has also pointed out in the virtual climate summit convened by him with the assistance of United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry that there was a moral and economic imperative to immediately act on climate change. Underlining the need to initiate new carbon-cutting measures, Biden has added that "the signs are unmistakable, the science is undeniable and the cost of inaction keeps mounting". He also reiterated that unlike his predecessor Trump, he was not walking away from the potentially horrific scenario but ensuring that the US has strong resolve in taking the required pre-emptive action. The US has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 50-52 per cent below 2005 levels by the end of this decade. This new pledge, unveiled at the virtual summit of 40 global leaders, essentially doubled the US previous promise. The Americans hope that their ambitious new plan will encourage China, India and others to go further before the crucial COP26 meeting, in Glasgow in November. However, there is some scepticism about the ability of the US to deliver on their new target, given the divided nature of American politics. The fact that President Biden is prepared to go slightly beyond this level will be a welcome surprise to many scientists and campaigners. "By announcing a bold target of cutting emissions 50-52 per cent below 2005 by the end of the decade, President Biden has met the moment and the urgency that the climate crisis demands, said Nathaniel Keohane from the US Environmental Defence Fund. "This target aligns with what the science says is necessary to put the world on the path to a safer climate, and vaults the U.S. into the top tier of world leaders on climate ambition." It may be recalled that Biden was criticised by the left wing of the Democratic Party for not signing up to the highly ambitious Green New Deal. He answered his critics by promising to make the environment a key plank of his presidency. He appears to have taken some significant steps in this regard- (a) reinstated US membership of the Paris climate accord, (b) paused oil and gas drilling leases on federal land, (c) appointed John Kerry as a climate envoy, (d) secured a loose joint commitment with China to work together and (e) organised a global, two-day summit for Earth Day. Welcoming the US's "return to the multilateral climate governance process", China's Xi has renewed his pledge for China to become carbon neutral by 2060. He has also urged other leaders to take "unprecedented ambition and action". It has also been indicated that "China will scale up its intended nationally determined contributions to the Paris agreement by adopting more vigorous policies and measures. In this context Beijing will strictly control coal-fired power generation projects and limit the increase in coal consumption over the next five years. One needs to remember that China leads the world in the deployment of clean-energy technologies. Analysts have however pointed out that to reach net-zero emissions in less than 30 years, the country will have to increase and refine its efforts. In this context China has already launched a number of initiatives, such as green infrastructure and transport and finance as part of its Belt and Road initiative. It needs to be understood here that no global solution to climate change is likely without the US and China, since the world's top two economies together account for nearly half of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions. Consistent with this effort Japan has also indicated that Japan plans to up its emissions cutting pledge for 2030. Their new target will be a 46 per cent cut in carbon by the end of the decade compared to 2013 levels. We, from Bangladesh, felt happy and proud that our Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had been particularly invited by Biden, through John Kerry, on April 9, to also participate in this important meeting. This was international recognition for a leader who is also the Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum-CVF and V20. The return of the United States to the Paris agreement and its strong political commitment has made Bangladesh 'optimistic' that the annual target of $100 billion global climate fund will be ensured this time. It may be recalled that ensuring this fund from 2020 onwards for the vulnerable countries was a pledge that had been made in the Paris climate agreement. Unfortunately, it could not be fulfilled principally due to the US's withdrawal from the agreement during the Donald Trump Administration. Prime Minister Hasina deeply appreciated the United States' return to the Paris Climate Agreement and promised to engage in this regard with the international community. She also pointed out that "despite being a climate vulnerable country with resource constraints, Bangladesh had emerged as a global leader on adaptation and mitigation". She also indicated that every year Bangladesh was spending about 5 billion dollars-- about 2.5 per cent of our GDP, on climate adaptation and resilience-building measures. It was also reiterated that the world should not only ensure the annual target of 100 billion US dollars but that it should also be balanced 50:50 between adaptation and mitigation with special attention to the vulnerable communities while pursuing resolution of the problems arising within the matrix of 'Loss and Damage'. The country in this regard had already included new sectors in addition to the existing energy, industry and transport sectors in the mitigation process. It was also stressed by her that while developed countries were trying to reduce their carbon emissions to keep the global temperature rise at 1.5 degree Celsius, they should also pay attention to another aspect. She correctly reiterated that major economies, international financial institutions and private sectors should come forward for concessional climate financing as well as innovation. It was also put forward that there should be more intensive focus on green economy and carbon neutral technologies with the provision of technology transfer among nations. Such a measure would help all vulnerable countries to play a vital role in international efforts to combat climate change, adapt and build resilience to climate hazards. Environmental activists and climatologists have carefully monitored the entire meeting and also the promises made by the world leadership regarding reducing carbon emissions. They have subsequently drawn attention to the fact that before the next COP meeting, they will hopefully be able to receive detailed policies about how such changes will be brought about. Some among them have also brought up another important issue. This relates to the oceans all over the world being in serious distress. They have warned that the seas are suffering from overfishing, pollution and aquaculture and it should be the duty of the world leadership to protect the oceans. Otherwise, it will also fuel climate change, because the seas help to regulate global temperatures by taking up CO2 and producing oxygen. Some interesting pieces of information have since emerged within this dynamic through a report recently published by the United Nations. It explains how rising carbon dioxide emissions have led to ocean acidification. The significant factors include the following: (a) the number of "dead zones", or areas with reduced oxygen in the ocean, has increased from more than 400 globally in 2008 to about 700 in 2019, (b) around 90 per cent of mangrove, sea grass, and marsh plant species as well as 31 per cent of species of sea birds are threatened with extinction, and (c) approximately 15 per cent of all sandy beaches worldwide are seeing retreating shorelines at an average trend of 1 meter per year or more over the last 33 years. This is indeed a matter of serious concern because the seas help to regulate global temperatures by taking up CO2 and producing oxygen. The meeting also drew the attention of important civil society institutions who have followed carefully not only the denotations of the impact of the pandemic but also the connotations of climate variability. One such person has been Bill Gates, who heads an umbrella group of sustainable investment organisations. In his pertinent remarks he drew attention to a singular factor-- something which the world leadership must note. He underlined at the summit not only that "young people are demanding action and rightly so" but also that "just using today's technology will not allow us to meet those ambitious goals." Such a view has also been supported by the COP26 Coalition, an alliance of civil society groups from Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom who are laying the groundwork to create pressure on negotiators well ahead of the November meeting. We also need to note the contents of a study published in March by Climate Action Tracker. It observed that the US would need to slice emissions around 60 per cent in this decade to be consistent with that pathway. Brandon Wu, Washington-based director of ActionAid USA, has also stressed on the associated critical moral considerations--adjusting for wealth and inequality in determining who pays for saving the climate. We need to conclude by referring to the statement made by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. He has hailed the pledges made at the summit by the world leaders but has also expressed the hope that this will be the turning point that will receive immediate action. This was reflected in his statement, "Today's summit shows the tide is turning for climate action, but there is still a long way to go". His anxiety was also mirrored in his declaration that "extreme weather and climate disruption, fuelled by anthropogenic climate change is affecting lives, destroying livelihoods and forcing many millions from their homes." It is clear that our efforts can meet with success in controlling greenhouse gas emissions if we all work together, forgetting narrow national interests. We have to save this world despite the numerous existing challenges. Political climate credibility is on the line.

Appreciating Bangladesh's leadership on climate front, President of the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Volkan Bozkir has said 2021 amid COP26 presents another important year for Bangladesh as a global leader on climate action. 'Covid-19 is the story of 2020 and 2021, but the existential threat of climate change remains. You are on the front line,' he said while delivering his keynote speech at the Foreign Service Academy. The UNGA President said Bangladesh's efforts to draw attention to the need for urgent global cooperation, including through Bangladesh's leadership of the Climate Vulnerable Nations' Forum, are noteworthy. He said an increase in global warming of just 1\'b0C globally risks flooding that would displace 40 million Bangladeshis by the end of the century. 'I welcome the government of Bangladesh's plans for low-carbon industrialisation,' said the UNGA President, adding that recent announcements by large carbon emitters of improved climate change commitments give a hope that this year will see the course correction they need. Also read: UNGA President pays tribute to Bangabandhu 2021 vital for Bangladesh as global leader on climate action: Bozkir He was delivering the Sixth Lecture of the Bangabandhu Lecture Series at the Foreign Service Academy on Tuesday. Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen also spoke at the programme titled 'Bangabandhu, Bangladesh and the United Nations.' State Minister for Foreign Affairs M Shahriar Alam and Foreign Secretary Masud Bin Momen, were, among others, present. Bozkir said Bangladesh is an active and influential Member State in the UN, and he is delighted to visit Dhaka, on only his second overseas trip since assuming the Presidency in September last. There are many synergies between his priorities in this 75th session of the UN General Assembly and the work interests of Bangladesh, whether in relation to the situation of LDCs and LDC graduation; Covid -recovery and the attainment of the Sustainable Developments Goals, gender equality and women's empowerment, and humanitarian action, he said. On vaccine issues, he said there is really no more pressing issue facing this region and the world. 'From the earliest days of my Presidency, I have emphasised the importance of fair and equitable distribution of vaccines.' Bozkir agreed with Bangladesh and others that Covid vaccines should be treated as a global public good. Also read: UNGA President pushes for Covid-19 vaccines for all Indeed, he said, this was the focus of a dedicated panel during the special session of the General Assembly on Covid-19, which he convened in December last. 'A lot has happened since then. Yet, much more remains to be done.' Bozkir said they have seen countries and companies from across the world come together to invest in, develop, and bring to market multiple proven vaccines. Billions of dollars have been provided to multilateral mechanisms to procure and distribute vaccines. And yet, he said, the fact remains that only 0.3% of all vaccines have gone to low income countries. Bozkir said from the health worker in an LDC, to a teacher in a refugee camp, to the elderly in care facilities across our countries, "we must all be covered. The most vulnerable groups - people on the move, in conflict zones, and those already marginalised - must be prioritised.' He said Bangladesh has promoted solidarity throughout the Covid-19 response, engaging actively in multilateral initiatives and helping its neighbors as well. 'With disruptions to commercial supply, it is clearly important that Bangladesh be included in the multilateral vaccine response. We are not safe until we are all safe,' he said. Bozkir said Bangladesh has demonstrated pride in its achievements and is a model for other countries seeking to move up the value chain, while continuing to invest in people. 'I am looking forward to your much anticipated graduation, with appropriate safeguards to reflect the vulnerabilities of Covid- recovery and climate change.' Peacekeeping On peace and security in the United Nations, Bozkir said Bangladesh is also a leader as the number one contributor of police and troops to UN peacekeeping missions. Of the 175,000 personnel deployed to 54 peacekeeping missions across five continents since 1988, currently 6,608 Bangladeshis are serving in nine missions around the world, including, Central African Republic, Mali, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lebanon, Yemen, and South Sudan. 'These brave men and women leave their families behind in order to protect communities in need. I pay particular tributes today to those peacekeepers who paid the ultimate sacrifice while serving under the blue flag of the United Nations,' Bozkir said. He said peacekeeping remains one of the most innovative responses provided by multilateralism to the maintenance of international peace and security. 'Under the primary purview of the Security Council, peacekeeping also has an important track in the General Assembly.' He commended the engagement of Bangladesh in the General Assembly, where it has advocated for the importance of increased participation of women in the field of peace and security, including in senior positions, for smooth transition from peacekeeping to peacebuilding and to sustaining peace. 'You were an early advocate and supporter of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda and you walk the talk,' Bozkir said. He said in September this year, he will convene a High-level Forum on Culture of Peace, as requested by the membership. He hoped it will address the rise of hate speech and discrimination, which has increased significantly during this pandemic, as well as reinforce what they know, which is that gender equality and women's empowerment are fundamental to building and sustaining peaceful societies. 'I look forward to Bangladesh's participation in this event, and I trust that as foreign service officers you will work to promote the spirit of a culture of peace - there is no more noble goal than the pursuit of diplomacy for peace,' Bozkir said. 2021 vital for Bangladesh as global leader on climate action: Bozkir Mission-Driven Approach He said this is clear in Bangladesh's mission-driven approach to service, particularly at the United Nations in New York, where Ambassador Rabab Fatima, is an active and highly respected Ambassador. 'Those of you who have worked with Ambassador Fatima know that she brings a dynamism and unique insight to all of her endeavours. When Madame Ambassador speaks, all in the room pay attention,' Bozkir said. He said, 'As we contend with a multitude of challenges, including the parallel threats of Covid-19, climate change, and conflict around the world, I trust that you will take a leaf out of her book and pursue an energetic, entrepreneurial style of diplomacy for peace.' In conclusion, he said, the dictum of Bangladesh's foreign policy is friendship to all, malice to none. 'At a time of great contestability and geostrategic rivalry, this positive and independent outlook should serve you well; you should cherish it, and use it to forge a peaceful and prosperous path for your country, region and the world,' he said. \</doc>

The International Energy Agency (IEA) on May 18 published a report outlining the essential conditions for the global energy sector to reach net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. It presented the "most technically feasible, cost-effective and socially acceptable pathway" for achieving the goal. Nuclear energy, the IEA said, will make "a significant contribution" in the net zero emission scenario and will "provide an essential foundation for transitions" to a net-zero emissions energy system. "The number of countries that have pledged to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century or soon after continues to grow, but so do global greenhouse gas emissions," IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said, launching the report. "This gap between rhetoric and action needs to close if we are to have a fighting chance of reaching net zero by 2050 and limiting the rise in global temperatures to 1.5\'b0C. Doing so requires nothing short of a total transformation of the energy systems that underpin our economies." The report titled  Net Zero by 2050: A Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector presented a net-zero emissions by 2050 scenario (NZE) designed to show what is needed across the main sectors by various actors, and by when, for the world to achieve net-zero energy-related and industrial process CO2 emissions by 2050. It also aimed to minimize methane emissions from the energy sector. In recent years, the energy sector was responsible for around three-quarters of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In parallel with action on reducing all other sources of GHG emissions, achieving net-zero CO2 emissions from the energy sector by 2050 is consistent with around a 50% chance of limiting the long-term average global temperature rise to 1.5\'b0C without a temperature overshoot, said the IEA. "By 2050, the energy world looks completely different," the report says. "Global energy demand is around 8% smaller than today, but it serves an economy more than twice as big and a population with 2 billion more people. Almost 90% of electricity generation comes from renewable sources, with wind and solar PV together accounting for almost 70%. Most of the remainder comes from nuclear power." Reduction in Fossil Fuel Use In the NZE scenario, global energy-related and industrial process CO2 emissions to fall by nearly 40% between 2020 and 2030 and to net zero in 2050. Universal access to sustainable energy is achieved by 2030, the IEA said. There is a target - 75% reduction in methane emissions from fossil fuel use by 2030. Total energy supply to decline by 7% between 2020 and 2030 in the NZE and remain at around this level to 2050. Coal demand to decline by 90% to less than 600 million tonnes of coal equivalent in 2050, oil would decline by 75% to 24 million barrels per day and natural gas may decline by 55% to 1750 billion cubic metres. The fossil fuels that would remain in 2050 to be used in the production of non-energy goods where the carbon is embodied in the product (like plastics), in plants with carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), and in sectors where low-emissions technology options are scarce. Annual energy sector investment, which averaged USD2.3 trillion globally in recent years, would rise to USD5.0 trillion by 2030. As a share of global GDP, average annual energy investment to 2050 in the NZE would be around 1% higher than in recent years. The Roadmap sets out more than 400 milestones to guide the global journey to net zero by 2050. These include, from today, no investment in new fossil fuel supply projects, and no further final investment decisions for new unabated coal plants. By 2035, there will be no sales of new internal combustion engine passenger cars, and by 2040, the global electricity sector has already reached net-zero emissions. The contraction of oil and natural gas production will have far-reaching implications for all the countries and companies that produce these fuels, according to the report. No new oil and natural gas fields are needed in the net-zero pathway, and supplies become increasingly concentrated in a small number of low-cost producers. OPEC's share of a much-reduced global oil supply to grow from around 37% in recent years to 52% in 2050, a level higher than at any point in the history of oil markets. In the near term, the report describes a net-zero pathway that requires the immediate and massive deployment of all available clean and efficient energy technologies, combined with a major global push to accelerate innovation. The pathway requires annual additions of solar PV to reach 630 GWe by 2030, and those of wind power to reach 390 GWe. Together, this is four times the record level set in 2020. Most of the global reductions in CO2 emissions between now and 2030 in the net-zero pathway come from technologies readily available today, the IEA said. However, under the NZE scenario, in 2050 almost half the reductions come from technologies that are currently only at the demonstration or prototype phase. Decisions Needed on Nuclear Under the NZE scenario, nuclear electricity generation increases from 2698 TWh in 2020 to 3777 TWh in 2030 and to 5497 TWh in 2050. Its share of generation decreases from 10% in 2020 to 8% in 2050. However, the IEA said, there are three important sets of decisions to be made concerning nuclear power: lifetime extensions; the pace of new construction; and, advances in nuclear power technology. The large fleet of ageing nuclear reactors in advanced economies means their decommissioning increases, despite many reactor lifetime extensions. In the NZE, annual average nuclear retirements globally are 60% higher over the next 30 years than in the last decade. Without further lifetime extensions and new projects beyond those already under construction, nuclear power output in advanced economies will decline by two-thirds over the next two decades. In emerging markets and developing economies, there are decisions to be made about the pace of new nuclear power construction. From 2011 to 2020, an average of 6 GWe of new nuclear capacity came online each year. By 2030, the rate of new construction increases to 24 GWe per year in the NZE. The IEA said the governments must decide the extent of their support for advanced nuclear technologies, particularly those related to small modular reactors and high-temperature gas reactors, both of which can expand markets for nuclear power beyond electricity. "Failing to take timely decisions on nuclear power ... would raise the costs of a net-zero emissions pathway and add to the risk of not meeting the goal by placing an additional burden on wind and solar to scale up even more quickly than in the NZE," the report warned. Time to Face Greatest Challenge "Our Roadmap shows the priority actions that are needed today to ensure the opportunity of net-zero emissions by 2050 - narrow but still achievable - is not lost," said Birol. "The scale and speed of the efforts demanded by this critical and formidable goal - our best chance of tackling climate change and limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0C - make this perhaps the greatest challenge humankind has ever faced. While the pathway to net zero presented in the new report "is global in scope", Birol said it is up to each country to determine how it will design its own strategy, taking into account its own specific circumstances. He said advanced economies are expected to reach net zero before developing economies. The IEA said the report is designed to inform the high-level negotiations that will take place at the 26th Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) in Glasgow in November. Climate Action Network (CAN) in a statement issued immediately after publishing the report welcomed this report\' s recognition and confirmation of the feasibility of the 1.5 C degrees Paris Agreement temperature goal.  It is hugely significant that the most influential energy agency recognized the urgency and the need for immediate actions in this critical decade in order to stay below 1.5C degrees, said CAN\'b4s Executive Director Tasneem Essop.  This sends a strong message to countries, the fossil fuel industry and investors worldwide that the time to end business as usual is now; that the radical transformation of all economies in a fair and just manner through centering equity and the rights of affected communities and to benefit from the renewable energy transition requires bold and courageous leadership as of today. Welcoming the IEA report\'b4s emphasis on large growth of particularly clean renewables like solar and wind to about two third of all energy use by mid-century, CAN expressed concern that it falls short of going much further. In particular, CAN is critical of the IEA scenario\' s reliance on doubling nuclear power, growing carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) to about 15% of all CO2 emissions reduction efforts and significantly increasing the use of bioenergy by mid-century. Despite its shortcomings, CAN strongly encouraged the IEA to make the roadmap and milestones its central scenario from now on for the coming years to assess governments\'b4 energy and climate policy implementation in this decade while continuing to address the weaknesses. CAN offered to work with the IEA to improve this scenario towards a fully sustainable pathway for all. \</doc>

The United Nations Climate Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow did not meet all expectations; it, however, met many long-standing demands of Bangladesh, said Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Shahab Uddin recently. COP26 member states have been asked to come up with ambitious and strong plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with a view to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius," he said while addressing a workshop as the chief guest at the Department of Environment. The workshop titled "World Climate Conference (COP 26): Expectations, Achievements and Future Action Plans" was organized by the environment ministry. Md Ziaul Haque and Mirza Shawkat Ali, two DoE directors presented a keynote paper at the program. "In addition to doubling adaptation financing by rich and industrialized countries in tackling climate change in developing countries, emphasis has also been laid on bringing 50:50 equilibrium between adaptation and mitigation financing in various COP26 decision texts," said Shahab. \</doc>

The forthcoming COP26 summit -- which could determine the viability of the Paris Agreement -- will "not be easy" but an outcome matching the urgency of the crisis is an "absolute necessity", the UN's climate chief said recently. As the world faces stronger and more frequent droughts, wildfires, flooding and storm surges made worse as the planet warms, the COP26 summit in Glasgow is being billed by organizers as a key milestone for keeping the Paris goals within reach. "The point is decisions need to be taken now, that is why Glasgow is so important," UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa said. Struck to international fanfare in 2015, the accord commits nations to limit global temperature rises to "well below" 2 degrees Celsius above those before the onset of the Industrial Revolution. It also saw countries promise to stick to a safer warming cap of 1.5C through sweeping emissions cuts. \</doc>

As the world takes decisive steps on climate change, the ensuing policy changes and their effect on the world's fastest growing fossil fuel, natural gas, were examined at an event held by the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) on 1 February 2022. Entitled 'Natural gas in the aftermath of COP26 ', the two-part webinar enjoyed the participation of first-class speakers representing exporting countries, academia, business, and service providers. The first session reviewed the main COP26 outcomes, including possible impacts on the energy sector, in particular natural gas. The second part focused on the responses of the gas sector to what came out of Glasgow in November 2021 and on what might be on cards as the industry head towards COP27. Setting the tone for a lively round of discussions, Eng. Mohamed Hamel, Secretary General of the GECF, underscored that the COP26 recommended phasedown of coal consumption could 'definitely benefit natural gas'. 'Coal-to-gas switching is the least costly mitigation option in many developing countries, including in countries with large populations, and it is a key component in their Nationally-Determined Contributions (NDCs).' \</doc>

A coalition of more than 1,500 environmental groups recently called for postponement of COP26 scheduled to begin next month, saying access to them would be unequal. Delegates from more than 190 countries attend the annual talks, yet with many countries grappling with Covid-19 and poorer nations struggling to access vaccines, they should be postponed, the Climate Action Network (CAN) said. The COP26 "Our concern is that the countries deeply affected by the climate crisis and suffering from the lack of support by rich nations in providing vaccines will be left out of the talks," CAN Executive Director Tasneem Essop said. Farhan Haq, a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the scientifically established urgency of combating climate change meant a further delay of COP26 'is no longer feasible'. \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 2 -- Delegates heading to the COP26 UN climate summit in Glasgow agreed they must deliver on the $100 billion per year pledge to help most vulnerable nations tackle climate change, COP26 president Alok Sharma said on Saturday. Speaking after days of meetings at the pre- COP26 climate event in Italy, Sharma said there was a consensus to do more to keep the 1.5 degrees Celsius target within reach, adding more needed to be done collectively in terms of national climate plans, reports Reuters. COP26 conference in Glasgow aims to secure more ambitious climate action from the nearly 200 countries that signed the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2.0 degrees Celsius - and to 1.5 degrees preferably - above pre-industrial levels.

A British-Indian Cabinet minister in charge of the UK's presidency of the COP26 climate summit in November will hold discussions with senior Indian ministers and leaders from industry and civil society ahead of the summit in Scotland, during which India is seen as critical to world leaders agreeing climate action targets. Agra-born Alok Sharma arrived in New Delhi on a three-day visit recently. It is expected that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend the flagship event, scheduled between November 1 and 12. "India has a vital role to play as the world comes together in Glasgow to demonstrate renewed action under the Paris Agreement," said Sharma. "India's leadership - including through the International Solar Alliance and Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure - is hugely important as we look to build global resilience ahead of COP26 and beyond. All countries - including the UK and India - have a historic opportunity to build back greener from the COVID pandemic," the 53-year-old minister said. "Providing climate resilient jobs that also promote economic growth will lead to a green industrial revolution that also makes financial sense," he added. \</doc>

Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg said recently she hoped to go to the COP26 climate summit in November, months after threatening to skip the event because of unfair vaccine rollouts. "I've heard from people that all the delegates will be offered a vaccine," Thunberg told a media. "If that's considered safe, then I will hopefully attend." The 18-year-old said in April that by November richer countries would be vaccinating young healthy people "very often at the expense of people in risk groups in other parts of the world". She said at the time that the conference in Glasgow should be postponed if everyone could not attend on the same terms. The conference has already been postponed once from its original date of November 2020. \</doc>

US President Joe Biden has apologized to world leaders for his predecessor Donald Trump's withdrawal from a global climate accord and said fighting the crisis should be seen as an economic opportunity. In a reference to Trump, who withdrew from the Paris climate deal on world action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Biden told the COP26 summit in Glasgow that he was sorry. "I guess I shouldn't apologize but I do apologize for the fact that the United States in the last administration pulled out of the Paris Accords and put us sort of behind the eight ball a little bit," he said, noting that one of his first actions on taking office this January was to re-enter the accord.

Australia's resources minister has proposed setting up a government-run A$250 billion ($180 billion) lending facility for the country's coal industry in return for supporting a net zero carbon emissions target for 2050, he said recently. Resources minister Keith Pitt, a member of the junior coalition partner National Party, told the Australian Financial Review his idea was for the government to be the "lender of last resort" to the mining sector as banks and insurers are increasingly unwilling to fund and underwrite the industry. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has come under increasing pressure to adopt a zero emissions target, but has been stymied by opposition from the party's junior partner. Pitt's proposal is a first sign of what that support might cost. Morrison said he will advise his government's position on cutting emission before he goes to the COP26 \</doc>

A new climate change report out recently showed that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will be impossible without immediate, large-scale emissions cuts, the UN chief said. The United in Science 2021 report, published by a range of UN agencies and scientific partners just weeks before the COP26 climate summit, said climate change and its impacts were accelerating. And a temporary reduction in carbon emissions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic had done nothing to slow the relentless warming, it found. The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, struck at the COP21 summit, called for capping global warming at well below 2 C above the pre-industrial level, and ideally closer to 1.5C. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the report's findings were "an alarming appraisal of just how far off course we are" in meeting the Paris goals. "This year has seen fossil fuel emissions bounce back, greenhouse gas concentrations continuing to rise and severe human-enhanced weather events that have affected health, lives and livelihoods on every continent," he wrote in the report's foreword. \</doc>

Global warming is already affecting people's health so much that emergency action on climate change cannot be put on hold while the world deals with the Covid-19 pandemic, medical journals across the globe warned recently. "Health is already being harmed by global temperature increases and the destruction of the natural world," read an editorial published in more than 220 leading journals ahead of the COP26 climate summit in November. Since the pre-industrial era, temperatures have risen around 1.1 degrees Celsius (34 degrees Fahrenheit). The editorial, written by the editors-in-chief of over a dozen journals including the Lancet, the East African Medical Journal, Brazil's Revista de Saude Publica and the International Nursing Review, said this had caused a plethora of health problems. "In the past 20 years, heat-related mortality among people older than 65 years has increased by more than 50 percent," it read. \</doc>

Financial firms including British insurer Prudential, lenders Citi and HSBC and BlackRock Real Assets are devising plans to speed the closure of Asia's coal-fired power plants in order to lower the biggest source of carbon emissions, according to people with knowledge of the initiative. The novel proposal, which is being driven by the Asian Development Bank, offers a potentially workable model and early talks with Asian governments and multilateral banks are promising, the sources said. The group plans to create public-private partnerships to buy out the plants and wind them down within 15 years, far sooner than their usual life, giving workers time to retire or find new jobs and allowing countries to shift to renewable energy sources. It aims to have a model ready for the COP26 climate conference which is being held in Glasgow, Scotland in November. "The private sector has great ideas on how to address climate change and we are bridging the gap between them and the official-sector actors," ADB Vice President Ahmed M Saeed said. \</doc>

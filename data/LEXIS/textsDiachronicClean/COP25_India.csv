These exports are lowering global emissions by up to 159 Mt CO2-e a year by displacing more emissions-intensive fuels overseas.The Governments Climate Solutions Package also maps out, to the last tonne, how we will achieve our 2030 Paris target more than a decade ahead of time.By working with our international partners and taking strong domestic action, the Australian Government will continue to deliver reliable, affordable energy and address the challenges of climate change while ensuring a strong economy.\l"

This conference provides governments from around the world the opportunity to share ideas and discuss our coordinated climate change actions to deliver on commitments under the Paris Agreement.This conference is also an opportunity to demonstrate Ontario's continued leadership on climate action and highlight the key components of our Made-in-Ontario Environment Plan. The plan is our evolving roadmap to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen our resilience to the impacts of climate change, such as more frequent extreme weather events and flooding. I am proud of the progress we have made so far to act on our plan's climate change commitments in a way that supports a healthy environment and a healthy economy.I look forward to sharing the significant progress Ontario has made towards achieving our goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 - a target that aligns with the federal government's Paris commitments. Ontario is already well on its way to this target, and we will continue to look at new information, ideas and innovations as they emerge.This month's conference will help to strengthen our existing relationships and build new ones with like-minded jurisdictions working to find effective and affordable solutions to address climate change and protect our environment while supporting a healthy economy. I appreciate this opportunity to learn from other governments, experts and industries about their approaches to climate action and promoting our province's low-carbon electricity grid and clean technology sector, which gives Ontario a natural advantage in the global shift to a low-carbon economy.Climate change is a global issue and we all have a role to play.

COP 25 was a great opportunity for Ontario to demonstrate its leadership in protecting the environment and phasing out coal, while engaging in meaningful dialogue about climate change action with other jurisdictions and organizations.I had the opportunity to join Patricia Fuller, Canada's Ambassador for Climate Change, to provide remarks about Ontario's successful initiative to phase out coal and transform our energy mix. This initiative made Ontario the first North American jurisdiction with a significant reliance on coal to cease coal-fired power generation. It was one of the largest completed actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in North America - resulting in a total annual reduction of up to 30 megatonnes. This action also contributed to reducing our smog days from a peak of 53 in 2005 to zero in 2017.Throughout the week, I met with my provincial and American counterparts and industry leaders to discuss our coordinated efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and share ideas on initiatives to help deliver on commitments under the Paris Agreement. I also met with Canadian youth delegates to learn more about their ideas on how we can protect the environment now and for future generations, and to discuss how government can further engage youth as we work to bring forward innovative solutions to address climate change.Ontario leads Canada in greenhouse gas reductions.

That means doing the important work at home to cut pollution and create good jobs for Canadians. It also means working with international partners to ensure a sustainable future for the next generation.Over the past two weeks, Canadas strong team of negotiators and the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, showed leadership on climate action at COP25 and played an active role in negotiations, including on the international rules on carbon markets, under the Paris Agreement (also known as Article 6). While Canada is pleased to see increased ambition and the launch of a new dialogue on oceans and climate in the decision, the negotiations on international markets will continue next year, in the hopes of reaching an ambitious resolution at COP26 in Glasgow.Indigenous Peoplesparticularly those in isolated or northern communitiesare disproportionately impacted by climate change. Canada called for rules to promote and protect human rights and the rights of Indigenous Peoples in activities that would occur under Article 6. We also actively promoted rules for the long-term environmental integrity of carbon markets.While a consensus was not reached on Article 6 in Madrid, discussions will continue into next years negotiations. Canada remains determined to push for ambitious climate action and will participate in further negotiations to define the rules that will mobilize private-sector investment toward the global transition to a low-carbon economy.While at COP25The Minister met with international counterparts, Indigenous leaders, young people, environmental organizations, and industry leaders. At a meeting with European Union Commissioner Frans Timmermans, he discussed the strong environmental partnership between Canada and the EU and their commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Minister Wilkinson met with fellow Canadian Mark Carney and congratulated him on his new position as UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance. He also met with German Minister Svenja Schulze, UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres, and other international counterparts and climate leaders, including Small Island Developing States, to continue to strengthen Canadas relationships on climate action.Canadian-led initiatives grew at COP25, as Minister Wilkinson welcomed new endorsees of the Ocean Plastics Charter and new members of the Powering Past Coal Alliance. The Minister also announced investments through the World Bank to help developing countries design and implement carbon pricing in ways that will work for them.In Canada and across the world, work to phase out coal-power generation goes hand in hand with work to ensure the transition is a fair one for affected communities and people. While at COP25, Minister Wilkinson participated in a Just Transition eventincluding New Zealand, Germany, Spain, and Scotlandled by the International Trade Union Confederation and the Canadian Labour Congress.Global momentum toward climate action continues to accelerate as more citizens advocate for bold climate solutions. Canada is working to ensure that the implementation of the Paris Agreement will cut emissions and create a clean and prosperous future for everyone. Canada was proud to be among the leaders who were advocating for important climate commitments that will reduce pollution, implement nature-based solutions, and create more jobs by accelerating clean growth.\l"

On December 3, the World Meteorological Organisation said the past 10 years were the warmest on record, with the global mean temperature about 1.1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels between January and October 2019. This indicates that the 1.5 deg C threshold will be breached in the 2030s, much earlier than expected. The current mitigation pledges are likely to take us to a 3.2 deg C warming scenario by the end of this century. Inaction has already set off irreversible chain responses to ecosystems, such as marine heat waves and acidification; severe heat waves; and changes in the southwest monsoon pattern, among others.The United NationsClimate Change ConferenceCOP25) in Madrid that ends this week has shown no indication of progress on meeting the Paris Agreement goal of keeping the global temperature rise below 2 deg C, and pursue efforts to keep it under 1.5 deg C. Developed countries, including Australia, Singapore, Japan and the United States, have said they will not update their nationally-determined contributions (NCDs). About 51% of all NDCs have included carbon markets, which is an emissions-trading mechanism, as one of the means to achieve emission reduction. Developed countries have also not delivered on their pre-2020 commitments, the most important among them being mobilising $100 billion per year by 2020 to support developing nations in mitigating and adapting to impacts. India, China, and Brazil, among others, have sought a stock-take on the implementation of pre-2020 commitments by developed countries at COP25.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

The announcement was made at an event hosted by the IDB during the United Nations (COP25) , under the presidency of Chile, in Madrid, Spain.The innovative platform uses Blockchain (DLT) technology and is the first such tool to facilitate harmonized issuance reporting and verification. By accessing the platform, issuers, investors and other market actors can upload and research information on transaction details, bond performance, use of proceeds, and environmental impacts of the region's green bond issues.The platform, currently in its beta stage and set for official launch in 2020, will provide a greater level of confidence to current market participants and removes an important deterrent for the entrance of new market actors requiring greater transparency and comparability. The GBTP, which is expected to become a model for green bond markets in other regions, is supported by more than 30 organizations present at the announcement.The demand for greater transparency in this growing financial market segment is evidenced by a Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI) analysis that shows that only 53 percent of surveyed issuers in the region reported on both the use of proceeds from their deals and their environmental impacts. The analysis also showed that only 27 percent chose to certify their bonds under the Climate Bonds Standard and just 1 percent provided post-issuance assurance on their use of proceeds and impacts.During the event, the IDB, IDB Invest, and the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development of the Federal Republic of Germany also signed a Joint Declaration of Intent supporting further growth and development of the green bond market in LAC.In addition to supporting the development of the GBTP, the agreement aims to provide technical assistance to clients in the region to support and promote domestic issuances; establish and promote ambitious regional standards and criteria for green bonds; and promote mechanisms to scale up green bond issuances in the region through anchor investments, de-risking and co-financing.The Joint Declaration of Intent was signed by Juan Antonio Ketterer on behalf of the IDB, Gema Sacristan, on behalf of IDB Invest and Dr. Heike Henn on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).

"COP25","India","COP25_India17","United States : IDB announces Green Bond Transparency Platform at COP25","December 12, 2019 Thursday","TendersInfo","The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) announced the creation of the Green Bond Transparency Platform (GBTP), an innovative digital tool that brings greater transparency to the Latin American and Caribbeans green bond market. The announcement was made at an event hosted by the IDB during the United Nations (COP25) , under the presidency of Chile, in Madrid, Spain.The innovative platform uses Blockchain (DLT) technology and is the first such tool to facilitate harmonized issuance reporting and verification. By accessing the platform, issuers, investors and other market actors can upload and research information on transaction details, bond performance, use of proceeds, and environmental impacts of the regions green bond issues.The platform is the solution to a key challenge of the green bond market, which is that investors demand to know more about the use of proceeds of the green bonds they buy. If we tackle this problem, we will see a noticeable increase in the growth of the green bond market, says Juan Antonio Ketterer, Division Chief of the Connectivity, Markets and Finance Division at the IDB. Green bonds have become an important tool for the region to attract private capital and add greater transparency will help further broaden the market, added Ketterer.The platform, currently in its beta stage and set for official launch in 2020, will provide a greater level of confidence to current market participants and removes an important deterrent for the entrance of new market actors requiring greater transparency and comparability. The GBTP, which is expected to become a model for green bond markets in other regions, is supported by more than 30 organizations present at the announcement.The demand for greater transparency in this growing financial market segment is evidenced by a Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI) analysis that shows that only 53 percent of surveyed issuers in the region reported on both the use of proceeds from their deals and their environmental impacts. The analysis also showed that only 27 percent chose to certify their bonds under the Climate Bonds Standard and just 1 percent provided post-issuance assurance on their use of proceeds and impacts.During the event, the IDB, IDB Invest, and the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development of the Federal Republic of Germany also signed a Joint Declaration of Intent supporting further growth and development of the green bond market in LAC.In addition to supporting the development of the GBTP, the agreement aims to provide technical assistance to clients in the region to support and promote domestic issuances; establish and promote ambitious regional standards and criteria for green bonds; and promote mechanisms to scale up green bond issuances in the region through anchor investments, de-risking and co-financing.The Joint Declaration of Intent was signed by Juan Antonio Ketterer on behalf of the IDB, Gema Sacristan, on behalf of IDB Invest and Dr. Heike Henn on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).

Also looking at acceptance to commitments of pre 2020. We will showcase the work of the country which is innovative an outstanding in many ways,"" said CK Mishra, secretary, ministry of environment. One of the important pieces under the Paris Agreement for which rules were not drafted last year at COP24 at Katowice was Article 6.""Article 6 is still under negotiation. We don't know how the rules will turn out to be. It will benefit developing countries like India. The projects under CDM were very small but we are expecting very large, ambitious carbon trading projects under the new mechanism. It has to be resolved during this COP. We scientists are very concerned about the environmental integrity of such a market based mechanism. I am however not very hopeful about a resolution on loss and damage. COP 25 will be a curtain raiser for COP26 which will be significant as countries would be expected to raise their ambition to keep global warming under 2 degrees over pre-industrial levels,"" said Professor NH Ravindranath, climate scientist and former Intergovernmetal Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) author.Since 2001, over 8,000 projects in 111 countries under CDM have reduced or avoided 2 billion tonnes of CO2-equivalent and sparked investment of close to $304 billion in climate and sustainable development projects,"" according to UN.""The meeting of the Conference of Parties (COP) takes place days before the Paris Agreement is set to come into force (monitoring of NDC targets will begin from 2020). The mandate for COP25 is clear. Countries must finalise the Paris Agreement rule book and for the pending issue of carbon markets, that is how offsets to emissions used by countries and big businesses should count towards emission reductions. The meeting will also see some hard political bargains as the issue of access to funds by vulnerable countries comes up for review in what is called as the Warsaw International Mechanism for loss and damage - essentially compensation to those impacted by extreme weather,"" said Aarti Khosla, director at Climate Trends-a Delhi based climate communications organisation.The issue of loss and damage is particularly significant because the UN's Emissions Gap Report 2019 last week said with the current pledges by countries to reduce carbon emissions, there is a 66% chance that warming will be limited to 3.2 degree C over pre-industrial levels by the end of this century. This will spell doom for several small, vulnerable countries particularly island nations. Loss and damage refers to irreversible climate impacts being faced by certain vulnerable parts of the world. For example, the threat of large scale bleaching of coral reefs or submerged islands. Though the Paris Rulebook drafted during COP 24 did mention Loss and Damage, it didn't spell out how vulnerable countries can be compensated.""The climate emergency is here and now. Developing countries are already bearing the brunt of the human and environmental costs of climate change. At the climate conference in Madrid, governments are set to begin negotiating financial support to repair the loss and damage caused by climate disasters, such as flooding, droughts and rising sea levels.But developed countries - those most responsible for the climate crisis - including the US, EU, Australia and Japan, have spent years blocking concrete progress to provide funding for countries in the Global South most affected by rising global temperatures,"" said Harjeet Singh, global climate change lead at ActionAid.Developing countries will also raise the issue of green climate fund under which developed countries had agreed to mobilise $100 billion per year by 2020.The World Meteorological Organisation last week said greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere had reached a record high in 2018.The globally averaged concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) reached 407.8 parts per million in 2018, up from 405.5 parts per million (ppm) in 2017. Since 1990, there has been a 43% increase in total radiative forcing - the warming effect on the climate by greenhouse gases.""There is no sign of a slowdown, let alone a decl"

With around two-thirds of the worlds electricity still generated through burning fossil fuels, and despite growing investment in renewable energy sources, global emissions of greenhouse gases reached a record high last year.Mr Grossi said greater deployment of a diverse mix of low-carbon sources such as hydro, wind and solar, as well as nuclear power and battery storage, will be needed to reverse that trend and set the world on track to meet climate goals.We should not see nuclear energy and renewables as being in competition with one another, he said in Madrid at a side event on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) to ensure access to affordable and reliable energy. We need to make use of all available sources of clean energy.Nuclear power plants produce virtually no greenhouse gas emissions or air pollutants during their operation. They are also able to operate around the clock at near full capacity, while variable renewables require back up power during their output gaps.Nuclear power offers a steady, reliable supply of electricity, Mr Grossi stated. It can provide continuous, low-carbon power to back up increasing use of renewables. It can be the key that unlocks their potential by providing flexible supportday or night, rain or shine.He also spoke of the role of nuclear applications that help countries adapt to the consequences of climate change which are already apparent. Our scientists help countries to develop new varieties of rice and barley that are tolerant of drought, extreme temperatures and salinity, he said. We support the use of nuclear techniques to identify and manage limited water resources.The UN side event, entitled Accelerating the energy transformation in support of sustainable development and the Paris Agreement, focused on initiatives that could have a significant impact toward achieving SDG 7 goals, helping to close the energy access gap in a sustainable way and promoting climate action by transitioning toward zero-carbon energy solutions.The event was opened by remarks from Liu Zhenmin, Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), Damilola Ogunbiyi, Chief Executive Officer of Sustainable Energy for All and Li Yong, Director General of the United Nations Industrial Organization (UNIDO).Mr Grossi said nuclear power needs a place at the table where the worlds energy future is decided, and that he was encouraged by his talks with other international organizations and their willingness to work with the IAEA towards a cleaner climate.He underscored the symbolism of coming to COP 25 just one week after taking office.This reflects the importance of the issue and my firm belief that nuclear science and technology have an important role to play in helping the world to address the climate emergency, he said.

Through two strategic channels, namely the negotiation path (hard diplomacy) and the outreach and campaign path (soft diplomacy) with the Indonesian Pavilion. Indonesian negotiators fought for missions in the form of interests and commitment (increased ambition) in filling gaps in achieving the NDC Indonesia target and the temperature rise target below 1.5 degrees Celsius.The Indonesian delegation led by Deputy Minister (Vice Minister) Alue Dohong LHK as the Indonesian Head of Delegation (HoD) and accompanied by Indonesian Ambassador HE Hermono (Head Alternate of Delegation), and Director General of PPI Ruanda Agung Sugardiman as National Focal Point and also Head of Alternate of the Delegation, will lead around 44 Indonesian delegates from various Ministries and Institutions, as well as Indonesian Pavilion participants from various sector stakeholders related to climate change control.The negotiation path for DELRI at the UNFCCC Conference in Madrid includes: (1) COP25 which will discuss the implementation of the Paris Agreement summarized in the Paris Agreement Work Program; (2) CMP15 which will discuss the continuation of the Kyoto Protocol in reviewing the obligations of developed countries and the transition of existing mechanisms in the Kyoto Protocol; (3) CMA2 which will oversee the implementation of the Paris Agreement and make decisions to promote the effectiveness of implementation; (4) UNFCCC Subsidiary Bodies (SBSTA51 and SBI51) whose bodies under this Convention will support technical advice (SBSTA) and funding support (SBI) for the implementation of the convention. ""We already have 40-50 negotiators who are divided into 13 thematic negotiations that we will fight for at COP 25,"" said Vice Minister Alue Dohon.Several agendas that will be fought by DELRI both in COP25 / CMP15 / CMA2 / SBI and SBSTA51 include: related issues of mitigation, adaptation, transparency framework and global stocktake, technology development and transfer, capacity building, funding (finance), article 6 related to carbon markets , agriculture, response measure, gender in climate change, research and observation systems, local communities and indigenous peoples.Then in soft diplomacy, certainly a number of world figures are scheduled to be speakers at the Indonesian Pavilion. Among those that have been confirmed is Al Gore, the former Vice President of the United States who, together with the intergovernmental panel on climate change, was once awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Besides Al Gore, another world figure who will be present is Professor Nicholas Stern, an economist, author of the book 'The Economics of Climate Change', which is a global reference book in calculating the effects of climate change in the economic paradigm. There is also Professor Jeffrey Sachs, an American economist who has a lot of thoughts on poverty alleviation.The presence of world leaders will have a positive impact on Indonesia's soft diplomacy at the climate change conference. The world leaders will bring mass, which in turn will increase public attention to the Indonesian Pavilion, which means also the concrete actions that have been taken by the Government of Indonesia in efforts to combat climate change.This soft diplomacy path was taken to inform the achievements of good practices and lesson learns as well as future programs on climate change and low carbon development and adaptation to achieve the Indonesian NDC target of 29% on their own efforts and 41% with foreign assistance in 2030. This pathway pursued through the holding of the Indonesian Pavilion which will start on December 4 and end on December 12, and also through the side event at COP 25.\l"

If G20 participation at the Climate Action Summit in September this year hadn't made this clear-host and, historically, one of the worst absolute and the worst per capita polluters, the US, refused to even speak at the summit-the fact that the climate-sceptic president of Brazil, Jair Bolsanaro, regime called the CoP25 negotiations a ""commercial game"" and Australia has been batting for, including carryover credits from the Kyoto Deal, under which it was allowed to increase emissions for some time, to let it meet its target under the Paris deal. The EU, which has just promulgated the ambitious EU Green Deal, under which the Union aims to turn carbon neutral by 2050, offers some hope-it talks about decarbonising its energy sector, a big boost for global emission control since 75% of the EU's emissions is accounted for by production and use of energy, rolling out cleaner public and private transportation, making households more energy efficient, and supporting industry to adopt green production and consumption. But, the US, which had talked about cutting emissions by 26-28% from 2005 levels by 2025 under the Paris deal, is expected to walk out of the deal soon if it stays under a Trump government. Brazil, too, has shown little inclination to act-unprecedented deforestation of its rainforests, an important carbon sink, for commercial exploitation has happened under the Bolsanaro regime.While scientific consensus sets a threshold of 2oC above pre-industrial levels, beyond which global heating will have cataclysmic impact-the world is already hotter by 1.1oC, with devastating consequences, including increased incidence of massive floods, wildfires, and cold spells-the World Meteorological Organization says the current heating rate puts the world on the path to 3-5oC rise by 2100. The 20 warmest years on record have occurred in the past 22 years, with the last four years being the hottest four. The latest assessment of global emissions by the UN shows that atmosphere will hold enough greenhouse gases for the planet to heat up by 1.5oC in just ten years.

The event, entitled Accelerating the energy transformation in support of sustainable development and the Paris Agreement, will focus on initiatives that could have a significant impact toward achieving SDG 7 goals, help close the energy access gap in a sustainable way and promote climate action by transitioning toward zero-carbon energy solutions.The IAEA Director General will also hold bilateral meetings with high-level officials, including UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Patricia Espinosa, as well as the heads of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Mr Grossi will also hold bilateral meetings with high-level Spanish Government officials.With around two-thirds of the worlds electricity still generated through burning fossil fuels, and despite growing investment in renewable energy sources, global emissions of greenhouse gases reached a record high last year.Variable renewables, such as solar and wind, are vital to the clean energy transition, but they alone cannot meet countries growing energy needs, Mr Grossi said. Nuclear power can provide the continuous, low-carbon power to back up increasing use of renewables. It can be the key that unlocks their full potential by providing flexible support day or night, rain or shine.COP25 will lay the groundwork for next years defining climate change conference, when countries must submit new climate action plans under the Paris Agreement. A key issue for COP25 is to address the financing of global climate action. For many financial institutions, nuclear power does not qualify for financing under green or sustainable financing mechanisms, making construction of new nuclear power reactors challenging. To achieve climate goals, all low-carbon energy sources need a level financial playing field, Mr Grossi said.\l"

The conference, which was expected to conclude on December 13, was extended till December 15, 2019 to arrive at a consensus on a range of issues, particularly Article 6 of Paris Agreement, Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts and climate finance.Addressing a Press Conference in New Delhi yesterday, Union Environment Minister, Mr Prakash Javadekar said that with the exception of climate finance issues, overall, India considers the outcome of COP 25 a balanced outcome which addresses concerns of all Parties, especially the developing countries and provides the necessary building blocks for successful implementation of the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement.""India engaged constructively in the negotiations while protecting India's key interests including consideration of principles of equity and Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC); need for enhanced means of implementation, including climate finance, technology transfer at affordable costs and capacity building support, from developed to developing countries in accordance with their obligations under the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement,"" said Mr Javadekar.The COP 25 decision, titled Chile Madrid Time for Action, emphasizes the continued challenges that developing countries face in accessing financial, technology and capacity-building support, and recognizes the urgent need to enhance the provision of support to developing country Parties for strengthening their national adaptation and mitigation efforts. The decision also recalls the commitment made by developed country Parties to a goal of mobilizing jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing country Parties. On the issue of global ambition for combating climate change, the decision adopted provides for a balanced and integrated view of ambition that includes not only efforts for climate change mitigation, but also for adaptation and means of implementation support from developed country parties to developing country parties.Some of the Key issues discussed at COP25 are enlisted below:-Pre-2020 implementation and ambition gaps: On the matter of Pre-2020 gaps in commitments and actions of developed countries under Kyoto Protocol, India, along with other developing countries, was successful in ensuring further work on it. The COP 25 decision provides for assessing the pre-2020 gaps through round tables at COP 26 in Glasgow, with written submissions from Parties. UNFCCC secretariat will prepare a summary report of the pre 2020 gaps in mitigation action and means of implementation support by developed country parties that had commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.\l"

The Bank has doubled its total climate change commitment to $25 billion between 2020 and 2025.The African Development Bank will on Monday kick off a campaign to present the continent's case at the world's leading climate change conference.The 25th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP)( https://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/events/african-development-bank-cop25-african-development-bank-cop25https://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/events/african-development-bank- HYPERLINK cop25 -african-development-bank- HYPERLINK cop25) comes at a crucial time for the globe and Africa in particular. In recent years, rising temperatures have wreaked havoc with weather patterns, leading to suffocating heat and devastating storms. In Africa, the climate has exacerbated food shortages and destroyed infrastructure.African countries know all too well the risks posed by climate change, said Wale Shonibare, the Bank's Acting Vice President for Power, Energy, Climate Change and Green Growth. He cited the devastating impact of Cyclones Idai and Kenneth in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Tanzania and the Comoros earlier this year.""However, Africa also offers climate smart investment opportunities - from country-led innovation centers, to transformative renewable energy initiatives. For example, this year, the Bank approved financing for the first on-grid solar power public-private partnership in Chad, under the Desert to Power initiative,"" Shonibare said.Projects like Desert to Power will be highlighted at COP 25, which will from 2 to 13 December bring together leaders and institutions from 196 nations plus the European Union, who have signed up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. At the heart of the matter are the Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs, which form part of the landmark Paris Agreement, signed in 2015 during COP21 in the French capital. The NDCs are specific climate change targets that each country must set.The Paris Agreement has been ratified by 51 out of 54 African countries. It binds countries to cutting carbon emissions to ensure that global temperatures do not rise by more than 2C by the end of this century, while attempting to contain it within 1.5C.Climate finance is another issue that will top the agenda at COP25 in Madrid.""2020 is a critical year in securing adequate resources for African countries to meet their Paris Agreement commitments, clarity and transparency on global climate finance access is essential to deliver climate action faster and at scale,"" said Anthony Nyong, Director Climate Change and Green Growth Department at the African Development Bank.The African Development Bank is joining the other Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) in a pavilion to showcase the joint commitment to combatting climate change. The Bank will participate in several panel discussions at , and will support the advocacy efforts of its regional member countries. The Bank is playing a leading role in guiding progress on climate change on the continent. Some of its achievements are: More than 50% of 2019 climate finance allocated to adaptation projects. 85% of investments are screened for climate risk and for greenhouse gas emissions. The Bank's ambition is to screen all projects by 2020. By next year, 40% of the Bank's own investments will be dedicated to climate finance. The Bank has doubled its total climate change commitment to $25 billion between 2020 and 2025, with more than half of it going to adaptation.Read more here( HYPERLINK https://www.afdb.org/en/cop25https://www.afdb.org/en/ HYPERLINK cop25) on the African Development Bank's role at COP25 or follow us for updates on:Source: African Development Bank\l"

The fourth-largest coal-producer, Australia, and Brazil, a major oil economy, have both threatened a US-style Paris-deal-walk-out though they haven't made any actual announcement. Climate action by three major fossil fuel producers, the US, Saudi Arabia, and Russia, is estimated to be critically insufficient (that is, if all countries were acting similarly, the world would heat beyond 4oC by 2100). Yet, fossil fuel phase-out-this would require planning commensurate to the paradigm shift that it is-is not on the explicit agenda for CoP25.The Katowice meeting (CoP24) was a lost opportunity-predictable, though, with host Poland being a major coal economy-but, if countries fail to make good in CoP25 and the major economies remain unwilling to adhere to the common but differentiated responsibilities principle, the Greta Thunbergs of the world would be right in accusing them of betraying future generations.The world is already 1.1oC warmer than pre-industrial levels, and even this warming has had disastrous effects-with just 12 years of emissions left to exhaust the carbon budget for 1.5oC warming, a planetary climate crisis is looming.Disasters rooted in climate change have already forced 20 million people to leave their homes annually over the past decade; people are seven times more likely to be internally displaced because of floods, cyclones, and wildfire than volcanic eruptions and earthquake, and three times more likely than because of conflict. The US shirking from the responsibility that its historical and current emissions demand in terms of climate action-it is currently the second-largest emitter and the largest per capita emitter-and the fact that NDCs are nowhere near as ambitious as required mean that CoP countries ex the US will have to vastly increase their commitment.At the UN Climate Action Summit, held in New York in September, nations didn't inspire much faith. CoP 25CoP25 will be the modalities of carbon markets that will allow big emitters to buy carbon credits from countries that keep well within their emission goals.For this mechanism to work, countries will have to first commit to sharper cuts-emissions must go down by 7.6% per year over the next decade if the world is to keep to the 2oC pathway-and developed nations must agree to stick to common but differentiated responsibilities.\l"

It can jeopardise the integrity of the process and not result in mitigation of the amount of emissions expected.Most of these sections are bracketed in the draft text which is being negotiated.On the topic of loss and damage, the US has allegedly sought a liability waiver. A note reportedly circulated with heads of delegations at COP25 says Washington plans to ensure it doesn't have to bear reparations associated with irreversible climate change impact in vulnerable countries.According to Harjeet Singh, ActionAid's global lead on climate change, the US has urged that Paragraph 51 of Article 8 of the COP 21 decision that led to the Paris Agreement be invoked with reference to compensation for loss and damage.Article 8 doesn't provide a basis for any liability or compensation.""This liability waiver was put into a COP decision and not the Paris Agreement itself,"" said Singh. ""Now, the US is also pushing for all parties to the convention (COP), including those not signed up in the Paris Agreement, to be on the executive committee... of the loss and damage mechanism. They want to ensure their polluting industries are protected from any kind of liability.""Both the draft text on carbon markets and loss and damage will be negotiated by ministers on Thursday and Friday.Brazil, South Africa, India and China(BASIC) issued a joint statement on Wednesday saying the outcome of the meeting depends on resolving the discussions on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which pertains to a new global carbon market.

It is one of the 15 recipients of the 2019 United Nations Global Climate Action Awards that help shine a light on some of the most practical examples of what people across the globe are doing to combat climate change. The award will be given at the United Nations (COP25), hosted by the Chilean government in Madrid in Spain, on December 10. The COP25 is being held from December 2-12. The Mahila Housing Sewa Trust's initiatives have so far helped 25,000 low-income families across seven cities in India, Bangladesh and Nepal. The project is centred around an integrated model wherein women take the lead through collective action and technology incubation to devise locally relevant, pro poor, gender-sensitive and climate-resilient solutions. For example, women were trained to be energy auditors who encourage households to switch to more efficient products, forming a women-led distribution network of green energy and building products. Other solutions include using sprinkler taps to reduce the flow of water, harvesting rainwater, and other behavioural changes leading to more than 60 per cent of households reporting to have increase in water quantity and more than 32 per cent having sufficient water during summers. Through projects like these, the Mahila Housing Sewa Trust is empowering women to take action against four major climate risks: heat waves, flooding and inundation, water scarcity, and water-vector-borne diseases, says the United Nations Climate Change. It says the Mahila Housing Sewa Trust has helped organise 114 community action groups, which have reached out to 27,227 women in 107 slums. Of the women they've worked with, 8,165 women were recorded to demonstrate an increase in ""knowledge seeking behavior"". Over 1,500 women have been trained as climate-saathis, who are responsible for communicating the issue of climate change with their community in their local language.

From 2021, three pairs of new meteorological observation satellites will be positioned in a geo-stationary orbit. Developed jointly by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European organization EUMETSAT, the MetOp satellites will generate critical observation data on the evolution of the climate over the next few years, thanks in particular to the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), created by Thales Alenia Space.This device would be partially inoperative without the use of a high-precision instrument called Corner Cube Mechanism, developed by the Neuchtel-based CSEM in close collaboration with various Swiss SMEs working at the cutting edge of technology.

"COP25","India","COP25_India49","COP25 climate summit: A massive failure of leadership?","December 17, 2019 Tuesday","Indian Express","The COP25 climate talks also ended without providing a direction to the road ahead and clearly lacked decisive leadership or good intentions.Despite scientific evidence pointing towards catastrophic effects of increasing anthropogenic emissions on the climate, the two-week-long COP 25 negotiations (the longest ever) in Madrid dismally failed to develop consensus to collectively respond to the climate crisis or decide on any enhanced ambition to tackle the looming threat. It failed to get world leaders to prioritise climate action even when there's mounting pressure on governments to do so. The negotiations were hostage to widening differences between countries on key issues agreed upon during the Paris Agreement of 2015, such as rules for carbon markets, most notably.The UN Secretary General's foreboding statement at the end of the long talks was a message to the international community that climate negotiators are not serious enough to tackle climate change. ""I am disappointed with the results of COP25,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement Sunday. ""The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis, he added.The climate talks also ended without providing a direction to the road ahead and clearly lacked decisive leadership or good intentions. Even as differences between governments regarding climate action was evident, the larger question of dealing with carbon credits to offset emissions and, more importantly, the issue of providing aid and support to vulnerable and poor countries for loss due to climate change, wasn't addressed adequately.The latest United Nations Emissions Gap Report 2019 had also presented unfavourable climate news: There's a yawning gap between 'what countries have committed and what they actually require to do to limit greenhouse gas targets'. In essence, the emissions report says that greenhouse gases (GHGs) rose over 1.5 per cent a year over the last decade.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has also warned that going beyond 1.5 degrees celsius means the ""bringing of eve wider-ranging and more destructive climate impacts"" including storm and heatwaves.One big issue that dominated discussions was the need to make developed countries more accountable to meet their climate obligations in the pre-2020 period.In this regard, India, China and others have been vehemently against committing to updating the NDCs, especially when developed countries are yet to fulfill their earlier promise of meeting climate obligations in the pre-2020 period. Because as per the Kyoto Protocol, which preceded the Paris Agreement, developed countries were obligated to cut their emissions, and provide money and technology to developing economies to help them battle climate change. However, the developed countries have fallen short of meeting these obligations, which is why developing countries led by India, China and Brazil had been lobbying to hold developed economies accountable to their past promises.""The problems we are facing today are not because of lack of intent but because of lack of implementation which is very glaringly visible in the unmet pre-2020 targets. The work programme was meant to address these gaps,"" India said.On the other hand, the United States, which pulled out of the Paris Climate agreement of 2015, demanded that the assessment of the pre-2020 actions be removed.More broadly, the lack of consensus among the stakeholders to combat climate change reflects a huge gap between the scientific evidence and what political leaders actually intend to do.\l"
"COP25","India","COP25_India50","India : Outcome of COP25 balanced, with the exception of Climate Finance issues","December 21, 2019 Saturday","TendersInfo","The 25th Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 25) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held under the Presidency of Chile in Madrid, Spain on 02nd 15th December 2018. The conference, which was expected to conclude on 13th December, was extended till 15th December 2019 to arrive at a consensus on a range of issues, particularly Article 6 of Paris Agreement, Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts and climate finance.Addressing a Press Conference in New Delhi today, Union Environment Minister, Shri Prakash Javadekar said that with the exception of climate finance issues, overall, India considers the outcome of COP 25 a balanced outcome which addresses concerns of all Parties, especially the developing countries and provides the necessary building blocks for successful implementation of the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement.India engaged constructively in the negotiations while protecting Indias key interests including consideration of principles of equity and Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC); need for enhanced means of implementation, including climate finance, technology transfer at affordable costs and capacity building support, from developed to developing countries in accordance with their obligations under the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement., said Shri Javadekar.Prime Minister ,Shri Narendra Modi has increased the target for renewables from 175 Giga Watts to 450 Giga Watts at the recent UN Climate Action Summit. India is simultaneously progressing on solar, biomass and wind energy, said the Union Minister. The COP 25 decision, titled Chile Madrid Time for Action, emphasizes the continued challenges that developing countries face in accessing financial, technology and capacity-building support, and recognizes the urgent need to enhance the provision of support to developing country Parties for strengthening their national adaptation and mitigation efforts. The decision also recalls the commitment made by developed country Parties to a goal of mobilizing jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing country Parties. On the issue of global ambition for combating climate change, the decision adopted provides for a balanced and integrated view of ambition that includes not only efforts for climate change mitigation, but also for adaptation and means of implementation support from developed country parties to developing country parties.Some of the Key issues discussed at COP25 are enlisted below:-Pre-2020 implementation and ambition gaps: On the matter of Pre-2020 gaps in commitments and actions of developed countries under Kyoto Protocol, India, along with other developing countries, was successful in ensuring further work on it. The COP 25 decision provides for assessing the pre-2020 gaps through round tables at COP 26 in Glasgow, with written submissions from Parties. UNFCCC secretariat will prepare a summary report of the pre 2020 gaps in mitigation action and means of implementation support by developed country parties that had commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.Summary of these roundtables will serve as an input for the second periodic review of the long-term global goal under the Convention, which will start in 2020 and conclude in 2022. The decision on Periodic Review ensures that it will assess the overall aggregated effect of the steps taken by Parties in order to achieve the long-term global goal in the light of the ultimate objective of the Convention, in accordance with the relevant principles and provisions of the Convention and on the basis of the best available science.Article 6 under the Paris Agreement: the guidance for Article 6 for market and non-market mechanisms could not be agreed due to divergences among Parties. However, India was successful in protecting its key positions in the last draft decision text presented including on transition of Clean Development Mechanism under Kyoto Protocol to the post-2020 period and provision of share of proceeds from market mechanisms as well as cooperative approaches, for adaptation fund to address the climate change adaptation needs of developing countries. India insisted that fundamental principles of market reliability and parity between Article 6.2 and Article 6.4 must be preserved. Indias concerns are reflected in the draft texts that will be negotiated in further meetings of the COP. India argued for incentivizing private sector through Article 6.4 with adequate returns without requirement of adjusting Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) that are country driven.Enhanced Transparency Framework (Monitoring, Reporting and Verification): in the discussions on technical elements under transparency, India argued for a robust transparency framework for both action and support provided by developed to developing countries. Further the common formats should operationalize flexibility for developing countries to reflect the principle of differentiation. Discussion on this matter will continue in the next COP26.Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM) for Loss and Damage: under the review of WIM for loss and damage associated with Climate Change Impacts, the decision recognizes urgency of scaling-up of action and support, as appropriate, including finance, technology and capacity-building, for developing countries for averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage, including from Green Climate Fund (GCF). The decision also established the Santiago network for catalyzing technical assistance for implementation of relevant approaches at in developing countries. Adaptation: On adaptation related matters, India has been stressing on parity between mitigation and adaptation.\l"

With regard to Article 6, which seeks to regulate the carbon market to encourage the implementation of actions by the private sector, the parties did not reach agreements.The balance is positive in terms of the issues agreed by the parties, however, despite exhausting all efforts and marathon negotiations, we could not close Article 6. Today, the countries have been indebted to the planet, said COP25 president Carolina Schmidt, who also said in her closing address that the world is watching us and expects concrete solutions from us. For the same reason, today we are not satisfied. The agreements reached by the parties are not sufficient to face the climate change crisis with a sense of urgency. There are still no consensus to increase ambition to the levels we need.The balance is positive in terms of the issues agreed by the parties, however, despite exhausting all efforts and marathon negotiations, we could not close Article 6.

For the same reason, today we are not satisfied. The agreements reached by the parties are not sufficient to face the climate change crisis with a sense of urgency. There are still no consensus to increase ambition to the levels we need.The governments unanimously agreed on the state of urgency and the need to increase the ambition to respond to climate change in the next half century inviting countries to update their NDCs and commit to carbon neutrality by 2050. Expressing their commitment under the Climate Ambition Alliance (Annex 1), 114 countries expressed their commitment to work on updating their NDCs by 2020, increasing ambition and 121 countries to work on long-term strategies considering carbon neutrality by 2050 as a goal to achieve in mitigation.At COP25In turn, responding to the science call of the need to be carbon neutral by 2050, the Climate Ambition Alliance also includes 121 countries, 15 subnational governments, 398 cities, 786 companies and 16 investors with assets for 4 trillion dollars, all of them committed to being carbon neutral by 2050.In the 25th version of the Conference of the Parties, the extension of the Global Climate Action was completed until 2025 to accelerate the climate action of cities, regions, companies and civil society supporting countries in the implementation of their commitments under the Paris Agreement .The agreement reached on gender was very much concluded by the Parties. The Gender Action Plan (Annex 2) will strengthen the role and empowerment of women in their respective local communities, providing them with tools to better face climate change. In the margin of the negotiations, on the day of Agriculture and Forests, the Platform for Climate Action in Agriculture of Latin America and the Caribbean (PLACA) was launched, with the accession of Ministers from nine countries in the region and whose first meeting would be in March 2020.Also, on Energy Day, the ministers of Chile and Colombia launched the regional goal for Latin America and the Caribbean on Renewable Energies, which seeks to increase the share of renewable energy to reach an average of 70% in the region per year 2030. We know that climate change is unfair. That is why the COP25 Presidency focused on changing course in various aspects, said COP25 President Carolina Schmidt.Another change of course is the step from negotiation to action, mainstreaming climate action to all productive sectors to make them part of the solution. For the first time in the history of the COP, high-level meetings were held with the ministers who lead the main emitting and capturing sectors of Greenhouse Gases (GHG): ministers of Agriculture and Energy, in addition to the celebration of Transportation Day.It also highlights the change in direction that the presence of global finance in climate action meant, bringing together the ministers of this sector for the first time at a COP. The coalition of finance ministers from 51 countries, which together represent 30% of the world's GDP, launched an action plan to address climate change.In this change of direction, the COP25 presidency also wanted to turn Science into a key ally, not only in diagnosis but also as a guide to solutions. Innovation, technology transfer, capacity building and nature-based solutions are key to more ambitious, faster and more effective climate action.\l"

"COP25","India","COP25_India56","Cote Dlvoire,Spain : Hola, Madrid! African Development Bank takes the continents climate agenda to COP25 in Spain","November 30, 2019 Saturday","TendersInfo","- The Bank is playing a leading role in guiding progress on climate change on the continent. The Bank has doubled its total climate change commitment to $25 billion between 2020 and 2025.The African Development Bank will on Monday kick off a campaign to present the continents case at the worlds leading climate change conference.The 25th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP) comes at a crucial time for the globe and Africa in particular. In recent years, rising temperatures have wreaked havoc with weather patterns, leading to suffocating heat and devastating storms. In Africa, the climate has exacerbated food shortages and destroyed infrastructure.African countries know all too well the risks posed by climate change, said Wale Shonibare, the Banks Acting Vice President for Power, Energy, Climate Change and Green Growth. He cited the devastating impact of Cyclones Idai and Kenneth in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Tanzania and the Comoros earlier this year.However, Africa also offers climate smart investment opportunities from country-led innovation centers, to transformative renewable energy initiatives. For example, this year, the Bank approved financing for the first on-grid solar power public-private partnership in Chad, under the Desert to Power initiative, Shonibare said.Projects like Desert to Power will be highlighted at COP 25, which will from 2 to 13 December bring together leaders and institutions from 196 nations plus the European Union, who have signed up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. At the heart of the matter are the Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs, which form part of the landmark Paris Agreement, signed in 2015 during COP21 in the French capital. The NDCs are specific climate change targets that each country must set.The Paris Agreement has been ratified by 51 out of 54 African countries. It binds countries to cutting carbon emissions to ensure that global temperatures do not rise by more than 2C by the end of this century, while attempting to contain it within 1.5C.Climate finance is another issue that will top the agenda at COP25 in Madrid.2020 is a critical year in securing adequate resources for African countries to meet their Paris Agreement commitments, clarity and transparency on global climate finance access is essential to deliver climate action faster and at scale, said Anthony Nyong, Director Climate Change and Green Growth Department at the African Development Bank.The African Development Bank is joining the other Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) in a pavilion to showcase the joint commitment to combatting climate change. The Bank will participate in several panel discussions at , and will support the advocacy efforts of its regional member countries. The Bank is playing a leading role in guiding progress on climate change on the continent. Some of its achievements are:- More than 50% of 2019 climate finance allocated to adaptation projects.- 85% of investments are screened for climate risk and for greenhouse gas emissions. The Banks ambition is to screen all projects by 2020.- By next year, 40% of the Banks own investments will be dedicated to climate finance.- The Bank has doubled its total climate change commitment to $25 billion between 2020 and 2025, with more than half of it going to adaptation.\l"
"COP25","India","COP25_India57","COP 25: Failure of talks shows countries willing to sacrifice future of planet; The failure of COP25 talks shows that To make a few billion dollars from the car....","December 18, 2019 Wednesday","The Financial Express","It was a farce. Yes, I am talking about the just concluded 25th Conference of Parties (CoP25) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Madrid, Spain. More than 25,000 people attended this longest-ever UN climate conference-it went over time by two days, and ended up with more animosity between countries than ever before. The ridiculous disconnect between the realities of the climate crisis and the willingness of the countries to do something about it was evident throughout the conference; the end only cemented it. But, should this outcome surprise us?Since 1992, when the UNFCCC was adopted to ""stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system"", the negotiations have gone downhill. The disagreements between the developed and the developing countries have only intensified every passing year. They have turned the negotiations toxic and counterproductive. The rancorous nature of the talks was starkly visible at CoP25. had one primary deliverable-to frame the rules for the carbon market under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. This is the last remaining piece of the Paris ""rulebook"" as the rest was agreed upon in 2018 at Katowice, Poland. But, even after two weeks and two additional days' talks, countries couldn't reach a deal, and the negotiation on the carbon market was pushed to another CoP in 2020. Most disconcerting about the failed talks is the petty issues on which the dispute happened. Let us comprehend this lowest of the low.The Paris Agreement is built around a grand international carbon market. In this market, carbon credits can be sold between developed and developing countries; between developed and developed countries; between developing and developing countries; between the private and the public sector, and all sorts of other permutations and combinations. It is no more the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the past, wherein only developed countries bought carbon credits from the developing countries. Under this new market mechanism, India can buy carbon credits from the US to meet its targets, and the US can buy from a private company in China to meet its targets. With such an intricate market design, it was incumbent on the countries in Madrid to agree to the rules that led to an effective and robust carbon market, unlike the one under the Kyoto Protocol.The market mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol was marred with loopholes. Firstly, it gave billions of tonnes of emission allowance, called the ""assigned amount units"" (AAUs) to developed countries. Developed countries were allowed to either trade in AAUs, or to use them to offset their emissions. Countries like Russia and Australia were given so many AAUs that they had to do little to meet their emission reduction commitments. Similarly, the CDM market was designed in such a way that all developed countries' emission reduction obligations could be outsourced. Many developed countries, therefore, bought cheap carbon credits from developing countries and did nothing domestically. There was also ""carbon leakage"", and corruption in the system. The result of all this was that instead of reducing emissions, the Kyoto carbon market led to their net increase. There was also no real transition towards low-carbon development in developing countries, as the cheapest possible technologies were used to generate carbon credits.To avoid the mistake of the Kyoto market mechanism, a group of 30 countries, led by Costa Rica, released the ""San Jose Principles"" at Madrid, to make the Paris carbon market robust. The benchmarks it used are commonsensical, and should have been acceptable to any country interested in combating the climate crisis. For instance, the San Jose Principles promotes rules that lead to an overall reduction in global emissions. It also prohibits the use of pre-2020 AAUs and CDM credits as these credits would further dilute the already-weak commitments made by countries under the Paris Agreement. It is worth remembering that the commitments made under the Paris Agreement are taking the to a path of catastrophic 3oC temperature increase. But, despite this dire prognosis, the San Jose Principles became a massive bone of contention.The question of how to deal with CDM credits, potentially amounting to more a billion tonnes of CO2, become a big point of contention. The lion's share of this carbon credit is in a handful of countries, particularly China, India, and Brazil. China alone has an estimated half a billion tonne equivalent of credits; India has around 100 million tonnes. India and China wanted these credits to be carried forward to the Paris carbon market, which was opposed by many vulnerable countries. For this billion tonne of credits, equivalent to a few hundred million dollars (the current price of carbon is less than $0.25/tonne), the negotiations were stalled.Similarly, Australia, which holds about 400 million tonnes of AAUs (equivalent to $100 million), wanted to use it towards its Paris target. If Australia is allowed to do so, it will meet half of its Paris target to cut emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2030. So, Australia obstructed the negotiations because it wanted to do as little as possible domestically.In a nutshell, the CoP25 at Madrid failed because few developed countries wanted to do as little as possible, and few developing countries were interested in making quick money from the carbon market. When millions of people are suffering due to global warming every year, including in India, the dispute over a few billions of dollars is nothing but petty and insensitive. This is the crux of the problem with the current negotiations-they are petty and inconsiderate. Every country is looking at its narrow economic gains in climate negotiations. Worst still, they view the talks as a zero-sum game.But, to most people outside the negotiating rooms, it is clear that in a rapidly warming world, the interest of countries and the interest of the planet are two sides of the same coin. Climate crisis demands that countries cooperate and work together to reduce emissions, and not focus on their petty self-interest. But, this can only happen if the climate change negotiations move from being viewed as a zero-sum game to a positive-sum game. At the UNFCCC, this is not possible; the politics is just too toxic. We should, therefore, seriously think about abandoning UNFCCC and creating multi-sectoral, multi-regional platforms to cooperate on climate change. Without this, we are doomed.(The author is CEO, iFOREST Twitter: @Bh_Chandra)Load-Date:\~December 18, 2019\l"

I don't see it likely that it is going to do that in 2020, till it sees what other countries do,"" Ghosh said.The UNCCC, or COP26 as the Glasgow, Scotland edition is called, is supposed to be held in November later this year. It is the last climate conference before the levels set for Paris Agreement are scheduled to come into play.Following US President Donald Trump's pulling out of the agreement after coming into office, the entire ethos of the Paris Agreement has been lost, Ghosh said. Apart from the US, other developing countries such as Brazil have questioned the agreement. Both China and Germany's emissions dropped for a bit, but then have steadily risen since.""All this culminated with in Madrid in late 2019, which demonstrated that we really had not put in place the nuts and bolts that could operationalise the agreement, which now completely changes the context for COP26,"" Ghosh said.Since 2015, investments in clean energy have beaten thermal and fossil- the traditional sources of power. ""We are averaging around $10 to $11 billion annually, but to meet our existing targets we will need at least $30 billion a year in investments,"" he said.However, with growing concerns over non-payment of dues to distribution companies (discoms), the renewable market remains wary of further investments. ""Figuring out a way to de-risk investments in India, whether through policy measures, regulatory fixes, central and state guarantees, improved grid or even combining projects with other countries, are things India should be looking at,"" Ghosh said.

The presence of legislative members at Indonesia's participation in the Climate Change Conference is expected to assist Indonesia's efforts in taking action to tackle climate change even greater, especially in building support in the political field.As the Indonesian Delegation at the Climate Change Conference, Cak Imin is also scheduled to open the Indonesian Pavilion on Wednesday 4 December 2019. In addition, Cak Imin will be the keynote speaker in one of the forums in the Indonesian Pavilion with material titled Collaborative Climate Action, Legislative and Executive Continuous Supports.""With this COP25COP 25 which was attended by approximately 197 countries.Cak Imin also added that the Indonesian Delegation should encourage the involvement of politicians, influential figures and religious organization figures, including in the DPR in overseeing and assisting Indonesia's efforts to tackle climate change.Cak Imin also advised that Indonesia's participation in the Conference should be even more ambitious, because according to him Indonesia's position was very strategic in the effort to control climate supplies. Indonesia's vast forests must be our strength in diplomacy with other countries, especially developed countries in efforts to control climate change.Correspondingly, one day earlier the UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres warned that the effects of climate change would accelerate, and called on governments in the world to show increased ambition and commitment in tackling climate change.""Climate-related natural disasters are becoming more frequent, more deadly, more destructive, with increasing human and financial costs. Drought in some parts of the developing world at an alarming rate is destroying human habitat and endangering food security. Every year, air pollution, related to climate change, kills seven million people. ""Climate change has become a dramatic threat to human health and security,"" he saidHe warned that the threat of climate change is no longer a long-term threat, but is a threat that has been faced by humans at the present time and causes a global crisis. The directives of the researchers to keep the temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius must be worked on together. Therefore human behavior must be changed in treating nature.""Today, the world will produce 120 percent more fossil fuels than is consistent with the 1.5 degree pathway. And, for coal, the figure is 280 percent. But the scientific community also tells us that the road map to stay below 1.5 degrees is still within reach, ""he said.Political behavior in a country, according to him, is very important in encouraging the success of climate change countermeasures. At present the political will is felt to be lacking in looking at the importance of efforts to control climate change. The use of coal-fired power plants and fossil fuel subsidies has at least shown the country's lack of political commitment in supporting global efforts to control climate change.For this reason, according to him, it is important to increase climate ambitions and to achieve the ambitious temperature reduction goals of the Paris Agreement. this is to secure a more ambitious national commitment, especially from the main emitters of greenhouse gases, to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a consistent pace to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.On the first day after the opening ceremony of the conference, the delegation of the Republic of Indonesia participated in the discussion on loss and damage, Transparency and MRV, Response and Measures.\l"

""COP25COP25 on Sunday morning. The text, however, is vague in stating, ""in light of climate urgency encourages parties to submit enhanced NDCs in 2020"". Negotiators failed to reach an outcome on carbon markets. In the final hours of negotiations, over 30 governments joined behind the San Jose Principles in an effort to preserve the integrity of carbon market rules and prevent loopholes and the ability for double-counting carbon credits. Santiago network established to lead more work on implementation to minimize, avoid and recover from loss and damage. However, the final text is weaker than the previous version. In term of finance, it ""urges"" scale up of support by developed countries and other Parties in a position to do so, as well as private and non-governmental organisations, funds and other stakeholders; but then only invites the Green Climate Fund (GCF) Board to continue providing resources for loss and damage, and invites it to take into account, within its mandate, the strategic work streams of the WIM executive committee. Governments have failed to respond to the emergency of the climate crisis as the talks fell victim to major differences between countries that are proving hard to resolve. Observers of the summit in Madrid held G20 countries - especially with the US, Brazil, Australia, Saudi Arabia - and major oil, gas and coal companies responsible for undermining the climate ambition and blocking the progress for better response to this global challenge. Canada, Japan, China and India were also faulted for their complacency as they failed to support vulnerable nations in the face of brutal impacts and push for a more robust collective response in 2020. The EU tried to play its role as bridge-builder between developing and developed countries. However, it will take a major diplomatic push and bigger leadership alliance to deliver substantial outcomes at COP26 in Glasgow. The United Nations is expected to begin new work on the ocean and climate change and consider measures to strengthen mitigation and adaptation action, while also considering related climate change action on land. According to the UN, the next 14 months are critical for global efforts to control greenhouse gas emissions, which hit a record high in 2018. Under the Paris Agreement, governments agreed to update their climate plans by 2020. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was ""disappointed"" by the results of a major UN climate summit in Madrid, calling it a missed opportunity to tackle the global warming crisis. Guterres issued the statement as the COP25 concluded its marathon meeting voicing ""the urgent need"" for new carbon cutting commitments but falling well short of what was required. ""I am disappointed with the results of COP25,"" Guterres said. ""The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis."" COP25 brought together representatives of nearly 200 countries to finalise implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit the rise in global temperatures to less than two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit). But the talks risked collapsing on Saturday after all-night negotiations left countries more divided than ever over on how to fight global warming and pay for its ravages. Competing national interests proved insurmountable despite global calls for action in the face of extreme weather phenomena and increasingly dire warnings from climate scientists. ""We must not give up and I will not give up,"" Guterres said. ""I'm more determined than ever to work for 2020 to be the year in which all countries commit to do what science tells us is necessary to reach carbon neutrality in 2050 and a no more than 1.5-degree temperature rise. \l"

To mark the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the Madrid pavilion features the humble 'charkha' or the spinning wheel, which is the physical embodiment of the Gandhian principles of perseverance, self-sufficiency and sustainability. Delegates and participants representing 197 countries at the 25th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) or COP25 are invited to try their hand at spinning the fabric of sustainability at the India Pavilion, an official statement said here. Gandhi had warned: ""A certain degree of physical harmony and comfort is necessary, but above a certain level it becomes a hindrance instead of a help. Therefore, the ideal of creating an unlimited number of wants and satisfying them seems to be a delusion and a snare."" India's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) has a separate goal on lifestyles to put forward and further propagate a healthy and sustainable way of living based on traditions and values of conservation and moderation. Spinning the charkha is a symbolic act that provides an opportunity for delegates and participants at COP25 to step back and reflect on their consumption choices and be reminded of the ancient wisdom of need-based consumption that motivates to draw less from nature and replenish more. Climate change should be seen as an ""opportunity"" rather than a ""threat"" for adopting a sustainable growth pathway, undertaking poverty alleviation measures and attracting investment. According to the UN, a key objective of COP25 is to raise overall ambition also by completing several key aspects with respect to the full operationalisation of the Paris Climate Change Agreement. India will look to engage in negotiations with a constructive and positive outlook and work towards protecting its long-term development interests. India has been ambitious in its actions and has emphasised that developed countries should take the lead in undertaking ambitious actions and fulfil their climate finance commitments of mobilising $100 billion per annum by 2020 and progressively and substantially scale up their financial support to inform parties for future action through NDCs. India will further stress upon the need for fulfilling the pre-2020 commitments by developed countries, and that pre-2020 implementation gaps should not present an additional burden to developing countries in the post-2020 period. The Indian delegation will be led by Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar. He is reaching Madrid on December 7. The COP25 is an important as countries prepare to move from the pre-2020 period under the Kyoto Protocol to the post-2020 period under the Paris Agreement.

Countries also reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris Agreement, reports Efe news. The document, named Chile-Madrid Time For Action, came two days after the COP25 summit had been scheduled to conclude and is the product of marathon negotiations that extended into the early hours of Sunday. Host nation Chile, represented by Carolina Schmidt, approved the text following a tense debate in which Brazil took objection to certain stipulations on oceans and land use. The final deal from the COP25 means nations must boost their commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in 2020. It also established scientific facts as the basis of policymaking on climate. The accord reiterated the importance of moving towards carbon neutrality and said a shift toward green energy would boost employment opportunities. The summit in Madrid was viewed as a preparatory step for the COP26 set to take place in Glasgow next year, when country performances within the framework of the Paris Agreement, which looks to limit the average global temperature increase to 1.5 C above preindustrial levels, will be up for review. The delay at COP25 stemmed from divisions in the plenary meeting. Some countries, led by the European Union, argued that it was important by the end of 2020 that all Paris Agreement-aligned countries upwardly revise their commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (the so-called Nationally Determined Contributions). But other nations, including Brazil, China and India, were resisting calls to commit to much more ambitious emissions cuts. Although data from 2014 to 2017 suggested global annual emissions of carbon dioxide had roughly stabilized, data from the Global Carbon Project reported a further annual increase of 2.7 per cent and 0.6 per cent in 2018 and 2019, respectively, according to the Our World in Data website.

"COP25","India","COP25_India76","Climate Emergency CoP 25: New platform linking oceans and climate launched in Madrid","December 19, 2019","Indian Agriculture News","December 19 -- The challenge of tackling the climate emergency is helped, to an extent, by natural carbon sinks\~- forests, soil, and the oceans. These sinks absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, partially offsetting the huge surplus of emissions that humans add to it.While land and forests are central to discussions on emission reduction, and are a designated 'sector' under most assessments of national emissions, the oceans do not get the same treatment.This is due to a combination of factors. Only a limited part of the oceans is legally part of any given nation's territory, making them difficult to account for. Unlike other sinks, ocean uptake of carbon dioxide has a huge negative effect\~- ocean acidification\~- which threatens species, especially sensitive ones like coral. Oceans need a different type of climate solution.A new international initiative at the 25th Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP25) currently underway in Madrid aims to kickstart the search for such solutions. The Platform of Science-based Ocean Solutions aims ""to enhance the sharing of knowledge created by various actors in the ocean and climate community to advance ocean-climate action"".The platform builds on the momentum of an IPCC Special Report on Oceans and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) earlier this year. The SROCC highlighted that ""the global ocean has warmed unabated since 1970 and has taken up more than 90 per cent of the excess heat in the climate system."" It has also absorbed 20-30 per cent of total human-caused carbon dioxide emissions since the 1980s, causing increasing surface acidification.Since 1993, the rate of ocean warming has more than doubled, according to the IPCC, which has resulted in marine heatwaves doubling in frequency since 1982 and increasing in intensity (very high confidence). In a significant stride forward for the nascent field of attribution science, the report noted that ""it is very likely that between 84-90 per cent of marine heatwaves that occurred between 2006 and 2015 are attributable to the anthropogenic temperature increase.""The scheduled release of the report this year prompted the host country, Chile, to declare that COP25The rest of the promise will have to be met in the new national climate targets, which are due next year. The most specific aim of the new platform is ""to encourage the incorporation of the ocean in climate strategies (Nationally Determined Contribtutions, National Adaptation Plans, Adaptation Communications, and National Policy Frameworks).""Integrating oceans into national targets will be challenging. The most direct way to do this is by taking into account coastal ecosystems. The SROCC notes, for example, that ""nearly 50 percant of coastal wetlands have been lost over the last 100 years, as a result of the combined effects of localised human pressures, sea level rise, warming and extreme climate events"".Because of their proximity to national territory, these ecosystems are, in one sense, the easiest to integrate into national targets. This could add significantly to global ambition\~- \~the loss of coastal vegetation (such as mangroves) is currently responsible for the release of up to around 5.3 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide each year.Still, doing so will be complex\~- India's afforestation target is proving to be a challenge. The Forest Survey of India's State of Forest Report started including data on carbon sequestration only recently. This year's report references mangroves but does not provide estimates of sequestration from them.This climate-and-ocean intersection also needs a good sounding board to weed out dangerous ideas\~- like 'ocean fertilization', which involves adding iron to the ocean surface to intensify the growth of carbon-absorbing phytoplankton, or generating carbon credits based on sinks.The Platform of Science-based Ocean Solutions will be critical to building technical capacity on both these fronts.\l"

MHPS will present model exhibits of clean power generating technologies using hydrogen as fuel (hydrogen gas turbines and fuel cells system).Hydrogen gas turbines are a cutting-edge, clean power generating technology that supports Japan's 3E+S policy, promotes carbon-free or low-carbon energy to achieve a hydrogen society, and contributes to the conservation of the global environment. By switching from conventional natural gas to hydrogen as fuel, only water is generated after combustion, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. MHPS has already established the technology for large gas turbines fired with a mix of 30% hydrogen and 70% natural gas, and is currently pursuing a project to convert a 440 MW natural gas-fired GTCC power plant facility in the Netherlands to a 100% hydrogen-fired plant, scheduled to begin operations in 2025.Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) offer high-efficiency power generation and reduce CO2 emissions, making the technology an effective option for distributed power source or cogeneration systems. One of MHPS's MEGAMIE hybrid systems combining SOFC and micro gas turbines (MGT) has been in commercial operation at the Marunouchi building of Mitsubishi Estate Co., Ltd. since March 2019, supplying electric power and heat.MHPS, by stimulating demand for the utilization of hydrogen through events such as this, and driving the establishment of an international supply chain to produce, carry, and store hydrogen, is helping to mitigate climate change and facilitate the realization of a hydrogen society.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Pivotal Sources.

Countries will have to increase their NDC ambitions threefold to achieve the well below 2 degree C goal and more than five-fold to achieve the 1.5 degree C goal.Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have risen at a rate of 1.5% per year in the last decade. There is no sign of GHG emissions peaking in the next few years after which they can start declining rapidly, the report said indicating a large gap in current emissions and action needed to avert climate change crisis.By 2030, emissions would need to be 25% and 55% lower than in 2018 to put the world on a pathway to meet the 2 degree C target.The G20 countries account for 78% of all emissions, but 7 of them do not have policies yet to achieve their current NDCs. On the progress of G20 economies, India along with China, the EU, Mexico, Russia and Turkey are on track to meet their goals, the report highlighted. Among them, India, Russia and Turkey are projected to over-achieve their NDC emission targets.""These results suggest that the three countries have room to raise their NDC ambition significantly. The EU has introduced climate legislation that achieves at least a 40% reduction in GHG emissions, which the European Commission projects could be overachieved if domestic legislation is fully implemented in member states,"" the report said.The delay in arriving at a global consensus to limit global temperature rise to 2 degree C has led to a situation where countries will need to make large cuts in CO2 emissions immediately.The report projects that had climate action begun in 2010, the cuts required per year to meet the projected emissions levels for 2 degree C and 1.5 degree C would only have been 0.7% and 3.3% per year on average.Due to the delay in making an agreement the required cuts in emissions are now 2.7% per year from 2020 for the 2 degree C goal and about 7.6% per year on average for the 1.5 degree C goal.The World Meteorological Organisation on Monday said greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere had reached a record high in 2018.The globally averaged concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) reached 407.8 parts per million in 2018, up from 405.5 parts per million (ppm) in 2017.Since 1990, there has been a 43% increase in total radiative forcing - the warming effect on the climate by greenhouse gases.""There is no sign of a slowdown, let alone a decl"

However, recent scientific findings show that current greenhouse gas concentrations threaten our planet with global temperatures set to rise by 3-5 Celsius by 2100. This is why we need to intensify and increase the ambition of our action to limit the increase of global warming to well below 2 Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 Celsius above pre-industrial levels.To achieve this will require enormous investments to flow into sustainable infrastructure over the next decades. Since public funding will not be sufficient, private investors will have to play a key role as will financial markets themselves. Their global nature gives them great potential to link local financing needs to global sources of funding.We should therefore coordinate and link our work together, strengthening international cooperation to scale up sustainable finance globally and promote the integration of markets for green financial products.

The &#8364;18 million initiative was announced by the European Commission and a consortium of 19 partners at the United Nations (COP25) in Madrid, Spain. It will show how innovative and flexible hydropower systems can help countries across the world to meet their renewable energy targets. The official launch of the project comes after a major UN Emissions Gap Report looking at ways to reduce global carbon emissions said that greater power system flexibility was ""key"" to integrating larger shares of variable renewable energy into the power supply.About the XFLEX HYDRO projectThe XFLEX HYDRO technologies to be tested are enhanced variable- and fixed-speed turbine systems, smart controls and a battery-turbine hybrid, each of which will be demonstrated at hydropower plant sites across Europe. The project will conclude in 2023 by delivering a roadmap to increase adoption of the technologies across the hydropower fleet, with policy and market recommendations for governments, regulators and industry. The initiative has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. It aims to help the EU achieve a target of achieving 32% of energy from renewable sources by 2030.Making the Frades 2 demonstrator even more efficientVoith supplied the pumped storage plant Frades 2 in Portugal with two variable speed pump turbines each with a rated output of 390 MW, two asynchronous motor generators with a rated output of 440 MVA each, the frequency converter and control systems as well as the hydraulic steel components. Within the XFLEX HYDRO project, Voith Hydro is in the lead of the development and implementation of additional solutions to make the Frades 2 demonstrator even more efficient. The aim is to extend power range through integration of hydraulic short circuit technology for variable speed machines and therewith increase the dispatchability of renewable energies. Another goal is to enhance high-quality and flexible ancillary services of the electric power system by implementing synthetic inertia and frequency containment reserve. By optimizing plant operation through application of multidimensional hillchart methods and optimized mode change procedures, maintenance intervals will be improved and outage times minimized. Furthermore, the annual energy production will be increased by reducing the power consumption of the auxiliary equipment.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Pivotal Sources.

The pavilion also depicts the present and traces the arc into the future of the country, where Government of India is implementing ambitious solutions to deal with the issue of climate change, inspired by the teachings of the Mahatma, and our cultural underpinnings based on the principles of sustainable consumption and production. As such, the pavilion has a special focus on 'sustainable lifestyles' as a solution to climate change.Shri C.K. Mishra said that Gandhi ji was ahead of his times when he spoke of sustainable development and need to care for our earth and its resources. To mark the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the Pavilion features the humble 'Charkha' or the spinning wheel which is the physical embodiment of the Gandhian principles of perseverance, self-sufficiency and sustainability. The Secretary invited delegates and participants representing 197 countries to try their hand at spinning the 'fabric of sustainability' at the India Pavilion.The Secretary further mentioned that over the next 10 days, India will be organizing 20 side events in the pavilion on important issues for climate change adaptation and mitigation. He added that presentations and panel discussions involving experts from both public and private spheres will be organized. The India Pavilion will provide a platform for exchange of innovative ideas for the world to come together and take action to combat climate change.In his closing remarks, Shri C.K. Mishra said that it is crucial that we find ways to combat climate change not just through modern technologies but with the wisdom of our collective cultural tradition and hoping that concrete steps are taken to promote sustainable lifestyles and climate justice globally.The India Pavilion at COP 25, Madrid displays India's climate action across a range of sectors, covering both activities for mitigation and adaptation. India has formulated ambitious contributions to combat climate change that have been nationally determined, keeping in view India's development imperatives and sustainable growth. India Pavilion provides an opportunity for the world to see India's policies and programmes for combating climate change, across sectors like industry, renewable energy, transportation, agriculture, forestry etc. Various reports indicate that India's climate actions are ambitious and the Country is on track to achieve its nationally determined contributions by 2030, under the Paris agreement.\l"

In 2018, emissions totaled 55 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent. This is putting the Earth on course to experience a temperature rise of 3.2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century, rather than the 1.5 degree goal set in the Paris Agreement.This critical situation has prompted the conference, which will last till Dec. 13, to choose ""Time for Action"" as its motto.Kuhn believes that market mechanisms should be well designed to stimulate investment in projects like reforestation and other climate-friendly economic activities. Therefore, COP25 is of great importance to implement the Paris Agreement.Cooperation crucialThe event comes after the United States formally initiated its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement earlier last month, impacting global cooperation on climate change with its unilateral move.""It will be more difficult for the world to stop climate change by reducing the annual emissions effectively to zero without the United States,"" said Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science.World leaders and experts are using COP25 as a venue for promoting multilateralism.

He also said that we have sleepwalked past the point of no return. The 25-odd Prime Ministers/Presidents present spoke of their long-term commitments, yet it remains clear that the political will is wanting. Further, the largest-ever scientific community attending COP 25 warned that the impact of climate crisis is far more significant than previously estimated.There were three key issues on the agenda: (1) Carbon markets dealt with in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, (2) loss and damage under Article 8 and setting up of a fund to help poor countries reeling from climate crisis, and (3) enhancing NDCs by all countries to curb emissions. The first two issues are pending from COP 24, held in Katowice (Poland), to be finalised in the Paris rulebook.Article 6 relates to matters like rules, modalities and procedures for the new global carbon markets after 2020 when the Kyoto Protocol expires. Carbon credits would lose economic value if they are not transitioned over to the new market mechanism. After years of effort, governments could not agree on rules that would allow trade in carbon credits. Carbon markets trade in emission reduction credits, which means that a country that has overachieved its target can sell carbon credits to others. More than half the countries have included carbon credits in their NDCs as one of the means to achieve emission reduction goals. It is important to ensure environmental integrity of these credits.Article 8 deals with devising a system for compensating loss and damage to vulnerable nations and reviewing the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage established at COP 19 in 2013. We need a standard approach to quantify loss and damage to implement the Paris Agreement and also a financing window for financial action on loss and damage under the Green Climate Fund. However, of the $100 billion per year committed by developed countries by 2020 in the Paris Agreement, only $5.6 billion appears to be coming till this year.Having said that, let me mention about a few interesting reports that were circulated on the sidel"

"COP25","India","COP25_India102","Will COP25 Build The Momentum For Increased Climate Action?","December 3, 2019 Tuesday","Youth Ki Awaaz","India, Dec. 3 -- What Is COP25?COP25 is the 25th conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). UNFCCC, an international environment treaty, was adopted on May 09, 1992, at the Earth Summit at Rio, Brazil. The first such conference, i.e., COP1, was hosted at Berlin, Germany in 1995.'Parties' is the term used to refer to the signatories (countries) of the UNFCCC. For almost three decades, the signatories have met every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every nation on earth is treaty-bound to ""avoid dangerous climate change"", and find pathways to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.This year Costa Rica wanted to host the event, but due to the lack of resources, Chile pitched in, and everything was set for the COP in Santiago. But rioting in the city and national political crisis forced the COP to be moved. The Spanish government then stepped up, and Madrid was finalized as the venue for the COP25.COP25?The negotiations, led by the environment ministers, UN officials and civil servants will go until 13th December. Almost every country will send their representative of a senior rank. More significant economies are expected to have a large delegation. Top world leaders may not show up for the event, but many of the celebrities and VIPs will mark their presence. Representatives from NGOs, Policy, and advocacy and research groups, climate activists and environmentalists will also be an integral part of the event. Journalist and media groups will extensively follow the event.The most important thing about the COPs is that they are the only forum on the climate crisis where the opinions and concerns of the low-income countries carry equal weight to that of the big economies, such as the U.S., China and India. Each of the 197 nations on earth, except a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty and no country has yet opted to withdraw from it. That includes the U.S., which is in the process of withdrawing from the Paris accord.This COP will be seen as a stepping stone to the official start date for the Paris Agreement. It is a vital step to help countries implement the Paris Agreement when it begins next year. The COP will also set the momentum for increased climate action. There is widespread understanding as well as profound demand that we need to do more to reduce emissions and build resilience. Still, nations have yet to formalize this understanding into their new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The deadl"

The objective: decarbonisation of international maritime shipping.The BMW Group has expanded its commitment towards making transport logistics more sustainable. Ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 25) in Madrid and as part of the Group's commitment to further reduce carbon emissions along the entire value chain, the company has joined the ""Getting to Zero Coalition"". The objective of this initiative is to use zero-emission cargo vessels from 2030. The Getting to Zero Coalition is a partnership between the Global Maritime Forum, the Friends of Ocean Action and the World Economic Form.""Maritime transport is crucial for supplying the BMW Group's international manufacturing network and for the global distribution of vehicles. We see the Getting to Zero Coalition of various governments, companies and other cross-sector stakeholders as a unique opportunity to continuously minimise carbon emissions in the maritime sector as well"", emphasises Jurgen Maidl, Senior Vice President Production Network and Supply Chain Management at the BMW Group. ""We are delighted to be the first carmaker to join this coalition and thus lead the way towards more sustainability.""Maritime transport currently accounts for 50 per cent of the BMW Group's transport chain CO2 emissions. Globally, around three per cent of the overall greenhouse gas emissions come from maritime transport - and the trend is strongly upwards. As part of the Getting to Zero Coalition, the BMW Group now wants to achieve a total elimination of carbon emissions by using carbon-free fuels and new propulsion systems as well as optimising energy efficiency.With its activities as part of the Getting to Zero Coalition, the BMW Group is continuing to push decarbonisation within the company in the area of logistics: in addition to the sustainability strategy along the entire value chain, the Group's holistic approach also includes resource-friendly production methods in BMW plants worldwide and further development of electric mobility.The BMW Group has succeeded, for example, in reducing the consumption of resources and emissions per vehicle produced by more than 50 per cent since 2006. In addition, all plants operated by the BMW Group and the three BBA joint venture plants in China will be supplied exclusively with energy from renewable sources from next year. The BMW Group plants in Europe are already being supplied with 100 per cent green electricity since 2017. By focusing on electric mobility from a very early stage, BMW has also become one of the global pioneers of this technology. The BMW i3 has been the global leader in its segment since 2013. With a portfolio currently including 12 models, BMW offers the widest range of electric vehicles in the market. By 2021, one million electrified vehicles of the BMW Group will be on the roads. Moreover, by 2023, the company will be offering 25 electrified models.BMW Group reconfirms its clear commitment to the UN Agenda 2030 The announcement that the BMW Group has joined the Getting to Zero Coalition in advance of COP 25, taking place from 2 to 13 December in Madrid, is no coincidence. The United Nations Climate Change Conferences and the BMW Group's activities are linked by a long history of close collaboration. The BMW Group has actively taken part in the COP climate change conferences on a regular basis since 2008. This year, the company will contribute new ideas and its technical expertise on sustainable development once again.The focus of the activities will be on the renewed involvement of the BMW Group as a headl"

And I appeal to the delegates of all Member States to convey a message of ambition to the world. He urged all to align their objectives with science to make sure that temperatures will not rise above 1.5C at the end of the century. Guterres maintained that a spirit of compromise is necessary for a successful conclusion of the regulations related to the implementation of the Paris Agreement of 2015, which was signed by 193 countries to limit the damage caused by a warming world. He also underscored the importance of showing a very strong commitment and a very strong ambition in climate action. The UN chief congratulated the European Union for its announcement on Friday, committing to carbon neutrality by 2050 and called for this example of climate action to be followed worldwide. Only coal-reliant Poland out of the 28-member bloc, decided it would not commit. According to his spokesperson, the Secretary-General continues to meet with various parties at the Conference as talks go into the night, with the possibility that proceedings may continue into Saturday. All eyes are on us At an on-site press conference, Andres Landerretche, COP25 Presidency Coordinator, spelled out: The eyes of the people are on us. Recalling that a consensus between 193 States was needed before the conference could be concluded, he acknowledged that negotiations have always been very difficult. While our priorities are always a call to ambition, mitigation efforts and adaptation he flagged that the underlying issue underpinning final negotiations, was the key element of finance. Some groups ask for more financing to move forward with climate action plans, including for technology transference and capacity building. Everyone has a role to play Landerretche stressed that while governments are responsible for frameworks, a cultural change must take place, with everyone asking themselves three fundamental questions: What am I doing to reduce my carbon footprint, resilience and vulnerabilities? Because, added, everybody has to be on board. The coordinator told journalists that his mood was one of general-moderate optimism and he was quite pleased with comments from the floor in terms of a final text, which he hoped would crystalize into a very good outcome. Our intention is to finish the programme, he concluded.

IFAD has shown that small-scale farmers can be effective agents of change - they can use climate finance to deliver multiple benefits in terms of food security, poverty reduction, ecosystem resilience and emission reductions.IFADs spokespeople will be participating in a wide range of events throughout UNFCCC COP25 in Madrid (2 to 13 December), encouraging investment in farmers. IFAD will be launching a new report focused on its work in Latin America and the Caribbean as well as the IFAD Climate Action Report 2019.Key Issues:Small-scale farmers are often located on marginal lands where environmental and climate impacts are most strongly felt, reducing crop yields and incomes.Small-scale farmers need to urgently adapt to environmental and climate impacts to ensure continued food production and sustainable incomes.IFADs Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP) is the largest global financing source of its kind, and channels more than US$300 million of climate finance to farmers in developing countries so they can access the information, tools and technologies that will help build their resilience to climate change.Small farms provide more than 70 per cent of the food calories to people living in south and east Asia, Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa.Where to find us: A member of the IFAD team will be on the UNs Reducing Inequalities Stand throughout COP25. They will be happy to arrange interviews/meetings with any of our team.\l"

"COP25","India","COP25_India119","Progress made at COP25, despite lack of agreement to increase climate ambition","December 16, 2019 Monday 6:30 AM EST","IBNS","New York/IBNS: Negotiations at the COP25 UN climate conference in Madrid finally ended on Sunday, wrapping up an event which saw much progress made by the private sector, and by national, regional and local governments. However, there was widespread disappointment that no overall consensus was reached on increased climate ambition.The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation finance to tackle the climate crisis. But we must not give up, and I will not give up. UN chief Antnio Guterres expressed his feelings on Twitter, but refused to see the conference as a defeat, and wrote that he is more determined than ever to work for 2020 to be the year in which all countries commit to do what science tells us is necessary to reach carbon neutrality in 2050 and a no more than 1.5 degree temperature rise. However, by Friday, when the conference had been expected to end, agreement on some important issues had been reached by negotiators, for example on capacity building, a gender programme, and technology, but an overall deal was held up over disagreement on the larger, and more contentious issues dealing with loss and damage caused by man-made climate change, as well as financing for adaptation. Weary negotiators worked through Friday night, at the request of the Chilean president of the COP, but a draft version of the outcome text released on Saturday morning was reported to have underwhelmed all parties to the negotiations, with representatives of NGOs and civil society describing it as unacceptable, and a betrayal of the commitments made under the 2015 Paris climate agreement. At 3pm local time on Saturday afternoon, a press conference was held by the COP organisers, explaining that the negotiators were still hard at work, aiming to show the outside world that we can deliver, that multilateralism works. By Saturday evening, there was still no sign of a deal, prompting acclaimed 16-year-old activist Greta Thunberg, one of the high-profile speakers at the Climate Action Summit held at UN Headquarters in September, to announce that it seems like COP25 in Madrid is falling apart right now. The science is clear, but the science is being ignored. Improved commitments announced at all levels Despite the disappointment voiced at the contents of the outcome document, several announcements made during the two-week conference to indicate progress. The European Union, for example, committed to carbon neutrality by 2050, and 73 nations announced that they will submit an enhanced climate action plan (or Nationally Determined Contribution). A groundswell of ambition for a cleaner economy was also evident a regional and local level, with 14 regions, 398 cities, 786 businesses and 16 investors are working towards achieving net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. Discussions held during COP25 broadened the understanding of the science behind the climate crisis, and the critical need for urgency: the UN Global Compact, which works with the private sector, announced that 177 companies have now agreed to set science-based climate targets that align with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and reaching net-zero emissions by no later than 2050. That is double the number of companies that signed up to the pledge at the Climate Action Summit, representing private sector emissions equivalent to the annual total CO2 emissions of France. Scottish bagpipes were heard in Madrid on Friday, marking next years climate conference, to be held in Glasgow, Scotland. COP26, due to be held in December 2020, is being touted as an important milestone in the fight against climate change, because countries will be expected to present upgraded national climate plans, that go beyond commitments made under the 2015 Paris Agreement.

"COP25","India","COP25_India121","Chile : Minister Schmidt takes stock of COP25 when arriving in Chile","December 23, 2019 Monday","TendersInfo","There is still no political will or maturity of some of the largest issuing countries. This is painful and sad because it affects us all, said the head of the Environment and president of COP25. In order to inform the public about the outcome of the COP25 held in Madrid, the Minister of the Environment and president of this instance, Carolina Schmidt, made a balance sheet on the progress and pending issues that remained at the most important climatic summit of the world and that must take action by consensus of the 197 parts that comprise it. We have just landed. We are tired, grateful for the progress made, but clearly we are not satisfied, Minister Schmidt said at a press conference this afternoon.Minister Schmidt said that when Chile assumed the Presidency of COP25, eight major challenges were imposed, of which 7 of them were achieved, after a long negotiation to win the unanimous support of all the members of the instance. First, a great global agreement was reached for climate ambition. This means that the 197 countries have committed to present more and better nationally determined commitments. Second, 121 of the 197 countries were already committed to Carbon Neutrality by 2050, as requested by science and Chile is doing.Third, and as Chile established from the outset, a global agreement was reached so that the oceans are protected in accordance with science for climate action, unpublished in a COP. Fourth, a consensus was reached to establish greater social equity globally in climate action. Despite the difficulties, the mechanism to address the losses and damages suffered by the most vulnerable countries in the face of climate change was agreed.Fifth, the Gender Equity Plan between men and women was established to boost climate action , fulfilling a very deep longing of the entire society. Sixth, the commitments of the private sector and non-state actors were strongly increased. This is how 400 cities and 800 global companies and more than 4 trillion dollars for investments were committed to reach the Carbon Neutrality 2050.Seventh, the Chilean Presidency managed to make climate action transversal, involving for the first time in history the authorities of the main productive sectors . Ministers of the world of Energy, Agriculture, Transportation and Finance will seek, from this COP25, solutions and ways to issue less and capture more.However, Minister Schmidt acknowledged that we could not achieve one of the most relevant objectives we had: regulate the purchase and sale of carbon credits. With pain, we economize that countries do not achieve a global consensus on this point, which would have allowed us to bring resources to the most vulnerable countries to implement projects that would allow us to accelerate the decrease in emissions.The head of the Environment recalled in the last four COP attempts to reach an agreement in the carbon bond market, but it has not been possible. There is still no political will or maturity of some of the largest issuing countries. This is painful and sad because it affects us all, he said.He added that many told us not to put this goal as one to achieve in this COP because it was impossible to achieve. We do not regret doing it. Faced with the urgency of the climate crisis, one should never be afraid to set high goals. There is only fear of not daring to fight where you have to do it. This was the place. This was the time.He added: Of course we are not satisfied. The agreements reached are not up to the climatic urgency that we need and that the citizens demand . I want to tell you this was a difficult COP, from its origins. In December of last year, it was easy to let the COP pass when Brazil got off and evade a responsibility that belongs to everyone on the planet. But Chile and this Government, against all odds, we decided to take this responsibility with all the difficulties that entailed. We raise the COP in record time. And a month before, for the reasons we all know, we had to change it.He concluded by stating that never before has a COP aroused so much interest and enthusiasm. We cannot, nor will we wait for the next COP. We will continue working, without stopping, without rest, for a more powerful and just climate action in the world (...) we need science, civil society, young people, productive sectors, indigenous communities, financial sector and all parliamentarians. Everyone plays a fundamental role in this task. Therefore, we appeal to everyone's generosity. This is the time to unite and face together the greatest challenge of our times. We will continue fighting for this cause.\l"

He recognized the success of the meeting organized by Costa Rica and the need for us to work together for our common goals and for greater ambition that allows us to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement.Vice Minister Aguilar expressed the Government's satisfaction for having organized a PreCOP where ambition and inclusion were the two central axes. He also recalled the importance of human rights for Costa Rica. For that reason, PreCOP began with a workshop for the promotion of human rights in climate action and concluded with another event on human rights related to the promotion and ratification of the Escaz Agreement on Rio Principle 10.Similarly, for the first time in the history of a pre-COP, gender issues were an integral part of the high-level political dialogues that took place within the framework of negotiation issues, which also included the drive for greater ambition to face the climate crisis, article 6 on markets and non-markets, as well as the Warsaw International Mechanism on Losses and Damages.

Proactive measures are being taken within parts of Africa and Asia to combat these effects which have been exacerbated by climate change, the Efe news reported. The COP25 summit hosted its last day of conferences in Madrid on Friday. At a side event discussing water management and flood risk prevention, some solutions for urban environments were provided by JW EcoTechnology (Ding Tai Co). The Taiwan-based company has been developing semi-permeable pavements and roads over the last decade, implementing them in parts of Asia, Africa and the United States. These porous surfaces contain small openings where rainwater can filter down to the soil underneath. ""In some countries where there are heavy rainfalls... we can help them avoid flooding and overflows of gutter waters. And also during the dry season when there is little or no rain, the water that has been captured can be reused,"" explained Alex Chuang, Project Coordinator at Ding Tai Co. ""Against drought and flooding (the technology) it acts as a water reservoir. ""Secondly against global warming, it acts as an air conditioner, and also with air pollution and water pollution it acts as a filter."" ""It's also able to provide an environment for vegetation and plantation where otherwise it wasn't possible,"" he added. Rural areas, especially across Africa, can be prone to heavy flooding. Research project CLIMAFRI aims to find answers on how to minimise the often devasting effects of flooding along the cross-border Lower Mono River Basin in Benin and Togo. ""The majority of people live in flood plains, so they are fully exposed with their houses, with their livelihoods, with their agricultural fields, to flooding, so we need to really rethink how we can adapt and reduce exposure,"" said CLIMAFRI's Yvonne Walz, a senior scientist at the United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security. In the beginning stages of a three-year research project, RAIN focuses on curbing the effects of climate change in Ghana and educating local communities.

According to a poll by the Pew Research Center, climate change is seen as the biggest international threat facing many nations: 13 out of 26 countries surveyed listed global warming as their top security concern.The EBRD participates in this years conference demonstrating its leading role among multilateral development banks (MDBs) as a pioneer in the delivery of climate finance.The Bank is working successfully towards achieving its ambitious Green Economic Transition (GET) target - to raise the proportion of its green finance to 40 per cent of annual new business by 2020 (from about 25 per cent in 2015). The 2019 result is expected to be well above that 40 per cent target, making this the Banks greenest year ever.To date, the EBRD has signed 30 billion in green investments, financed over 1600 green projects and reduced over 100 million tonnes of carbon emissions each year.But addressing climate change is a challenge that can only by tackled jointly, especially by development banks and institutions: The EBRD this year has the task of coordinating the MDBs that have worked together for more than a decade to scale up global climate finance and bring in the private sector in efforts to keep worldwide temperature rises to below 2C and if possible 1.5C.At COP25In September, at an earlier climate summit in New York, the nine MDBs coordinated by the EBRD announced plans to increase the global climate action investments they support each year to US$ 175 billion by 2025. In 2018, MDB climate finance in developing countries and emerging economies already reached record annual levels, resulting in US$ 111 billion of combined MDB climate finance and co-finance.Announcing the increase in September, the MDBs pledged to focus on building and strengthening partnerships for greater impact. We are united in increasing our collective ambitions, as well as our clients, to ensure that the common goals of the Paris Agreement will be met.The EBRDs own GET investments range from renewable energy projects in Egypt to energy efficiency investments in Ukraines corporate sector, and have gone from strength to strength in 2019.Among highlights was Septembers successful launch of the first ever dedicated climate resilience bond, raising US$ 700 million with demand from 40 investors in 15 countries. The proceeds will be used to finance the Banks existing and new climate resilience projects. The EBRD currently has a portfolio of about 7 billion in climate resilience projects, from the Qairokkum hydropower upgrade in Tajikistan to the Saiss water conservation project in Morocco.October saw the completion of one of the largest solar parks in the world. Benban, in Egypts Aswan desert, covers 37 square km and will generate 1.5 GW, enough to provide renewable energy to more than 1,000,000 homes. The EBRD is its largest financier, having supported 16 of the 32 plots.EBRD Green Cities, a 1 billion urban sustainability programme set up in 2016 to improve infrastructure and policy in cities, which account for more than three-quarters of greenhouse gas emissions, now has more than 30 participants. In October, it won an 87 million contribution from the Green Climate Fund, the largest fund in the world to support the efforts of developing countries to respond to the challenge of climate change, which will support the facility in Albania, Armenia, Georgia, Jordan, North Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, Serbia and Tunisia.The EBRD has more than two decades of experience in financing green investments, with an initial focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy. As well as its own dedicated programmes to promote green investment, the Bank works closely with donors such as Climate Investment Funds, the European Union, the Global Environment Facility, the Green Climate Fund and other bilateral donors to mobilise climate finance for clients.\l"

And if current trends persist, then global temperatures can be expected to rise by 3.4 to 3.9C this century, which would bring wide-ranging and destructive climate impacts.Thats the stark warning from the international community ahead of the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference, known as , which gets underway in the Spanish capital, Madrid, on 2 December. So, just two months after the Secretary-General convened a major Climate Action Summit at UN Headquarters in New York, what can be expected from COP25? The Climate Action Summit in September was the initiative of the UN Secretary-General to focus the attention of the international community on the climate emergency and to accelerate actions to reverse climate change. The Climate Conference (held in Madrid after the meeting was moved from Chile due to unrest there), COP25, is the actual Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, which is tasked with making sure that the Convention, (and now the 2015 Paris Agreement, which strengthens the Convention), are being implemented. 2. But why all the UN attention on the climate? There is more evidence of the impacts of climate change, especially in extreme weather events, and these impacts are taking a greater toll. The science shows that emissions are still going up, not down. According to the 2019 WMO Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have reached another new record high. This continuing long-term trend means that future generations will be confronted with increasingly severe impacts of climate change, including rising temperatures, more extreme weather, water stress, sea level rise and disruption to marine and land ecosystems. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has warned, in its 2019 Emissions Gap Report, that greenhouse gas emissions reductions of 7.6 per cent per year from 2020 to 2030 are needed to meet the internationally agreed goal of a 1.5C increase in temperatures over pre-industrial levels. Scientists agree thats a tall order, and that the window of opportunity is growing smaller. 3. So what did the September Climate Action Summit achieve?

WMO which uses five leading international datasets showed that the global mean temperature last year was approximately 1 degree C over pre-industrial levels.This year is expected to be the second or third warmest year on record while 2016, which had strong El Nino conditions is warmest year on record.El Nino is a climate pattern characterised by sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean rising to above normal levels.Last year, greenhouse gas concentrations reached record highs with globally averaged concentrations of CO2, methane and nitrous oxide about 147%, 259% and 123% of pre-industrial 1750 levels. Concentrations for 2019 may be available when WMO releases its final statement but real-time data from a number of specific locations indicate that CO2 levels continued to rise in 2019, WMO said.""The observed data presented by WMO shows that we might be going over the 1.5 degC much earlier than expected. The 1.1 degree C temperature anomaly is for the current year, and not the climatic average over a long period. We had El Nino-like conditions in the early part of 2019, which may have partially contributed to a warmer than usual year,"" said MK Roxy, principal investigator and climate scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.In October 2019, the global mean sea level reached its highest value since the beginning of the high-precision altimetry record in January 1993.Greenhouse gas concentrations in the oceans have been increasing so has the sea-surface temperature and consequent marine heat waves.In 2019, the ocean experienced 1.5 months of unusually warm temperatures, 38% of the ocean area experienced what is classified as strong marine heat waves, 28% experienced moderate heat waves while large areas in the northeast Pacific recorded severe marine heat wave category. Increasing CO2 concentrations has led to more ocean acidification which has increased by 26% compared to start of the industrial era.WMO has reiterated that this year the September average extent of sea ice in the Arctic was the third lowest on record, the net ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet and the Antarctic is also reaching extreme proportions.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

"COP25","India","COP25_India133","Explained: Why Chile can't host COP25 climate conference","October 30, 2019 Wednesday","Indian Express","The annual climate change conference have been thrown to uncertainty this year with Chile announcing on Wednesday that it would not be able to host the meeting in view of the ongoing protests in the country.With just about a month to go for the start of the December 2-13 meeting in Santiago, COP25 (25th edition of the Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) is almost certain to be postponed. The UN Climate Change said it was exploring alternative options to host the event.If it is not held in December, this would be the first time that no COP could be held in a calendar year since these meetings started in 1995.The annual climate conference, held toward the year-end, takes decisions related to global response to climate change. COP21 in Paris in 2015 delivered the Paris Agreement, a new international arrangement to fight climate change. In the subsequent years since then, the countries have been negotiating to finalise the rules that will govern the implementation of the Paris Agreement that will become effective once the 1997 Kyoto Protocol comes to an end next year.The location of this conference is rotated every year in different regions of the world. This year it was the turn of South America to host the event.Chile has been witnessing largescale demonstrations that started with protests against suburban train fare hike two weeks ago. It quickly developed into a mass movement demanding greater equality and better public services, and a change in dictatorship-era Constitution.But it was also a reluctant host right from the start. It agreed to host it after much persuasion from UN Climate Change, since no one else in the region wanted to do it either. The host is usually decided almost two years in advance, to give the city time to organise an event that witnesses participation of over 20,000 delegates. Several side events, including protest walks and demonstrations, also take place alongside the conference, so the city has make preparations for those as well.In the case of COP25, however, the host not decided till almost the end of COP24 meeting in Katowice, Poland last year. It was a toss-up between Chile and Costa Rica. Chile, being the host of year-long meetings of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) this year, tried to wriggle out saying it had host the APEC leaders' summit in November and therefore it could not prepare itself for another large event in December. Costa Rica was not too keen either. The host city incurs huge expenditure on the event, and not all of it is reimbursed.In 2017, Fiji was the host but the conference was held in Bonn, the headquarters of UN Climate Change, under Fijian presidency. Fiji said it did not have the resources to organise an event of this scale. It was one of the reasons why the UN Climate Change was not very keen on Costa Rica's candidature, because it could have meant a repeat of the 2017 conference. Interestingly, even UN Climate Change does not want to host it in Bonn every year.Richer countries have generally shied away from hosting this event. The United States has never hosted the conference and neither has Australia or many other countries in western Europe. UK will host it for the first time next year, in Glasgow. Poland, on the other hand, has hosted it four times, and Morocco twice.\l"

If it doesn't make into the final agreement in the form of rules for Article 6, it would be unfair for the countries who earned credits in the pre-2020 phase.The CDM allows emission-reduction projects in developing countries to earn certified emission reduction (CER) credits (each equivalent to one tonne of CO2). These CERs can be traded and sold, and used by industrialised countries to meet a part of their emission reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol. It is expected that the carbon trade mechanism may stimulate sustainable development and emission reductions, while giving industrialised countries some flexibility in how they meet their emission reduction limitation targets.Viewpoints of votaries of such 'transition' was articulated by India's lead negotiator, Ravi Shankar Prasad, who told the plenary on Friday that the Parties (countries) to the UNFCCC could still ""not find balance"" between various aspects of the carbon trade under Article 6.""On Article 6, we would like to highlight that we still don't find a balance between Article 6.2 (on country to country trade of emissions) and 6.4 (on project to project or project to country trade of emissions) development. And whereas the text on 6.4 is heavily bracketed, we don't find a similar situation in 6.2. We also feel that large parts of concerns highlighted by some of the Parties (countries) have been ignored,"" said Prasad.He also said, ""We are having a look at the text regarding transition of CDM credits. We expect this transition to happen seamlessly and to ensure that the business and private sector have faith in this process. We expect that any unilateral measure on such kind of transaction is not imposed. By experience we have seen some kind of discriminatory practices on markets have been imposed.""His remarks clearly show that the negotiators still have many differences to be ironed out. Some of the differences include the crucial issue of long-term finance and technology transfer to support developing countries in their mitigation and adaptation measures.\l"

Midway through the first of two weeks of negotiations, progress remains limited. New negotiating text emerged\~on December 4 on Article 6 (the 'markets article' in the Paris Agreement). A number of highly technical issues still remain to be resolved.The Paris rulebook needs to (indirectly) regulate bilateral/mini-multilateral marketsMarkets under the Paris Agreement come in two types. Article 6.2 sets up rules for credits traded on bilateral or mini-multilateral markets (such as the\~European Union Emission Trading System) if such credits are being counted towards a country's nationally determined contribution (NDC).Negotiations on Article 6.2 are divided over whether bilateral / mini-multilateral markets need a common set of accounting rules, or whether countries using credits from such markets can pick from a 'menu' of accounting standards.The important thing to note here is that the Paris Agreement cannot prevent countries from forming their own bilateral or mini-multilateral markets. The trigger that draws the Agreement's attention is if a country wants to count a credit traded (on whatever type of market) towards its NDCs.Even if it does not directly regulate the market, the Paris markets rulebook should do everything possible to protect the sanctity of NDCs, which are the heart of the Agreement. So, any credit being counted toward an NDC should follow a common, rigorous accounting standard.Allowing countries to choose their own accounting systems will make keeping track of ambition extremely difficult. This will undermine the new round of NDCs, which are due in 2020 (see CSE's primer on NDCs here).Overall Mitigation of Global Emissions may be easier done than saidArticle 6.4 sets up the Sustainable Development Mechanism (SDM), a centralised, global market designed as the successor to the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) in the Kyoto Protocol. It is clear that the SDM will bind countries to a single set of rules, but the governing structure of that mechanism still needs to be fleshed out.Besides, the SDM under Article 6.4 is required to deliver an ""overall mitigation of global emissions"" (OMGE). This is a response to a key flaw of the CDM under the Kyoto Protocol\~- that it might have increased rather than decreased the globe's emissions. However, OMGE itself has not been defined. There is continuing disagreement over whether a definition is needed.More encouragingly, despite the definition confusion, the recently released texts contain reasonably strong language on a mechanism targeted at achieving OMGE, known as\~ 'voluntary cancellation'.\~Carrying over credits from Kyoto to Paris remains a sticking pointRelated Stories  Climate Emergency CoP 25: The Adaptation Fund is perfectly fit to serve the Paris AgreementThis 'hot air' problem was the most significant sticking point at Katowice last year.

The finance was raised, in part, by levying a 2 per cent ""share of proceeds"" on the value of credits traded on the international carbon market under the Protocol\~- known as the 'Clean Development Mechanism'. It also relies on contributions from developed countries.Since 2010, the Adaptation Fund has directed $532 million to 80 concrete adaptation projects in the most vulnerable communities of developing countries, serving 5.8 million direct beneficiaries. In 2018, the Fund raised $129 million in new pledges, a record-setting year. This is owing to its consistent success in financing projects which build national capacities and foster developing country ownership of climate change adaptation.It has done so, in part, because close to 70 per cent of its Board is represented by members from developing countries. This fact has become the core of a disagreement over the future of the Fund, which is being discussed at the Conference of Parties 25 (CoP25) in Madrid.Several developed countries want to change the governance structure of the Adaptation Fund to ensure more developed country participation. One\~proposal\~is to expand the size of the Board to 18, and allocate separate seats to Eastern and Western European nations. Developing countries are adamant that developing world presence on the Board should not be diluted. Some developed countries expressed support for maintaining a developing country majority on the Board, but consensus looks far off.Nor are there plenty of avenues for adaptation finance. Despite the Paris Decision calling for a balance in finance between mitigation and adaptation, only one-fifth of finance provided by the OECD went to adaptation in 2017. At the Green Climate Fund, the largest dedicated climate fund (with around $9.8 billion in pledges), board battles between developed and developing country representatives have become common.Developed countries consistently raise questions regarding the 'quality' of proposals, and regularly oppose proposals for adaptation projects on dubious grounds. These disagreements derailed the fund-raising process last year, which has only partially recovered this year.The Adaptation Fund, therefore, despite its limited size, is one of the few consistent avenues for finance sourced from developed countries, over which developing countries have significant control. If markets under the Paris Agreement take off, the amount of money from ""share of proceeds"" available to the Fund could become significantly larger, as we discuss\~here.The challenge is to keep raising money from developed countries, while retaining control in the representatives of those who are most vulnerable to the climate crisis.

Shortly after the commencement of talks on December 2, a comprehensive ""carbon budget"" report was published revealing how far the world currently is from meeting the objectives of the Paris Climate Agreement.\~As such, high on the agenda for this year's session of talks is the negotiation and development of a transparent and robust regulatory framework for carbon markets. Several experts have stated that the implementation of carbon markets may hold the key to achieve loftier national reduction targets (also known as nationally determined contributions or NDCs), towards the overarching goal of limiting global warming to under 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2100.\~Simply put, emissions trading via carbon markets involve firms (or nation-states)\~buying or selling carbon credits based on their emissions targets. For instance, assume a single carbon credit is the equivalent of 1 tonne of carbon dioxide. If a firm has an annual emissions target of 100 tonnes of carbon dioxide, but it manages to overachieve and cap emissions at 90 tonnes, it can now claim 10 carbon credits. It can now enter the carbon market and sell these carbon credits to firms who may have failed to restrict their individual national emissions as per their target.\~With the number of total carbon credits in the market remaining fixed at the outset, the market itself will automatically determine a going rate for a single carbon credit. Over time, the number of carbon credits decreases placing increasing pressure on firms\~to invest in cleaner and innovative production options to reduce their total emissions in more cost-effective ways.\~ Criticisms of carbon marketsIn theory, the system seems straightforward but as witnessed with the carbon market frameworks established in the Kyoto Protocol, such markets can have disastrous effects when poorly implemented. One of the primary reasons that carbon trading has come under heavy criticism is that it focusses too much on easing the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner sources of energy, so much so that many large firms who can afford to purchase credits can continue with business as usual. What's more is that emissions budgets are typically set very generously at the outset in the fear that tougher targets will drive the carbon price up too quickly, leading to a huge escalation in operational costs for businesses, and higher prices for consumers.\~The cost and resources (human and capital)\~involved in setting up, monitoring and regulating carbon markets can also be significant. Large bureaucracies would need to be created to certify, validate and enforce emissions cuts across the world. Regulators may also find themselves bowing to short-term market pressure rather than ensuring that long-term goals are achieved.\~Some opponents of carbon markets have even claimed such markets to be anti-democratic. Any system of trade automatically incentivises both, buyers and sellers to conceal as much information as possible. Buyers are looking to purchase cheaper rights to pollute, while sellers are seeking the highest prices.Yet for the market itself to achieve its objective of tackling the climate crisis, all traders must have the same information. As witnessed before with cases like the subprime mortgage market that spurred the 2008 financial crisis, and the Enron scandal, speculation, misinformation, conflicts of interest, asymmetric information and insider trading can cause these markets to become extremely volatile and even collapse.\l"

It is time to look in the mirror. Has developed world delivered on its promises? Unfortunately, annexed countries (developed nations) have not met their Kyoto Protocol targets,"" said India's environment minister Prakash Javadekar while making 'country statement' at high-level segment of the UN climate conference (COP25) here.The Kyoto Protocol is earlier version of the global climate deal which sought only the rich countries (annexed as developed nations in the deal) to take climate actions for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) in Pre-2020 period whereas under the new deal - Paris Agreement - all countries are expected to take climate actions - known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) - as per their pledges made in 2015.Seeking to remind the developed countries of their low targets amid a proposal of giving them extra years to deliver on the Kyoto Protocol commitments, Javadekar said, ""Neither their NDCs reflect ambitions nor they have shown willingness to enhance their commitments. I propose that we have three more years to fulfill Pre- 2020 commitments till the global stocktake takes places (in 2023) for bridging emission gaps"".""Let us concentrate on implementation of Paris Agreement and not digress,"" said Javadekar amid a growing demand of raising ambition for bigger climate action as the collective current target is not enough to avert the climate crisis. India had already made it clear that the country would, at present, concentrate on whatever it promised in 2015 under the Paris Agreement and would consider its new target only in 2023 when the global stocktake of climate actions under the new deal will happen. Drawing attention of ministers and senior delegates to two key issues of financial assistance and transfer of technology from developed nations to developing countries for supporting them to take up mitigation (emission cut) and adaptation measures, Javadekar said, ""Developed world promised one trillion dollar in last 10 years, and not even 2% has materialized. It has to be public finance and there should be no double accounting. The world that benefited from carbon emissions that made them developed, must repay.""Technology development and transfer at affordable costs is crucial for developing countries. If we are dealing with a disaster, nobody should profit from it. So, my proposal is to have more joint research and collaboration, grant finance made available for meeting the targets"".The minister while delivering his speech also spoke about all the projects, including renewables, clean fuel, afforestation and land restoration, which India is undertaking to meet its Paris deal goal by 2030. He said, ""Only six countries are on track to meet their NDCs announced in Paris. We are leading the pack. Sustainable lifestyle is a part of the ethos of India"". ""This is the time for ownership and this is the time for responsible action. India has and will continue to do its bit - expecting commensurate multilateral action with developed countries taking the lead,"" said the minister.The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in its latest 'Emission Gap Report' last month noted that only six G20 members - China, India, Mexico, Russia, Turkey and EU28 - are projected to meet their unconditional NDC targets with current policies while others require to make progress on multiple fronts.The minister in his speech also spoke about political unanimity in India on his government's decision to impose carbon tax on coal production. He said, ""We have put carbon tax on coal production at the rate of six dollars per tonne. Even with 36 parties represented in parliament, we could achieve this unanimously"".Referring to carbon market which is one of the key focus areas at COP25 in terms of making rules for it under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, Javadekar said, ""We expect that guidel"

The event was now taking place in the Spanish capital after the Chilean government said it could not host it owing to political unrest in the country, reports Efe news. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, acting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, the new European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, and Chilean Environment Minister and chair of the summit, Carolina Schmidt, among others, were scheduled to attend the opening ceremony of the 25th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The summit will include technical and scientific meetings, plenary sessions involving official delegations from nearly 200 countries, attendance by more than 50 global heads of state and government, and leaders of international agencies, as well as a large number of activists and social leaders. The event will also be attended by 20 European Prime Ministers, the Presidents of Argentina, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras and the Dominican Republic; Morocco's Prime Minister Saadeddine Othmani; and Prince Albert of Monaco. The heads of the European Commission, European Council and the European Parliament, as well as leaders from many African and Asian countries were also expected to attend the opening of the summit. US President Donald Trump would not attend the event, but a delegation defending the government's stance as it prepares to leave the Paris Agreement, will represent the country. The summit will also host prominent social leaders, including former US Vice President and 2007 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Al Gore, and Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg. Initially envisaged as a ""transitional"" summit, the conference has become particularly important for Spain hosting it in place of Chile, which retains the presidency, as well as for the international community as it coincides with Trump's announcement to start the process of pulling out of the Paris Agreement. Chile and Spain hope that this conference will open a new phase in global climate action, which would not only involve the negotiators of the delegations representing central governments, but also local governments, regions and economic and social agents. The summit, which will continue until December 13, will conclude just two weeks before the Paris Agreement comes into force and the beginning of a decisive year with countries required to make more ambitious commitments to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions. --IANS ksk/ \l"

He spoke on a panel discussion: ""Towards an energy system based on 100% renewables.""Pineda was clear: ""The number one objective is to fully decarbonise the power sector - and our work is far from over. The renewables target we have for 2030 is a milestone, but this milestone may not enable us to reach the terms of the Paris Agreement. Secondly, we need to integrate transport and heating into the clean electricity system."" Thirdly, he said that while Europe is tackling the easy-to-abate emissions, such as those in electricity, it must also reduce carbon emissions from the harder-to-abate sectors. ""Use renewable electricity when and where available. Renewable gases where needed. Essentially, the lion's share will have to come from the renewables-based electrification of the power mix.""Recent discussions have focused on the size and scale of the transformation: should the energy transition happen at local levels before extending to national levels, or do we need a more top-down approach? Pineda said ""There's really no contradiction in any these approaches. But the scale of the challenge would need changes in policy. The right policies should give long-term visibility on volumes, revenues and be enshrined in practical, easy-to-implement legislation. This will attract a lot of investment. This is why the National Energy and Climate Plans are so important. They need to be very detailed. These need to be written as investment brochures.""Pineda also said: ""What we need is a clear and ambitious industrial strategy, with 4 components: 1) market scale & visibility linked to NECPs; 2) sustained investment in R&I 3) RSM and policies that keep financing costs low; and 4) trade policies that leverage global supply chains"".Such a strategy would create a job-rich energy transition.

To achieve this objective, the mitigation table established a coordinated work for one year to evaluate the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) prepared by the Ministry of Energy, Environment and Finance, and establishes recommendations for updating. For example, it suggests establishing mechanisms for monitoring existing solutions and incorporating nature-based solutions into strategies.Adaptation Table (Coordinated by Sebastin Vicua and Paulina Aldunce): The adaptation addresses the consequences, impacts and risks of climate change. The recommendations of the table aim to reduce the main gaps detected in the area: i) gaps regarding the capacities to identify adaptation needs, in order to implement the required measures in a participatory and legitimate manner; ii) gaps associated with public policy instruments designed to promote and implement adaptation; iii) gaps in the promotion of facilitators and the reduction of obstacles in the implementation of adaptation; and iv) gaps in the identification of transformational measures and other emerging issues that have not yet been fully incorporated into the adaptation processes in Chile.Water table (Coordinated by Alejandra Stehr): The water table provides recommendations in 4 aspects: i) water governance in Chile, ii) water scarcity, iii) water quality, and iv) adaptation of water resources to climate change .Biodiversity table (Coordinated by Pablo Marquet): The biodiversity table focused on reviewing evidence of the conservation, management and restoration of ecosystems and the protection of biodiversity, the change in land use is the main driver associated with the current decl"

The key findings show that the impacts of climate change on African fisheries will be serious, even under the most optimistic scenarios, and countries will be affected differently.The study found that the ecological risk is very high for a large proportion of Africas coastal countries, including in the Gulf of Guinea, from Gabon to Guinea-Bissau, and along Africas east coast from Eritrea to Mozambique. The models forecasting the impacts of climate change on marine fisheries show that the maximum catch potential (MCP) will decrease by 30 percent or more as early as 2050 in many tropical West African countries.For all African coastal countries, climate change impacts will require decision-makers to rethink their approach to fisheries management. Even under best-case scenarios, the models clearly show that the impact of climate change on fisheries will be serious, although not evenly felt. Stressed fisheries resources, for example, overfished stocks, are at additional risk from this additional impact. Each country has different pathways to adapt to the impacts of climate change on its marine fisheries. An important distinction needs to be made between ecological risks, which, to a large extent, are beyond the control of African coastal states, and socio-ecological risks, which can be mitigated through a variety of management measures.The economies of the Horn of Africa, parts of West Africa, and Nigeria are particularly at risk from climate change because of the importance of their fisheries. The impacts of climate change on fisheries and fishing communities are not a foregone conclusion; the extent of socio-ecological risk depends on a number of important variables, including the effectiveness of fisheries management measures. A second volume of the study will be published in 2020 and go more into details on what can be done to make African fisheries more resilient to climate change.The report presentation at COP25 is part of the World Bank event: Fighting Poverty in the Face of Climate Change What Role for the Oceans?

In this way, a hundred activities have taken place these days, which have highlighted the transversal nature of climate ambition and the fundamental role that all agents play in the path towards a true structural change of our societies and economies.Debates beyond the summitWith the objective of acting as a speaker of the aims pursued by the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, institutions such as the Congress of Deputies or the Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology ( FECYT ), have participated in the Castellana Verde initiative, promoting debates that have served to spread these objectives.In this sense, the Congress of Deputies hosted this week an organized day together with the Interparliamentary Union, in which 200 parliamentarians and parliamentarians from around the world listened to some of the leading experts in the fight against climate change, such as Jeffrey Sachs , who made a call for parliaments around the world to promote the necessary legislation to implement some of the objectives of the Summit. Likewise, FECYT has promoted in these weeks gatherings between scientists and journalists about the need to raise public awareness of the urgency of acting against climate change.Artistic expressionsArt has been another of the main instruments to call the action for the climate in the activities of Castellana Verde. In this area, initiatives such as the exhibition installed at the Atocha station of the renowned photographer Sebastio Salgado stand out, with images of the Brazilian Amazon, which reflect the life of the indigenous communities that live in the main lung of the planet. Salgado also starred in a keynote lecture at the Reina Sofa Museum.Also, in the Plaza Coln, the sculpture of a polar bear melting between icebergs that are part of its body, has aimed to raise awareness about the need to act on the impact of humanity on the planet. This work by Veronica and Edwin Nogales has been moved from Chile to Madrid on the occasion of COP25 by the Geo Art Regeneration of Wildlife Foundation.In addition, at the height of the Paseo de la Castellana 13, the sculpture ""Talla de la Reina"", by the Burgos artisan Humberto Abad, has been located. It is a sculpture that represents the two hands of Queen Juana I, clinging to some bars, and that emulates the prison of Tordesillas. The sculpture, carved in 2006, is made on the trunk of a pine tree from Soria-Burgos, dried as a result of climate change at the summits of the Urbin, at the source of the Duero River. This trunk is about 200 years old, was saved from being crushed to make biomass and has served to reflect on the different contributions of forests and their value chain to the fight against climate change.\l"

""The task of building a strong link between human rights and the ecosystem, and integrating its protection into the international system for the defense and safeguarding of those human rights,"" remains outstanding.The minister has stressed that, today, there are no mechanisms to demand responsibility for the breach of international commitments on climate change and its effects. Thus, both the International Criminal Court and the European Court of Human Rights or the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ""are born of international conventions that do not include any provision concerning the right to the environment or its protection"", so that environmental processes are limited to the jurisdictional organs of each country. ""If we have accepted that the sanction for the most serious violations of human rights cannot be at the expense of the will or effectiveness of a country's judicial system, the most serious attacks against the ecosystem have ceased to be a national matter to become in a matter of global governance, ""said Delgado.Together with the minister, the Minister of the Environment and Urban Planning Department Antonio Vercher participated in the event.

"COP25","India","COP25_India171","COP25: International Community Cannot Afford To Overlook Its Carbon Neutrality Goal","December 10, 2019 Tuesday","Youth Ki Awaaz","India, Dec. 10 -- What does it take to reverse the ill effects of climate change? A conference. A meeting. Tonnes of money. Well, the answer is both yes and no. We need to sit together and discuss the effects of climate change. We certainly need to juggle with mind-numbing data on planetary changes which are underway. We must engage with challenges to reduce heating of the planet, which is as of now spiking out of control. But we must do so with clear intent and must not we dither.The ongoing COP25The Quicksand Of Climate ChangeThere is no denying the fact that we are terribly running out of time. The planet's temperature is rising. The year 2019, in fact, brings a close to the hottest decade in earth as per records. Scientists were appalled to notice that at the North Pole in February 2019, it was 35 degrees Fahrenheit, when usually it is at least 50 degrees less warm in a usual season. In the year 2012, Arctic sea ice cover dipped to its lowest levels ever recorded. In August 2019, the Prime Minister of Iceland attended the funeral of Okjikull glacier lost to global warming.Globally, arid conditions at places have arisen, and it has led to the generation of firestorms and sea is in turbulence as more typhoons and cyclones threaten human and animal habitations like never before. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change alarmingly announced in 2016 that ""Global warming is likely to reach 1.5 degreeC between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate.""The world is warmer than it was at the start of the Industrial Revolution, and as per the UN estimates, if this trend continues, the global temperature could further be expected to rise to 3.2 to 3.9 degrees by the end of the century. This may have devastating effects on the environment as a whole. According to 2019 WMO Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have reached another new record high. This brings us to the commitments and action plans.India And Climate ChangeClimate emission targets of India are ambitious, but is the government doing enough? It is noteworthy that India's greenhouse gas emissions have doubled in the past 25 years. As per the experts, India has employed a great amount on renewable energy generation but needs to do more on planned sector expansion. There is a growing concern on over-dependence on fossil fuels. To meet energy requirements, coal and oil lead the chart for India. Oil imports are rising, and this needs to be checked.While India has announced that it is walking the talk, the government certainly needs to do more by giving a generous boost to alternative modes of energy generation. The dependence on fossil fuels must be reduced. Countries like Pakistan and Guatemala have vowed to plant more than 11 billion trees in September 2019 Climate Action summit at New York, which preceded the COP25 consultations. There is a mounting pressure on big polluters like India, Saudi Arabia, United States and China to deliver on their commitments in carbon emissions.The United States, at the direction of Donald Trump, is already under the process of withdrawing from the Paris Accord, which set a goal of limiting global temperature rises to well within two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial levels. Instead, the US has just sent a diplomatic team and a delegation led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to shore up support for its stated concern on climate change. This is a setback for the international community.On the other hand, Chinese representative in a rare press conference dodged questions over whether it would change its climate action plan next year. The UN Secretary-General noticeably remarked at the beginning of COP25 deliberations that ""Without the full engagement of the big emitters all our efforts will be completely undermined"". Further, he appealed that we should ensure that at least $100 billion US dollars a year are available to the developing countries for mitigation of climate change effects and to help them build resilient systems for disaster response and recovery.Writing On The WallThe writing on the wall is very clear: nations big and small cannot look away from their commitments, as everyone enjoys planet earth and its resources. Article 6 of the Paris Agreement has remained a bone of contention. Paris Agreement (an agreement under United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or UNFCCC) basically provided a framework where nations had to come up with NDC's (Nationally Determined Contributions) on the commitment to reduce carbon emissions.The parties are under a legal obligation to NDCs and take measures to implement them. Binding nature of NDCs has to be achieved through a global transparency mechanism. Additionally, a global stocktake is taken every five years to determine whether the international community is on the path to achieving the target of ensuring 1.5 degrees C of containing global heating. African nations have complained that Article 6 doesn't include rules to protect the native forest.This leaves out underdeveloped nations out of the dialogue process altogether. Lack of accountability at the stage of determining whether a country has actually achieved NDCs or not is, in reality, leading us towards uncertain times. The writing on the wall is, Save the planet right now! It is time that nations built upon a consensus on their specific roles and responsibilities. Big polluters must run the gauntlet and come out strongly to reverse the climate change process.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Youth ki Awaaz.

The UN chief was in the city to draw attention to the need to efforts to tackle climate change to close the growing gap between the actions that need to be taken and the efforts on the ground. In doing so, Guterres hoped to set the tone for the negotiations and persuade countries to step up their climate ambition ahead of the operationalisation of the Paris Agreement.Addressing the media, Guterres reminded that the impact of rising temperatures was already being felt around the world, and is having dramatic consequences for humans beings and biodiversity. He said that the world has the scientific and technical knowledge and means to slowdown global warming but what it was lacking was political will. He said, ""Political will to put a price on carbon. Political will to stop subsidies on fossil fuels. Political will to stop building coal power plants from 2020 onwards. Political will to shift taxation from income to carbon. Taxing pollution instead of people.""""The point of no return is no longer over the horizon,"" Guterres stressed, ""it is in sight and hurtling toward us."" Even as he cited growing scientific evidence of the impact of human induced greenhouse gas emissions on the planet from record high summer temperatures to melting Arctic and Antarctic ice caps, Guterres insisted that his was a ""message of hope and not despair"". ""Our war against nature must stop and we know that that is possible.""The world, UN chief said, needs to stop ""digging and drilling"" and take advantage of renewable energy and nature-based solutions. The UN chief took the opportunity to highlight the inadequate pace of action by the world's major economies and biggest emitters. ""We also see clearly that the world's largest emitters are not pulling their weight. And without them, our goal is unreachable,"" he said.Recognising the critical role of finance, particularly the provision of predictable and adequate funding to developing countries, Guterres announced that the outgoing Bank of England governor Mark Carney will become his new special envoy on ""climate action and climate finance"" from next year.(The reporter travelled to Madrid for COP25 at the invitation of the Global Editors Network, a non-profit non-governmental association committed to sustainable journalism) For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com\l"

However, many cash-strapped African countries are not benefiting from new technologies to develop early warning systems.Harding was speaking on Tuesday at the COP25 climate conference in Madrid during a panel discussion on building the resilience of small island developing states (SIDS) against extreme climate eventsThere are many reports that say in Africathe coverage of climate and weather observing stations is eight times lower than recommended by WMO for optimal weather observation systemsLess than 50 percent of them provide the type of information required, said Harding, who heads the secretariat of the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS).The session was hosted by the African Development Bank, a significant investor in efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change.Andre Kamga, director general of the ACMAD Center in Niger, said the Bank-funded severe weather observation project, SAWIDRA, had enabled the use of data to generate forecasts and early warning systems in Africa.What matters on the ground is the warning, which emergency services must use during disaster events to save lives, Kamga said.Linus Mofor, senior environmental affairs officer at the UN Economic Commission for Africa, said governments should invest in their climate response as they do in other economic sectors.Having said that, in the absence of the investment in early warning systems,, should we just fold our arms?The session was moderated by Antonio Palazuelos, from SYAH Cabo Verde, whose small island nation has been battered by extreme weather. The African Development Banks 2019 African Economic Outlook cites climate shocks as one of the headwinds facing Cabo Verde in the Atlantic; likewise the Indian Ocean islands of the Comoros, Madagascar and the Seychelles.Small islands have been for a long time not very much in the focus, so we are very glad to be here to say we need support from partners. We need to get more into robust early warning systems, Palazuelos said.The bank supports investments to modernize hydro-meteorological systems in Africa and manages partner efforts to address the weak observational capacity and lack of severe weather early warning systems for small island developing states in Africa, he said.Anthony Nyong, Director for Climate Change and Green Growth at the African Development Bank, followed up the session with another panel discussion on Wednesday on SIDS leadership on the ocean, climate and sustainable development goals.He said the Bank had made investments to support island states, such as deep sea mining, and had identified the blue economy as a key part of its Feed Africa strategy to strengthen fisheries and other marine resources, creating wealth to empower the African continent, not go to other countries.Nyong said the Bank had released about $17 million to invest in data systems to arm states with the information to better prepare for climate related disasters.The Island States are our shareholders and our clients. We pay very close attention to them. If they disappear with the rising sea levels, then it means we really need to assist them build resilience, Nyong said.He said island states offered opportunities for private sector investment, despite their challenges.

It produced a bland, platitudinous statement re-emphasising with ""serious concern the urgent need to address the significant gap between the aggregate effect of Parties' mitigation efforts in terms of global annual emissions of greenhouse gases by 2020."" It simultaneously added that it ""stresses the urgency of enhanced ambition in order to ensure the highest possible mitigation and adaptation efforts by all Parties.""COP 25's failures were primarily in two areas. One was its inability to frame rules governing the operations of carbon trading, which owes its origin to the Kyoto Protocol of 1997. Deferred to this year by the last year's conference, COP 24, it has been shelved for the next climate conference, COP 26, to be held in Glasgow in December next year. The second was its failure to make any progress towards achieving meaningful emission cuts.One must first look at the carbon trading since deliberations over it were supposed to be a principal feature of the conference even before the latter began. It owes its origin to the Kyoto Protocol, which came into force in 2005. Dividing countries into developed and developing ones, and recognising that the former were responsible for the current level of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through more than 150 years of industrial activity, it mandated that the 37 industrialised nations plus the European Union cut their emission levels to targets for GHG emissions for the first compliance period from 2008 to 2012. Developing countries, numbering 100, and including India and China, were asked to contribute by investing in projects designed to lower emissions in their countries.Developed, industrialised countries undertook to reduce their annual hydrocarbon emissions by an average of 5.2 per cent, representing 29 per cent of the world's GHG emissions, by 2012. All countries were required to draw up national emission reduction targets, called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which they had to submit regularly to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The protocol laid down that instead of reducing its own emissions, a polluting company or country could buy carbon credits from another that had reduced its carbon footprint. Industrialised countries could do so through the Emission Reduction Purchase Agreement, while a Clean Development Mechanism gave developing countries carbon credits in the form of Certified Emission Reduction Units, which were bought and sold in a separate market. Equally, instead of reducing emissions domestically, an industrialisedcountry or a company could offset its high levels of GHG emissions by investing in green ventures through what the Protocol identified as Joint Implementation (JI) projects and, thereby, earn Emission Reduction Units from the latter.The question arises: What is a carbon credit? It is a permit or a certificate, issued by a Government or a regulatory body, allowing a country or an organisation to burn a certain specified amount of hydrocarbon fuel over a specified period. Each carbon credit is valued against one tonne of hydrocarbon fuel.As the commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol ended in December 2012, parties to it met in Doha, Qatar, and amended it, fixing new emission reduction targets for the period 2013 to 2020. The Doha Amendment, as it was called, was, however, never ratified and was superseded by the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Article 6 of the Paris Climate Agreement provides for international cooperation and carbon trading.Unfortunately, the issue of carbon trading has been clouded by allegations of corruption and the fundamental claim that it does not really help in reducing emission levels. Particularly under focus have been Joint Implementation Projects. The rules provide that an industrialised country must invest in a project, which would not otherwise have come about and not in ones that were to happen anyway. The allegation is that the latter has been the case in an alarming number of instances.As early as August 24, 2015, a report in The Guardian by Arthur Neslen referred to the findings of the Stockholm Environment Institute that the Joint Implementation scheme was so open to abuse that three quarters of the allowances under it lacked environmental integrity. As a result, around 600m tonnes of carbon were wrongly emitted under the UNFCCC-administered Joint Implementation (JI) scheme. The institute's paper, which was corroborated by United Nations officials, and parts of which were published in Nature Climate Change, states that an estimated 80 per cent of JI projects were of low environmental quality. The Guardian dispatch quotes one of the authors of the report, Vladyslav Zhezherin, as saying, ""Many of them didn't observe the requirements of JI on £dditionality' as they would probably have happened anyway, and I would even doubt the physical existence of some of these projects."" He was further quoted to have added, ""I would say that many of them were fake.""According to The Guardian report, Russia and Ukraine were the two biggest beneficiaries of the JI system. Not surprisingly, JI markets in the two countries have received particular attention. The Guardian report quotes a source with regulatory experience in Ukraine's JI market as saying that as the 2000s dragged on, JIs increasingly came to be seen by market participants as ""a corruption mechanism.""Clearly, the rules and regulations for carbon trading need to be reformed substantially to rule out corruption and ensure transparency in transactions. Matters have been further complicated by the issue of whether carbon credits earned before the Paris Climate Conference can be used in the period after it came into force. Not surprisingly, the rules continue to be subjects of discussion and, judging by the progress thus far and the interests involved, are unlikely to be finalised in COP 26. Even if these are, the wider question of whether the carbon trading system actually helps in reducing emission levels remains, with the critics pointing out that it primarily helps the developing countries to maintain their high emission levels without making any significant contribution to reducing - or even containing - emission levels in the developing countries.This once again underl"

"COP25","India","COP25_India182","COP25 kicks off with calls to make serious progress on climate action and finalise rules for global carbon trade","December 3, 2019 Tuesday","The Times of India (TOI)","NEW DELHI: Amid serious concerns that the collective actions of all nations together is not enough to save the world from ill effects of global warming, the UN climate change conference kicked off in Madrid on Monday where representatives of nearly 200 countries will work on giving finishing touches to the rules governing the Paris accord in next 11 days.Twin objectives of the Conference (COP25) are to bring more and more nations on board to work for 'net zero emissions' by 2050 and finalise rules on how countries can reduce their emissions using global carbon markets. Though 65 countries including many of the European Union (EU) nations, including France, Germany, Italy and UK, figured in the list of the nations which will work on 'net zero emissions' by 2050, they hardly account for 37% of the global emission. Top emitters such as China, USA and India and other nations like Russia, Japan and Australia have, so far, not spelt out their intent on either working for net-zero emission or looking to ratchet up their climate action targets by 2020. Issues of putting a price on carbon and how the countries can trade in it if they have already cut their emissions more than the amount they had pledged are covered under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. The countries could not resolve this outstanding issue at COP24 in Katowice, Poland last year. ""You are here at COP25 to reach progress on key items - namely, achieving success on Article Six and continuing to boost ambition in preparation for new and revised national climate action plans due next year,"" said the UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres while speaking at the opening ceremony of the Conference. Urging all countries to overcome their current divisions and to find common understanding on this issue, Guterres said, ""Operationalizing Article Six will help get markets up and running, mobilize the private sector, and ensure that the rules are the same for everyone.""He warned that the failure to operationalize Article 6 risks fragmenting the carbon markets and sends a negative message that can undermine overall climate efforts.The US-based think tank, World Resources Institute (WRI), in one of its media briefs on working of international carbon market explained that the countries that struggle to meet their emissions-reduction targets can purchase emissions reductions from other nations that have already cut their emissions more than the amount they had pledged, such as by transitioning to renewable energy. ""If the rules are structured appropriately, the result can be a win-win for everyone involved - both countries meet their climate commitments, the overachiever is financially rewarded for going above and beyond, finance is provided to the country generating the emissions reductions allowing them to leapfrog technologies, and the world gets a step closer to avoiding catastrophic climate change,"" said the WRI in its note written by its Article 6 experts.The UNSG in his address also reminded the G20 nations of their responsibility as these big economies together account for 78% of total emissions and therefore they all together need to step up their efforts. The COP25 was supposed to be held in Chile. But, it was moved to Spain due to civil unrest in that country.Referring to the serious need to have higher targets, the UN secretary-general said he expected all governments to commit to review their national climate action plans - Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) - with the necessary ambition to tackle the climate emergency in the course of the coming 12 months up to COP26, the date by which governments need to submit updated and enhanced plans.He also called on governments to ensure that at least $100 billion a year is available to developing countries for measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to build resilience to climate change.

The figures for 2018 and 2017 show a downward trend for two consecutive years. According to the SERFOR study and the Forests Program, the departments that presented the most deforestation in 2018 are: Loreto with 26,203 hectares followed by Ucayali with 25,991 hectares, Madre de Dios is in third place with a loss of 23,492 hectares and San Martin with 21 991Loss figures compared to 2014 (maximum deforestation value 2001-2018) recorded a reduction of 22 800 hectares. The average annual loss is 126,938 hectares. During these 17 years, since 2001, the total loss of our Amazon forests reached 2,284,889 hectares. Part of this study was announced by the Minister of Environment, Fabiola Muoz, at the Climate Summit (COP25) held in Madrid, Spain. The Deputy Minister of Agricultural Policies of MINAGRI, Paula Carrin, president of the Directing Council of SERFOR, and the general director of Information and Forest and Wildlife Management of SERFOR, Elvira Gmez, are part of the delegation of Peru.Peru aspires to continue reducing deforestation figures by 2021, which is why priority axes have been raised in various sectors. In the case of Minagri, actions against deforestation fall mainly on SERFOR, which for several years made several advances, including the following:In the integral management axis of the territory, the forest zoning of San Martin and approval is expected; while Ucayali approved module 1 of that process and Loreto is about to approve it. In addition, there are significant advances in Madre de Dios, Amazonas, Junn, Hunuco and Pasco. The platform of the Satellite Monitoring Submodule of Impacts to Forest Heritage has also been implemented in 70%, which contains information on changes in use and logging, forest fires and the impact on fragile ecosystems for immediate action.On the axis of the fight against illegal economic activities, five Regional Tables for Forest Control and Surveillance and Wildlife have been installed in San Martn, Ucayali, Lambayeque, Madre de Dios and Loreto.

In turn, it is essential to pay attention to the important role they play in the preservation of the environment and biodiversity, the fight against climate change and equitable and sustainable access to resources. It is also necessary to keep in mind the role that sustainable development and international cooperation policies can play in contributing to the effective protection of defenders.Therefore, the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID) has today generated a space for debate on this issue within the framework of COP25. Under the title 'Environment and human rights defenders: right to protect and be protected', and moderated by Sara Acosta, journalist and editor of the economy and environment magazine Ballena Blanca, has had participants living in defense of human rights and the environment in the first person: Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; Domingos Nunes de Oliveira, indigenous leader, xakriab people (Brazil); and Milena Mara Flrez Gutirrez, vice president of the Ros Vivos Movement, Prosecutor of the Organization of Women defenders of Water and Life (AMARU) and president of the Association of Victims and Affected by Megaprojects of the Veredas de Orejn, Chiri and Buenavista.Victoria Tauli-Corpuz has presented a brief assessment of the current situation of human rights of indigenous peoples in the world and their vision of what role these communities play in protecting the environment and combating climate change: ""Indigenous peoples defend their environment, which is fair, their way of life depends on the natural environment they inhabit,"" he said.In light of what is explained by the UN Special Rapporteur, Domingos Nunes de Oliveira has shared with the public her testimony about what is happening in Brazil and about the reality that her community is living. For the indigenous leader denying our rights is a way of eliminating the indigenous population. We have the right to our land, and the best way to protect the territory is to let local people enjoy it.Meanwhile, Milena Mara Flrez Gutirrez has related her work as an activist in Colombia and why she had to flee the country. During his speech he has proclaimed environmental and social justice and has claimed the right to a healthy environment, denouncing that, often, local communities are not taken into account when deciding on their own territory .There has also been discussion on how to guarantee the protection of human rights defenders working on environmental issues in an increasingly hostile environment, from a human rights-based approach and climate justice. Also on how to ensure synergies between the climate and development agenda, and stimulate at the same time the joint and coordinated action of the multiple actors that direct their efforts towards the achievement of the SDGs.\l"

Organized by the Ministry of Energy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and KAUST, the event took place in the Gulf Cooperation Council Pavilion at the UNFCCC COP25. ""Recognizing the urgency to act on the climate while ensuring access to clean and affordable energy for all, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is promoting the 'Circular Carbon Economy' model as a sustainable, pragmatic and cost effective approach for achieving ambitious climate goals,"" says panel moderator Dr. Khalid Abuleif, chief UNFCCC negotiator for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Pioneering a new narrative for carbon, the environmental architect William McDonough, of William McDonough & Partners, says, ""Carbon has been demonized, but carbon is not the enemy. The current problem is one of mismanaged carbon resulting from design failures. We need a new narrative of carbon that recognizes the benefits of carbon and addresses the risks in a responsible manner. This leads us to a narrative of how we can redesign our products, buildings, systems and cities in a circular carbon economy to improve the health of our planet.""KAUST is catalyzing the circular carbon economy by contributing scientific advances in the development of engineering, chemical and biological technologies in addition to clean and traditional energy solutions which includes hydrogen fuel and advanced materials. Discussing opportunities for CO2 utilization, Jorge Gascn, director of the KAUST Catalysis Center, says: ""We, catalysis researchers, are modern alchemists, we look for the philosopher's stone, the one that will help us turn waste (CO2) into value. We are about to have another revolution in the way we use our resources and in the way we produce and store energy, and I believe catalysis will play a huge role. At KAUST, we are in an excellent position to contribute strongly to that transition.""The circular carbon economy is a system where carbon emissions are reduced, reused, recycled and removed (4R). Such a closed-loop system, inspired by how nature works, may help restore the balance of the carbon cycle.On rebuilding ocean carbon, Susana Agust, professor of marine science at KAUST, says: ""The oceans play a fundamental role in the global carbon cycle, holding the largest carbon stock in the biosphere. Its capacity to remove CO2 has been eroded due to global warming and losses of about 50 percent of coastal habitats. However, conservation and restoration of marine forests represents a strategy...we call 'blue carbon,' which can advance climate change mitigation with adaptation benefits.""The concept of a circular carbon economy is a new way of approaching energy and climate goals that implicitly values all options and encourages all efforts to mitigate carbon accumulation in the atmosphere while also facilitating global economic growth.\l"

WUR organised a session on shaping climate smart food systems with Prof. Louise O. Fresco as keynote speaker.Combine adaptation & mitigationLouise Fresco told her audience in a key note at a site-event of the 25th Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that in general food is blamed too much in relation to the climate challenges we face. The audience agreed on the statement that agriculture is indeed a responsible party for deforestation, and a large part of emission of greenhouse gasses like methane and nitrous oxide. Fortunately, food is already moving away from being a problem creator to problems solver. The key challenge, however, for agriculture is adaptation. Short- and long-term response strategies to deal with the impacts of or exploit opportunities provided by climate change requires a flexible and schooled farmer and food producers community. The example of the Netherlands was provided where less is more is the motto of a large group of farmers. They develop very efficient production systems where nutrients, water and other resources are used to the last drop. This new generation is active in combining both adaptation and mitigation in their management.Food systemIt is not only farmers that need to adapt to new conditions. Food waste is important as it causes huge losses of valuable resources. Up to 40% of food production is lost. Both at the level of consumers and throughout the food system, measures are required to prevent losses. Society and consumers are vital parts of the food system, and it is imperative there is understanding of the origins of and how food is produced. This will also help in accepting new technologies needed to increase the efficiency and flexibility food system require in adapting food systems to climate change.The issue of meat is also discussed. Animals play an important role in the food system as not all land is able to produce food for human consumption. Animals are able to digest plants that are hardly digestible by humans, and the animals provide highly nutritious products. Places differ hugely worldwide, from massive overconsumption to protein shortages in other places. We need a more circular, moderate use of meat, fitting healthy lifestyles. In the Netherlands the minister issued a policy paper on circular agriculture. New methods to work on protein sources and from plants and processing them are promising, but do have major implications for land use that need to be taken into account.Collaboration & integrationThere is definitely room for improvement, as several examples are discussed. Among others new breeding techniques that incorporate new climatic conditions and weather extremes, or improve the processes of photosynthesis; precision agriculture that improves overall efficiency and the placing of agro-chemicals; training of farmers and the new generation, making the farmer a more high-valued professional; technology from mobile phones to satellites and drones are to part of this fully integrated food system.

"COP25","India","COP25_India191","Sweden : Climate negotiations conclude at UN Climate Change Conference COP25","December 23, 2019 Monday","TendersInfo","The UN Climate Change Conference COP25 in Madrid, Spain, concluded in overtime. The Conference was challenging both technically and politically, and several issues were deferred until future meetings as the Parties were unable to agree. The main progress made at the Conference included strengthened action to address loss and damage, an updated gender action plan, strong political signals on the importance of countries raising the bar in their climate action in 2020, and the importance of strengthening the link between oceans and the climate.One of the issues on which the Parties were unable to agree was rules on how countries can achieve parts of the targets in their national climate plans through cooperation with other countries. This can be done via emissions trading, for example, or through one country implementing climate measures in another country.It is unfortunate that we were unable to agree on these rules. However, both Sweden and the EU had made it very clear that we will not accept rules that risk undermining the goals and purpose of the Paris Agreement. For this reason, we would rather the negotiations on these issues continue at future meetings. For us, it is completely crucial that the rules guarantee that these forms of cooperation lead to real emissions reductions, and that climate measures implemented in another country lead to positive developments for both the climate and the country in which the measure is undertaken, says Minister for Environment and Climate Isabella Lvin.Another important issue at the Conference was the importance of raising the bar for global climate action, and ensuring that efforts are consistent with the latest science. The negotiations resulted in documents that will give additional weight to research from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The Parties also approved documents urging all Parties to submit updated national climate action plans in 2020.Important steps towards higher ambitions were taken during the Conference, not least through the presentation by the EU of the Green Deal, with its target of becoming the worlds first climate-neutral continent by 2050. Nonetheless, progress is too slow and more countries must step up the pace of their national climate action. We need to show the world that we treat the climate crisis with the utmost seriousness. The importance of greater ambition must therefore also be reflected in the climate action plans that all countries are due to submit next year, says Ms Lvin.Another important matter for negotiation was the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts.Sweden has long been a driving force for ensuring that more is done to support the countries hardest hit by climate change, and we are currently one of the largest per capita donors of climate aid. At the Conference, the Parties agreed that more financing is needed, and a working group to support this was established. A network was also established to provide technical assistance to developing countries, says Ms Lvin.To achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, it is important that everyone has the opportunity to participate in climate efforts. At the Conference, the Parties therefore agreed on an updated gender action plan. The new plan covers a five-year period and contains specific activities to strengthen gender mainstreaming in decision-making processes associated with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and in countries own climate action.Ahead of the Conference, Chile stated that through its Presidency, it wanted to highlight the climates impact on the oceans. During the two weeks of the Conference, several high-level meetings were held in this area and a platform was launched to help create positive synergies between oceans and the climate. Sweden has long been a driving force for strengthening the link between the oceans and the climate, and is co-chair of the Ocean Pathway project.It is gratifying that ocean issues were given additional space at this years conference. This is an important issue for many countries, not least for a number of the small island states that have already been hit hard by rising sea levels. As we now enter the implementation phase of the Paris Agreement, it is important to integrate ocean issues into our work, says Ms Lovin.\l"

Collectively, the 54 African states represented at the UN climate talks account for less than 4% of global emissions, yet across the continent, every nation is feeling the effects of a changing climate.Earlier this year, catastrophic floods from two different storms affected over 2 million people in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. In late November, heavy rains triggered deadly landslides that killed more than 50 people in West Pokot in Kenya. The rains continue to cause unprecedented damage across different parts of the East African nation.In this light, African negotiators at the COP 25 conference have called for the continent to be granted ""special considerations"" to allow it more resources to tackle such climate-related disasters.Chair of the African Group of Negotiators, Ambassador Mohamed Nasr, said African countries spend at least 2% of their GDP every year to address climate change.Nasr said the cost was already a huge burden for the continent. Many African countries are only just discovering oil and gas - which they could use to drive their economies - but may have to leave these resources in the ground following calls from the international community to reduce emissions globally.Granting Africa special case consideration would encourage the continent to maintain the path of sustainable development, Nasr said.Latin American and small island nations said they were also uniquely affected by climate change.In response, African experts have emphasized that their appeal was based on scientific studies which have identified the continent's economy as potentially the most vulnerable. Africa's call for special status first emerged in 2015 during COP21 in Paris, where ministers tabled the issue for consideration.Informal consultations continued until last year's UN talks in Katowice, Poland, before finally ending up on the agenda this year in Madrid.The African Development Bank has played a key role in developing the continent's position in the run-up to COP 25 and is present at the conference to support its regional member countries in negotiations.The Bank's delegation is taking part in several panel discussions and other events, including on gender and climate change, climate finance, the role of legislators in implementing the Paris Agreement and climate adaptation.\l"

""The global stocktake (of climate actions under Paris Agreement) will happen in 2023. So, that is the time when we talk of new targets and raising our ambition,"" said India's environment minister Prakash Javadekar -- a remark which could be a clear signal of tough position which India would take in its 'country statement' during high-level segment of the Conference (COP25) on Tuesday. He said that it would be futile to talk about ""new targets"" and ""new programmes"" under the Paris Agreement as this global deal would only come up for implementation post-2020 and emphasised what was more needed at this juncture was to focus on implementing pre-2020 promises which were made by the developed countries under the Kyoto Protocol (KP).Noting that the rich nations can't just get away by giving an excuse that there is just one year left under KP to work on promises under it, the minister said, ""We (developing countries) will not forget it because it was a historical promise due to their (developed countries) historical responsibility. The KP parties (countries) must take up their responsibilities.""The biggest current carbon emitter China (28% of total global emission) too may not revise its target next year. The decision of the United States - biggest historical emitter and second biggest (15%) current emitter - to keep itself out of the Paris Agreement has already made the 'new ambition' move weak. Since India accounts for 7% of the global emission, the three countries together represent half of the total emission. Javadekar while narrating India's position said if the developed countries want, they can declare their targets in the present COP and can get two-three years (by 2022) more to carry it out fully -- an argument which developing countries including China had made at several occasions so that the burden of unfulfilled pre-2020 targets could not be passed on to developing countries post-2020.The minister said the pre-2020 targets of developed countries ""cannot be sidel"

The emissions savings were almost ten times greater than the global carbon footprint of the mobile industry itself2.The new GSMA report, produced in collaboration with the Carbon Trust, an independent sustainability specialist, is being presented at the 2019 United Nations () held in Madrid this month. It found that the majority of avoided emissions made possible by mobile technologies were the result of significant reductions in energy and fuel consumption.

CoP President, Carolina Schmidt, brought in new texts regarding the decision documents of the CoP 25, the\~Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol 15 (CMP15), the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement 2 (CMA2), and other outstanding issues like Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, Review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage, response measures and long-term review on its agenda late on the evening of December 14.The new texts will be discussed and re-negotiated by countries after which the closing plenary sessions of the CoP, CMP and CMA will take place. It looks highly unlikely as another informal stocktaking plenary has been planned by the CoP presidency at 11 pm local time, even though the closing plenary had been announced at 10 pm local time earlier.This means that the negotiations may continue into the early hours of December 15 and murmurs of the Madrid CoP being a failure or being suspended are growing stronger.The new texts were necessitated by a series of issues that were highlighted by countries at the stocktaking plenary session convened by Schmidt earlier\~on December 14 regarding the texts that were introduced\~in the morning of the same day.The most prominent among these issues was the absence of reference to the updation of the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) in 2020 as mandated under the Paris Agreement in the draft of the CoP 25 document.Belize, representing the Alliance of Small Island Nations (AOSIS), said that their group was unhappy. ""This CoP was one of ambition but we are not seeing the ambition. All the references to science have become weaker in the text. All references to enhancing NDCs have gone,"" the representative from Belize said. ""We are currently looking backward rather than forward"", he added.There was considerable applause at this statement. Colombia, speaking on the behalf of the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean (AILAC) said that the updation of NDCs was the lowest possible denominator at the CoP this year. Malaysia and Egypt also supported the stand taken by Belize and Colombia. Grenada went as far to say that ""if references to ambition be removed from the CoP 25 decision then we would have failed"".Mexico, on the other hand, noted with concern that there was no reference in the CoP document to one of the most applauded accomplishments of CoP 25 so far\~- the new 5-year gender action plan which takes into account the challenges faced by women and indigenous people.It also raised the point on NDCs. This, in fact, might be the only reference to human rights in the document, which has been a demand made civil society groups all through CoP 25.Another contentious issue was introduced by Brazil during the session. Its representative said that they were not comfortable with including the proposal for a work stream on land issues informed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) special report on climate change and land released earlier this year, in the CoP document.He argued that they were in the middle of the Koronivia process for agriculture and had the Warsaw International Mechanism for REDD. They did not want to pursue this discussion at the moment while being okay with the discussion on oceans. He added that this was a no-go for them.To this, came two strong interjections, first by Saudi Arabia followed by Russia stating that IPCC's report on land was as important as the one on oceans and that all references to the report should be kept in the CoP document. Both countries reiterated that the specific issues of one party (referring to Brazil) cannot hold the entire multilateral process.China and India stuck to their long-held stand on the gaps in the pre-2020 commitments by countries under the Kyoto Protocol. India's lead negotiator, Ravi Shankar Prasad, urged the CoP presidency to make sure that all parties are taken on board regarding Article 6 and that there is no tampering with the language of the Paris Agreement.The reference to the pre-2020 stocktake in the CMA document was opposed by the United States (US) saying that they ""did not need this language."" Later in the session, Tuvalu interjected by saying that the CMA text should be decided upon by parties who are going to remain in the Paris Agreement. The US is set to leave the Paris Agreement in November 2020. The\~US also had an issue with the global goals on adaptation which it wanted removed from the text.\l"

The EIB is set to provide EUR 26m to support the Solar Storm 200 project, which includes the construction of 15 solar photovoltaic power plants in Spain. The agreement was signed today at the EU bank's COP25 stand by EIB Vice-President Emma Navarro and IM2 Energa Solar CEO Enrique Selva, and is supported by the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), the main pillar of the Investment Plan for Europe (the Juncker Plan).The 15 new photovoltaic power plants will have a total capacity of 218 MW and will be located in four autonomous communities: Extremadura, Andalusia, the Valencia Region and Murcia. Their installation will prevent the release of 116 000 tonnes of CO2 a year, 400 people will be employed for their construction and a further 20 permanent jobs will be created.The operation has an innovative structure that will see the EU bank investing in a platform for developing renewable energy projects for the first time. This agreement will make the EIB an equity partner of Solar Storm 200, the sustainable investment vehicle via which IM2 has planned the development and construction of this infrastructure in Spain. This is a flagship project for IM2, a company with 16 years of experience in the photovoltaic sector with offices in Spain and Chile, and that works with both investment projects and high-power industrial self-consumption projects.During the signing ceremony at COP25, EIB Vice-President Emma Navarro, who is responsible for the Bank's climate action and its business in Spain, said: It is a pleasure to be at the Climate Change Conference supporting projects such as this that will help cut CO2 emissions and increase the amount of renewable energy generated in Spain. Our country has great potential for producing this kind of energy and the EIB wants to help take advantage of this. As the EU climate bank, the EIB is working to ensure that Europe leads the response to the climate emergency.European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis, responsible for An Economy that Works for People, said: Investing in renewable energies is a crucial element to achieving the Paris Climate Agreement goals and reaching climate neutrality by 2050. I am pleased to be in Madrid for COP25 where the European Investment Bank has signed an agreement under the Investment Plan for Europe which will see 15 new solar energy farms constructed in Spain. Not only will this deal provide new sources of clean energy, but it will also create jobs in the process.According to IM2 Energa Solar CEO Enrique Selva, the Spanish photovoltaic power sector is growing exponentially and Solar Storm is a major opportunity to invest in clean energy, in a project combining sustainability and long-term profitability. We have the opportunity to take advantage of Spain's high levels of sunshine (the highest in Europe) and a highly cost-effective technology to generate energy that can compete economically with other technologies.This agreement will enable Solar Storm to be launched as the investment platform of Umbrella Capital IM2 Energa Solar's holding company with an Independent Power Producer (IPP) focus and becoming a renewable power producer. In addition to the EIB investment, Solar Storm 200 is backed by the commercial banking sector via project finance.The EIB and climate action:The EIB is among the world's largest multilateral providers of climate finance. The Banks goal is to be a leader in mobilising the finance needed to keep global warming under 2C and to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C in order to meet the Paris Agreement objectives. On 14 November, the EIB Board of Directors approved its roadmap to consolidate its position as the EU climate bank, together with the new energy lending policy. The core components of these agreements are: the EIB Group's commitment to mobilise at least EUR 1tn in climate and environment investment over the next decade from 2021 to 2030; to this end , the Bank will gradually increase the financing it dedicates to these objectives to represent 50% of its financing by 2025. It also announced its intention to align all EIB Group activities with the Paris Agreement. To this end, the EIB will cease financing fossil fuel-based projects from late 2021.In 2018, the EIB provided almost EUR 1.3bn to support climate action in Spain by financing projects involving the development of cleaner means of transport and implementation of new, less polluting and more environmentally friendly production processes.\l"

Chile is the president of CoP 25.The CoP 25 Presidency has set up various working groups headed by pairs of countries to engage with parties so that a consensus can be reached on the most pressing issues.New Zealand and South Africa are leading the discussions on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, dealing with carbon market mechanisms. It has been a sticking point at CoP 25 and in fact, has carried over from CoP 24 in Katowice, Poland last year. The representative from New Zealand said that they heard the views on three difficult issues regarding Article 6 and there was a high level of consensus on principles and the commitment of the parties to the UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.The parties also agreed to find an acceptable outcome and expressed concern for parties with different views. They also agreed to find resourcing for adaptation. Further discussions on these issues will be held by the afternoon of December 13, including bilateral meetings with different parties.Even with this, the CoP 25 Presidency reported that there was no consensus on the transition of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) as well as Rules, Modalities and Procedures (RMP) under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement which establishes a global carbon market mechanism known as the Sustainable Development Mechanism (SDM).The draft decision was taken up the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP) plenary later on December 12.On the issue of the Warsaw International Mechanism dealing with financing for Loss and Damage due to climate change impacts, Grenada reported that discussions regarding two key questions about the tasks for expert group of Workstream E and functions and modalities, like mobilisation of existing resources, of the Santiago Network had been taken up and discussions were to go on till the afternoon of December 12.""The focus is on the text and not on conceptual understanding,"" the representative from Grenada said. ""On the matters of the governance of the Santiago Network, the various ministers are being consulted on finding a political resolution in Madrid,"" he added.On the progress of the decision documents from CoP 25, Spain and Singapore said there were some key points in the document that parties wanted to preserve. These included pre-2020 ambition and implementation; the Nationally Determined Contributions in 2020; and Land, Ocean and Loss and Damage.This working group closed its discussions by the evening of December 12.On the issue of the periodic review of the long term goal, the CoP Presidency noted that while they were ""close to an agreement"", the parties wanted to wait until other issues were resolved. Schmidt also urged all parties to engage in solutions-oriented discussion.From the floor, Australia pointed out that too many issues were still unresolved. Interestingly, in many negotiating rooms, like the one on gender and climate change, Australia has been stressing on semantics, rather than principles. It also signalled its disappointment at no consensus being reached on the issue of ""transparency"".Grenada expressed concern on the overall outcome of the CoP and stated that many countries were still ignoring the fact that there was a climate emergency. The European Union expressed its willingness for an outcome on both, Article 6 and Loss and Damage.Egypt raised a number of flags on the proceedings at the CoP. Representing the African group, it said that most of the elements under discussion were priorities for African countries but that it was difficult to implement what had been agreed upon.On Loss and Damage, which is crucial for many countries in Africa as they face the wrath of cyclones, extreme rainfall and droughts Egypt said it was ""concerned about use of governments to discuss the Paris Agreement"" and that ""issues are being taken hostage because some are pushing forward views.""Bhutan urged countries ""to respond to voices of most vulnerable around the world"" and pointed out that there was a disconnect inside the conference from what's happened outside"", referring to the continuous protests by youth, women's and indigenous people's groups.Using strong language, Indian representative Ravi Shankar Prasad also raised a slew of points at the event regarding climate financing, technology transition and other issues. He said that ""ambition differs from implementation"" and that he had ""unfortunately heard a lot of words from ambition, but not zeal as far as implementation is concerned.""He added that ""historical gaps and shortfalls have got us to this situation"" and that ""if we don't take that seriously, we will repeat history.""\l"

PIK Director Johan Rockstrm and colleagues from Future Earth and the Earth League today presented the 10 New Insights in Climate Science report to UNFCCCs Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa at the meeting in the Spanish capital Madrid.""The key insight from the latest climate science is that the Paris climate target of limiting global warming to 1.5C is a planetary boundary we pass at our own peril, putting future generations at risk, says Johan Rockstrm, PIK director, co-chair of Future Earth and the Earth League and co-author of the report. Earth observations show that big systems with known tipping points are already now, at 1C warming, on the move toward potentially irreversible change, such as accelerated melting of Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, drying of rainforests, and thawing of Arctic permafrost,"" continues Prof Rockstrm.""A planetary boundary we pass at our own peril""10 new insights into climate risks and solutionsDespite increasing drivers of reduced emissions, such as growth in green energy, institutions divesting from fossil fuels, and some countries phasing out coal power, the fossil industry is still growing and global leaders aren't yet committing to the necessary emissions cuts. We are not on track to reach the Paris Agreement.2. Climate change is faster and stronger than expectedThe pace of contemporary rise in greenhouse gas concentrations is unprecedented in climate history over the past 66 million years, and methane concentrations are now at a record high of 257 percent of pre-industrial levels. A global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels could be reached already in the year 2030, instead of 2040 as is the mean projection of IPCC.Sea-level rise is accelerating due to the increased melting rate of Greenland's and Antarctica's ice sheets. If they are destabilized, that could lead to severe ice losses and would thereby critically accelerate sea-level rise.3. Climate change leaves no mountain summit behind4. Forests are under threat, with global consequencesThe world's forests are a major carbon dioxide sink, absorbing about a third of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. Yet human-driven forest fires have been reducing these sinks, and climate change globally amplifies wild forest fires. Increases in fires are observed in Western U.S. and Alaska, Canada, Russia, and Australia as a result of prolonged drought. Huge emissions have been observed from land changes in western Ethiopia and western tropical Africa. Loss of forests affects both the local and global climate. Fighting deforestation and encouraging reforestation, along with sustainable forest management and other natural climate solutions, are important and cost-effective options for reduced net emissions.5. Weather extremes a ""new normal"" in 2019Climate change is forcing us to reconsider the notion of an extreme event. What was once considered unlikely or rare -- both in terms of the intensity and frequency -- is becoming part of a ""new normal.""

They pointed to assessments showing that developed countries are not on track to achieve the required reduction of 25-40% in emissions from the 1990 levels by 2020.In an official proposal, several developing countries, including many G-20 members, said the industrialised countries must fulfil their commitments by 2023.In other developments in the talks, developing countries have objected to continued efforts by the United States to shape the global policy on climate change. Countries have argued that with the US formally submitting its application to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, it no longer has a stake in the post-2020 global climate policy. Therefore, it should not be allowed to steer the discussions, but rather participate as an observer.The objection came close on the heels of arguments by the US that there was no need to discuss a roadmap for providing developing countries with finance to deal with climate change.In early November this year, the US moved a formal application to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.This request for formal withdrawal will come into effect from November 4, 2020.

The agreement was signed today at the EU bank's COP25 stand by EIB Vice-President Emma Navarro and IM2 Energa Solar CEO Enrique Selva, and is supported by the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), the main pillar of the Investment Plan for Europe (the Juncker Plan).The 15 new photovoltaic power plants will have a total capacity of 218 MW and will be located in four autonomous communities: Extremadura, Andalusia, the Valencia Region and Murcia. Their installation will prevent the release of 116 000 tonnes of CO2 a year, 400 people will be employed for their construction and a further 20 permanent jobs will be created.The operation has an innovative structure that will see the EU bank investing in a platform for developing renewable energy projects for the first time. This agreement will make the EIB an equity partner of Solar Storm 200, the sustainable investment vehicle via which IM2 has planned the development and construction of this infrastructure in Spain. This is a flagship project for IM2, a company with 16 years of experience in the photovoltaic sector with offices in Spain and Chile, and that works with both investment projects and high-power industrial self-consumption projects.During the signing ceremony at COP25, EIB Vice-President Emma Navarro, who is responsible for the Bank's climate action and its business in Spain, said: It is a pleasure to be at the Climate Change Conference supporting projects such as this that will help cut CO2 emissions and increase the amount of renewable energy generated in Spain. Our country has great potential for producing this kind of energy and the EIB wants to help take advantage of this. As the EU climate bank, the EIB is working to ensure that Europe leads the response to the climate emergency.European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis, responsible for An Economy that Works for People, said: Investing in renewable energies is a crucial element to achieving the Paris Climate Agreement goals and reaching climate neutrality by 2050. I am pleased to be in Madrid for COP25 where the European Investment Bank has signed an agreement under the Investment Plan for Europe which will see 15 new solar energy farms constructed in Spain. Not only will this deal provide new sources of clean energy, but it will also create jobs in the process.According to IM2 Energa Solar CEO Enrique Selva, the Spanish photovoltaic power sector is growing exponentially and Solar Storm is a major opportunity to invest in clean energy, in a project combining sustainability and long-term profitability. We have the opportunity to take advantage of Spain's high levels of sunshine (the highest in Europe) and a highly cost-effective technology to generate energy that can compete economically with other technologies.This agreement will enable Solar Storm to be launched as the investment platform of Umbrella Capital IM2 Energa Solar's holding company with an Independent Power Producer (IPP) focus and becoming a renewable power producer. In addition to the EIB investment, Solar Storm 200 is backed by the commercial banking sector via project finance.The EIB and climate actionThe EIB is among the world's largest multilateral providers of climate finance. The Banks goal is to be a leader in mobilising the finance needed to keep global warming under 2C and to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C in order to meet the Paris Agreement objectives. On 14 November, the EIB Board of Directors approved its roadmap to consolidate its position as the EU climate bank, together with the new energy lending policy. The core components of these agreements are: the EIB Group's commitment to mobilise at least EUR 1tn in climate and environment investment over the next decade from 2021 to 2030; to this end , the Bank will gradually increase the financing it dedicates to these objectives to represent 50% of its financing by 2025. It also announced its intention to align all EIB Group activities with the Paris Agreement. To this end, the EIB will cease financing fossil fuel-based projects from late 2021.In 2018, the EIB provided almost EUR 1.3bn to support climate action in Spain by financing projects involving the development of cleaner means of transport and implementation of new, less polluting and more environmentally friendly production processes.\l"
"COP25","India","COP25_India218","COP25: Deadlock on carbon trade mechanism continues, India is disappointed with draft text","December 14, 2019 Saturday","The Times of India (TOI)","MADRID: Deadlock on decision relating to how countries to trade in carbon credits, earned by them through adoption of clean processes, continued at the ongoing UN climate change conference till late on Friday - officially the concluding day of the COP25. It is, however, likely that the discussions over the draft text would be dragged till Saturday to have some outcome of this mega negotiating round of the global parleys.Since the heavily bracketed draft text, released on Friday, carried points of all divergent demands from stakeholders, ongoing discussions on the issue - covered under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement - may, in such a situation, require the countries to finally take the call on this delicate issue next year. Though it carried India's and many other like-minded countries' demand on 'transition' of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) from Kyoto Protocol (pre-2020) to Paris Agreement (post-2020), this point is bracketed - it means there is no agreement on it. If it doesn't make into the final agreement in the form of rules for Article 6, it would be unfair for the countries who earned credits in pre-2020 phase.The CDM allows emission-reduction projects in developing countries to earn certified emission reduction (CER) credits (each equivalent to one tonne of CO2). These CERs can be traded and sold, and used by industrialized countries to meet a part of their emission reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol. It is expected that the carbon trade mechanism may stimulate sustainable development and emission reductions, while giving industrialized countries some flexibility in how they meet their emission reduction limitation targets.India's view points on Articles 6 and other key issues were articulated by India's lead negotiator, Ravi Shankar Prasad, while making intervention during informal Presidency stock-taking Plenary on Friday. He told the gathering that the country was ""disappointed"" to see the extensively bracketed text as it didn't address the concerns of India and many other Parties (countries) to the UNFCCC.""On Article 6, we would like to highlight that we still don't find a balance between Article 6.2 (on country to country trade of emissions) and 6.4 (on project to project or project to country trade of emissions) development. And whereas the text on 6.4 is heavily bracketed, we don't find a similar situation in 6.2. We also feel that large parts of concerns highlighted by some of the Parties (countries) have been ignored,"" said Prasad.He also said, ""There is no justification for barring CDM credits from a particular year. We seek seamless transition of CDM credits. Otherwise the private sector and businesses will lose faith in the process. Further, in past we have witnessed embargo on CDM credits from India by some of the Parties. This is not only unfair but distort market significantly. The text has deleted necessary provisions for ensuring equal market access that safeguard that no party resort to restrictive practices and impose barriers"".His remarks clearly show that the negotiators still have many differences to be ironed out. Some of the differences include the crucial issue of long-term finance and technology transfer to support developing countries in their mitigation and adaptation measures. Referring to finance, Prasad said, ""We also feel that the progress on the issues related to finance has been very slow. It has not yielded desired results. We find that there are lot of resistance to the talk of mobilization of 100 billion US dollar, and documenting how this goal has been achieved under the UNFCCC process. There is also resistance to continuance of long-term finance channels, its related agenda items and on the definition of climate finance.""India's lead negotiator also touched upon the key issue of £mbition' where countries are expected to increase their Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets, submitted to the UNFCCC ahead of the Paris Agreement in 2015. Making India's position clear on NDCs, Prasad said, ""We strongly feel that the NDCs are country driven. Therefore, there is no mandate for any top down directions on NDCs. We would like to respect the language that is agreed by all of us during Paris COP regarding NDCs submission, communication and updatation. Of course, the parties are welcome to update or scale up their ambition at any point of time. There are parties which already have an ambition commensurate with the requirement of the Paris Agreement"". For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com\l"

It was adopted at the eighth CoP serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP) in Qatar's capital in 2012.As of December 10, 2019, 135 parties deposited instruments of acceptance of the amendment, according to UNFCCC. The amendment needs ratification by nine more parties to come into effect; On the other hand, its commitment period ends next year.Countries that have not met pre-2020 Kyoto Protocol commitments should do so soonest, India's lead negotiator Ravi Shankar Prasad said at a high-level event to take stock of 'pre-2020 implementation and ambition'. to meet the commitments or made any announcements and the gaps should be filled before the global stocktake in 2023, he added.Though the Green Climate Fund was replenished in 2019 and many countries doubled their contribution, its overall value remained around $9.7 billion (Rs 68,746 crore), Prasad said.He also raised the issue of carbon credits from Kyoto Protocol not being carried forward to the Paris Agreement - one of the hottest points of contention at Madrid against which several countries such as Fiji have taken a stand.Not valuing the credits post-2020 under the UN-mandated sustainable development mechanism will send a wrong signal to private players who invested in them. This will create mistrust in the multilateral UNFCCC process and the carbon market mechanisms to will be part of the Paris Agreement, he added.On the same pageThe representative from China raised similar concerns at an earlier panel discussion at the event. He called for an effective conclusion to the pre-2020 gaps so that they are not carried into the post-2020 period.Both India and China have taken up issues around carbon market mechanisms under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, financial flows from developed countries and other climate financing-related matters under different agenda at every forum they have had a chance to address.The pre-2020 stocktaking should not be taken as an excuse to not move forward on the Paris Agreement, Gale Rigobert, St Lucia's minister for education, innovation, gender relations and sustainable development, said. The most vulnerable countries needed more than a trillion dollars for mitigation and adaptation, he added.Big emitters have to raise their climate ambition and increase financial contributions for the most vulnerable and developing countries, Jeanne D'Arc Mujawamariya, the environment minister of Rwanda said.The African country's achievements showed ""development, climate action and equity can all be achieved together,"" she said, citing the example of Rwanda Green Fund, which has been awarded by the UNFCCC for climate finance leadership. It invested $40 million in 35 projects, created more than 137, 500 green jobs, improved access to clean energy for 57,500 households and saved 19,500 hectares land against soil erosion. Sixty per cent of the green jobs were for women.While these calls are being made at open plenary sessions, movement on such important issues inside negotiation rooms remained slow. With only two days for the COP 25 in Madrid to end it remained to be seen if all these issues get resolved and a strong and ambitious outcome is reached.\l"

The Senators urged the administration against ceding U.S. leadership on this issue. The letter was sent as the 25th United Nations takes place in Madrid this week.As the second largest global emitter of greenhouse gases, and the largest historical emitter, it is imperative that the United States assume our rightful place as a global leader in the fight to combat climate change, yet with this action you are ceding American leadership to other nations at great political and economic costs. the senators wrote.There is an international race to develop advanced energy technologies. Instead of capitalizing on this economic opportunity, this action to no longer participate in the Paris Climate Agreement places U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage and effectively offshores American jobs to China and other countries, Moreover, the blow dealt to our national security by surrendering technological prowess to other countries is matched only by the damage caused by abdicating our international commitments made under the Paris Climate Agreement.\l"

We came to Madrid to wrap up the Katowice rulebook' and to clear the path for raising ambition in 2020 at COP26 in Glasgow. Since we arrived here, the World Meteorological Organisation has told us that the global average temperature reached 1.1C above pre-industrial levels in 2019 concluding a decade of exceptional global heat, and hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to demand more ambitious climate action.The EU is deeply concerned by the recent UN reports confirming that, collectively, Nationally Determined Contributions submitted by Parties and current GHG emission trajectories fall far short of what is required to achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. Whilst developed countries must continue to take the lead, it is vital that all Parties undertake and communicate ambitious efforts as part of an urgent global response, taking heed of the best available science.It is important that COP25 sends an unequivocal message that all Parties will update their NDCs in a manner that reflects their highest possible ambition. It is disappointing that after years of hard work and especially during the last two weeks that we could not agree on Article 6 providing incentives to reduce emissions now and in the future without undermining environmental integrity. We think, however, that we came much closer to agreement than previously, and this is something that we can build on in our future deliberation.Besides, we are deeply concerned by the fact that we could not reach an agreement on transparency, despite the utmost importance of these issue for implementing Paris Agreement. We are also happy that we managed to complete the second review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for loss and damage. This enables us thus to enhance our capacity to mobilize and catalyze effective action for averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage associated with climate change impacts.We want to mention one result of this COP that we warmly welcome, the new Gender Action Plan. It strengthens gender considerations and women's participation in climate action and highlights the important role of women as agents of change. This COP was not only about negotiations. The multiple events under the Global Climate Action Agenda and the active participation by Non-Party stakeholders show that they are crucial allies in implementing the Paris Agreement. Their expertise and enthusiasm is valuable and we look forward to working with them in increasing ambition and action.\l"
"COP25","India","COP25_India226","Climate Emergency CoP 25: Roadblock for Adaptation Fund","December 19, 2019","Indian Agriculture News","December 19 -- Negotiations regarding the Adaptation Fund hit a major roadblock on December 11, 2019, at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of Parties (CoP) 25 in Madrid. The negotiations are key to migration from the Kyoto Protocol regime to the Paris Agreement regime and a governance mechanism for that.\~The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP) agreed to the first seven paragraphs of the text of the agenda item 7 under CMP, which deals with the Adaptation Fund. But it could not reach a consensus on the the main point of contention regarding the composition of the governing board of the Fund which makes up the paragraph 8 of the text.In its current form, the board comprises members mostly (70 per cent) from developing countries, giving them control over the financial management of the fund. On the other hand, the developed countries want a greater representation on the board.At a negotiation meeting on December 10, the decision regarding paragraph 8 was postponed to the next meeting of the CMP in June, 2020. Hence, the parties agreed to delete the paragraph from the text document for now.Other countries like India, Saudi Arabia and Belize wanted the matter to be taken up in the next session.The Adaptation Fund was set up in 2001 under the Kyoto Protocol to finance projects and programmes in developing countries to adapt to the harmful effects of climate change. The finance was raised, in part, by levying a 2 per cent ""share of proceeds"" on the value of credits traded on the international carbon market under the Protocol\~- known as the 'Clean Development Mechanism'.It also relies on contributions from developed countries. The fact that it was mostly controlled by developing countries and was able to build their national capacities to adapt to the consequences of human-induced climate change had contributed to its success. An amount of $532 million has been disbursed through the Fund for 80 projects on adaptation, mostly serving vulnerable communities in developing countries.The next discussion among the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA) was on whether the text that has been agreed upon by them for the CMP can be taken over directly under CMA.This led to a lot of confusion in the room, with remarks coming from a host of countries across the spectrum. The\~EU had first proposed that the same text under the CMP be taken over under the CMA as the parties had waited for a long time for the Adaptation Fund to be guided by the Paris Agreement.Saudi Arabia was vehemently opposed to this proposal while South Africa said that it ""cannot consider new text and wanted to go back to its team to discuss"". India and Egypt pointed out that there was no clarification on the text.To this, the co-facilitator stated that the text is the same as has been agreed upon a while back under the CMP. Saudi Arabia raised its flag again to say that ""it is not ok with the text"". For quite sometime later, India, South Africa and Saudi Arabia intervened that they cannot entertain new text while the co-facilitator kept reiterating that the text was the same.In the end, South Africa remarked that what the co-facilitator was proposing was procedurally wrong. ""It seems like procedural engineering of an agreement and It is a problem"", its representative said.It was also pointed out that no decision can be made on this matter till the issues regarding Article 6 get resolved. After this, the session was abruptly closed after a series of statements by Saudi Arabia for the session to be ended.With this, matters concerning the Adaptation Fund and its functioning remain unresolved and so do the hopes of the millions of vulnerable people who would have benefitted from its smooth functioning.It seems like the developing countries are willing to compromise on the Adaptation Fund negotiations to get the Article 6 moving along in the right direction. With only three days left for the CoP 25 in Madrid to end, a decision on Article 6 is highly unlikely.\l"

It underscored the importance of aligning gender-responsive climate policies with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted by\~United Nations member countries in 2015.The fifth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG5) mandated by the United Nations specifically calls for Gender Equality. This includes some general goals\~- ""end all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere"" - and some specific ones, for example:""Eiminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation"";  ""Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights [...]"";""Undertake reforms to give women equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, financial services, inheritance and natural resources""The decision at CoP 22 in Marrakech also laid out some climate-specific action points for countries:  Appoint and provide support for a national gender focal point for climate negotiations, implementation and monitoringIncrease the representation and active participation of women in the bodies established under the Convention  Mainstream a gender perspective in the enhancement of climate technology development and transferIntegrate local and traditional knowledge in the formulation of climate policy and to recognize the value of the participation of grassroots women in gender-responsive climate action at all levelsProgress on these latter action points was supposed to be reviewed at CoP 25 this year. On December 9, 2019, at the beginning of the 'political' week of the CoP, the chair of the technical body discussing this issue handed it over to the political negotiators, noting that no consensus was found. This is a surprising and troubling development.There was an inexplicably specific disagreement regarding how to refer to the 2030 Agenda within a CoP decision on gender\~- whether cohering climate policies with the 2030 Agenda ""can improve"", ""will improve"", ""will contribute to improving"" or ""can contribute to improving"" a gender-just transition.Representatives from African and South American countries pushed for the stronger language, with the United States, Canada,\~European Union (EU) and Australia pushing back. The Canadian representative pointed out at one stage that this was a debate over semantics, but it did not seem to produce consensus.In addition, developing countries wanted to discuss the question of ""direct access""\~- transferring money from funds like the Green Climate Fund and Adaptation Fund directly to organisations operating at ground-level. There is a feeling among developing countries that more sub-national organisations need to be authorised (by the Funds) for such ""direct access"", including grassroots organisations focused on gender.This builds on a trend at CoP 25 of developing countries emphasising finance in every discussion. It is a development born out of too many broken promises by developed countries on finance, and finance is justifiably discussable under the stated agenda on gender. But developed countries including the EU and the US pushed back strongly, arguing that a separate finance agenda item was available for that debate.The upshot of these disagreements is that\~- despite the Paris Agreement stating that countries ""should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their respective obligations on [...] gender equality""\~- a forward-looking work programme on gender is on the verge of falling off the agenda in Madrid.\~\l"

The disappointment among developing and least developed countries (LDCs), many of them highly vulnerable to the ongoing impacts of climate change such as extreme rainfall, sea level rise and tropical cyclones, has been regarding matters of climate finance for adaptation, loss and damage and enhanced nationally determined contributions (NDCs).These issues were of critical importance at this CoP, along with resolving the outstanding issues with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement which deals with the establishment and functioning of carbon markets, the shares of proceeds from which had to feed into finances for mitigation, adaptation and implementation.The slow progress on these issues at the CoP 25 witnessed wide spread protests from youth, women and indigenous peoples' groups and other prominent environmental groups like the Climate Action Network (CAN) both inside the conference venue and outside it.""CAN has followed these climate negotiations since they started in 1991 and never before witnessed such a disconnection between what the science and the people demand and what governments are delivering,"" the representative of CAN said at the combined closing plenary session of the CoP 25, the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol 15 (CMP15) and the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement 2 (CMA2), which was held from the morning of December 15.""We witness an almost complete absence of ambition and urgency from all large emitters. And then to hear that one country blocked language on addressing these gaps is obnoxious. The arrogance to block progress while leaving the Paris Agreement is treacherous,"" he further added, perhaps referring to the United States (US), which had made last minute interventions in various matters especially regarding climate financing, eventually blocking them.One of these issues was that of long-term climate financing which was agreed upon by countries in the meeting rooms but the text was changed when it was introduced in the closing plenary. Many countries, including Egypt, expressed confusion over the deleted language after which the CoP president, Carolina Schmidt, announced that the matter had not reached conclusion and will be taken up at the session when the parties will meet.The CAN representative also pointed a more glaring concern of ""the exclusion of vulnerable countries from key negotiations and call on future presidencies to ensure full inclusiveness.""The only saving graces at the conference were the adoption of the new five-year gender action plan by the CoP and its establishment as well as the establishment of Expert Group and the Santiago Network for Loss and Damage under the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM).But the latter of these came with a caveat of the concern over the governance of the WIM on which no decision was taken at this CoP. While many of the countries like Bhutan said that the WIM should serve both the UNFCCC and the CMA, the US was opposed to this as it would not be a part of the CMA when it leaves the Paris Agreement next year.Here too, the text was changed at the last minute to remove the liability of the developed countries as historical polluters. The representative from Tuvalu called it ""a crime against humanity"" and ""an absolute tragedy.""""There is a vast disconnect between the urgency we are feeling at home and the pace of these negotiations,"" Sonam P Wangdi, chair of the LDCs said in a statement.""We have seen floods in Mozambique and Malawi, droughts in Senegal and the Gambia, and flooding in Bangladesh and Nepal. These disasters have killed thousands, wiped away homes and communities, destroyed farms and crops. Scientists say it is only going to get worse. More climate action and support is urgently needed, not less. But here, some countries seem to be working to limit their obligations under the Convention and the Paris Agreement,"" he added.Regarding Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, he said that ""these rules must ensure environmental integrity and deliver overall mitigation in global emissions. We're disappointed with the lack of willingness by some parties to work together to ensure environmental integrity, to respond to the needs of the most vulnerable communities, and to build upon rather than undermine the Paris Agreement, including resources for the Adaptation Fund"".Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Down to Earth.

The Deal aims to be a comprehensive strategy document which puts the European Union (EU) on a trajectory toward ""no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use.""2020 is a critical year to raise climate ambition, the year in which parties to the Paris Agreement have to submit their second round of\~Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The European Green Deal is highly conscious of this fact, announcing a number of climate-focused action points over the next 12 months, some of which are:Proposal on a European 'Climate Law' enshrining the 2050 climate neutrality objective (March 2020)  Comprehensive plan to increase the EU 2030 climate target to at least 50 per cent and towards 55 per cent in a responsible way (Summer 2020)Assessment of the final National Energy and Climate Plans (June 2020)Strategy on offshore wind  Initiatives to stimulate lead markets for climate neutral and circular products in energy intensive industrial sectors (from 2020)Proposal to support zero carbon steel-making processes by 2030Legislation on batteries in support of the Strategic Action Plan on Batteries and the circular economy (October 2020)Launch of the European Climate Pact (March 2020)The policy focus on a number of sectors critical to climate action is positive (and a long-standing feature in EU policy), but the genuinely new information in this announcement is concentrated in the first two points\~- a climate law, and an emissions reduction target. Another important action point is scheduled for 2021, which we come to in a bit.The EU's NDC under the Paris Agreement binds it to reduce its emissions by 40 per cent between 1990 and 2030. In that sense, the Green Deal announcement is an improvement\~- to reduce emissions by at least 50 per cent between 1990 and 2030.While this ambition 'increase' is being celebrated, some context is needed. Firstly, the EU's current NDC is rated 'insufficient' by Climate Action Tracker, which takes into account ""historic emissions, capability and equality"" to determine each country's 'fair share' of mitigation effort.If every country matched the ambition in EU's NDC, the world would be on track to warm by nearly 3 degrees Celsius (\'b0C) by the end of the century. The Paris Agreement commits countries to keep end-century warming ""well below"" 2\'b0C, and ""pursue efforts"" to limit it to 1.5\'b0C. So, there is huge scope for improvement in the EU's target-setting.As an aside, there is also huge scope for improvement on hitting targets. There is a lot of uncertainty around whether the EU is on track to achieve its NDC\~- this year alone, UN Environment's Emissions Gap Report considered that it was, while the European Environment Agency reported that it was not.What would be an appropriate target? Sandbag, a London-based climate policy think-tank, considers that a 50 per cent reduction by 2030 is now 'business as usual' for the EU. Greenpeace Europe is pushing for the EU to aim for a 60 to 70 per cent reduction by the same deadl"

Rail Freight Forward (RFF), a coalition of European freight railways, has set itself the goal of drastically reducing the negative impact of freight transport on our planet. The Noah's Train campaign has been spreading its message for almost a year to increase the modal share of rail freight transport across Europe to 30% in order to improve climate, air quality and mobility. At the UN COP25 climate conference the topic is now being positioned.Vision: climate-friendly freight trafficRail Freight Forward is a Europe-wide initiative. The aim is to inform the European population that rail freight transport is an essential response to the challenges of climate change. The transport sector is one of the largest sources of CO2 pollution and the greenhouse effect. Shifting freight transport by rail is the fastest and most efficient way to combat ever-increasing CO2 emissions and pollution. Much still needs to be done to make the modal shift feasible: fair competitive conditions between rail and road, tax relief for traction and clear, current toll rules for road transport that apply across Europe. Because the goal is to align the procedures and regulations at EU level and to reduce the number of border interfaces. These measures are intended to increase competitiveness with trucks. Running a train across Europe has to be as easy as driving a truck through Europe. Only by increasing the modal split will we reach the climate protection goals of the Paris Agreement 2016.Rail Freight Forward (RFF) and Noah's Train: a year laterWithin a year, Rail Freight Forward has already achieved a lot. Climate Ambassador of the RFF coalition is Noah's Train with its 19 containers designed by international street art artists with animal motifs. With 16 stays on its journey across Europe, it has been spreading the message from 30 to 2030 since COP24 last December. Noah's Train is more than 200 meters long, making it the longest mobile work of art in the world. He has delivered more than a million people in Europe through the RFF message, and the number of followers and advocates is steadily increasing. During the year, ten other rail companies have become members - the movement is growing and is getting off to a good start to drive climate change by shifting traffic from road to green rail.Progress in AustriaFor the first time, competitors are working together on a European level with a strong participation from Austria in the highly competitive rail freight market to create a vision. Because everyone is aware that the modal change can only work together. Not only the Rail Cargo Group but also the LTE group and the East-West Logistics Network are part of the European alliance. The Rail Cargo Group used the joint work program to improve the services for their customers in rail freight transport considerably. These include, for example, the expansion of multilateral connections in Central Asia, the handover of the first TransANT set to the voestalpine subsidiary logserv,About Rail Freight ForwardRail Freight Forward is an initiative of European rail freight companies that wants to drastically reduce the negative effects of freight transport on the environment through innovation and a smarter transport mix. The initiative aims to increase the modal share of freight transport by rail to 30% from today to 2030, as this is the best macroeconomic solution for growth in Europe. It tries to get railway companies, infrastructure managers and politicians in Europe to act to achieve this shift in traffic. Rail Freight Forward is a broad, constantly growing initiative made up of rail freight companies supported by the umbrella organizations CER, UIC, EFRA and VDV. The Rail Freight Forward initiative currently includes BLS Cargo, CD Cargo, CFL Cargo, DB Cargo, GreenCargo,Rail Cargo Group: Freight traffic of the BBWith 8,500 employees, branches across Europe and annual sales of around EUR 2.3 billion, the Rail Cargo Group is one of the leading rail logistics companies in Europe. Together with strong partners, the Rail Cargo Group operates a nationwide network of end-to-end logistics in Europe and beyond to Asia. It connects European metropolitan areas and ports with prospering economic centers in Russia, Turkey and China. The operational lead company of the Rail Cargo Group is Rail Cargo Austria AG.\l"

The vast majority will do so through this airport, so their initiatives such as recycling, tree donation, clean energy production and electromobility implementation are aspects that should be highlighted because, in that way, we also encourage others transport-related actors replicate them, said Minister Hutt.The head of the branch indicated that the portfolio has promoted the introduction of electric taxis nationwide and 11 of them currently operate in the air terminal. ""We will add six double charging points for electric cars and the company Engie takes steps to increase the quotas of electric vehicles that operate at the airport to 60 and also incorporate others in regions to reach 150 across the country in the medium term,"" He pointed out.Among other sustainable actions that will be implemented are the installation of 2,500 solar panels before the end of the year, the incorporation of 10 electric static bicycles to charge devices, such as cell phones, and the measurement of the carbon footprint.Currently, the Santiago airport has promoted a series of sustainable actions in terms of energy, electric mobility, biodiversity and recycling. These include the replacement of more than 10,000 LED lamps, which translates into a saving of 70% of electricity consumption; the donation of more than 600 endemic trees of the country to the municipality of Pudahuel and the reforestation of more than seven hectares with pines, quillayes and huinganes, as well as programs of recycling of glass, paper, plastic and cans.In this context, the concessionary firm Nueva Pudahuel set as objectives the additional 40% reduction of its carbon footprint by 2030 and transformed into an airport with zero carbon emissions by 2050.\l"

"COP25","India","COP25_India234","Climate Emergency CoP 25: 70% of top polluting countries failed to meet GHGs reduction target","December 20, 2019","Indian Agriculture News","December 20 -- Only six of the world's top 20 economies, or the G20, which account for 78 per cent of the global emissions, are on course to meet their targets to reduce greenhouse gas reduction (GHGs) under the Paris Agreement\~- though most of these targets are woefully unambitious.A total of 197 countries, party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), are congregating at the Conference of Parties in Madrid starting from December 2 through December 13, dubbed CoP 25, to take stock of their climate actions since the Agreement came into force in 2016 and to plan their new and more stringent targets to be announced in 2020. \~CoP 25 is a critical opportunity for countries to realign their emission trajectories with the goals set under the Paris Agreement.The Paris Agreement was the first legal instrument to set an explicit temperature target. It pushes countries to keep the average global temperature rise to below 2\'b0C over pre-industrial levels and encourages them to limit it to 1.5\'b0C. It does this largely through voluntarily agreed Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs.WATCH VIDEO: Extreme El Ni\'f1o events may double in 21st century: IPCCHowever, even if all NDC commitments are met, the global mean temperatures would still rise by 3.2\'b0C by 2100, estimates the United Nations Environment Programme's Emissions Gap Report, released in November 2019.Global emissions in 2018 totalled 55.3 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e). To limit warming to 1.5\'b0C, annual global emissions in 2030 need to be under 25 GtCO2 e while the less ambitious 2\'b0C target requires limiting emissions to 41 GtCO2e.However, even if all NDCs are met, the annual emissions in 2030 will be 54 GtCO2e. Current policies are invariably less ambitious than NDCs and will take annual emissions to almost 60 GtCO2e.\l"

"COP25","India","COP25_India237","\line ","December 19, 2019","Indian Agriculture News","When the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) introduced the concept two decades ago, it was thought that these ""large-scale discontinuities"" in the climate system were likely only if global mean temperatures increased by more than 5 \'b0C over pre-industrial levels.Recent IPCC reports, including last year's\~Global Warming of 1.5\'b0C\~and this year's\~Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate,\~suggest that tipping points could be exceeded even between 1 and 2 \'b0C of warming. This is worrying as\~we are on track to a 3.2 degree warmer world, suggests the UNEP's\~Emissions Gap Report\~released last week.Nevertheless, many politicians and even scientists assume that tipping points have a low probability of occurrence.\~\~A new article in\~Nature\~by a group of scientists summarises the evidence to challenge this notion. The article has been co-authoured by climate scientists from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, the University of Exeter in the UK, Stockholm University in Sweden, University of Copenhagen in Denmark and Australian National University in Australia.On ice, the article notes, Amundsen Sea embayment in West Antarctica may have already reached a tipping point, which could destabilise the rest of the West Antarctic ice sheet like toppling dominoes and lead to a sea-level rise of about 3 metres on a millennial timescale.Together, with similar developments in the East Antarctic and Greenland, this may already have committed the future generation to 10 metres (m) of sea-level rise. But, as the paper emphasises, despite breaching a tipping point, the pace of change, which can partially mitigate the catastrophe, is still in our hands. If warming is limited to 1.5 \'b0C, the 10 m rise could take 10,000 years to unfold, while warming of over 2 \'b0C could mean getting there in just a 1,000 years.The report addresses biosphere tipping points such as Amazonian deforestation, which can trigger abrupt carbon releases into the atmosphere, amplify climate change and reduce remaining emission budgets. Permafrost emissions could total 100 Gigatonnes (Gt), Amazon dieback emissions could be as high as 90 Gt and emissions from boreal forests a further 110 Gt.Related StoriesClimate Emergency CoP 25: Saudi Arabia to delay oil fossil fuel phase-out  Climate Emergency CoP 25: UN member states continue to default on paymentsClimate Emergency CoP 25: 70% of top polluting countries failed to meet GHGs reduction targetClimate Emergency CoP 25: India is the only major economy to be '2 degree compatible'These three phenomena could thus alone consume 60 per cent of the 500 Gt carbon budget remaining to maintain a 50 per cent chance of limiting warming to 1.5 \'b0C. While estimates of an Amazonian tipping point vary from 40 per cent deforestation to just 20 per cent forest cover loss, about 17 per cent has been lost since 1970.The paper argues that finding the precise tipping point requires understanding deforestation and climate change as interacting drivers, as well as fire and climate feedbacks as interacting tipping mechanisms.Exceeding tipping points in one system can increase the risk of crossing them in others. Thus a ""global cascade"" of such tipping points could trigger a ""global tipping point"" leading to a less habitable, ""hothouse"" climate state. Noting that such regional cascades had occurred in the geological past when only natural forces were at play, the paper makes the case for a potentially significant probability of the future global tipping point, in the backdrop of atmospheric CO2 concentration and global temperature increasing at rates that are an order of magnitude higher than those in the past.The article also claims that the case for a potential global tipping point is strengthened by the early results of studies for the IPCC's\~Sixth Assessment Report\~due to be published in 2021, which indicate a much larger climate sensitivity (the temperature response to doubling of atmospheric CO2) than in previous models.Some economists assume that climate tipping points are of very low probability and, as a result, suggest that 3 \'b0C warming is optimal from a cost-benefit perspective. The article challenges this notion and argues that as tipping points are more likely, the ""optimal policy"" recommendations of climate-economy models would require warming to be limited to 1.5 \'b0C.To scientists who argue that a global tipping point is highly speculative, the paper's authors respond that given its huge impact and irreversible nature, one must err on the side of caution. ""This is an existential threat to civilization. No amount of economic cost-benefit analysis is going to help us. We need to change our approach to the climate problem,"" the article notes.To evaluate if the world is indeed in a climate emergency, the paper defines an emergency as the product of\~risk\~and\~urgency. Urgency is the ratio between the reaction time to an alert and the intervention time left to avoid a bad outcome. A situation is an emergency if both risk and urgency are high.If the reaction time is longer than the intervention time left, we have lost control. The paper argues that the intervention time left to prevent tipping could already have shrunk towards zero, whereas the reaction time to achieve net-zero emissions is 30 years at best. Thus we might already have lost control and the world is indeed in a climate emergency.Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, one of the authors of the report, told\~The Guardian Australia\~that the formula was just the ""tip of a mathematical iceberg"" in defining the climate emergency. He argued: ""It can be illustrated by the Titanic disaster... Yet there are options to avoid the disaster."" Noting that little time was left to act, Schellnhuber warned that beyond the critical point ""only some sort of adaptation option is left, such as moving the Titanic passengers into rescue boats (if available).""\l"

But as the climate emergency builds closer to social tipping points, there is a danger that progress toward long-standing social ideals is undone. The UNFCCC process recognises these truths, which is why a Work Programme on Gender was initiated at the Lima Conference (CoP 20) in 2014.In 2016, at CoP 22 in Marrakech, countries adopted a decision to extend the work programme for three years. It underscored the importance of aligning gender-responsive climate policies with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted by United Nations member countries in 2015.The fifth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG5) specifically calls for Gender Equality. This includes some general goals - ""end all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere"" - and some specific ones, for example: ""Eiminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation""; ""Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights [.]""; ""Undertake reforms to give women equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, financial services, inheritance and natural resources""The decision at CoP 22 in Marrakech also laid out some climate-specific action points for countries: Appoint and provide support for a national gender focal point for climate negotiations, implementation and monitoring Increase the representation and active participation of women in the bodies established under the Convention Mainstream a gender perspective in the enhancement of climate technology development and transfer Integrate local and traditional knowledge in the formulation of climate policy and to recognize the value of the participation of grassroots women in gender-responsive climate action at all levelsProgress on these latter action points was supposed to be reviewed at CoP 25 this year. On December 9, 2019, at the beginning of the 'political' week of the CoP, the chair of the technical body discussing this issue handed it over to the political negotiators, noting that no consensus was found. This is a surprising and troubling development.There was an inexplicably specific disagreement regarding how to refer to the 2030 Agenda within a CoP decision on gender - whether cohering climate policies with the 2030 Agenda ""can improve"", ""will improve"", ""will contribute to improving"" or ""can contribute to improving"" a gender-just transition.Representatives from African and South American countries pushed for the stronger language, with the United States, Canada, European Union (EU) and Australia pushing back. The Canadian representative pointed out at one stage that this was a debate over semantics, but it did not seem to produce consensus.In addition, developing countries wanted to discuss the question of ""direct access"" - transferring money from funds like the Green Climate Fund and Adaptation Fund directly to organisations operating at ground-level. There is a feeling among developing countries that more sub-national organisations need to be authorised (by the Funds) for such ""direct access"", including grassroots organisations focused on gender.This builds on a trend at CoP 25 of developing countries emphasising finance in every discussion. It is a development born out of too many broken promises by developed countries on finance, and finance is justifiably discussable under the stated agenda on gender. But developed countries including the EU and the US pushed back strongly, arguing that a separate finance agenda item was available for that debate.The upshot of these disagreements is that - despite the Paris Agreement stating that countries ""should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their respective obligations on [.] gender equality"" - a forward-looking work programme on gender is on the verge of falling off the agenda in Madrid.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Down to Earth.

The EIB is set to provide EUR 26m to support the Solar Storm 200 project, which includes the construction of 15 solar photovoltaic power plants in Spain. The agreement was signed today at the EU bank's COP25 stand by EIB Vice-President Emma Navarro and IM2 Energ\'eda Solar CEO Enrique Selva, and is supported by the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), the main pillar of the Investment Plan for Europe (the Juncker Plan).The 15 new photovoltaic power plants will have a total capacity of 218 MW and will be located in four autonomous communities: Extremadura, Andalusia, the Valencia Region and Murcia. Their installation will prevent the release of 116 000 tonnes of CO2 a year, 400 people will be employed for their construction and a further 20 permanent jobs will be created.The operation has an innovative structure that will see the EU bank investing in a platform for developing renewable energy projects for the first time. This agreement will make the EIB an equity partner of Solar Storm 200, the sustainable investment vehicle via which IM2 has planned the development and construction of this infrastructure in Spain. This is a flagship project for IM2, a company with 16 years of experience in the photovoltaic sector with offices in Spain and Chile, and that works with both investment projects and high-power industrial self-consumption projects.This agreement will enable Solar Storm to be launched as the investment platform of Umbrella Capital - IM2 Energ\'eda Solar's holding company - with an Independent Power Producer (IPP) focus and becoming a renewable power producer. In addition to the EIB investment, Solar Storm 200 is backed by the commercial banking sector via project finance.The EIB and climate actionThe EIB is among the world's largest multilateral providers of climate finance. The Bank's goal is to be a leader in mobilising the finance needed to keep global warming under 2degC and to limit the temperature increase to 1.5degC in order to meet the Paris Agreement objectives. On 14 November, the EIB Board of Directors approved its roadmap to consolidate its position as the EU climate bank, together with the new energy lending policy. The core components of these agreements are: the EIB Group's commitment to mobilise at least EUR 1tn in climate and environment investment over the next decade from 2021 to 2030; to this end , the Bank will gradually increase the financing it dedicates to these objectives to represent 50% of its financing by 2025. It also announced its intention to align all EIB Group activities with the Paris Agreement. To this end, the EIB will cease financing fossil fuel-based projects from late 2021.In 2018, the EIB provided almost EUR 1.3bn to support climate action in Spain by financing projects involving the development of cleaner means of transport and implementation of new, less polluting and more environmentally friendly production processes.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Pivotal Sources.

"COP25","India","COP25_India250","\line ","December 19, 2019","Indian Agriculture News","The imperative of transformation and the idea of net zero targets by 2050 should not mean that governments get the liberty to delay domestic action to mitigate emissions; or to design another cheap and convoluted market-based system so that rich countries can buy their way out of the climate crisis.The fact remains that climate impacts are affecting the poor today. As temperatures increase, they will hit us all - climate change is a great leveller. Without cooperation based on equity, climate change action will not be effective or ambitious. CSE would like to remind governments of the need for both ambition and equity in the negotiations.What is clear is that climate change is happening, and a climate emergency is upon us. The poor, particularly farmers in the countries of the South, who are not responsible for the stock of emissions in the atmosphere, are the worst-hit. They are the victims of climate change.In India, official figures reveal that 2,405 people died due to extreme weather events in 2018-19. Dust storms in northern India linked to global weather patterns killed over 500 in 2018.Intense heat spikes in northern India have been making the ground dry, exacerbating a flood-drought cycle which is playing havoc with the livelihoods of subsistence farmers.The impact is also visible in Africa, where the predominantly rain-fed agriculture is very vulnerable to climate change. The entire continent is experiencing rising temperatures and reducing precipitation, which could make it more food-insecure.We also know that the impact of extreme weather events is not limited to a short period as they cripple lives, destroy livelihoods, and extinguish the development dividend.What we would like to state unambiguously is that the world is NOT ON TRACK to stay below 1.5\'b0C - seen as the guardrail, as temperature increase beyond this will spiral the world out of control.Related StoriesNo climate equity in Commonwealth; poor nations doing lot more for mitigation\~  Climate Emergency CoP 25: Large sections of western media insensitive to equity questionBut that is not the bad news. The bad news is that countries are not even close to meeting the weak and unambitious NDCs that they have set for themselves. According to the same UNEP report, current emissions are way above this and many G20 countries are unlikely to meet the targets.Countries must raise their ambition and the NDC targets due next year must be set consistent with at least a 2\'b0C trajectory, if not a 1.5\'b0C trajectory - but these targets must be based on equity and climate justice.Past consumption has been highly iniquitous with developed countries having consumed a disproportionate share of the carbon pie. CSE's analysis of the past and future carbon budgets finds that only China will increase its share of the carbon budget by 2030; there will be nothing left for the rest of the world - by 2030, at current rates of emissions, the carbon budget to keep the world below 1.5\'b0C will be exhausted. What then happens to the right to development of the rest of the countries of the South?CSE is also deeply concerned that the current discussions on net zero targets and its corresponding market mechanism could delay the much-needed domestic action and also lead the world to designing (once again) a convoluted market mechanism, which will look for cheap mitigation options in the developing world. This would be disastrous.The world has run out of time and space and needs transformative solutions. The market mechanism must be designed to promote high-cost and transformative actions and not lock the world into creative carbon fudging once again.The mistakes of the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which flooded the market with cheap carbon credits, must not be repeated. CSE is demanding that credits should only be created for expensive mitigation solutions, which cost more than a defined threshold - say $100-150 per tonne of CO2 abatement.This will ensure that only genuinely challenging projects which involve meaningful technology transfer to developing countries will take place. It will also mitigate the risk of developing countries selling off their cheaper mitigation options and then being left with only expensive options to meet their own targets.The net zero carbon emissions targets of countries - set to allow countries to emit and to take out of the atmosphere through forest sequestration and other technologies the excess of their domestic emissions - must not end up delaying domestic action; countries should not be led to believe that they can use technology to mop up the excess.This is just not acceptable. The net zero target must be designed to allow countries to undertake drastic action domestically to reduce emissions and then, if there is a gap, to buy high-cost transformative emission reduction from the developing world.The bottom l"

It pushes countries to keep the average global temperature rise to below 2degC over pre-industrial levels and encourages them to limit it to 1.5degC . It does this largely through voluntarily agreed Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs.WATCH VIDEO : Extreme El Nno events may double in 21st century: IPCCHowever, even if all NDC commitments are met, the global mean temperatures would still rise by 3.2degC by 2100, estimates the United Nations Environment Programme's Emissions Gap Report, released in November 2019.Global emissions in 2018 totalled 55.3 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e). To limit warming to 1.5degC, annual global emissions in 2030 need to be under 25 GtCO2 e while the less ambitious 2degC target requires limiting emissions to 41 GtCO2e.However, even if all NDCs are met, the annual emissions in 2030 will be 54 GtCO2e. Current policies are invariably less ambitious than NDCs and will take annual emissions to almost 60 GtCO2e.Most of the gap is due to a complete lack of ambition in most countries' NDCs. The question of meeting the Paris Agreement is usually reduced to whether countries are on track to meet the first round of NDCs, which were announced in 2015. The Agreement requires countries to declare new, progressively ambitious targets every five years and the second round of NDCs are due in 2020.However, most countries are found wanting in meeting the first set of NDCs. Of the G20, which includes 19 countries and the EU, seven will fail to meet their NDCs, three are on track, three will exceed their target by at least 15 per cent, and the performance of three countries is uncertain, estimates the 2019 Emissions Gap Report.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Down to Earth.

Such an arrangement, if agreed to by countries, can open up the possibility of the Paris Agreement and an extended Kyoto Protocol running simultaneously.The minister emphasised on the need of developed countries to honour what was promised within Kyoto Protocol's second commitment process. It has not been ratified as an adequate number of developed countries have not signed it yet. Thus, it is not legally binding and does not make it imperative for signatories to implement what they promised years ago.Javadekar, however, reminded them about the historical emission cut commitments of developed countries and pointed out that India was not ready to forget the agenda though its scheduled closure was only a year away.""We will not allow to forget it, these (commitments of developed countries) are historical responses based on historical responsibility and Kyoto Protocol parties should take the responsibility,"" he said.Several climate experts, however, feel that such an arrangement would add to the confusion and might lead to double accounting of emission cuts.""India is trying to get value of the unsold few million certified emission reduction (CER) certificates, prepared under the clean development mechanism (CDM) of Kyoto but remained untraded due to very low carbon value in market ... which will be only possible if the demand is generated under Kyoto protocol once it is extended,"" a climate analyst said.""The other option is to allow those CERs carrying forward to Paris regime, which is likely to be countered by most countries excepting Brazil and 'like-minded developing countries' such as China, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines among others.""The entire system is geared up to initiate Paris emission cut regime.

It's like India trying to get in a bus which has long left,"" another analyst said.The first phase of the Kyoto Protocol, the only legally binding agreement on climate action the world had before the Paris Agreement,\~was adopted in 1997 to fight global warming by reducing greenhouse gases emission only by developed countries. It came into effect in 2005.After the first set of commitments ended in 2012, a second set was agreed to for 2013-2020 during the Doha climate summit. Several countries, particularly from Europe, promised emission cut targets. But without ratification, it went to the back burner and the carbon market nosedived, keeping several billion emission trading certificates untraded.Javadekar also said India was among the top five countries in implementing the Paris Agreement.

This limit is called the carbon budget or the emissions budget.In 2014, the IPCC had estimated that the carbon budget was 2,900 Gigatonnes (GT). This carbon budget was from pre-industrial times to the end of the 21st century.But by 2017, the world had already emitted 2,200 GT or about three-fourths of this budget. To avoid breaching the 1.5degC mark, the world can emit only 420-570 GT till century-end.Historically, the US and the EU (28) usurped most this carbon budget. Americans, some 4.3 per cent of the world population, caused 25% of historical emissions (1751-2017). The EU, which consists of 6.8 per cent of the world population, caused 22 per cent of the emissions (1751-2017).However, India, which houses nearly 18 per cent of the world population, had emitted only 3 per cent.

To do so, the Vice-President of the EU bank Emma Navarro and the President of Iberdrola Ignacio Galan agreed two loans for a total of EUR 690m.Of the EUR 690m total, EUR 250m will go to financing the construction of 15 wind farms to be developed in the country by Neoenergia, the Iberdrola subsidiary in Brazil. These new facilities will be located in three states in the north east: Para\'edba, Bah\'eda and Piau\'ed. Once operational, they will have a total installed power of 520 MW and produce an annual average of 2 300 GWh of clean energy. Commissioning these wind farms will help to reduce CO? emissions and increase the proportion of renewable energy in the country's electricity generation. The investments in these new wind farms will be made over a five-year period and will enable the creation of 2 300 jobs.The EIB is granting this financing under the Latin America lending mandate 2014-2020, meaning that the agreement is covered by the EU budget guarantee. By supporting this project, the EU bank is helping to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations. The EIB has been working in Latin America for some 30 years and one of the major priorities in the region is to promote climate action.Smart electricity networks in SpainThe EU bank and Iberdrola have also joined forces to develop digitalisation of infrastructure essential to the decarbonisation of the economy: the electricity distribution networks. To do so, they have agreed a EUR 440m loan to finance new investments in Spain for infrastructure to help improve the reliability of the network and the quality of supply.These networks are key to the energy transition, as they enable the integration of more renewables, sustainable mobility, smart cities and decentralised consumption. Transforming the networks into smart infrastructure that is more reliable and more secure puts consumers at the centre of the business, giving them greater decision-making power and connectivity.The EIB and climate actionThe EIB is among the world's largest multilateral providers of climate finance.

In the letter, Senator Murray sounded the alarm on the dangerous, growing impacts of the climate crisis and the damage that will be inflicted on current and future generations unless immediate action is taken. Senator Murray also warned the President against ceding U.S. leadership on this issue, and admonished him for failing to honor his commitment to work with Democrats to renegotiate the Paris Climate Accord or to craft a new deal to address the climate crisis. The letter comes as the 25th United Nations takes place in Madrid this week.Senator Murray wrote, As the second largest global emitter of greenhouse gases, and the largest historical emitter, it is imperative that the United States assume our rightful place as a global leader in the fight to combat climate change, yet with this action you are ceding American leadership to other nations at great political and economic costs.Additionally, the letter emphasized the national security implications related to the Presidents withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord, underscoring the damage done to the United States reputation by going back on an international commitment. Senator Murrays letter further illustrates the outcry from Washingtonians and Americans across various sectors, including the business community, citing more than 2,200 U.S. businesses including major companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Starbucks.

"COP25","India","COP25_India261","Japan's 2018 greenhouse emissions lowest in two decades","December 11, 2019 Wednesday","IANS-English","Tokyo, Nov 29 (IANS) Japan in 2018 recorded its lowest greenhouse gas emissions in two decades thanks to a warm winter and increased generation of nuclear power, according to data released on Friday. However, the country still has a long way to go to reach its Paris Agreement goal, Efe news reported. In 2018, total carbon dioxide emissions were recorded at 1.24 billion tons, a year-on-year decrease of 3.6 per cent and the lowest figure since data compilation began in 1990, according to the preliminary figures released by the Japanese Ministry of Environment. The previous low was recorded in 2009 with 1.25 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. Although this is the fifth consecutive year of dropping emissions, the ministry acknowledged that a lot remained to be done to achieve the 2030 goal of 26 percent cut in emissions from the 2013 levels a target set under the Paris climate agreement. From 2013 to 2018, Japan's cumulative reduction in greenhouse gas emissions has been 11.8 percent, according to the government's figures published a week before the 2019 United Nations in Madrid. The government said the main factors that contributed to the reduction were the decreasing production in power stations that use fossil fuels and gradual return to energy generation through nuclear plants. Japan established a stricter safety framework following a nuclear standstill after the 2011 Fukushima accident. Although the approval to reactivate was given in 2017, it was not until 2018 that the plants started functioning. Household emissions fell by 10 percent in 2018 due to increased use of energy-saving appliances and a warm winter which led to lower usage of heating systems during the season. However, an increased use of air conditioners caused a 9.4 percent rise in hydroflurocarbon emissions and other similar compounds. The Japanese government aims to tackle this problem by introducing new regulations in 2020 to strengthen control over the disposal of hydroflurocarbon-using equipment. --IANS sdr/ \l"
"COP25","India","COP25_India262","Climate Emergency CoP 25: Circumventing climate action","December 10, 2019 Tuesday","Down To Earth","India, Dec. 10 -- For countries like India to have cleaner futures, climate agreements must walk the talk; not just talk the talkAnother Conference of Parties (CoP 25); this time in Madrid . But with a difference. This time, there is near consensus that climate change is real .Everyone now believes that it is time to act. No more procrastination. Or so, you would think.The fact is in Madrid, new games are being played out to circumvent action - or at least to find ways to do as little as possible and as cheaply as possible. The new buzzword is to develop credible market mechanisms, which are needed to make countries carbon-neutral, or net zero . Big and nice sounding words. But as they say there is many a slip between the cup and the lip.In climate negotiations, I have found that laudable-sounding ideas often end up with convoluted agreements that just don't add up. In fact, it is business as usual. You just find that out later, when the dust has settled.Take, for instance, what happened in CoP 21 in Paris in 2015. The mood was ecstatic; a new deal was struck. All countries agreed to take on mitigation commitments. These ""targets"", called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), were arrived at after much confabulation. It was also decided that the objective of NDCs would be to keep the world below the danger mark of 1.5degC increase in temperature from pre-industrial times.But now the ""success"" of Paris is unravelling. According to the United Nationa Environmental Programme's Emissions Gap Report 2019, even if all countries do what they had agreed in the NDCs, global temperature would increase by 3.2degC by 2100.Not only that, countries - particularly the already rich who have disproportionately used up the carbon budget - are not even doing what they have agreed to do. For instance, according to German-based Climate Tracker, the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia's actions are 4degC compatible; China, Japan are 3-4degC; and, even the European Union's actions are insufficient - 2-3degC compatible.This simply means that if all countries followed this rate of emissions, then the temperature would rise between 2-4degC by the end of the century. Let's then get real. Not enough is happening to combat greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and this is when millions out there still need to secure their right to basic energy security.Given this reality, net zero sounds like a really good idea. What this means is that countries will stay below their target - that is they will emit GHG emissions, but they will find ways of soaking up or burying the emissions so that in their balance sheet, they are net zero.So, how does this great carbon soak-up-burial work? One, emission sums would calculate the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) sequestered in trees; what is emitted and how much is absorbed. Then, there are new technologies (still mostly on the drawing board), which would suck tonnes of CO 2 from the atmosphere and bury it deep underground.This would mean countries can now plan, not just to cut emissions, which is turning out to be more difficult than they imagined, but to continue emitting and then clean up. They can also buy credits - invest in carbon-friendly projects in other countries - and add them to their balance sheet.This is where the discussion on markets becomes critical. It is also a fact that planting trees in vast villages of Africa or Asia is much cheaper than in Europe or Japan. In our world, there are still low-hanging fruits - cheaper options to cut emissions. So, markets are being designed so that there can be investment (that's a sweet word) in developing countries for carbon capture and credits.For most of us who have worked in this contentious climate territory, these are familiar terms - in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) started with the same lofty ideas of paying for technology transitions in the developing world, but soon deteriorated to become the cheap and convoluted and even corrupt development mechanism.This time after Paris, all countries, not just the already industrialised, have to undertake emission reductions domestically. Therefore, if India, for instance, ""sells"" off its cheap emission reduction options to a rich country, how will it take on the real cuts that the world needs. Let's remember, this is a crisis for everyone - if the poor are impacted today, even the rich will be hit tomorrow as temperatures increase.So, what should be done? There is nothing wrong with setting a net zero target, per se . But the objective should be to incentivise countries to do more at home and then to buy whatever remains through global trading systems. But this means setting a base price on carbon trading - below this rate (say $100-150 per tonne) projects would not qualify.This would mean that only those projects would be funded that would be transformational, and not transitional, in the developing world. Countries like India could leapfrog to much cleaner futures. We could avoid first polluting and then cleaning up. This is the future we seek. But for this to happen, for once, climate agreements must walk the talk; not just talk the talk.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Down to Earth.

Thousands of East Africans have been displaced in the wake of heavy rains that have battered the region since October, and more wet weather is expected due to an Indian Ocean Dipole attributed to the warming of the ocean.Such extreme weather events should galvanise Africans; their governments are spending 2% of GDP on climate related disasters, said Anthony Nyong, Director for Climate Change and Green Growth at the African Development Bank. He encouraged the global community to remain steadfast in finding effective solutions to climate change.The annual negotiations are now in their 25th year.The global community, and in particular Africa has a lot to offer in terms of solutions; what is evidently lacking is the global political will to turn potential into wealth to serve humanity and the planet, said Nyong, who led the Banks delegation to the UN conference.At the conference, African delegates pushed for support for climate finance to build resilience against the impact of climate change and for special consideration for Africa around targets contained in the treaties under discussion.The discussions at COP 25 centred around the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, which calls on countries to cut carbon emissions to ensure that global temperatures do not rise by more than 2C by the end of this century, while attempting to contain it within 1.5C. The conference ended with a declaration on the urgent need to close the gap between existing emissions pledges and the temperature goals of the Paris agreement.The African Development Bank attended the conference to lend strategic support to its regional member countries in the negotiations.Nyong pointed out that Africa is committed; 51 of the 54 African countries have already ratified their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement signed at the landmark COP21 in Paris. The NDCs are specific climate change targets that each country must set.Support for the Bank-funded Desert to Power project highlighted Africas determination to strive for a climate-friendly world, especially for its local populations, said Nyong. Desert to Power is a $20 billion initiative to deploy solar energy solutions across the entire Sahel region, generating 10,000 MW to provide 250 million people with clean electricity.The African Development Bank stands ready as ever to assist its regional member countries to build resilience against climate change, as indicated by the Banks decision to join the Alliance for Hydromet Development, announced at COP 25. The Alliance will assist developing countries to build resilience against the impact of natural disasters caused by extreme weather, Nyong said.The Bank will also continue to drive initiatives to strengthen the ability of regional member countries to advocate robustly at global forums such as COP 25, Nyong added. One example was the Banks participation at the annual African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) and support for the Africa Group of Negotiations (AGN).We look forward to engaging further with regional member countries and other parties to ensure that the continents development agenda remains on track, Nyong added.Leaders and institutions from 196 nations plus the European Union, who have signed up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, attended the conference in Madrid.\l"

But there seemed little hope due to pressure from the United States-led develop countries bloc.The demand has been a key negotiation agenda along with settlement of new market mechanism under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement from the beginning of the Madrid CoP.\~The issue pitch-forked to the front as part of a review this year of the existing Warsaw Institutional Mechanism (WIM) for Loss and Damage.The mechanism was set up at the 2013 Warsaw CoP under pressure from developing countries to address climate liability of developed countries in addressing the damages already incurred by developing and vulnerable countries.The US-led group, however, kept it from becoming a financial instrument, fearing it would open a Pandora's box. Not having a dedicated funding mechanism associated with 'loss and damage' will be like a car without fuel, developing and vulnerable countries have always argued.The final draft, released at 4.50 am, by Simon Stiell (Grenada) with Minister Ola Elvestuen (Norway) recognised ""the urgency of enhancing the mobilisation of action and support, including finance, technology and capacity building"". It added long-term and non-economic damages under the category, a long term demand of the climate workers.\~The draft sought an expert group to be set up in 2020; a 'Santiago network' to catalyse technical support; developed countries to scale up finance; and Green Climate Fund to provide financial support.""It is marginally better than before but still far less than it should have been. There is much more reference to available finance than generating new finance. It hardly makes sense as available finance is found inadequate to support existing requirements like mitigation and adaptation, agendas other than loss and damage"" said Harjeet Singh, global lead of climate change in Actionaid and a 'loss and damage' expert.""Rich countries responsible for climate change, particularly the US, Australia and Japan, are using every opportunity to water down proposals (of financial linkage),"" he added.""Developed countries have always been trying to stop financial access through loss and damage but least developed countries will continue to put pressure. I still would like to believe that something concrete on loss and damage will emerge in Madrid declaration,"" said Saleemul Haque, a senior negotiation tracker and advisor of least developed countries.An Indian expert explained the relevance of loss and damage in India's perspective: ""Take the recent cyclone that devastated Sundarban in southern fringe of state of West Bengal in India - It is well known that Sundarban, spread across India and Bangladesh, is a hotbed of climate change and has been repeatedly affected by extreme weather events in recent time,"" the expert said.""The latest cyclone, named one of the six biggest cyclones in 2019 by World Metrological Organisation in Madrid , caused financial loss in tune of Rs 23,000 crore.

The EIB, which has expanded its climate action to become the EU climate bank, will provide EUR 66m to financing and investment bank Natixis to support the implementation of two photovoltaic solar energy projects in Spain. Both projects will help Spain reach its goal of ensuring that 42% of the energy it uses comes from renewable sources by 2030, as set out in the National Energy Plan. The agreement was signed at COP25 by the EIB Vice-President responsible for climate action, Emma Navarro, and Natixis most senior representative in Spain, Jean-Philippe Adam.Eight solar power plants in Extremadura, Aragn and Castilla y LenFirstly, the EIB will provide EUR 25m to Natixis to build eight solar power plants with a capacity of 254 MW. It will generate 438 GWh of electricity a year from photovoltaic energy, avoiding the release of 204 000 tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. Three of these plants will be in the municipality of Tordesillas, in Valladolid. Three further plants will be built in Salamanca (two in Valdelosa and one in Palacios del Arzobispo), another in the municipality of Casatejada in Cceres, and lastly one in Huesca, in the municipality of Poleino. The project involves employing 400 people during the implementation phase and 50 on a permanent basis.The plants are owned by Solaria Energa y Medio Ambiente S.A, which is also the developer, builder and operator. Solaria is a Spanish company specialised in the photovoltaic sector, and was among the successful bidders in the auction for new renewable electrical energy production facilities held in Spain in July 2017.Solar power in AndalusiaThe second solar power project supported by the EIB will be in Alcal de Guadaira, Seville, with the EU bank providing EUR 41m to Natixis to finance its construction. The project promoter is Spanish company Novasol Invest La Isla, which is located in Seville and was also a successful bidder in the 2017 renewable energy auction.This complex will have a total capacity of over 182 MW and will be capable of generating 341 GWh of electricity a year without producing polluting emissions of any kind, while helping to prevent the release of 127 000 tonnes of CO2. The project will also have a positive impact on jobs, as it will make it possible to employ 300 people in Andalusia during the implementation phase and 40 on a permanent basis to operate the plant.At the signing ceremony during the COP25 Climate Change Conference at IFEMA in Madrid, EIB Vice-President Emma Navarro, who is responsible for the Bank's climate action and its activities in Spain, highlighted the positive impact of both projects on helping to achieve the EU's climate targets, ambitious goals to which the EIB will make a substantial contribution by mobilising up to EUR 1tn in financing to promote the transition to a new economic model. Spain is being asked to play a key role in the transition to a low-carbon economy. Projects like this demonstrate the direct positive impact of EIB activity on investments promoting clean energy in our country, while also helping to create jobs.Head of Natixis in Spain Jean Philippe Adam pointed out the important role of the financing in combating climate change, and Natixis active contribution to financing renewable assets across the globe. Natixis is the first financial company to actively manage the climate impact of its balance sheet, incorporating an unprecedented mechanism measuring the climate impact of each asset by applying a Green Weighting Factor.The EIB and climate actionThe EIB is among the world's largest multilateral providers of climate finance. The Bank's goal is to be a leader in mobilising the finance needed to keep global warming to under 2 ?C and limit temperature rises to 1.5 ?C to meet the Paris Agreement objectives. On 14 November, the EIB Board of Directors approved its new climate objectives and the new energy lending policy. The Bank will gradually increase its financing for climate and environmental objectives up to 50% by 2025, with the goal of ensuring that the EIB Group mobilises at least EUR 1tn by 2030 to promote investments helping to meet these objectives. It also announced its intention to align all EIB Group activities with the Paris Agreement. To this end, the EIB will cease financing fossil fuel-based projects from late 2021.In 2018, the EIB provided almost EUR 1.3bn to support climate action in Spain by financing projects involving the development of cleaner means of transport and implementation of new, less polluting and more environmentally friendly production processes.Natixis is a French multinational financial services firm specialised in asset and wealth management, corporate and investment banking, insurance and payments.

As Taiwan's foremost sustainability leader, Ko is ready to share O'right's revolutionary green practices with the rest of the world.This past September, Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate-change activist and Fridays for Future founder, opened the United Nations Climate Action Summit, with world leaders convening in New York in an effort to jump start action on climate change. At the summit, many condemned world leaders for failing to take strong measures to combat climate change.O'right, however, strongly supports the Fridays for Future movement. In fact, this fall, O'right joined forces with the Taiwan Youth Climate Coalition (TWYCC) for ""Stand Up for Future!"", an event to encourage youth action on climate change and to inspire passersby to take a stand and speak up for the planet.Ko himself continues to stress the urgency of dealing with climate change and believes that young people need to be heard. Leading by example, Ko began promoting sustainability programs in elementary schools across Taiwan in March in the hopes of raising environmental awareness among teachers and students. Ko has also championed a ""Climate Leader"" program that aims to inspire a new generation of green ambassadors.This December, Ko will stand alongside DuPont Biomaterials and other industrial leaders who are active in the circular economy field in order to share O'right's journey towards becoming an even more progressive green beauty brand by reducing marine plastics at the source.In addition to its pioneering position in raising the standard for sustainability and its efforts to move towards a more circular economy, O'right also introduced the world's first 100% renewable plastic shampoo bottle and renewable plastic pump in 2016 and 2018, respectively. Recently, O'right obtained the respected USDA Certified Biobased Product Label, which displays the biobased content of a product that comes from a renewable source.Ko understands that being ""organic"" does not guarantee sustainability. Therefore, the best, and ultimate, way to move closer towards sustainability is to achieve ""zero-environmental impact."" With sustainability efforts that have already achieved an impressive 80% reduction in carbon emissions, O'right is dedicated to developing sustainable solutions that lead the way in the worldwide beauty industry while ensuring that its brand continues to contribute to a better world-for people, society, and the environment.""We aspire to be great instead of big, which means taking giant innovative leaps to make a lasting impact,"" Ko emphasized.

""This market mechanism is usually the warmest negotiation because the use of market mechanisms in achieving the Paris Agreement is very dynamic,"" said Wamen Alue.""There are countries that agree, but there are also those who disagree. We hope that COP 25 will have clarity regarding the mechanism,"" added the Deputy Minister.Article 6 of the Paris Agreement aims to promote an integrated, holistic and balanced approach that will assist a country's government in implementing their National Determination Contribution (NDC) through voluntary international cooperation. This cooperation mechanism, if well designed, will facilitate the achievement of reduction targets and increase a country's ambitions to increase carbon emissions. Specifically, Article 6 can also form a policy foundation for emissions trading systems, which can help lead to global prices for carbon.Deputy Alue also stressed that efforts to tackle climate change must be implemented immediately because it involves risks that will be experienced by several countries, especially small island countries in the Pacific.Indonesia added that the Deputy Minister is also an archipelago country with more than 13 thousand small islands, therefore Indonesia will also focus on tackling climate change because it could be that the islands in Indonesia will experience many problems due to rising global temperatures which cause our sea levels to rise.""It means we will support the efforts of small island countries to jointly fight to suppress the temperature rise of 1.5 degrees so that they can be achieved together,"" the Deputy MinisterThen in soft diplomacy, certainly a number of world figures are scheduled to be speakers at the Indonesian Pavilion. Among those that have been confirmed is Al Gore, the former Vice President of the United States who, together with the intergovernmental panel on climate change, was once awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.Besides Al Gore, another world figure who will be present is Professor Nicholas Stern, an economist, author of the book 'The Economics of Climate Change', which is a global reference book in calculating the effects of climate change in the economic paradigm. There is also Professor Jeffrey Sachs, an American economist who has a lot of thoughts on poverty alleviation.The presence of world leaders will have a positive impact on Indonesia's soft diplomacy at the climate change conference. The world leaders will bring a mass that will ultimately increase public attention at the Indonesian Pavilion which means also to the concrete actions that have been taken by the Government of Indonesia in efforts to combat climate change.\l"

African Development Bank presents update on Adaptation Benefits Mechanism","December 18, 2019 Wednesday","TendersInfo","Three decades ago, renewable energy was considered too futuristic. The idea of plugging a car into a wall socket was unthinkable.Today, both these things are a reality. And renewable energy is expected to attract $2.3 trillion in investment this year. The same will be true in the next phase of the worlds response to climate change for adaptation, said Luc Gnacadja, chair of the recently formed interim Executive Committee of the Adaptation Benefits Mechanism (ABM).ABM is groundbreaking. The continent where ABM should start is rightfully Africa, because it has the highest vulnerability, the poorest communities and the most development challenges, while having benefitted least from climate finance. I hope that COP 25 recognizes its importance and gives it a place in the implementation of the Paris Agreement as the only cooperative approach for adaptation proposed so far, Gnacadja told delegates at the COP 25 climate conference in Madrid.The ABM aims to mobilize public and private sector finance to assist developing countries with meeting climate change needs for adaptation set out in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, in particular those requiring international cooperation.The design of the ABM methodologies and theory of change must be welcoming for SMEs and micro enterprises. Despite the focus on Africa, the ABM EC will seriously consider opening its services to the rest of the world during the pilot phase, as there is already interest from other regions and ABM is potentially applicable in all countries, Gnacadja said.The African Development Bank established the interim Executive Committee of the ABM on 4 October. The ABM Executive Committee had adopted an ambitious work plan for 2020, prioritizing guidance on methodologies to determine adaptation benefits and incremental costs of ABM projects.Giving monetary value to adaptation will go a long way to crowding in investments that will increasingly build resilience in least developed countries and small island developing states in Africa, said Anthony Nyong, Director for Climate Change and Green Growth after the session.The African Development Banks financing for climate mitigation and adaptation action reached parity in 2018, a first among development finance institutions.

The EU bank and the public promotional bank of the Brazilian State Minas Gerais, Banco De Desenvolvimento De Minas Gerais (BDMG), have signed a memorandum of understanding to reinforce the cooperation between the two institutions.This new agreement signed with BDMG aims at sharing experiences and best practices in areas and sectors of common interest, thus fostering financial cooperation in Brazil between the two institutions. The EIB will support BDMG in its goal to promote sustainable economic and social development in the State of Minas Gerais by facilitating investments in both the public and private sectors.In October this year, the two entities joined forces to support climate action projects in Brazil. Thanks to agreement, the EIB facilitated EUR 100 m to boost climate investments in this Brazilian State, contributing to an increased production of renewable and clean energy while securing energy supply. Part of this EIB financing is going to be dedicated to supporting energy efficiency projects, especially in public buildings, street lighting, and industrial facilities.The EIB, a key player in Latin AmericaThe EU is the main development partner of the Latin America region, its number one investor and its second-largest trading partner. As the EU bank, the EIB supports the EU's relationship with Latin America by financing projects that contribute to the EU's external policy objectives: the development of economic, environmental and social infrastructure; private sector development; and climate change mitigation and adaptation.Climate change mitigation and adaptation is the EIB's main priority in the region, where projects supported by the EU bank focus on the environment, and especially on boosting renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable public transport schemes. Climate change adaptation-related projects involve upgrading existing infrastructure to be more resilient in the face of more volatile and unpredictable weather patterns, preparing it for direct and indirect impacts. In 2018, the EIB stepped up its contribution to sustainable development and climate action in Latin America, providing EUR 640m to finance 15 operations: that is the highest number of EIB operations structured in one year in the region.The EIB and climate crisisThe EIB is among the world's largest multilateral providers of climate finance. The Bank's goal is to be a leader in mobilising the finance needed to keep global warming to under 2 ?C and limit temperature rises to 1.5 ?C to meet the Paris Agreement objectives. On 14 November, the EIB Board of Directors approved its new climate objectives and the new energy lending policy. The Bank will gradually increase its financing for climate and environmental objectives up to 50% by 2025, to ensure that the EIB Group mobilises at least EUR 1 trillion by 2030 to promote investments helping to meet these objectives. It also announced its intention to align all EIB Group activities with the Paris Agreement. To this end, the EIB will cease financing fossil fuel-based projects from late 2021.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Pivotal Sources.

In tribal belief systems and popular folklore, it is a metaphor of mother earth, said Shyam. The painting depicts cutting of tree and its impact. ""I drew the painting to highlight the sustained abuse of natural resources, cutting of trees and its adverse impact that is leading us into a climate crisis,"" he added. Officials from Madhya Pradesh tourism and Tribal Museum in Bhopal guided Shyam through the process. His art work has been displayed globally. Shyam is the nephew of one of the best known Gond artists, Jangan Singh Shyam, who was awarded the Shikhar Samman, the highest state honour for artistic excellence, in the 1990s when he was only 30. Within last four decades, Gond art has transformed from being storytellers who recited folklore and drew on mud to preservable sheets in galleries across the world. The transformation was spearheaded by J Swaminathan, who was instrumental in establishment of the Bharat Bhawan. ""Gonds were primarily storytellers of their folklore and drew on the floor.

The project is sponsored by Encavis AG, a leading independent producer of renewable energy, and Solarcentury, a global integrated solar power company, and comprises the construction and operation of a 300 MWp photovoltaic solar plant in the cohesion region of Extremadura, more specifically in the municipality of Talayuela. The transaction is supported by the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), the main pillar of the Investment Plan for Europe, also known as the Juncker Plan.At 300MWp, the Talayuela Solar plant will be one of the most powerful solar projects in Europe, capable of producing enough energy to power around 150,000 households per year at a very competitive price. Moreover, the project will contribute to reducing CO2 emission by more than 171 kt CO2-e/year and approximately 400 people will be employed during the construction phase.EIB Vice-President Emma Navarro, who is responsible for climate action at the Bank and for operations in Spain, said: As shown throughout COP 25, the EIB is highly committed to delivering on the fight against global warming. As the EU Climate Bank, we are ready to step up to the challenge. For this reason, we are pleased to support Spains huge renewable energy potential and help the country to meet its decarbonisation targets. Promoting solar energy leads to increasing energy independence and, more significantly, it means reducing the consequences of global warming.European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis, responsible for An Economy that Works for People, said: For the second time this week we are announcing European Investment Bank financing for solar energy in Spain. With the support of the Investment Plan for Europe, a 300 megawatt solar energy plant will be built in Talayuela, Extremadura, which will produce enough clean energy to power 150,000 homes annually. Investing in renewable energies such as solar is crucial for achieving the Paris Climate Agreement goals and reaching climate neutrality by 2050.Dr. Dierk Paskert, CEO of Encavis AG stated: This project marks a milestone both for Encavis and for the Spanishs renewable energy market, as it highlights the EU support to our growth strategy and it is the first long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) signed for a solar park without any support from feed-in tariffs. The conclusion of this PPA and the launch of the Talayuela solar park next year will take Encavis to a new level and will stimulate the market for comparable contracts in many countries.Jose Miguel Ferrer, General Manager of Solarcentury in Iberia, commented: Thefinancial close of Talayuela Solar is a major achievement for Solarcentury and Encavis AG, as well as a landmark deal that demonstrates the financial viability of Spains subsidy-free solar market. By demonstrating the long-term bankability of this large-scale project through the signing of our ground-breaking Power Purchase Agreement in September, we have secured the backing of two of Europes largest lenders, the European Investment Bank and Deutsche Bank, that share our vision for the project. With everything now in place, we look forward to beginning the construction of the project over the coming weeks.The EUR 228m project has secured a project financing from the EIB and Deutsche Bank for an aggregate amount of c. EUR 165m, which reached financial close at the end of November. The Talayuela Solar Plant is one of the first greenfield renewable energy projects to be financed in Spain without any form of government/public support. The Project entered into a 10-year financial Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) in September 2019, which hedges the off-take price for approximately 75% of the volume of the production. Following these developments, Encavis AG has provided Solarcentury with a notice to begin construction of the plant, which is expected to be operational in the second half of 2020.The Talayuela plant is going to have a significant impact on the Spanish renewable energy market, helping the Iberian country to meet its renewable target of 20% of primary energy consumption to be generated by renewable sources by 2020. Moreover, the project contributes to the achievement of the Banks Climate Action objectives as well as to meeting the European Commissions binding renewable energy target of at least 32% of final energy consumption by 2030.\l"

Cleanup does use additional energy and costs more than dumping polluting CO2 into the atmosphere. But benefits include cleaner air, a stable climate and creation of high value jobs.Clean concentrated gases (from gas power plant, or cement works at 4-8 per cent CO2), are much easier to capture than dirty gases (coal combustion at 2 per cent CO2) or dilute gases (normal air from the atmosphere, CO2 0.04 per cent).To allow recovery of the atmosphere, storage of CO2 is necessary for very long timespans -10,000 years. Geological storage is similar to oil accumulations, where a porous reservoir rock is needed, overlain by an impermeable shale seal. This pairing of rock types occurs with hydrocarbons - for example, the North Sea east of the UK could store 200-400 years worth of emissions. Similar rocks for CO2 storage exist offshore on the northwest and east of India.CO2 can also be stored in chemically reactive basalt, where growth of new minerals can lock up CO2 at very low cost. Abundant basalts in central India could be investigated for their suitability. The applications of CCS are not restricted to power plants.In the UK and Europe, most large industries emit CO2.

Using wind to power the equipment reduces emissions relative to using natural gas but still allows air pollution to continue, and increases the social costs relative to no carbon capture.Conversely, using wind to displace coal altogether reduces emissions, air pollution and social costs substantially. Spending money on wind-powered carbon capture always increases emissions compared with spending the same money on replacing fossil fuels and biofuels with wind.In sum, CCU and SDACCU increase or hold constant air pollution health damage and reduce little carbon, even without considering leakages. No improvement can change this conclusion since carbon capture always incurs an equipment cost never incurred by wind, and mostly increases air pollution and fuel mining. Once fossil power plant emissions end, CCU and SDACCU social costs need to be evaluated against the social costs of natural reforestation and reducing non-energy halogen, nitrous oxide, methane and biomass burning emissions.\l"
"COP25","India","COP25_India284","COP25 summit: UN chief warns of 'point of no return' on climate change","December 2, 2019 Monday","Indian Express","The annual two-week climate change meeting begins in the Spanish capital Monday with the hope that countries will commit themselves to more ambitious actions to deal with the climate emergency which several new scientific studies have warned was getting out of hand.In 2015, while finalising the Paris Agreement, all the countries had pledged a series of actions they intended to take by 2025 or 2030 to deal with the crisis. These actions, called Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs, in climate jargon, are supposed to be updated next year. In the meanwhile, several studies have shown that the climate crisis had been worsening rapidly, and that the world's response had been woefully inadequate so far, thereby requiring an immediate and massive scaling up of efforts.""The point of no return is no longer over the horizon,"" warned UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres ahead of the start of the conference. ""It is in sight and hurtling toward us,"" he added.A special meeting called for the same purpose by Guterres during the UN General Assembly session in September received a lukewarm response. Though lots of countries did announce fresh commitments, including a pledge from over 70 countries to ensure net-zero emissions by 2050, the big emitters, whose actions make all the difference - the United States, China, India, European Union and others - have so far been holding on.At the Madrid meeting, countries are likely to come under intense pressure from civil society groups to commit to greater action. The climate negotiators, in the meanwhile, will try to tie the loose ends of the Paris Agreement rulebook. The rulebook that contains the processes, mechanisms and institutions through which the provisions of the Paris Agreement will be implemented, had been finalised in Katowice last year, But some of the issues had remained unresolved and had been left for the negotiators to settle over the next one year. Prominent among these is the issue of creation of a new carbon market under the Paris Agreement.A carbon market ensures that a country or an industry that overachieves its emission targets is able to trade its additional effort with a country or industry that has been unable to achieve its target, or even otherwise willing to buy.A carbon market already existed under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the earlier climate agreement which is expiring next year and getting replaced by Paris Agreement. In the last one decade, as several countries walked out of the Kyoto Protocol and no one was feeling compelled to meet their emission reduction targets, the demand for carbon credits had waned. As a result, developing countries like India, China and Brazil had accumulated huge amounts of carbon credits. These credits are now in danger of getting redundant.Brazil has been arguing that these accumulated carbon credits should remain valid under the new carbon market to be instituted. But the developed countries have been resisting this claiming that the weak verification mechanisms under Kyoto Protocol had allowed dubious projects to earn credits. India, which has accumulated 750 million certified emission reductions (CERs), is backing Brazil's position on this.The resolution of this tussle is key to the success of the Madrid meeting. But there are similar other pending issues as well, like those related to ensuring transparency in the processes, and methods of reporting information.\l"

New asset classes have been added to the methodology and new tools are available for the growing number of financial companies who want to use the PCAF methodology. Participating institutions in the Netherlands represent 2 trillion of assets under management, many of whom already publicly disclose the associated carbon footprint.The Dutch group pioneered the development of a methodology to assess the carbon emissions of financial institution's loans and investments. This groundbreaking approach has been the catalyst for a global movement of institutions who assess their emissions with a view, ultimately, to align their impact with the Paris Climate Goals.Triodos Bank's Spanish Managing Director, Mikel Garcia, and FMO Jorim Schraven, Director of Impact and ESG at Dutch development bank, FMO, presented the report, Accounting CHG emissions and taking action: harmonized approach for the financial sector in the Netherlands, to Marcel Beukeboom, Climate Emissary of the Dutch government during the climate summit in Madrid.Align portfolio with Paris climate agreementPCAF chair Piet Sprengers (ASN Bank): ""PCAF plays an important role in allowing the financial sector to make the transition to a positive, low carbon future. By making their CO2 emissions transparent, financial companies are taking a very important step to ultimately align their portfolio with the Paris Climate Agreement. Today's report shows that PCAF provides a simple and powerful way to start measuring and reporting on their climate impact. We call on the financial sector to start assessing the emissions of their loans and investments, to reduce their finance of fossil assets and actively support the transition to a low carbon economy of the future.""RabobankWiebe Draijer, chairman of the Managing Board of Rabobank, about the report: 'We welcome this report as a further development of the measurement of the carbon footprint of banks' balance sheets. To meet the Dutch Climate Agreement and the Paris goals it is required that our clients and society at large halve the emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 level. PCAF can help to make the challenge visible and to monitor progress. 'In the report, Rabobank describes an initial exploration of the credit portfolio of its local banks. The results are further improved with in collaboration with RIVM and CBS.Global movementPCAF started in the Netherlands in 2015, when ASN Bank took this initiative during the climate summit in Paris. Eleven Dutch financial institutions joined this first effort of its kind by the financial industry, for the financial industry. PCAF has now become a worldwide standard. To date, 57 financial institutions from around the world have joined and committed to measure and report on their CO2 emissions. They represent $3.5 trillion in total assets.The ambition of PCAF is to grow this number to 100 institutions worldwide within three years. In the future, the group believes that measuring and disclosing CO2 impact should become common practice across the entire financial sector.Science based targetsAn important next step in the development of PCAF is to use insights from assessing greenhouse gas emissions to set science-based targets. These targets will help ensure financial institutions play their part in keeping the global increase in temperature within safe levels.Source: Rabobank\l"

Echoing the United Nations Emissions Gap Report published recently,\~he projected that the world was on course to a '3 to 5 degree rise' unless emission cuts happened rapidly and adequately.""It is almost certain that the ongoing decade of 2010-2019 is going to be the warmest on record,"" said Taalas,\~adding that though there was still about a month to go before the decade\~came to an end, the prediction was unlikely to change.He also\~said that the five-year period of 2015-2019 was going to be the warmest on record, with 2016 being the warmest year ever so far. According to NASA figures, the current decade has already recorded a 0.265 degrees\~Celsius (\'b0C) rise over 2000-2009. The 2000-2009 decade was found to have a 0.2\~\'b0C rise over the previous decade.""Major greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have reached record levels and the situation has worsened since the Paris Agreement has been signed. Carbon dioxide has crossed the threshold level of 400 ppm (parts per million) and is now on an all-time record high of 407.8 ppm. Methane has also reached a record proportion of 1,869 ppb (parts per billion) and so has nitrous oxide, with 331.1 ppb,"" Taalas said.\~\~Harjeet Singh, global head of climate change at non-profit ActionAid, alleged that the inaction of rich countries and the emission holiday that was provided\~according to the Paris Agreement package had pushed the world to a critical juncture.Though the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015, it gave a five-year emission holiday to all countries, asking them to cut emissions from 2020 onwards\~according to their commitments in the Agreement. CK Mishra, environment secretary in the Union government, told this\~reporter\~that the failure of rich countries to implement their emission cut commitments pre-2020 had brought the world to\~this stage.The report also highlighted that apart from temperature rise, all the tell-tale symptoms of incremental climate change\~were clearly visible including more acidification of sea water, sea level rise, heightened health impacts and hunger, more forest fires, tropical cyclones, marine heatwaves, sharp changes in precipitation patterns, increasing heatwaves and the melting of Arctic ice.India at the receiving endThe report has mentioned Bulbul and Fani as two major cyclones\~among six global cyclones that have had maximum impact on people's lives and livelihoods during 2019.Incidentally, in response to a question posed by this reporter,\~Taalas\~agreed that the Sundarbans, spread between the Indian state of West Bengal and Bangladesh, with an estimated 8\~millimetre rise per year as calculated in India, was one of the hotbeds of global sea level rise.The report also mentioned the pre-monsoon heatwave in the Indian Subcontinent as one of the top global heatwave incidents of 2019.\l"

In their letter, the senators sound the alarm on the crisis of climate change and the damage that will be inflicted on Americans for future generations unless immediate action is taken. The senators warned the president against ceding U.S. leadership on this issue, and admonished him for failing to honor his commitment to work with Democrats to renegotiate the Paris Climate Accord or to craft a new deal. The letter comes as the 25th United Nations takes place in Madrid this week.The senators wrote, As the second largest global emitter of greenhouse gases, and the largest historical emitter, it is imperative that the United States assume our rightful place as a global leader in the fight to combat climate change, yet with this action you are ceding American leadership to other nations at great political and economic costs.The letter also emphasized the national security implications related to the presidents withdrawal, underscoring the damage done to the United States reputation by reneging on an international commitment. The senators letter further illustrates the outcry from Americans across various sectors, including the business community, citing more than 2,200 U.S. businesses including major companies such as Google.

With the right support and commitment from successive UK ministers, and through the ingenuity of our people, within a decade we transformed into Europes largest decarbonisation project and its biggest source of renewable power generating 12% of the UKs renewable electricity last year while reducing our carbon emissions by more than 80% since 2012.We have reduced our emissions, we believe, more than any other energy company in the world and we have enabled a just transition for thousands of UK workers who began their career in coal but will end it by producing renewable, flexible and low carbon power for 13 million British homes. But as the climate crisis intensifies and the clock counts down, we cant stand still. So today I am pleased to share our new ambition: to move beyond carbon neutrality, to achieve something that nobody has before, and become the worlds first carbon negative company by 2030.By applying carbon capture and storage technology to our bioenergy generation we can become the first company in the world to remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than we produce, while continuing to produce about 5% of the UKs overall electricity needs. As the IPCC and UK governments Committee on Climate Change make clear negative emissions are vital if we are to limit the earths temperature rise to 1.5 degrees.At Drax we can be the first company to produce negative emissions at scale, helping to arrest climate change and redefining what is possible in the transition beyond coal. If we are to defeat the climate crisis we must do it in a way that unlocks jobs and economic growth, unleashes entrepreneurial spirit and leaves nobody behind. The UK is unrivalled in decarbonising in this way. We are second to none in deploying renewables like offshore wind and bioenergy, which have transformed lives and our post-industrial communities.We need to apply a similar framework to Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage as made offshore wind so successful. Fundamentally, an effective strategic partnership of government and the private sector was critical. The government provided support and an effective carbon tax regime. With confidence in that regulatory framework, many businesses provided investment and innovation. As a result, offshore wind has grown from less than 600 megawatts (MW) of installed capacity in 2008 to more than 8,000 MW in 2018 an increase of more than 13 times in 10 years to produce 7.5% of the UKs electricity.At the same time, the cost of that electricity has decl"

The CoP presidency of Chile has set up two separate tracks of negotiations to fasten the process of consultations.At the AGN press conference, Nasr pointed out that the progress in Madrid has been slow and limited.He expressed concern that ""in the first four days, several items dealing with support for developing countries have not seen conclusion"". In many cases the parties have postponed the discussions to be taken up at the subsidiary body meetings in June 2020.These issues include the support for developing countries to implement their obligations under the UNFCCC, support to establish reporting mechanisms under the Paris Agreement and the issues regarding the Consultative Group of Experts, a technical group that helps in building capacities for developing countries. All these have not seen success in the negotiations.""We are very, very, very worried about the balance of the outcome. We are regressing on the implementation of all the commitments under the Paris Agreement,"" Nasr said.Ambassador Hussein Alfa (Seyni) Nafo\~from the Republic of Mali, who is the former chair of the AGN, said that at this point, the African group would rather that there be no decision on some issues than having a bad decision. ""We have strong positions and we will continue being united on them,"" he said.Regarding\~the new text\~on the decision of the CoP in Madrid brought in by the Presidency on December 13 morning, Nasr said the text was a good starting point for the consultations. ""But the AGN has asked for a more balanced text that includes an approach that focuses on the elements of the negotiations,"" he added.Nasr observed\~that ambition on action should be there but without ambition on finance and support, it does not make any sense.Regarding carbon markets under Article 6, he said they should be complementary to national actions and that even though the AGN see potential in markets, they have not been big supporters of them. Nasr also iterated Nafo's point that on some issues ""no deal is better than bad deal and we are fine with continuing the process till next year.""At a later plenary session, India's lead negotiator, Ravishankar Prasad flagged some concerns with the negotiations, especially regarding Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.He pointed out that there was no balance between the second paragraph of the Article that deals with bilateral carbon trading and mini-multilateral carbon markets and the fourth paragraph that deals with a global carbon trading mechanism known as the Sustainable Development Mechanism.Prasad also mentioned that there was some resistance from parties regarding the $100 billion per year finance that developed countries had to give to the developing countries.\l"

They are Chilean Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt accompanied by UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa and Spanish Minister for Ecological Transition Teresa Ribera. The two-week long 25th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) or COP25 began on Monday in the Spanish capital in the backdrop of climate impact biting globally. This COP is an important meeting. The reason: In 2015, governments signed the Paris Agreement -- the first global UN treaty that saw all nations commit to cutting emissions to zero by mid century. Next year, the same countries are on notice to submit new and tougher climate plans. This time the talks will take place under the Presidency of the government of Chile and will be held with logistical support from the government of Spain. ""This year, we have seen accelerating climate change impacts, including increased droughts, storms and heat waves, with dire consequences for poverty eradication, human health, migration and inequality,"" UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said ahead of the onset of talks that is seeing the presence of diplomats and officials of nearly 200 nations. ""The world's small window of opportunity to address climate change is closing rapidly. We must urgently deploy all the tools of multilateral cooperation to make COP25 the launchpad for more climate ambition to put the world on a transformational path towards low carbon and resilience,"" she said. A key objective of COP25 is to raise overall ambition also by completing several key aspects with respect to the full operationalisation of the Paris Climate Change Agreement. Spain's Minister for Ecological Transition Teresa Ribera said the UN climate conference starts a new cycle for more climate ambition and inclusion in 2020 and beyond. ""So we can avoid the 'point of no-return' the Secretary-General has warned of today."" ""The global shift from the grey to the green economy is gathering momentum, as we saw from business and finance stepping up at the Climate Action Summit in September, but much more is needed,"" she said. Madrid is the city that is hosting the COP25 at the eleventh hour when Chile took the decision not to host the meeting owing to civic unrest. ""I would like to give a special thanks to the two women that join me this morning (November 30) -- personal friends and tremendous examples of strength, conviction and a sense of urgency in the face of the climate crisis -- Teresa Ribera and Patricia Espinosa,"" said COP25 President Carolina Schmidt, who was handed over the presidency by the outgoing President of COP24, the Polish Michal Kurtyka. ""I want to thank Teresa, and through her all of the government for their enormous support and generosity in hosting the , which Chile presides. This is the best possible example of multilateral work and fraternity in the face of a common problem: the climate crisis,"" said Schmidt, who believes that the people need to be at the centre of climate action. ""We have to change course. Countries must work together and commit to more ambitious goals that will allow us to bridge the gap between current commitments and those needed to avoid the rise of temperatures above 1.5 degrees Celsius as the science dictates,"" she added. Over 20,000 participants have landed in the Spanish capital for the negotiations. Green groups are expected to argue that the root cause of the climate crisis is linked to unbridled capitalism that benefits wealthy polluters while displacing the poorest and putting at risk biodiversity and civilization. Voices demanding that social justice is at the heart of a zero-carbon world are growing louder. What's at stake? At a time when the discrepancies between what governments need to do according to science and what they are actually doing are getting unprecedented global attention, Madrid is the moment when the race for governments to submit new climate plans starts. These are due in 2020 and, under the Paris deal, they need to be better than previous ones. Experts believe hosting COP25 is an excellent opportunity for Spain to showcase progress made on energy transition since the socialists came to power in June 2018. Spanish Minister for Ecological Transition Teresa Ribera is determined to use the COP to advance international action, and also to give her domestic ambitions a boost.

But in their current form, the rules are a recipe to repeat the mistakes of the past, and undermine all promises of equity.All countries, including developing countries, now have national targets in the form of nationally determined contributions (NDCs). This should translate into a greater demand for high-quality mitigation, with only the highest-cost mitigation available for international transfer.It is not in developing countries' interest to put low-cost projects on the market, which can be achieved within their own resources. Also, it is clear that NDCs will be continually revised upwards - so if developing countries initially mitigate more than their fair share, they must keep the option to retain the credits they generate for their own use toward future targets.International carbon trading should be restricted to activities or technologies which deliver outcomes well beyond business-as-usual. The objective has to be to ensure that the world does not see a recurrence of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol, which was designed to keep costs low and find the most 'efficient' reductions - it completely failed in delivering the kind of transformative change that the world needs.The market design that the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) proposes is fundamentally different from the CDM. It is not designed to capture the low-hanging fruit; instead, it is deliberately designed to allow the world to pay for transformative change, which would have higher costs, but would allow countries to leapfrog to new emissions reduction technologies.CSE considers that this goal can only be met by setting a floor cost to qualify projects for accreditation under the Paris market mechanism. The floor cost should be carefully set to eliminate projects which would not provide the transformative change that is required in today's climate risked world.\~This restriction should ideally be in the form of a minimum cost per tonne - ideally at least $100 per tonne - of carbon dioxide mitigated. Only activities or technologies with a cost above this threshold should be allowed accreditation under Article 6.This restriction must be a foundational pillar of market design from the beginning, not an add-on at a later stage. Without it, the only purpose served by markets under the Paris Agreement would be to let developed countries abandon their NDC commitments.\l"

India has already shared its charter with 38 potential member countries including G20 nations. ""More countries are expected to join this initiative during COP25 whose high-level segment will be attended by the Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar next week,"" said an official of environment ministry.Launched by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York in September, the CDRI will create a mechanism to assist countries for upgrading their infrastructure as per their vulnerability, disaster risk and economic needs.After making International Solar Alliance (ISA) a reality, the CDRI is India's second major initiative of global scale to face the challenge of climate change. India has earmarked Rs 480 crore (approx. $70 million) for setting up the CDRI's secretariat in New Delhi and covering its recurring expenditure over a period of five years till 2023-24.Besides providing access to knowledge, technology and capacity development for infra developers, the Coalition will create opportunities for Indian infrastructure & technology firms to expand services abroad - mainly in Africa, Asia and small island developing countries.India is expected to pitch the CDRI during COP25, flagging vulnerability of many countries when the world is already 1.1 degree Celsius warmer than the pre-industrial (1850-1900 level) period.The COP25 is the final such UN climate change conference before 2020, when countries are expected to submit their new respective climate action plans. Many scientific reports have already highlighted that the current pledges of all countries together are not enough to meet the most important climate goal of stabilizing global temperature rise at 1.5 degree Celsius by the end of the century. The UN conference in Madrid is also important for finalising rules on how countries can reduce their emissions using international carbon markets. The various aspects of carbon markets/trading are covered under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. ""I expect a clear demonstration of increased climate action ambition and commitment out of COP25.

Just hours after Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg delivered a powerful speech at the 25th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) or COP25 on Wednesday, around 200 young campaigners staged a noisy demonstration in front of the main halls where UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was due to update the conference on the progress of the talks. They were expressing a rising sense of disappointment with the slow progress of the conference, which is in marked contrast to the urgency of scientists and the clamour for action from school strikers. As the group banged pots and pans and chanted slogans, UN security staff intervened to move the protesters outside ""abruptly and roughly"", from the building, the demonstrators said, adding that they also had their badges removed, preventing them from returning to the talks.

These targets were submitted as part of a mid-century strategy published in 2016, and Mexico contends they are consistent with the 2\'b0C threshold. It intends to communicate a new NDC in 2020, but there is no indication whether it will be 1.5\'b0C-consistent, or by how much it will raise ambition.Similar concerns exist with South Korea (1.29 per cent of global annual emissions), which published its 2050 strategy in 2009, much before the Paris Agreement legally established the 1.5\'b0C and 2\'b0C thresholds to assess NDCs. Other significant emitters with a declared intent to update targets in 2020 include South Africa (1.08 per cent of global annual emissions), Nigeria (1.01 per cent), Argentina (0.91 per cent) and Ukraine (0.70 per cent).As developing economies, these countries will need to significantly ramp up ambition between 2030 and 2050. It is unclear if they have domestic policy frameworks to do so.The lack of ambition increase from these developing economies, however, pales in comparison to the abdication of responsibility by much larger economies. The US, Australia, China, Russia and Brazil are united by precious little other than their disregard for the spirit of the Paris Agreement. Major economies need to step up, based on ""a fair sharing of efforts and resources, centred around equity"", says Harjeet Singh, Global Lead on Climate Change at Johannesburg-based international non-profit ActionAid. If China and India are to decarbonise at a 1.5\'b0C-consistent rate, international support for capacity building, technology and finance will be essential, he emphasises.Australia currently targets a 26-28 per cent reduction below 2005 emissions levels by 2030. This is consistent with warming in excess of 4\'b0C - easily one of the worst pledges in the world - and contradicts advice from its Climate Change Authority, which recommended a 45 per cent cut. The election of a denialist Liberal/National Coalition government earlier this year is likely to worsen matters.Kate Dooley, research fellow at the Climate & Energy College, University of Melbourne, Australia, says the government ""has shown no interest in increasing this pledge in l"

The Minister recently assumed the Presidency of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) and, in this capacity, has a mandate to advance Africas shared priorities.For Africa and all its Member States, the impacts of Climate Change are real and most felt by the poor and vulnerable groups in society. Over the past year, every sub-region of Africa has experienced weather events that have caused considerable loss of life and destruction.In South Africa, we are experiencing unprecedented increases in the frequency and intensity of heat-waves, bush fires and droughts, which are placing a tremendous burden on our already water-stressed country. There have also been particularly violent storms and floods. Science tells us that the worst is yet to come.Given this reality, it is imperative for South Africa to contribute to securing a robust multilateral response to climate change.

As a result, has obtained the certification of sustainable event management system (UNE-EN ISO 20121: 2013), being the second COP to receive this certificate, after COP22 held in Marrakech. However, we are working to obtain two more certificates (EMAS and ISO 14001), so the COP of Madrid will be the first to have three sustainability certificates. This standard introduces sustainability criteria throughout the life cycle of the management of an event ensuring that it has a certified sustainable management system in accordance with this standard.Among the fundamental axes of this sustainable management system, it has been ensured that, to the extent possible and given the dimensions of an international summit of these characteristics, as well as the imminence in its celebration, all aspects of sustainability related to COP25 organization have been identified in each of the phases of the event and for all the entities involved in its celebration.

"COP25","India","COP25_India305","Cuba : Climate change: sainete and great fiasco in Madrid","January 4, 2020 Saturday","TendersInfo","The Paris Agreement on climate change was presented to the world in 2015 as a great achievement at the end of the twenty-first Conference of the Parties (COP21) of the Convention on Climate Change. It was said that for the first time all the countries of the world had joined together in a common effort to keep climate change below two degrees Celsius with respect to the pre-industrial era. In addition, it was agreed to make efforts to limit this climate change to 1.5 degrees. To achieve this, each and every member country would voluntarily and independently define its commitments to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.The Paris Agreement (AP) formally entered into force in November 2016, when it was ratified by the required number of countries. But what has never been said clearly, and the media have failed to understand, is that this agreement has already entered into force, but it still cannot be applied. We have been in this kind of limbo for four years, which turns the PA into an international treaty that has already entered into force but cannot be applied. The reason is that it lacks what would be the equivalent of a regulatory law.The implications of the above are devastating. In the last four years, the 192 member countries of the Paris Agreement have been busy negotiating the precise rules of application of that instrument. You read correctly: we have spent four years negotiating the content of the Rule Book that defines the procedures to standardize national reports on emission reduction, financial cooperation rules, how a country can meet its emission reduction goals by helping to other nations to reduce theirs and the modalities that should govern the transactions in the carbon markets and in the mechanisms of compensation of emissions, etc.A year ago, COP24 ended in Katowice, Poland, and it was said that negotiations had finally been completed to define the Rule Book. But again the mendacious diplomatic language served as a smokescreen. It turns out that the rules for the implementation of one of the most important components of the Paris Agreement, defined in its sixth article, remained undefined and the task was left for COP25 . And this could not reach an agreement on that article.What does this famous article say? It is one of the most important and contentious of the Paris Agreement. It is a short text that opens the doors for a country that has exceeded its national goals or commitments (voluntary and independently defined) to sell its excess emissions to a nation that has not been able to meet its goals. These objectives may be related to different types of projects, such as emission reductions, expansion of renewable sources or forest plantations.The sixth article also opens the door to the creation of a new international carbon market to exchange emission reductions anywhere in the world for public and private sectors. Like the previous case, these decreases can come from multiple types of projects.The main problem is that these market mechanisms make it easier for things to remain as they are and have not served to curb emissions. The most developed carbon market is the European Emissions Trading System, and that regime has been in crisis for years. Just this 2019, the price of a ton of carbon (equivalent) began to rebound, but multiple problems of origin have not facilitated its operation. Maintaining the status quo is a very bad option right now. We already know that the national commitments do not reach the initial objective of the agreement, and when they are accounted for it is observed that they place the world on the trajectory of three degrees Celsius, which has implications of catastrophic dimensions and constitutes an existential threat to humanity.Before and during COP 25 many organizations and some countries had expected that large GHG emitters would announce that they were redoubling efforts to reduce these emissions. These notifications never arrived and it is clear that the United States (which the AP has denounced, but still had the right to participate in this COP), Brazil, China, Australia and Saudi Arabia led the group of countries that, frankly, spared no resources to sabotage COP 25 efforts.\l"

Said the Director General of Asia Pacific and Africa, the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Desra Belcaya who led the Indonesian delegation at the 50th Pacific Islands Forum Summit (PIF Summit) meeting in Funafuti, Tuvalu, 13-16 August 2019.At the meeting between the PIF Leaders and Dialogue Partners (Friday, 16/8), Ambassador Desra Percaya reiterated Indonesia's commitment to be more instrumental in overcoming the challenges of the Pacific region, which is largely an island nation such as climate change, marine issues and natural disasters. Indonesia also wants to contribute to efforts to develop the Pacific region.Keep in mind, that Indonesia also faces the same impacts of climate change as the Pacific region. We (read: Indonesia) are partners of Pacific countries and an inseparable part of this region. Indonesia is ready to concretely fight for the interests of the archipelago at the 25th Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP 25 ) in Santiago, Chile, in December 2019 "".The 50th PIF Summit addresses issues of mutual concern in the Pacific, including regional security, climate change and maritime security. PIF endorsed the Kainaki II Declaration for Urgent Climate Change Action and agreed to draft the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. The meeting also marked the handover of the leadership of the PIF from Nauru (2018-2019) to Tuvalu (2019-2020).Discussion on climate change issues dominates the course of this year's PIF Summit. Pacific island countries are very vulnerable to the threat of climate change which results in huge losses, especially as a result of the threat of rising sea levels, intensified natural disasters, to create humanitarian issues where island communities are threatened to survive by migrating to other countries. In addition, PIF countries also focus on developing a joint position to fight for the upcoming COP25 meeting.Since 2001, Indonesia has regularly attended the annual PIF meeting together with other Dialogue Partners, including the US, China, South Korea, Japan and the European Union. Indonesia is always present and contributes actively by exchanging views, sharing experiences, and offering technical assistance in the form of training and capacity building to Pacific countries.PIF is a forum for cooperation between countries in the Pacific region which includes 18 countries / regions, namely Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Federation of Micronesia, Palau, Papua New Guinea Baru, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Tonga and Vanuatu.This forum was established in 1971, and aims to strengthen cooperation and integration of Pacific countries' policies to achieve economic growth, sustainable development, good governance and shared regional security.\l"

They were expressing a rising sense of disappointment with the slow progress of the conference, which is in marked contrast to the urgency of scientists and the clamour for action from school strikers. As the group banged pots and pans and chanted slogans, UN security staff intervened to move the protesters outside ""abruptly and roughly"", from the building, the demonstrators said, adding that they also had their badges removed, preventing them from returning to the talks.

The US, with 4.3 per cent of the world population in 2018, has been responsible for 25 per cent of cumulative emissions since 1850, while the EU with 6.8 per cent of the population has been responsible for 18.4 per cent. \~India, with 17.8 per cent of the population, has been responsible for only 2.8 per cent, while China, with 18.3 per cent of the world's population has been responsible for 10.7 per cent.Despite the catch-up act being played by developing countries, this inequity fails to disappear even as we look to the future.

Certain countries keep defaulting on their contributions, leading to a building budget emergency which has now come to a head. An amount of $1.3 billion in unpaid contributions compelled Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General to comment publicly this October about a 'cash crisis'.The UN Climate Secretariat is facing similar difficulties. In 2017, it indicated that it needed around 28 million euros in 2018, and a similar amount in 2019 to continue operations. This budget is used to pay for the salaries and activities of the Secretariat staff.The 2017 report also indicated the share to be contributed by various countries, based on the UN General Assembly formula. India, for example, needs to contribute around 0.7 per cent of the annual budget, while the US needs to contribute around 22 per cent.Countries continue to default on payments, as made clear by an update on the status of contributions as at 15 November 2019. 7.2 million euros in contributions remain outstanding for the period 2010-2018. Hence, the repeated CoP decisions expressing concern.The United States (US), predictably accounts for the largest portion of these arrears - around 2.9 million euros, or 40 per cent of total arrears over the period. The other significant defaulter is Brazil, with over 1.5 million euros in arrears for 2010-18. India is indicated as having no arrears, as is China.Other countries with significant arrears include Greece (around 0.1 million euros), Iran and Libya (around 0.2 million euros) and Venezuela (around 0.75 million euros), all of which are currently in economic crisis.

The UK and Bangladesh can form a great partnership to lead global efforts to tackle it. Our combined expertise and leadership mean we can work together to raise the worlds ambition before and during COP26, seeking global commitment on adapting to climate impacts and building resilience for the future.Mr Ziaul Hasan ndc, Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Focal Point for Bangladesh, delivered the keynote speech.COP25: Sultana Afroz, Additional Secretary, Economic Relations Division, Ministry of Finance, Dr Saleemul Huq, Director, International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCAD) and Adviser to the Least Developed Countries Group in UNFCCC; Mohammed Malik, Infrastructure Development Company Ltd.; Sharaban Tahura Zaman, Lecturer, Department of Law, North South University, and LDCs group negotiator at COP25. The panellists reflected on the process and outcomes of COP25, the journey to COP26, and opportunities for the UK and Bangladesh to raise global ambition to reduce the emissions gap.DFID Country Representative Judith Herbertson, delivered the closing remarks on UK-Bangladesh cooperation beyond COP26. She said that DFID is planning a new programme to support adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change as well as environmental management in Bangladesh.The DFID Country Reepresentative saidOur vision is that through our partnership and our programming, we can show what can be done to clean up growth and build resilience across the country; and share this expertise with other countries.The UK, in partnership with Italy, will host COP26 this year in November in Glasgow. More than 30,000 people are expected to attend the conference, including heads of state and government; experts; and campaigners. Delegates will be discussing ambitious ways in which the world can lower emissions to keep global temperatures below 1.5 degrees of warming. While the UK is gearing up for the presidency of COP26, Bangladesh is advancing its preparation to lead the Climate Vulnerable Forum and the Locally-Led Adaptation Action Track of the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA). And leading up to COP26, the UK intends to build a stronger partnership with countries like Bangladesh; a vulnerable country but increasingly resilient to climate impacts. As the leading voice against climate impacts, Bangladesh can play a more significant role in the global climate change discourse through COP26.The UK is already a key partner to Bangladesh on disaster management and resilience building. Since 2008, UK and Bangladesh jointly helped over 27 million people gain access to early warning systems for floods and cyclones, and provided emergency assistance and recovery support after disasters to more than 900,000 people.\l"

Her plain pink dress had no frills, just like her. Head down with a nervous yet sanguine smile, she walked to the main stage as easily as she sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to reach New York on a zero- emissions sailboat. The loud and fiesty ""No"" that answered her question spoke not just of the top brass' passivity but also her rising prominence. Until last year's United Nations' held in Poland, many would walk past her, musing what a ""child was doing at the high-level meet.""But things changed as fast as the climate. Today at the Battery Park in New York, over 2.5 lakh people across the globe had all eyes on her. A naive climate activist? Not anymore. Greta Thunberg on Friday created history by bringing around 4 million people across the globe to fight for one cause, the crisis of climate change. Addressing the massive crowd in New York after the first-of-its-kind climate march, Thunberg chose to be brief but bold with her speech. ""We have not taken to the streets, sacrificing our education for the adults to take selfies with us and tell us that they really admire what we are doing. We are doing this to wake up the leaders because we deserve a safe future,"" she said.For the ""small group of people threatened by us"", Thunberg's message on behalf of the global youth was loud and clear - ""We have some very bad news for you - This is only the beginning. Change is coming whether they like it or not.""The loud cheers from the crowd motivated the teenager to go on. ""What's the point of educating ourselves or learning facts when people on power refuse to listen to the educated? Where I come from, things are very different from here. But when it comes to climate and ecological emergency, it's pretty much the same everywhere,"" said Thunberg adding that empty promises and inaction are the same wherever she went. Thunberg, who is all set to speak at the UN Youth Climate Summit on Saturday, added that the citizens should do everything in their power to stop the climate crisis. ""We are not just some young people skipping school or adults missing on their work. We are waiting wave of change,"" - her final words rippled a strong wave of outrage among the protestors.

"COP25","India","COP25_India320","JICA announce signing of loan agreement for Mexico's ""photovoltaic power generation projects""","March 25, 2020 Wednesday","Pivotal Sources","Mexico, March 25 -- On March 26, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) signed a loan agreement for a maximum amount of US$100 million with Infraestructura Energetica Nova, S.A.B.de C.V. (IEnova), a Mexican energy company.This transaction is JICA's first private sector investment finance project in Mexico since the resumption of private sector investment financing. The loan is part of the facility arranged by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to finance IEnova's solar power generation portfolio and through which both IFC and the North American Development Bank (NADB) committed loans to IEnova of US$100 million each in November 2019. Not only will this loan be the first co-financing project with the NADB; it is also JICA's first loan under the Green Loan Principles. Furthermore, this loan is based on the Memorandum of Understanding on JICA's cooperation with the IFC in May 2017 to facilitate co-financing for the private sector in developing countries.At COP21 (2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference), the Mexican government set a target to reduce CO2 emissions by 22% compared to the projected CO2 emission level as of 2030. Additionally, the Energy Transition Law stipulates that the government has set a target to increase the share of renewable energy to 35% by 2024 and 60% by 2050.IEnova is one of the country's largest private energy company, founded in 1996. In 2015, IEnova entered the business of renewable energy. As of 2019, the company boasted a renewable energy capacity of 658MW, and are planning to expand their business in the future. In the case of the Pima Solar power generation project, which is one of IEnova's solar power generation projects, the company signed the first long-term electric supply contract between a private generator and an industrial client in Mexico. Furthermore, the company has formulated a management strategy that takes environmental and social considerations into account, is working to increase the transparency of their business, and has been included in the Sustainable Index of the Mexican Stock Exchange for the fifth consecutive year, the first energy infrastructure company to be included.This project will contribute to mitigate the impact of climate change by increasing the supply of electricity, promoting renewable energy, and diversifying power sources in Mexico through support for IEnova's photovoltaic power generation projects. It will also contribute to SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) Goals 7 and 13. JICA will continue its support for climate change initiatives in the Latin American region, including Mexico, and actively promote cooperation with development financial agencies such as the IFC, thereby advancing projects that contribute to economic and social development in developing countries and regions.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Pivotal Sources.

To do so, the Vice-President of the EU bank Emma Navarro and the President of Iberdrola Ignacio Galn agreed two loans for a total of EUR 690m.EIB Vice-President Emma Navarro, head of climate action at the Bank and its operations in Spain and Latin America, remarked: We are delighted to be signing these agreements at the Madrid Climate Change Conference, because they are a great example of the EIBs efforts to support climate action inside and outside of Europe. To fulfil the objectives of the Paris Agreement, we need to mobilise resources on an unprecedented scale, and the EIB is seeking to lead the response to this challenge. We are the EUs climate bank, and that is why we have strengthened our climate ambition. We are working on mobilising up to EUR 1tn over the coming decade through projects that, like the ones we are supporting today, are going to help with the transition towards a low-carbon economy by promoting renewable energies.Ignacio Galn expressed his satisfaction for sealing this deal during the Climate Change Conference. The byword for this COP is the need to start taking action, and that is what Iberdrola and the EIB are doing today: undertaking specific actions that will help to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5C He also said that Iberdrola got a head-start with this transition 20 years ago, when we realised that the economy of the future had to be carbon-free. Since then, we have invested EUR 100bn in renewables, smart networks and efficient supply, becoming one of the world's largest utility companies. The Iberdrola President also congratulated the EU bank on its decision to increase its climate ambition and to cease financing projects based on fossil fuels: We all have to be part of the solution. As leaders in sustainable financing, we believe that agreements such as the ones we are signing today are essential to turning climate change into an opportunity and leaving an inhabitable planet for future generations.Of the EUR 690m total, EUR 250m will go to financing the construction of 15 wind farms to be developed in the country by Neoenergia, the Iberdrola subsidiary in Brazil. These new facilities will be located in three states in the north east: Paraba, Baha and Piau. Once operational, they will have a total installed power of 520 MW and produce an annual average of 2 300 GWh of clean energy. Commissioning these wind farms will help to reduce CO? emissions and increase the proportion of renewable energy in the countrys electricity generation. The investments in these new wind farms will be made over a five-year period and will enable the creation of 2 300 jobs.The EIB is granting this financing under the Latin America lending mandate 20142020, meaning that the agreement is covered by the EU budget guarantee. By supporting this project, the EU bank is helping to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations. The EIB has been working in Latin America for some 30 years and one of the major priorities in the region is to promote climate action.Smart electricity networks in SpainThe EU bank and Iberdrola have also joined forces to develop digitalisation of infrastructure essential to the decarbonisation of the economy: the electricity distribution networks. To do so, they have agreed a EUR 440m loan to finance new investments in Spain for infrastructure to help improve the reliability of the network and the quality of supply.These networks are key to the energy transition, as they enable the integration of more renewables, sustainable mobility, smart cities and decentralised consumption. Transforming the networks into smart infrastructure that is more reliable and more secure puts consumers at the centre of the business, giving them greater decision-making power and connectivity.The EIB and climate actionThe EIB is among the world's largest multilateral providers of climate finance. The Banks goal is to be a leader in mobilising the finance needed to keep global warming under 2C and to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C in order to meet the Paris Agreement objectives.On 14 November, the EIB Board of Directors approved its new climate objectives and the new energy lending policy. The Bank will gradually increase its financing for climate and environmental objectives up to 50% by 2025, with the goal of ensuring that the EIB Group mobilises at least EUR 1bn by 2030 to promote investments helping to meet these objectives. It also announced its intention to align all EIB Group activities with the Paris Agreement. To this end, the EIB will cease financing fossil fuel-based projects from late 2021.The EIB is the world's largest issuer of green bonds and was the first organisation to make an issue on this market in 2007.In 2018, the EIB provided almost EUR 1.3bn to support climate action in Spain by financing projects involving the development of cleaner means of transport and implementation of new, less polluting and more environmentally friendly production processes.\l"

"COP25","India","COP25_India327","Climate Emergency ","December 20, 2019","Indian Agriculture News","There are two approaches to do so -\~technological and natural. The best known technological solutions are carbon capture and storage (CCS); bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS); and direct air capture and storage (DACS).Natural solutions come in the form of carbon ""sinks"", such as forests, land and oceans. Let's look at them one by one.CCS is a technology to capture waste carbon dioxide from large sources such as factories or fossil fuel power plants, and store it underground. IPCC sees a limited role for this technology. Its 1.5\'b0C report indicates that the electricity mix needs to be almost completely renewables by 2050.Even with CCS, coal power needs to be completely phased out by the same year. For natural gas, even if it is combined with CCS, IPCC indicates that its share of the electricity mix will be limited to 8 per cent by 2050.DACS is a technology that captures carbon directly from the air, rather than capturing it from major sources such as power plants or factories. The technology consumes electricity to do this, making it expensive. A demonstration project in Canada reported a cost of $94-232 per tonne of CO2 equivalent last year. IPCC's 1.5\'b0C report does not indicate a big role for DACS in the push towards net zero.BECCS is a technology which combines bio-energy and CCS. Bio-energy is produced from the burning of waste from forests and agriculture, or from crops grown specially for the purpose. By itself, it is not an efficient way to produce energy.When combined with CCS, the joint effect of producing new energy while sequestering carbon makes BECCS a worthwhile economic proposition. IPCC considers BECCS an important technology to stay within 1.5\'b0C, projecting that it would have to sequester up to 1 GtCo2e each year by 2030, up to 8 GtCo2e each year by 2050, and up to 16 GtCo2 e each year by 2100.However, there are three concerns with BECCS. One, in the best-case-scenario BECCS will be able to sequester up to 5 GtCo2e per year in 2050, which will not be enough, states the IPCC 1.5\'b0C report.Second, BECCS could be environmentally damaging. In theory, it is supposed to rely on residues and waste from agriculture, forestry, industries and homes. In practice, the industry is currently under the scanner for covertly cutting down pristine forests instead of using waste wood. Even without such fraud, IPCC's Climate Change and Land report considered that BECCS reliance would greatly increase competition for land, driving degradation and desertification, and threatening food security.Related StoriesClimate Emergency CoP 25: The Paris Agreement is tilting into a downward spiralThe third concern is that IPCC largely presents BECCS as a post-2050 technology. Yet, there is a risk that the potential of BECCS could become a convenient way for countries to delay immediate action on reducing emissions. This is particularly true of wealthier countries, which are constantly searching for ""magic bullet"" technologies to avoid the tough choice of ensuring equitable consumption.Natural carbon sinks of the planet have some inherent capacity to sponge GHGs. This is most famously done by trees, which take in CO2 and convert it into biomass and organic matter. It is also done, to some extent, by the soil and by the oceans. These are sites of natural carbon sequestration or ""sinks"", effectively the opposite of emissions sources. Such sinks make the zero emissions challenge a little easier. If the Earth is doing part of our work for us we may not have to get to absolute zero, but net zero.IPCC estimates that with the right policies, forests can capture and store 0.4-5.8 GtCo2e per year, while soil can capture and store 0.4-8.6 GtCo2e per year. This is a good reason to enhance natural sinks.However, even in the best case scenario, natural sinks cannot sequester all the carbon we currently emit each year.The limits to carbon dioxide removal discussed above show that there is a clear need to reduce emissions. The simple way to do this is for a country to shut down its own sources of emissions. However, there is an alternative, albeit controversial, approach to this end - carbon markets.Carbon markets trade in carbon ""credits"", which are created by assigning a dollar value to emissions reduced or avoided. Polluters buy carbon credits to offset their emissions. However, attempts such as the EU's Emission Trading Scheme do not inspire confidence in carbon markets. Political and technical challenges have resulted in emissions reduction credits without emissions actually reducing.Yet, there is continuing ambition to create markets for carbon credits - the UK's national law, for example, allows counting credits toward its emission reduction efforts, despite the chairperson of the government's official Committee for Climate Change saying that it was ""essential"" to avoid doing so. At the global level, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol has been succeeded by ""New Market Mechanisms"" under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.The legacy of problems with global carbon markets looks set to continue. Those problems plague credits issued in relatively standardised sectors such as energy or transportation. If that wasn't concerning enough, there is a growing push to trade sinks - by assigning credits to activities such as afforestation or ""avoided deforestation"". The combination of sinks and credits promises a cornucopia of delayed mitigation, if only one is willing to ignore a lot of contrary evidence.IPCC's Climate Change and Land report identifies limits to the ability of forests to trap carbon. Carbon sequestration through forests takes decades. Afforestation, reforestation and agroforestry do not continue to sequester carbon indefinitely - eventually the net annual removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere decl"

His alleged solicitation of the Ukrainian government to interfere in the US presidential elections, using American aid to that country as a leverage in this regard, is just one example. This has triggered an impeachment process Less than eleven months remain for the 2020 presidential elections in the United States of America. The campaign is attracting global attention and the stakes are unprecedented. The US is around one-fifth of the world's total gross domestic product and it continues to leave a huge imprint on international peace and security issues.although it would require two-thirds' support in the Senate which is highly unlikely because of the Republican majority. Trump faces little challenge to his re-nomination in the Republican Party. The suspense is with respect to the ongoing primaries campaign of the Democratic Party. It is hard to guess which contestant has an edge at this stage. However, some of the issues discussed so far within the primaries campaign are of direct relevance to the global audience.First and foremost, the issue of inequality has acquired a greater resonance within the Democratic Party. In the past few decades, the default positions of the Democrats and the Republicans have held on corporate and income tax rates. When in power, the Democrats increase tax rates. The Republicans lower them when they are the incumbents. Within the US, where the median age is around 38 years, millennials and super millennials have a particular interest in the issue.Senator Elizabeth Warren along with Senator Bernie Sanders - both are contestants - have pitched for a structural change to corporate America. Other rivals, such as the former vice-president, Joe Biden, and Peter Buttigieg have not been that vociferous on these issues, but their campaigns are expected to be sensitized by them. This issue is resonating across the world as within most countries the gap between the ultra-rich and everyone else remains high. This gap is expanding in lower-middle and upper-middle income countries in particular.Another matter of prime interest will be the narrative on climate change. Trump intends to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement. All major Democratic contestants are committed to the US rejoining the same, and some of them are quite familiar with the nuances of various international initiatives. One of the contestants and the former mayor of New York City, Mike Bloomberg, attended the recent United Nations (COP25) in Madrid. He had been the United Nations secretary-general's special envoy for climate action and has stated that ""the next U.S. president should halt fossil fuel subsidies altogether.""Connected to the topic of inequality is the disproportionate wealth and unregulated power acquired by technological firms such as Facebook, Microsoft and Google. Candidates like Warren have called for breaking up some of these tech giants. This is coupled with concerns about data privacy, hate speech and the use of such platforms to spread misinformation. In countries like India and Myanmar, the misinformation spread on some of these technological platforms has led to mob attacks on individuals or on minorities as well as social unrest leading to a loss of human life. Within the US, in the 2016 elections, Facebook's data were instrumentalized by the Republican Party through the UK-based firm, Cambridge Analytica.The stance of the contestants on peace and security will be closely watched by the international community. Approximately 28 per cent of the UN peacekeeping budget comes from the US. The scale of its contribution can be gauged from the fact that the liquidity crisis of the UN in the Ocober-November period was primarily due to non-payment of the US's dues. In December, once the US paid $533 million owed for dues in 2018, the immediate crisis was over. Trump and his advisers have consistently attacked Nato countries ""for not paying their fair share as the US pays about twice as much as other Nato member nations"". He has also threatened to revise treaties with Japan that were signed after the Japanese surrender that commit the US to defend Japan.In terms of bilateral engagements, rapprochement with Cuba and Iran were the two much-touted foreign policy successes of Barack Obama. On Cuba, bowing to the influential Cuban American vote bank in the swing state of Florida, Trump reversed some of Obama's policy initiatives. He reinstated the prohibitions on commerce with businesses owned by the Cuban military and security services and a ban on individual travel to Cuba. This means little as there are provisions to circumvent the ban. To the consternation of his European allies, he terminated US's participation in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in 2018, popularly known as the Iran nuclear deal, and has imposed ""maximum pressure"" sanctions on Iran. Trump withdrew troops from Syria. He wanted to do the same in Afghanistan. But, after initial proactiveness, he dropped the plan because of the ground realities. Some former foreign policy professionals have voiced their concerns in both cases. If one follows the template of the last Democratic Party president, the approach of the potential Democratic presidential nominee will be rooted in avoiding meddling in regional and sectarian disputes.Lastly, the issue of economic trade is where Trump has been the most vocal during his campaign and his term as president. He has executed the protectionist pitch of his campaign to guide his policies with the main premise being bringing back manufacturing jobs to the US. In response, China has accelerated the move of several China-based manufacturing units to neighbouring countries in Southeast Asia to circumvent the tariff imposed on Chinese-made goods. Within the US, Trump's core base in the agricultural-dominant economies of the South is facing the direct brunt of his protectionist policy that led to a trade war with China. In retaliation to the imposition of high tariffs on Chinese goods, China has stopped the import of corn, soyabeans and other commodities from southern states like South Carolina. After an escalating trade war of over two years, a preliminary trade deal may help in reversing some of the negative trends as China has agreed to buy more US agricultural products. The US has agreed to reduce tariffs on Chinese imports.On many of the trade related issues, the impulse of the Democrats is no different from that of the Republicans, particularly on China, owing to their impact on their blue-collar bases. The return of manufacturing jobs to the US is a priority for both parties in some of the swing states. What will be interesting to watch in this regard would be the stance of the Democratic candidates on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was Obama's key project. During the 2016 elections, the TPP faced flak from both Republican as well as some Democratic candidates, including Sanders. Unsurprisingly, Trump withdrew the US from the TPP in 2017. At a time when a new trade pact, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, whose leading member is China, is on the anvil, the apparent failure of protectionist policies and the danger of the US economy losing out to other global initiatives may force the leadership of the Democrats to consider moderating its opposition to the TPP.\l"

As the most vulnerable continue to suffer from the climate emergency's impacts, such as ongoing heat waves in Europe and record-breaking cyclones in Africa and Asia, government officials leave Bonn with moderate progress in negotiation on various issues. However, they now must urgently confront the wide gap between current commitments to climate action and the harsh reality of an accelerating climate crisis.Sven Harmeling, CARE's Global Policy Lead on Climate Change and Resilience:""In the wake of the UN Climate Action Summit and COP25, outcries sound from the public demanding climate justice amidst fears of catastrophe and a climate apartheid future. While more than 20 countries announced in Bonn to improve their national climate plans, now, more than ever, the big emitters must follow their lead. We continue to reiterate the same message to decision makers: heed our warning before it's too late. Government leaders must now step up and provide the emergency action required instead of making empty promises.""Discussions on supporting efforts to address loss and damage, particularly in developing countries, have progressed in Bonn in preparation for a revision of the UN support scheme for vulnerable countries by COP25 (December, Chile). However, developed countries continue to resist demands by poor countries to substantially scale-up finance to address climate impacts, of which they have been the primary perpetrators. CARE urges developed countries to turn to a more constructive mode in preparation for COP25 and side with the most vulnerable. CARE also welcomes moderate progress on agricultural issues, and calls on leaders to maintain the momentum to fight climate change and gender equality through the adoption of a new gender action plan at COP25.Obed Koringo, CARE's representative to the climate summit preparatory meeting:""After the Bonn session, we call on countries to champion necessary responses to the demands by the UN Secretary General for the upcoming UN Climate Action Summit. Heated debate about the IPCC's Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 degree C is unacceptable. Ongoing dispute on the irrefutable impacts of climate change must end now. In the coming months, we must see significant, urgent national action to halve emissions globally by 2030, and we need at least a doubling of the financial pledges made by developed countries to the Green Climate Fund.""Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from NGO Daily News.

He indicated at the meeting that Serbia and Madrid would express their commitment to fighting climate change, not only declaratively, expressing their support for such a global policy, but by providing concrete national input. Although Serbia is not one of the big greenhouse gas emitters globally, Serbia has prepared strategic documents such as climate change strategy and climate change law. The Minister referred to the recent declaration by the European Parliament redefining European targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.The Minister said that the Draft Law on Climate Change has been finalized and will be in the process soon. ""This law addresses a number of issues in all sectors, which is why there has been a lot of negotiation in many areas within our Government,"" he said, adding that, in the policy, above all, greenhouse gas emission limits, all sectors need to fit. ""The law on climate change is the first law that shows in a very explicit way that Serbia is now beginning to integrate all sectoral policies into the principles and rules of environmental protection,"" he said.Goran Trivan said that the time that has come is the time of the environment, and that the Ministry will try its best to mature the public and everyone involved in the process, that the environment is a comparative advantage.

In a video message ahead of the two-day high-level segment of the UN Climate Change Conference or COP25 in Madrid, beginning on Tuesday, Sanz, who has won 17 Latin Grammy Awards and three Grammy Awards, has called on world leaders to act on climate change. ""I want to tell you, what you and I have in common. The planet is precious resource, but we have long overshot its limits,"" the singer said. Also speaking at the opening of the high-level segment will be COP25 President Carolina Schmidt, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa, World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas, UN General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande and Spanish Minister for Ecological Transition Teresa Ribera. The singer, who is famed for his flamenco-influenced ballads, said, ""The earth is our home but it does not belong to us. We are borrowing it to live."" ""The next generations have every right to live and enjoy it. Just like you and I have done. Climate change is here and will stay with us. The Poles are melting. There is little time left but all is not lost,"" an optimistic Sanz said in Spanish. Urging the global leaders to show the way forward and live by example, he said, ""All of us can and must act as well."" ""Do it for you, do it for the people you love the most. It is time to act,"" he added. The high-level segment will then continue on December 11 with remaining national statements from ministers and heads of delegations, intergovernmental and nongovernmental organisations. The COP25 is being held in the backdrop of climate impacts biting globally, believe climate experts. Indian Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar, who is leading the delegation, told this visiting IANS correspondent here that India is participating with a constructive and positive outlook and working towards protecting long-term development interests. He will be delivering his address in the high-level segment on December 11. With 197 Parties, the UNFCCC has near universal membership and is the parent treaty of the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement. The main aim of the Paris Agreement is to keep a global average temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius and to drive efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The UNFCCC is also the parent treaty of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The ultimate objective of all agreements under the UNFCCC is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system, in a timeframe which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development.

"COP25","India","COP25_India335","COP25: Climate talks headed for breakdown as countries reject draft","December 15, 2019 Sunday","Indian Express","Newer and deeper divides appeared in the positions of countries in the final hours of the Madrid climate talks, which were left facing an extremely uncertain outcome on Saturday evening.Country after country rejected the draft agreement text that was put together on Saturday morning after a whole night of effort to find a compromise language on contentious issues. With very little time at hand now - the conference, which was scheduled to end on Friday evening, is already in extra time - the Madrid talks were facing the prospect of a breakdown or an extremely weak agreement that would avoid any decision on the controversial issues.Non-government organisations and civil society groups, which are important stakeholders in climate negotiations, also rejected the draft texts.EXPLAINEDHow carbon market worksNegotiators were asked to go back to the meeting rooms to revise the drafts again, to be considered later Saturday night and possibly Sunday morning.There was only one major agenda for Madrid talks to negotiate and decide - the rules for a new carbon market to be set up under the Paris Agreement. That would have completed the Paris Agreement rulebook that was finalized in Katowice in 2018 without the provisions related to carbon markets on which countries had major disagreements.Two other issues came to dominate the discussions at Madrid - one relating to the demand to enhance climate actions being currently taken, and the other about the need to make developed countries accountable to their climate obligations in the pre-2020 period.A number of countries - mainly the ones most threatened by climate change, such as small island states, but also some developed countries and civil society organisations - had been demanding that countries commit themselves to taking more climate actions in view of recent scientific assessments that the world was not doing enough to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. These countries and organisations had been pushing for provisions in the Madrid agreement that would call upon all the countries to update their climate action plans, called Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs, with greater commitments by next year.Countries such as India, China, and many others have been strongly resisting this. They have been arguing that it was more important to start delivering on the commitments already made in the past than make fresh commitments. It was in this context that these countries repeatedly raised the issue of unfulfilled promises of developed countries in the pre-2020 period. Under the Kyoto Protocol, the predecessor to the Paris Agreement, developed countries were mandated to make targeted cuts in their emissions, and also provide money and technology to the developing countries to help them fight climate change. But the developed countries have been way short of meeting these obligations.As a result, developing countries led by India, China and Brazil had been pushing for provisions that would hold the developed countries accountable to their past promises.When the first draft of the agreement came on Friday morning, all these options had been included. But that draft was heavily bracketed, each bracket representing a difference of opinion and different option on the table. The final agreement cannot have brackets. So when the revised draft was put before the negotiators on Saturday morning, many of the earlier options had been removed, triggering angry reactions from whoever was backing those.The European Union, Spain, Bangladesh, Belize, Colombia, Grenada and many others pointed out that the draft text did not strongly ask the countries to raise the ""ambition"" of their climate actions by next year, and this would unacceptable to them.""This was supposed to be a COP (Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the formal name of the climate meetings) of ambition. We do not see this ambition reflected anywhere,"" said the negotiator from Belize, while speaking on behalf of the group of small island countries.The EU representative said it would be ""impossible for EU to leave this COP without a satisfactory language on ambition"". Mexico said it was disappointed to see that there was no mention of NDCs being by next year. ""We would have failed the COP if we do not have provisions to enhance ambition,"" the Mexican negotiator said.Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Tuvalu also made similar remarks on absence of stronger provisions on raising of ambition of climate actions.Countries such as India and China, on the other hand, lamented the fact that a provision on creating a work programme to assess the performance of developed countries on their pre-2020 promises had been dropped. ""The problems we are facing today are not because of lack of intent but because of lack of implementation which is very glaringly visible in the unmet pre-2020 targets. The work programme was meant to address these gaps,"" India said.China said it had already made it clear that strong provisions on assessment of pre-2020 actions was ""very important for all developing countries"", and needed to be strongly reflected in the final agreement.The United States strongly objected to even a mention of assessment of pre-2020 actions and demanded that it be removed.Many countries had other problems as well. Saudi Arabia and Russia, for example, said they would not accept an agreement that acknowledged the Oceans report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change but ignored the Land Report by the same organisation. The IPCC's Oceans report was about the impact of climate change on oceans, while the other report was about how land systems and land-use affects and in turn is affected by climate change. The land report touches upon the sensitive subject of emissions from agricultural practices.While all this was being discussed, the draft text on carbon markets had not even been finalised. The provisions related to carbon markets have been deeply contested with India, Brazil, China and some other developing countries aligned on one side, and the developed countries, many small island countries, and civil society groups on the other side. When the draft text on carbon markets did make its appearance a little later on Saturday morning, it was promptly rejected by Belize and some other countries.\l"

The prime ministers advisor on climate change expressed these views here on Tuesday while delivering his keynote address as a keynote speaker at n event titled ""Setting Pakistan's Agenda for the 25th Session of the Conference of Parties (COP25) being organised in Spain this year from 2-13 December.The event focused on adaptation strategy. The three thematic areas of the event were climate change and human rights, the role of private sector in climate change and framing Pakistan's agenda for COP25 with focus on adaptation strategy. Given the realisation, we are assigned heightened importance to the protection of indigenous forest communities rights in out the countrys historically largest 10 Billion Tree Afforestation Programme (BTAP) and initiatives for conservation and protection of the existing forests, Malik Amin Aslam told the participants of the event.He said Experiences of several countries have shown that afforestation and forest protection programmes implemented without consultation with the local forest communities have only failed. Thus, efforts are being made to consultant and engage forest communities at all scales while implementing the 10 Billion Tree Afforestation Programme. Spelling out environment and climate change-related programmes of the present government, the premiers advisor Malik Amin Aslam told participants of the panel discussion that the present government has launched four major initiatives as a part of climate change mitigation and adaptation and fighting environmental degradation.Of them all the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami Programme is the largest afforestation programme, followed by Electric Vehicle policy recently approved by the Prime Minister Imran Khan, Clean Green Pakistan Programme and Recharge Pakistan Programme, promotion of clean energy cooking stoves as part of renewable energy programme and publish awareness-raising through climate change education programme. Thanks to increased understanding of the climate change risks and environmental issues, the people have now started to understand the concept of climate change and its impacts and possible solutions to increase their resilience to the climate vulnerability or risks, Malik Amin Aslam observed.He also informed the participants of the event that these environmental conservation and climate change-related programmes have been launched envisioned by the Prime Minister Imran Khan, who is highly concerned about the environmental and climate change problems being faced by the country and is committed to tackle them at all levels. Talking about Pakistans agenda to purse at COP25, Malik Amin Aslam told participants of the event Global Climate Fund (GCF) will be main focus of the Pakistani delegation and explore possible funding avenues for climate change mitigation and adaptation programmes to be implemented in future in Pakistan.He also recalled that recently Pakistan has been honoured to be co-chair of GCF, which is undoubtedly a big accomplishment and at the same time a big opportunity and responsibility. As GCF is the largest international climate change funding mechanism for poor countries, this honour of being GCFs co-chair will enable us at the COP25 in Spain to raise Pakistan's profile internationally as a climate-responsible and capable country, he told the participants.\l"

"COP25","India","COP25_India338","United Kingdom : Drax sets world-first ambition to become carbon negative by 2030","December 14, 2019 Saturday","TendersInfo","Leading British energy company, Drax Group Plc, will be the first company in the world to announce an ambition to become carbon negative when CEO Will Gardiner speaks at a Powering Past Coal Alliance event at COP 25 in Madrid, (Tuesday December 10, 2019).He will say that Drax has an ambition to become carbon negative by 2030, but doing so will depend on an effective negative emissions policy and investment framework for new technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). Being carbon negative means that Drax will be removing more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it produces throughout its operations creating a negative carbon footprint for the company within a decade.Drax is already running a successful BECCS pilot at its power station capturing a tonne of carbon dioxide every day. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the UK Committee on Climate Change agree that BECCS is critical to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Sustainable biomass is an important part of the UKs long-term energy mix. Combining this renewable fuel with carbon capture and storage technology on Draxs biomass generating units at its power station in North Yorkshire, England, means the Groups operations could capture 16 million tonnes of CO2 a year or more a significant proportion of the UKs target.Drax CEO Will Gardiner said:Draxs ambition is to be carbon negative by 2030. Having pioneered the use of sustainable biomass, Drax now produces 12% of the UKs renewable electricity. With the right negative emissions policy, we can do much more, removing millions of tonnes of emissions from the atmosphere each year.The UK Government is working on a policy and investment framework to encourage negative emissions technologies, which will enable the UK to be home to the worlds first carbon negative company. This is not just critical to beating the climate crisis, but also to enabling a just transition, protecting jobs and creating new opportunities for clean growth delivering for the economy as well as for the environment. In recent years Drax has undergone a world-leading transformation, becoming Europes largest decarbonisation project by converting two-thirds of its coal-fired power station to use sustainable biomass. In the first half of 2019, 94% of the power produced by Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire, England, was renewable delivering carbon savings of more than 80% compared to when it only used coal.The engineering skill and expertise at Drax which enabled this unique transformation is now pioneering ground-breaking negative emissions technologies. Earlier this year Drax became the only power generator in the world to have captured carbon dioxide from a 100% biomass feedstock using BECCS technology, through its successful pilot project. After closing its remaining two coal generating units at Drax Power Station by 2025 and using carbon capture technology on its biomass power generating units, its operations would become carbon negative by 2030.Will Gardiner will announce Draxs ambition when he speaks at COP25 in Madrid. Drax is a member of the Powering Past Coal Alliance, an initiative launched by the UK and Canadian governments, which seeks to end the use of unabated coal in power stations around the world by 2030. The Powering Past Coal Alliance wants to accelerate the transition away from unabated coal and Drax is supporting its work to encourage members to scale up their ambitions, and to create more collaboration, helping prospective new members to move forwards in using cleaner energy.\l"

Spain has stepped in and offered to host it on the same dates, December 2-13.

This will be the 25th edition of the meeting, hence COP25. It is the same meeting that, at COP3, delivered the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the first international agreement to fight climate change. The Kyoto Protocol was later deemed to be inadequate, and after several years of negotiations, COP21 in 2015 delivered the Paris Agreement.In subsequent years, countries have been trying to finalise the rules and procedures that will govern the implementation of the Paris Agreement. One of the most important tasks at the upcoming COP is to complete the negotiations over the rulebook.Hosts by rotationThe venue for the COP meeting is rotated among the five UN-identified regions - Africa, Asia-Pacific, Eastern Europe, Latin America and Caribbean, and Western Europe and Others. The countries in the region have to propose a candidate, and a host is usually decided at least two years in advance. If no one else agrees to do it, Bonn in Germany, as headquarters of the UNFCCC secretariat, has to step in and host the event.The rotation cycle has not been followed very strictly. The first and second COPs were both held in western Europe (Berlin and Geneva), and so were the fifth and sixth (Bonn and the Hague). After the 2012 COP in Doha, the event has not returned to Asia. That is because Fiji, the host in 2017, lacked the resources to organise an event of this scale; as a compromise, the event had to be held in Bonn under the Fijian presidency.Reluctant hostsEven before the ongoing unrest, Chile had been a reluctant host. It had agreed to host the event after much persuasion, and Santiago could be named the COP25 venue only towards the end of COP24 in Katowice, Poland, last year. Chile had been arguing that as hosts of the Asia Pacific Economic Conference this year, it had to organise year-round meetings, including leaders' summit in November, and that it would be difficult to organise another big event in December. Those APEC meetings too have been put off now.The only other contender from the region to host COP25 was Costa Rica, but it lacked the resources. And UNFCC was not very enthusiastic about another event at its headquarters.The host city incurs huge expenditure on the event, not all of which is reimbursed. Apart from the over 20,000 participants, the city has to make arrangements for visits by heads of states and governments, and other personalities. Side events and demonstrations invariably come with the conference, and the host city has to brace for such disruptions for more than two weeks. The event does help local economy, and tourism, but many countries do not see that as adequate incentive.Climate leadershipThere is another reason why some countries do not seem very enthusiastic about hosting the event. The host country presides over the conference, and as such is expected to demonstrate leadership in taking individual steps to combat climate change. For countries with smaller greenhouse gas emissions, this is not much of a problem, but such expectations explain why the US, China or Russia have not shown much interest in hosting the event. Neither have countries like Japan, Australia or Canada, generally considered climate laggards. Japan hosted the 1997 event that produced the Kyoto Protocol, but it also happened to be the first country to walk out of it in 2011. Canada hosted it in 2005. Australia, which too withdrew from Kyoto Protocol, has never hosted it. Spain will now host it for the first time, and so will the UK, in Glasgow next year.India, the third largest emitter, hosted the 2002 COP in New Delhi, much before climate change became this big.The European Union, which has a relatively strong climate change action plan, has hosted the most COP editions - 11 of 24 COPs, with Madrid now the 12th of 25. Germany and Poland have been hosts three times each.\l"

Nevertheless, ""net zero by 2050"" has become a new mantra in the year since the last CoP.France and Britain vied with each other in 2019 to become the first country to enshrine a net zero target in law.

The\~European Commission\~has just announced a Green New Deal, promising a similar law.One key cause of concern in the three laws passed this year is their misinterpretation of the goal set by the IPCC. 2050 is the target year for the world as a whole to reach net zero.Developed countries need to reach net zero earlier, around 2030, in keeping with the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities enshrined in the 1992\~UNFCCC and reiterated in the Paris Agreement of 2015.Another issue arises dues to the change from defining targets in terms of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to defining them in terms of CO2 emissions alone. Globally, CO2 accounted for 69 per cent of all GHG emissions in 2015, with the figure being 72-74 per cent for France and the UK.This means that their net zero targets are actually less ambitious than these countries' previous long term targets (see Greenhouse gas abatement in 2050 over 1990 levels), particularly in the case of the UK.Thus, the country's law is seemingly more comprehensive than the UK and France in covering all GHGs. But the country's large agricultural and livestock sector means that biogenic methane, which accounted for 36 per cent of its gross greenhouse emissions, is the country's largest contributor to\~GHG emissions; a position held in most other countries by the power or transport sectors. Indeed New Zealand is the world's largest emitter of methane per capita, emitting over six times the global average.Even the lower limit for biogenic methane abatement has been called ""eye-wateringly hard for farmers to achieve"" by the country's Federated Farmers. Nevertheless, even if New Zealand abates its biogenic methane emissions by the upper limit, it will have abated\~GHG emissions by barely 56 per cent over 1990 levels (see Greenhouse gas abatement in 2050 over 1990 levels under New Zealand's net zero law).This is a far cry from Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's claim that the law puts New Zealand on ""the right side of history"". In this context, the European Commission's Green New Deal's ambigously-worded targets of 'climate neutrality' is concerning.Leaders have countered this criticism by arguing that abatement of other\~GHGs would continue; France's minister for the ecological transition Fran\'e7ois De Rugy argued that the new law would lead to an 87.5 per cent reduction in\~GHG emissions, higher than the previous target of 75 per cent.Nevertheless, the fact that a target for abatement of\~GHGs as a whole is no longer enshrined in law (as it once was in the UK) is a cause for concern. The IPCC's recommendations on carbon abatement depend critically on the rate of reduction of other GHGs. The new net zero laws, which provide no way of ensuring that these other gases reduce at the required rate, are thus not in keeping with the spirit of net zero.\l"

Thank you so much for joining us today for this very special High-Level Event on the Climate Crisis and Childrens Rights.""My name is Paloma Escudero. I am the Global Director of Communication at UNICEF.""I am delighted to be welcoming you to an event where children are taking centre stage and leading all of us in a dialogue about the impact of the climate crisis on their lives. The presence of Theo, Pablo, Camila, Penelope, Nkosi and Sara today reminds us that the demands we are hearing from young people on the streets all over the world need to be reflected in the corridors of power in Madrid.""I am also delighted to welcome representatives of governments who are committed to putting children at the heart of climate policies. Chile, Costa Rica, Fiji, Luxembourg, Monaco, Nigeria, Peru and Spain have indeed signed the declaration we are launching today. This Intergovernmental Declaration on Children, Youth and Climate Change is a historic step towards accelerating inclusive, child-responsive climate policies policies that protect, respect and fulfill the rights of societys most vulnerable, and enhance the participation of young people in the decisions that affect them.""Why is this Declaration important? For two reasons:""1. The climate crisis is a child rights crisis: We cannot lose sight of this fact, particularly as the world celebrates the 30-year anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child this year, and of course, Human Rights Day tomorrow. From hurricanes to droughts to floods to wildfires, the consequences of the climate crisis are all around us, affecting children the most and threatening their health, education, protection and very survival. Let me give you an example. Half a billion children live in areas at extremely high risk of floods due to extreme weather events such as cyclones, hurricanes and storms, as well as rising sea levels. Just a few days ago UNICEF released a report saying that the number of children forced to leave their homes because of storms in the Caribbean increased six times in the periods 2009-2013 and 2014-2018.""2. The second reason why this Declaration is important is that, right now only 42% of national climate plans mention children or youth, and only 22% mention children explicitly. We must do better than that! As member states continue to move forward in the implementation of the Paris Agreement, they have a unique window of opportunity to put children front and centre. Because, as the Secretary General said here last week, the climate crisis is getting closer and closer to the point of no return.""This is why it is imperative that we put children at the heart of climate policies. And why it is urgent that we invest in the practical solutions that protect children from the effects of climate change.""With the right technology and funding, we can preserve supplies of clean, safe ground water so that children are not at risk of killer diseases.""With long-term investments, we can build more resilient communities that are able to withstand extreme weather events, so that if a massive storm, flood or wildfire happens, they can recover quickly, and children are not uprooted from home and school.""With the right kind of education, children can grow up knowing how to create sustainable communities, become leaders of sustainable businesses and live sustainable lifestyles.""With a massive programme to deliver solar-power health centres, schools and other essential services, we can create cleaner, cheaper and more sustainable facilities for children around the world.""There is reason for hope. We still have a chance to turn things around. No - not just a chance. An obligation. A duty. Because children have a right to inherit a healthy planet.""\l"

Our collective failure to act early and hard on climate change means we now must deliver deep cuts to emissions  over 7% each year, if we break it down evenly over the next decade, said Inger Andersen, UNEP's executive director. If we don't do this, the 1.5\'b0C goal will be out of reach before 2030, she said in a statement. Her remarks ahead of assume significance as the world has already recorded 1.1C of global average temperature rise above pre-industrial (1850-1900) levels and there is little widow available to increase GHG emissions further.It is expected that the countries during December 2-13 COP25 in Madrid would try to find a common ground to raise their climate action targets by 2020 to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. Over 195 countries had together in 2015 agreed to take climate actions to keep the global average temperature rise within 2C by 2100 and make efforts to limit the increase to 1.5C.Full report on HYPERLINK www.toi.in\l"

According to him, around 50% of Indonesia's population lives in rural areas with around 83,000 villages. ""The population of Indonesians living in rural areas is about 3 times the population of Spain,"" he said while giving a keynote address at a panel discussion at the Indonesian Pavilion at the 25th COP UNFCCC Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain, Thursday (5/12/2019).That fact is what drives the government to develop the climate village program (Proklim). Through Proklim, communities at the village level are fostered to strengthen the ability to adapt to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, the Proklim also had an impact on the welfare of the villagers and helped empower women.""In order for this program to run sustainably, it needs support from various stakeholders, including the private sector,"" said the Deputy Minister.APP Sinar Mas Chief Sustainability Officer Elim Sritaba said that he fully supports the government's steps in developing the Proklim. He explained, APP Sinar Mas built a program known as Desa Makmur Peduli Api (DMPA) which provided education about the important role of village communities in protecting forests. Not only that, APP Sinar Mas also provides financial and technical assistance to support rural communities, moving from the slash-and-burn method to the sustainable agroforestry method. ""APP Sinar Mas believes that when a village is prosperous, the forest will also be sustainable,"" said Elim Sritaba.APP Sinar Mas has invested more than Rp. 46 billion in the DMPA program. Now, more than 18,040 households in more than 312 villages benefit from the program. ""We are targeting to reach a total of 500 villages by the end of 2020,"" Elim continued.A total of 78 DMPA target villages have been registered in the Proklim program. Of the entire village, 24 villages were awarded the Main Proklim Award and 46 other DMPA villages were awarded the Proklim Madya award, for successfully carrying out ongoing efforts to adapt to and mitigate climate change. Elim said, currently APP Sinar Mas is working with a number of organizations to develop the program from the local to the international scale.Meanwhile the Indonesian Country Director of the Center for People and Forest Forest Gamma Galudra stressed the importance of collaboration between all parties to facilitate capacity building in village communities. According to him, support from the private sector such as that conducted by APP Sinarmas had a very positive impact on strengthening the climate program that had been initiated by the Indonesian government.According to Gamma, closer collaboration between stakeholders, particularly in optimizing institutional capacity, access to capital, and access to product marketing, can be the key to improving climate resilience at the village level.\l"

Her plain pink dress had no frills, just like her. Head down with a nervous yet sanguine smile, she walked to the main stage as easily as she had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to reach New York on a zero-emissions sailboat.The loud and feisty  No that answered her question from the two-lakh New Yorkians, who had taken part in the climate march, spoke not just of the top brass's passivity but also her rising prominence. Until last year's United Nations held in Poland, many would walk past her, musing what a  child is doing at a high-level meet .But things changed as fast as the climate. On Friday, at the Battery Park in New York, over 2.5 lakh people across the globe had turned the spotlight on her. A naive climate activist? Not anymore. Greta Thunberg on Friday made history by bringing around four million people across the globe to fight for one cause, the crisis of climate change. From Melbourne to Bengaluru to Istanbul to Paris to New York, thousands of young people passionate about the environment sought change from their country's leaders.Addressing the massive crowd in New York after the first-of-its-kind climate march, Thunberg chose to be brief but bold with her speech.  We have not taken to the streets, sacrificing our education, for the adults to take selfies with us and tell us that they really admire what we are doing. We are doing this to wake up the leaders because we deserve a safe future, she said.For the  small group of people threatened by us , Thunberg's message on behalf of the global youth was loud and clear:  We have some very bad news for you  this is only the beginning. Change is coming whether they like it or not. The loud cheers from the crowd motivated the teenager to go on.  What's the point of educating ourselves or learning facts when people on power refuse to listen to the educated? Where I come from (Sweden), things are very different from here. But when it comes to climate and ecological emergency, it's pretty much the same everywhere, said Thunberg, adding that empty promises and inaction are the same wherever she went.Thunberg, who is all set to speak at the UN Youth Climate Summit on Saturday, added that citizens should do everything in their power to stop the climate crisis.  We are not just some young people skipping school or adults missing on their work. We are awaiting a wave of change, her final words rippled a strong wave of outrage among the protestors. But as promised, it all went off peacefully.\l"

"COP25","India","COP25_India358","Climate Emergency CoP 25: Its market versus market in Madrid","December 6, 2019 Friday","Down To Earth","India, Dec. 6 -- Carbon market mechanism is turning into a big negotiation thornThe ghost of pre-2020 carbon market mechanism has started to haunt the Madrid negotiations over the new climate market mechanism proposed for the post-2020 Paris regime. The negotiations for the new carbon market regime, which falls under Article 6 of the Paris agreement, will take centre stage along with the other outstanding issue of ""Loss and Damage"" before the agreement gets rolling on ground.According to sources, some developing countries, in private discussions, have already raised the demand that the Kyoto Protocol phase II should be pushed back for couple of years to ensure that the developed countries complete their commitments under the protocol. Developing countries are pointing out that the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, which officialises the second commitment period from 2013 to 2020, is yet to be ratified by requisite number of developed countries and hence did not get started on ground, though its scheduled closure has almost reached.While developed countries are mostly pushing for a new market-based carbon cut mechanism post-2020, developing countries, led by India, want the developed world to first fulfill their emission reduction commitments made under the Kyoto Protocol before finalising a new market mechanism. India, supported by like-minded developing countries, and Brazil are also demanding that certified emission reductions or CERs, a typed of carbon credits issued under the Kyoto protocol, should either be valid under the Paris regime or the developing countries should be compensated for discontinuing them.India still has 750 million CERs, which could not be sold, as per a senior Indian delegation member. ""It is not only the issue of money but also of trust and credibility of the UN process as the certificates were generated under UNFCCC programme and Kyoto protocol mandate. How can we now conveniently forget CERs built under pre-2020 regime and embrace post-2020 Paris agreement's similar market-based approach. Who will guarantee that the same thing will not repeat post-2020?"" asks the delegate. Sources say that developing countries might demand an extension of the Kyoto Protocol, if untraded CERs do not bear fruit.Under the clean development mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto protocol, developed countries could buy CERs from developing countries to meet their emissions commitments. Initially, the market had shot up when developed countries were willing to pay US$20 for 1 tonne of carbon. The market subsequently crashed when the developed countries chose to ignore their commitments under Kyoto phase II and stopped trading in CERs, which fell to less than a dollar for 1 tonne carbon.The impact was felt by several Indian companies, including the public sector, which invested on emission cuts to earn CER certificates. India and China hold the maximum untraded CERs but other developing countries also have substantial amounts of CERs. The total global untraded CER number stands around 4 billion.""They (old CERs) are mostly junk. There should not be any carry over as they will lead to double accounting. We should make a fresh start under the Paris agreement,"" says Sam Van den plas, policy director, Carbon Market Watch. Others disagree. ""India has valid logic but both sides should weigh the options on table and reach to a solution,"" says Sanjay Vasisht of Climate Action Network South Asia (CANSA). He points out that till now there has been hardly any forward movement in Article 6 negotiation apart from a new text that came out on Wednesday. ""The number of pages was reduced, so are the brackets (which mean no agreement). The text has become sharper but all contentious issues are still there,"" says Vashist. The unresolved issues around CERs, apart from the carry forward controversy, include double accounting of such emissions as they were created before 2020, consideration of human rights safeguard in the process, market versus non-market mechanism promoted by Bolivia and Venezuela and silently supported by China, as well as the possible limits of trading under the new carbon market set up.A fresh negotiation text is set to come out before the political leaders as they start negotiations next week.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Down to Earth.

We're aiming high in terms of ambition with the European Green Deal.It will:protect our environment;increase investment in the most competitive technologies;and give our people a better quality of life.Fulfilling this ambition will not be cheap. It will require massive levels of investments, especially from the private sector. Europe was the first region to legislate properly in sustainable finance. I hope that this will inspire other regions too. Just now, we are in the final stage of reaching an agreement on an EU classification system - to define which economic activities are sustainable.When agreed, this will be the single most important piece of EU legislation for sustainable finance so far. It will create a common language for what qualifies as a green and sustainable investment. It will help investors, industry and policymakers to identify green investment opportunities. We see it as the basis for an EU green bond standard and EU ecolabel for retail financial products. I believe that this new green standard' will change investment flows towards green. And we do hope it will soon become a global standard. Next year, after consulting widely, I will present an updated green financing strategy.On sustainability reporting, we will propose regulatory changes for companies to provide information on their sustainability risks and opportunities. We will explore standards and labels for other financial products, such as green loans and mortgages for energy-efficient housing. Lastly: Europe cannot do this alone. If the world moves together, we will move faster. That is why we recently launched the International Platform on Sustainable Finance. It is open for any like-minded country to join and I call on all countries represented here today to do so.\l"
"COP25","India","COP25_India360","India to showcase achievements at UN climate summit","December 11, 2019 Wednesday","IANS-English","Madrid, Dec 8 (IANS) India will highlight its achievements in climate action during the ongoing UN Climate Change Conference (COP25) negotiations in the Spanish capital on Monday. This comes as part of the processes set up in 2010 to enhance transparency in addressing climate change. The so-called multilateral assessment for developed countries and facilitative sharing of views (FSV) for developing countries provide multilateral fora for countries to showcase their achievements in climate action and engage in a constructive exchange of views. Both the multilateral assessment and facilitative sharing of views processes serve as foundations of the enhanced transparency framework under the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement, which represents an important component of increasing ambition to tackle climate change by building trust and confidence that countries are taking actions. In the facilitative sharing of views, Indian along with five developing countries -- Chile, Ghana, Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia -- will present updates on climate actions and what is needed to strengthen their capacities. Chile is the first, and until now the only country to participate in the facilitative sharing of views for the third time, which underscores the country's efforts to strengthen climate transparency. At the multilateral assessment, 10 developed countries - Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Kazakhstan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Portugal and Switzerland a"" will present their actions to meet their 2020 climate targets. Countries under the multilateral assessment will be sharing their achievements, innovative climate actions and experiences in meeting the 2020 climate targets. Among those achievements is New Zealand's recently passed ""zero carbon"" law that aims to make the country almost carbon neutral by 2050. The multilateral assessment process also allows all 197 Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to ask questions to clarify a country's emission reduction actions and greenhouse gas trends and projections, based on the national reports and their review reports. Both the processes help expand the knowledge base and build trust in addressing climate change as they enable countries to better understand where they are in terms of climate actions and how to prioritize further actions and support. Indian Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar, who is leading the delegation in the high-level segment of COP25, told this visiting IANS correspondent that India is participating with a constructive and positive outlook and working towards protecting long-term development interests. ""In the last four years, India is leading from the front in Climate Action. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was first to propose Solar Alliance and Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure,"" he said. ""India's ambitious renewable energy program of 450 GW has attracted world attention as it is the largest renewable programme in the world,"" he said, adding ""we are one of the few countries which has increased tree cover in and outside forest."" According to Javadekar, who reached here on Saturday, India has reduced its emission intensity by 22 per cent over 2005. The Indian Union Cabinet, chaired by Modi, in the run-up to COP25 approved the negotiating stand of India.COP25 is an important summit as countries prepare to move from pre-2020 period under the Kyoto Protocol to post-2020 period under the Paris Agreement. In addition to International Solar Alliance, two new initiatives have been launched by India as part of its efforts to mobilize world on climate action. These include Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, which will serve as a platform to generate and exchange knowledge on different aspects of climate and disaster resilient infrastructure and Leadership Group for Industry Transition launched jointly by India and Sweden, which will provide a platform for government and the private sector in different countries to work together on accelerating low carbon growth. India has been ambitious in its actions and has emphasized that developed countries should take lead in undertaking ambitious actions and fulfil their climate finance commitments of mobilizing $100 billion per annum by 2020 and progressively and substantially scale up their financial support to inform Parties for future action through nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Indian negotiators told IANS that at the two-day high-level talks beginning on December 10 India will further stress upon need for fulfilling pre-2020 commitments by developed countries and that pre-2020 implementation gaps should not present an additional burden to developing countries in the post-2020 period. According to Climate Risk Index 2020, an annual report by Germanwatch released here last week, India has also been badly affected by climate change, ranking fifth in the overall global vulnerability index in 2018, ranked first in terms of fatalities and second in the world in terms of losses in millions of dollars. India's overall ranking has drastically fallen from 14th in 2017, to fifth in 2018. (Vishal Gulati is in Madrid to cover COP25. He can be contacted at HYPERLINK vishal.g@ians.in) --IANS\l"

Though 65 countries, including many European Union (EU) nations  France, Germany, Italy and UK  figured in the list of the nations which will work on 'net zero emissions' by 2050, they hardly account for 37% of the global emissions.Top emitters such as China, US and India as well as other countries like Russia, Japan and Australia have, so far, not spelt out their intent on either working for 'net-zero emissions' or looking to ratchet up their climate action targets by 2020.Issues of putting a price on carbon and how the countries can trade in it if they have already cut their emissions more than the amount they had pledged are covered under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.

""The Madrid conference has failed to agree on how we will implement the Paris Agreement. The EU and Slovenia insist that we must act now if we want to limit the warming of the atmosphere to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The biggest polluters have a moral duty to start warning scientists to take serious and appropriate action. ""Member of the Slovenian delegation to COP25 Eva ?ernigoj explains that the negotiations in Madrid have been extremely demanding and time-consuming. Countries wanted to make progress in the talks, but in the end, the views on the subject were too different. Despite repeated extensions, COP25 did not bring the desired progress for us - the adoption of the entire Book of Rules for the Implementation of the Paris Agreement and thus the closure of Article 6. It also failed to show a clear path to increase countries' ambitions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. All this will now wait for the next meeting - COP26, which will be in Glasgow in a bad year.While a number of items on the agenda have been adopted, progress does not reflect the urgency and action we need as a planet in the fight against the climate crisis. Despite a poor start, progress has been made on the Gender Action Plan and on recognizing the importance of the oceans in relation to climate change. The second review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage as a result of climate change has also been successfully completed.However, it was quickly realized that there would be no progress on this COP in the area of ??transparency. Until the last, it was not known whether, after years of hard work and two intense weeks of Article 6 negotiations, we would nevertheless adopt a complete book of rules. That didn't work out for us this time, ""said Eva Chernigoj.In order to successfully overcome the climate crisis, countries will need to raise their ambitions and come up with clear plans for achieving the goals. The rules must also be clear, transparent and safeguarding human rights and ensuring environmental integrity in order to truly achieve their purpose.This week, the EU adopted the European Green Deal and the goal of becoming the first carbon-neutral continent by 2050. It remains, first and foremost, in the fight against climate change. Even before the adoption of EU-level documents, Slovenia has set itself a goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. This commitment will also be reflected in the Climate Policy Act and the Long-term Climate Strategy prepared by the MESP. Time is running out and we hope that other countries around the world will follow. Only in this way can we achieve the global progress we need.\l"

The overshoot figure for oil production were 16 per cent and 59 per cent respectively, while for gas, they were 14 per cent and 70 per cent.Despite this, the global fossil fuel phase-out is not on the explicit agenda for the ongoing 25th Conference of Parties on climate change (CoP) that is underway in Madrid, Spain.Nevertheless, the large reductions in fossil fuel combustion demanded by both the 1.5\'b0\~and 2\~\'b0C\~targets, if implemented, will mean a huge impact on communities engaged in the production of fossil fuels.

Progress indeed needs to be made on response measures, but the focus needs to be on the needs of poorer developing countries.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Down to Earth.

"COP25","India","COP25_India374","Indonesia : Religion Has Great Power to Control Climate Change","December 21, 2019 Saturday","TendersInfo","Climate change is not only about temperature changes, but more importantly it involves changing belief systems and social attitudes in caring for the earth and natural resources. This was conveyed by Nana Firman, Green Faith Muslim Coordinator in America, when opening the Interfaith session at the Indonesia Pavilion UNFCCC COP-25 in Madrid.Religion has the potential to move mankind to control climate change. This was proven through a number of concrete actions in various parts of the world.Wahid Foundation Director Yenny Wahid stated, the power of religion to move people to things that are abstract. Call it a matter of heaven and hell that is physically unknown.On the other hand, climate change that is actually happening, has not been able to mobilize humanity massively to take action to prevent the release of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.For this reason, Yenny invited to optimize the role of religion and its people. ""I invite all to move to take action to control climate change,"" said Wahid Foundation Director Yenny Wahid after being a speaker at the Indonesian Pavilion at the UNFCCC COP25 Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain, Monday (9/12/2019).According to Yenny, efforts to move humanity to take action in controlling climate change are wrong if only using a scientific approach. According to him, human beings should also be touched by their hearts and feelings to take concrete actions. The ability to touch the emotions of humanity is owned by religion. ""It cannot be just a fact, it must also touch its emotions,"" Yenny said.He said, so far there have often been conflicts between religious groups and those who glorify science. Call it in the discussion about the origins of humans. Groups that believe humans evolved from apes often contradicted the concept of human creation taught by religion. But certainly, Yenny said, if all humanity continues the current lifestyle that is wasteful of GHG emissions, climate disasters such as floods will occur. ""When that happens, there is no Noah's boat that will help us,"" he said.The great potential of religion in controlling climate change is because about 80% of humanity on earth currently embraces religion. Yenny also said, so that the role of religion can be optimal, religious organizations and religious leaders must be involved as parties in controlling climate change. They must also be educated and facilitated so that they understand the causes and impacts of climate change.""Religious leaders can spread new propaganda about the threat of climate change,"" he said.Moreover, various religions in the world actually teach about the need to protect the environment. In Islamic teachings, there is the concept of human beings as khilafahs who must take leadership in protecting the earth. In Sikh religion, the concept also exists and must be practiced by all of its followers.At present there have been many concrete actions carried out by religious groups. Yenny gave an example when attending a meeting of ulemas in Oman discussed about fiqh (Islamic law) saving water. He said, there are also many synagogues that are now implementing energy savings and utilizing clean energy. While churches, many are investing in projects that have an impact on controlling climate change.According to Yenny, the phenomenon of the involvement of religious groups in controlling climate change also occurs in Indonesia. The two largest Muslim organizations in Indonesia have collaborated with KLHK. The two organizations, Nahdatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah, often carry out actions that benefit the environment, such as planting mangroves, recycling waste, and not using disposable plastic.He hopes such a role can continue to be strengthened. ""We are fortunate that the collaboration between the government and community organizations in Indonesia is close,"" he said.\l"

In 2016, it was ranked sixth on the Climate Risk Index.When it comes to the Rohingya, the location of the community's refugee camps in Bangladesh exposes them to risks. After the initial influx of Rohingya refugees, trees were cut all at once to accommodate more people, leading to deforestation. This has caused an increase to landslide possibility in the mountains during monsoon.Indigenous communities, many of whom also live in coastal areas, are at a similar risk.This intersectionality remains at the heart of the solutions and needs to be brought into focus when thinking of ways to address climate risks in these countries. As experts on the ground in Bangladesh have pointed out, at the core of climate resilience is the understanding of how it affects various communities - who do not often get a seat at the discussion table - differently.For Sabnam, this remains the focus of the journey ahead - to ensure Bangladesh is not ""forgotten along the way after the Climate Strike"".Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Bangladesh Monitor.

"COP25","India","COP25_India387","Run-up to CoP25 Santiago: Are global transport emissions on course?","October 28, 2019 Monday","Down To Earth","India, Oct. 28 -- This is the first article in a series on global sectoral emissions and the progress on mitigation action in the build-up to 25th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate ChangeTransportation accounted for over 24 per cent of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fuel combustion in 2016, making it the second-largest sectoral emitter after the ""electricity and heat production"" category.Of the total emissions from transport in 2010, road transport accounted for 72.1 per cent, shipping accounted for 9.3 per cent, international aviation accounted for 6.5 per cent, domestic aviation accounted for 4.1 per cent, rail accounted for 1.2 per cent ( see figure ).It bears mentioning that emission reductions in the shipping and international aviation sectors have been entrusted respectively to the International Maritime Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization, and thus fall outside the ambit of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.Share of various modes in global transport emissions, 2010Source: Fifth Assessment Report, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2014Transportation emissions are of concern not just because they constitute nearly a quarter of global emissions but also because they tend to rise faster than emissions as a whole as countries become richer.This is because when developing countries become richer, there is a consequent increase not just in the demand for transport but also in the capacity to employ more carbon intensive means to fulfill it; for example, by using private cars rather than public transport.So while it goes without saying that rich countries had higher transportation emissions compared to poor ones, it bears mentioning that transportation also accounts for a higher share of national emissions in rich countries.Thus in 2016, 29 per cent of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion in Kyoto Annex I countries were from transportation, compared to only 17 per cent in Kyoto non-Annex I countries. For India, the figure stood at about 13 per cent.Global transport emissions are growing, even in rich countries like the United States where transport has now displaced power as the largest sectoral emitter. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), transport emissions need to peak by 2020 and fall thereafter to be consistent with the Paris Agreement. What needs to be done to reduce transport emissions and how is the world faring on the same?Status updateAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s 2014 Fifth Assessment Report, besides urban redesign, the key strategies for decarbonising transport consist of avoiding journeys, modal shift to lower carbon transport (including walking, cycling and public transport), increasing energy efficiency and reducing the carbon intensity of fuels.Over the longer term, it emphasised the importance of urban (re) development. As on all climate strategies centered on consumption reduction, there has been little overall progress on avoidance; between 2000 and 2017, passenger kilometres travelled increased by 74 per cent globally, while freight kilometre-tonnage increased by 68 per cent.Though passenger kilometres remained stable in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) during the same period, they have not fallen as their high per capita consumption would require.In addition to being central to the very limited mitigation strategy in the aviation and shipping sectors, biofuels are also blended into petrol and diesel used in road vehicles. While the European Union and other countries consider biofuels as zero carbon, there are concerns that biofuel production leads to significant indirect emissions through deforestation and land use change; it may also divert land away from food production.In contrast to this continuing hegemony of biofuels, the share of electricity (renewable or otherwise) in global transportation energy consumption increased only marginally from 0.7 per cent to one per cent between 2000 and 2015. Electrification as a mitigation strategy relies heavily on rapid decarbonisation of the grid.Indeed, emission reductions by the adoption of electric vehicles may be meagre or even negative in many situations. On electric cars, Norway led the world with a electric car market share of 46 per cent in 2018; the global average is still in the low single digits, a share that is expected to rapidly grow.Low ranges limit the potential of electrification for trucks and busses, though cities and companies are experimenting with electric and hydrogen vehicles.On modal shift too, there has been little progress. Globally, the share of road freight (the more inefficient) actually increased from 12 per cent to 22 per cent between 2000 and 2015, with the share of the more efficient rail being about 70 per cent in Russia and 35 per cent in India and China, compared to about 10 per cent globally in 2014. This had stagnated since the turn fo the century.Public transport's share has stagnated in OECD countries since around 2000, standing at 27 per cent in 2010. While the figure stood at 44 perf cent in non-OECD countries, their growing urban population has meant that per capita public transport use has actually decl"

"COP25","India","COP25_India390","Explained: What it means to host UN convention on climate change?","November 2, 2019 Saturday","Indian Express","Chile has pulled out as hosts of annual climate change event, citing unrest at home, and Spain has now stepped in. How is the host decided, and why are some countries not enthusiastic about that role?Chile, the designated host for this year's UN climate change conference, has said it would not be able to organise the December event because of political unrest at home. Spain has stepped in and offered to host it on the same dates, December 2-13. Spain's offer was accepted on Friday evening, and Madrid now faces the herculean task of making arrangements for the two-week event, which has over 20,000 delegates and attendees every year.Explained | Why Chile can't host the COP25 climate conferenceThe year-end conference, called COP (Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change), have been held since 1995, and never been postponed.COP25. It is the same meeting that, at COP3, delivered the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the first international agreement to fight climate change. The Kyoto Protocol was later deemed to be inadequate, and after several years of negotiations, COP21 in 2015 delivered the Paris Agreement.In subsequent years, countries have been trying to finalise the rules and procedures that will govern the implementation of the Paris Agreement. One of the most important tasks at the upcoming COP is to complete the negotiations over the rulebook.The venue for the COP meeting is rotated among the five UN-identified regions - Africa, Asia-Pacific, Eastern Europe, Latin America and Caribbean, and Western Europe and Others. The countries in the region have to propose a candidate, and a host is usually decided at least two years in advance. If no one else agrees to do it, Bonn in Germany, as headquarters of the UNFCCC secretariat, has to step in and host the event.The rotation cycle has not been followed very strictly. The first and second COPs were both held in western Europe (Berlin and Geneva), and so were the fifth and sixth (Bonn and the Hague). After the 2012 COP in Doha, the event has not returned to Asia. That is because Fiji, the host in 2017, lacked the resources to organise an event of this scale; as a compromise, the event had to be held in Bonn under the Fijian presidency.Even before the ongoing unrest, Chile had been a reluctant host. It had agreed to host the event after much persuasion, and Santiago could be named the COP25 venue only towards the end of COP24 in Katowice, Poland, last year. Chile had been arguing that as hosts of the Asia Pacific Economic Conference this year, it had to organise year-round meetings, including leaders' summit in November, and that it would be difficult to organise another big event in December. Those APEC meetings too have been put off now.The only other contender from the region to host COP25 was Costa Rica, but it lacked the resources. And UNFCC was not very enthusiastic about another event at its headquarters.The host city incurs huge expenditure on the event, not all of which is reimbursed. Apart from the over 20,000 participants, the city has to make arrangements for visits by heads of states and governments, and other personalities. Side events and demonstrations invariably come with the conference, and the host city has to brace for such disruptions for more than two weeks. The event does help local economy, and tourism, but many countries do not see that as adequate incentive.There is another reason why some countries do not seem very enthusiastic about hosting the event. The host country presides over the conference, and as such is expected to demonstrate leadership in taking individual steps to combat climate change. For countries with smaller greenhouse gas emissions, this is not much of a problem, but such expectations explain why the US, China or Russia have not shown much interest in hosting the event. Neither have countries like Japan, Australia or Canada, generally considered climate laggards. Japan hosted the 1997 event that produced the Kyoto Protocol, but it also happened to be the first country to walk out of it in 2011. Canada hosted it in 2005. Australia, which too withdrew from Kyoto Protocol, has never hosted it. Spain will now host it for the first time, and so will the UK, in Glasgow next year.India, the third largest emitter, hosted the 2002 COP in New Delhi, much before climate change became this big.The European Union, which has a relatively strong climate change action plan, has hosted the most COP editions - 11 of 24 COPs, with Madrid now the 12th of 25. Germany and Poland have been hosts three times each.\l"

The loan is part of the facility arranged by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to finance IEnovas solar power generation portfolio and through which both IFC and the North American Development Bank (NADB) committed loans to IEnova of US$100 million each in November 2019. Not only will this loan be the first co-financing project with the NADB; it is also JICAs first loan under the Green Loan Principles (Note 1). Furthermore, this loan is based on the Memorandum of Understanding () on JICAs cooperation with the IFC in May 2017 to facilitate co-financing for the private sector in developing countries.At COP21 (2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference), the Mexican government set a target to reduce CO2 emissions by 22% compared to the projected CO2 emission level as of 2030. Additionally, the Energy Transition Law stipulates that the government has set a target to increase the share of renewable energy to 35% by 2024 and 60% by 2050.IEnova is one of the countrys largest private energy company, founded in 1996. In 2015, IEnova entered the business of renewable energy. As of 2019, the company boasted a renewable energy capacity of 658MW, and are planning to expand their business in the future. In the case of the Pima Solar power generation project, which is one of IEnovas solar power generation projects, the company signed the first long-term electric supply contract between a private generator and an industrial client in Mexico. Furthermore, the company has formulated a management strategy that takes environmental and social considerations into account, is working to increase the transparency of their business, and has been included in the Sustainable Index (Note 2) of the Mexican Stock Exchange for the fifth consecutive year, the first energy infrastructure company to be included.This project will contribute to mitigate the impact of climate change by increasing the supply of electricity, promoting renewable energy, and diversifying power sources in Mexico through support for IEnovas photovoltaic power generation projects.

The increase in global average temperature by 1 degC, since industrialisation began, is already causing havoc, dwarfing the preparedness of all countries.The unprecedented heatwaves, drought, forest fires, super charged cyclones and rapidly rising seas are affecting millions of people and damaging public and private property worth billions of dollars every year. Despite contributing little to the crisis, developing countries predominantly stand to lose more due to their economic situation and their disadvantageous geographical position on the globe.The aspirational political target of keeping the temperature to ""well below 2 degC "" in the Paris Agreement has been blown away by a special report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released last October. The report warns of catastrophic impacts if the 1.5 degC target is allowed to be breached. Yet, it recognises that the formidable target can be achieved by almost halving the emissions by 2030 and then becoming carbon neutral in the following two decades.Such a challenging target can be achieved only when countries agree to cut the ""cake"" of remaining carbon budget equitably. The bottom-up approach of setting ""nationally determined"" targets has put us on a dangerous pathway to 3 to 4 degC of warming.Rich industrialised countries that have disproportionately used up the ecological resources are far away from meeting the fair share of climate action. The series of landmark reports released by the civil society over the past few years revealed that the initial targets of biggest historical emitters like the US and the European Union amount to about a fifth of their fair share, in terms of both capacity and responsibility. Under President Donald Trump, the US has gone downhill by junking even its meagre commitment of emission reduction and providing climate finance and has now formally initiated the process to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.The civil society analysis concludes that China's pledge exceeds its fair share and India's climate action plan is roughly in l"

On the other hand, its expected to increase fuel costs.We have to embrace the change to create a healthier planet for all of us, said UNCTAD Deputy Secretary-General Isabelle Durant, who is leading the organizations delegation to the UN Climate Change Conference (COP25) in Madrid, Spain.Trade can be a driver for climate action, she said.Getting to zero emissionsUNCTAD is part of the Getting to Zero Coalition that is committed to getting commercially viable deep sea zero-emission vessels powered by zero emission fuels into operation by 2030.The coalition will hold an event on sustainable maritime transport during COP25 on 10 December. The event will examine the prospects of zero-emissions shipping for developing countries and large ocean states or small island developing states (SIDS).UNCTAD is also cooperating with the World Bank and the IMO to assess the potential implications of carbon dioxide reduction measures on developing countries.The same countries that suffer most from climate change might also be the ones that would potentially suffer from higher shipping costs due to more expensive fuel, Ms. Durant said.This raises the question of inequality, she said.According to her, global action against climate change should consider this inequality and ensure the special needs of the most vulnerable economies are duly considered in the quest to reduce shipping emissions to zero.Building resilience and adaptationDiscussions at COP25 are also focused on how to bolster actions on resilience and adaption in the face of the severe impacts of the climate emergency.A round table discussion on accelerating action to build a resilient world at 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming is scheduled for 10 December.Ms. Durant, who will participate in the round table discussion, cited the case of the Bahamas, where Hurricane Dorian, the most intense tropical cyclone on record to strike the country.It resulted in losses worth US$3.4 billion, wiping out over a quarter of the countrys gross domestic product.Or Namibia, which is experiencing its worst drought in 90 years. The drought has ravaged agricultural production, undermined export crops, triggered food shortages and put pressure on the countrys debt, undermining years of efforts to reduce it.In both cases, what needs to be addressed is the development and economic approach to climate and disaster resilience, Ms. Durant said.Required measures include economic diversification, which increases the ability of economies to adapt to shocks.In addition, infrastructure should be built and operated in a way that anticipates, prepares for, and adapts to changing climate conditions, Ms. Durant said.SIDS are already seeing the devastating effects of climate change, including sea-level rise and coastal erosion, which are affecting their infrastructure and economies.These countries remain at risk because they do not have the finances to firstly mitigate, and critically, to adapt their infrastructure.Focus on coastal transport infrastructureBuilding the climate-resilience of global ports is of strategic economic and human importance, Ms. Durant said, given the potential economic implications of climate-related damage, disruption and delay.Ms. Durant will be on the panel of a high-level discussion on climate-resilient transport infrastructure for sustainable trade, tourism and development in SIDS during COP25 on 10 December.UNCTAD has been working on the implications of climate change for maritime transportation for over a decade, since 2008, with an emphasis on impacts and adaptation needs of seaports and other coastal transport infrastructure.Its recent work includes a technical assistance project on climate change impacts and adaptation for coastal transport infrastructure in the Caribbean, focusing on Jamaica and Saint-Lucia.Some of the project's substantive findings informed theIPCC assessment of climate change impacts at 1.5 degrees global warming, highlighting the risk of marine flooding to coastal transport infrastructure in SIDS, which could occur as early as the 2030s.\l"

By the summer of 2020, the Commission will present an assessment of the impact of increasing the EU's greenhouse gas reduction target from 40 per cent below 1990 levels by 2030 to 50 per cent and ""towards 55 per cent"" in a ""responsible way"".To deliver these additional greenhouse gas emissions reductions, the Commission will, by June 2021, review and propose to revise where necessary, all relevant climate-related policy instruments.In contrast, the UK's official Committee on Climate Change published its assessment of the net zero target in May, which was followed on June 12\~with a four-word amendment to the country's Climate Change Act (2008), making Britain the first country in the G7 to enshrine the net zero target in law.That speed no doubt reflects the ease of national, rather than multinational action, as well as Britain's historical advantages which have enabled easy emission mitigation.Nevertheless, any analysis of the Green New Deal must acknowledge how little Europe has moved in the year since the European Commission unveiled its 2050 long term strategy.\~The strategy has failed in its promise of leading to the adoption of a net zero target despite the months-long painstaking negotiations which followed.Moreover, the European Environment Agency reported last week that the EU was not even on track to meet its current Paris targets and is only likely to hit a 30 per cent emission cut by 2030.The European Commission President has described the deal as\~""Europe's man on the moon moment"". What it amounts to at most is President Kennedy's speech in 1963 declaring that America would put a man on the moon\~""before the decade is out"".Even as a statement of intent, the EU's Green New Deal falls far short of versions in America, where the term has acquired great currency despite being likely invented in Britain in 2008. While there have been several versions of a Green New Deal since Congresswoman Alexandria Occasio-Cortez moved a resolution with that title, Bernie Sanders' plan calls for complete decarbonisation of the transport and power sectors by 2030.Even if other sectors saw no movement, this would mean a reduction in the United States (US) emissions by at least 50 per cent over 1990 levels. There will be mitigation additional to this; formerly-Republican-currently-Democrat Michael Bloomberg's highly optimistic plan estimates that US emissions can fall by as much as 37 per cent between 2005 and 2030 even in the face complete federal inaction.Europe as a whole, once used to be a more progressive force on climate change than American left-liberals, but the European Green New Deal is a pale imitation of the American original.Besides not matching up to similar statements of intent in the US, the Green New Deal also fails to adequately contribute to limiting the global mean temperature rise. Europe's fair share of the global mitigation burden to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (\'b0C) would imply a net-zero target closer to 2030.Even the Green New Deal's best case scenario of a 55 per cent emissions cut by 2030 is not compatible\~with a 2\'b0C temperature rise, according to the Climate Action Tracker, a collaborative effort between Climate Analytics and the New Climate Institute, both based in Germany.Like member state Denmark's new climate law passed last week, the Green New Deal's 2050 target, has been worded as ""climate neutrality"" rather than as net zero carbon emissions, though the new phrase has not been defined in the Communication. A strategy brochure released by the Commission earlier this year indicated that the reference is to net zero greenhouse gas emissions, rather than net zero carbon emissions.If that is indeed the case, it marks a genuine increase in ambition (however meagre) over the EU's existing long-term goal of cutting 2050 emissions by 80-95 per cent over 1990 levels, unlike the net zero carbon laws of the UK, France and New Zealand.Related StoriesClimate Emergency CoP 25: The European Green Deal is far from good enoughBut the Green New Deal is silent on the crucial question of whether carbon credits will be used to meet the climate neutrality target, as allowed by the UK law in contravention of the advice of its own official Committee on Climate Change. Five of the seven pathways to 2050 studied by the Commission will result in an emission reduction of just about 80 per cent (the lower end of the EU's current target), while a sixth achieves 90 per cent by combining the efforts of the five.A seventh pathway achieves 100 per cent using Bio Energy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), while an eight one does so by relying on the circular economy, less carbon intensive consumer choices as well as expanding land use sinks.But as the brochure acknowledges, carbon capture and storage (CCS) has ""low social acceptability"". Globally, while the present installed BECCS capacity is less than 0.03 per cent of current EU emissions, most IPCC pathways to limit warming to 1.5\'b0C require some degree of BECCS, particularly for achieving the net negative emissions required in the post-2050 period.Nevertheless, the IPCC has pointed out that this will be very hard to achieve given current technologies, making it clear that the pathways remained aspirational and that its special report on Global Warming of 1.5\'b0C (2018) had found no reason to shed the skepticism of its Fifth Assessment Report (2014).To the European Commission, combined with ""sustainable biomass"", CCS can help attain negative emissions. But ""sustainable biomass"" is a controversial concept.Despite the much heralded boom in wind and solar,\~biomass accounted for\~8.8 per cent of the continent's primary energy supply in 2016, while the total share of all other renewables was just 4.8 per cent.Like elsewhere in the world, sustainably-sourced biomass is considered carbon neutral under EU regulations, based on the argument that the carbon dioxide released will be recaptured by next year's biofuel crop (though there will be some emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases). However, not all biomass is sustainable and biomass production may lead to rising emissions from land use change due to deforestation, as well as from the increasing use of fossil fuels in biomass production.Noting that more biomass will be needed in a zero-emissions economy, the Commission emphasises its sustainability, ""to ensure that the EU's forest sink and other ecosystem services do not decl"

Xavier Espot, accompanied by the ambassador of Andorra to Spain, Vicen Mateu, participates today at the Climate Summit (COP25), which is celebrated in Madrid with the aim of setting global action plans for a new phase of Climate action with the clear desire to increase ambition and accelerate action during 2020. The Conference has been inaugurated this Monday in the Spanish capital with the presence of 50 Heads of State or Government and representatives of the main international organisms.Espot stood out in front of the 50 executives gathered in the high level round table held today that in Andorra there is a cross-cutting consensus of all the political forces in favor of the fight against climate change and that the Council last year General unanimously approved the Law on Energy Transition and Fight against Climate Change, which reflects the commitments and the national contribution to which Andorra pledged itself in the Paris Agreement.The Head of Government has explained that currently the sustainability policies that apply to Andorra are focusing particularly on the mobility and heating sector, the points identified as main sources of emissions in the territory. Thus, efforts are being made to give a decisive impulse to electric mobility, with a policy of direct aid to the purchase of electric vehicles and a network of chargers that is among the densest in the world. He also stated the Government's desire to strengthen the public transport model and, in the same way, how it is working on an integrated mobility system that includes electric vehicles.Espot has reported that, by law, new construction works must meet the standards of energy efficiency so that consumption becomes almost zero, developing projects of systems of supply of hot water and heating more efficient and deploying a new energy regulation which encourage the use of renewable energies, self-production and self-consumption.With these measures, added the head of government, it is expected to reduce our energy dependence, increasing domestic production to cover 33% by 2030, when 75% of national energy production must come from sources renewable.Xavier Espot referred to the need to align, as much as globally and at the local level, all the efforts on the challenge of sustainability. In this regard, he said that the multilateral forums must give an effective response to the current challenges and that, for this reason, Andorra will host in November next year the Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State and Government under the motto 'Innovation for Sustainable Development - Goal 2030'.The United Nations Conference on Climate Change COP25 will be held until December 13 under the chairmanship of the Government of Chile and with the logistical support of the Government of Spain.

Climate change has even been linked to depression.""The bushfires currently devastating the nation's eastern seaboard signal the need for urgent action,"" he said.""Human health will improve as we pursue pathways to net zero emissions. Cleaner air, healthier diets and safer, more walkable cities will benefit our physical and mental health, and yield increases in worker productivity and savings in healthcare costs,"" Professor Capon added.KEY FINDINGSThe report examined progress on climate change and human health in Australia, tracked across 31 indicators divided into five broad sections: climate change impacts, exposures and vulnerability; adaptation, planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; finance and economics; and public and political engagement.A number of new indicators were introduced this year, including one focused on wildfire exposure, and another on engagement in health and climate change in the corporate sector.Associate Professor Yuming Guo from the School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, who led section one of the report focusing on climate change impacts, exposures and vulnerability, said increases in heat continue to present a leading source of climate change-related health risk in Australia, and this trend is likely to continue.""Despite uncertainties created by the large variability in daily and seasonal temperatures, there's been a striking upward trend in the rate of increase in maximum temperatures over the past two decades.""Large increases in heatwave intensity are also evident over the same period, with consequent risks for health, particularly among people experiencing underlying vulnerability and disadvantage,"" said Associate Professor Guo.""Additionally, hot years in terms of both maximum and minimum annual temperatures continued to be associated with higher suicide rates.""We've found little evidence to suggest that Australia is acting effectively to mitigate these multiple heat-related risks for physical and mental health. This is particularly concerning in the context of a growing and ageing population,"" he said.Australia was the only country to produce its own national Countdown assessment report in 2018. It found that overall, Australia is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on health, and that policy inaction in this regard threatens Australian lives. The current report presents the first annual update of this assessment tracking Australia's engagement with, and progress on, this vitally important issue, and found that Australia performed poorly across many of the indicators in comparison to other developed countries.The report's authors have called for the health impacts of climate change to be a priority on the agenda at the Climate Change Conference in December.The MJA-Lancet Countdown will continue annual assessments until 2030.The global report can be found here and the Australia-focused chapter is published in the MJA.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from India Education Diary.

Climate experts said the two-week long talks produced a weak gesture toward raising climate targets and failed to agree for the second year in a row on rules to govern carbon markets. ""I am disappointed with the results of COP25,"" Guterres said in a statement. The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis, he said. ""But we must not give up, and I will not give up."" ""I am more determined than ever to work for 2020 to be the year in which all countries commit to do what science tells us is necessary to reach carbon neutrality in 2050 and a no more than 1.5 degree temperature rise,"" the Secretary-General, who devoted much of his time in the summit, added. Climate negotiators said governments failed dismally to respond to the unfolding global climate crisis despite clear warnings from scientists through 2019, record levels of protests and severe climate impacts. Observers in Madrid blamed G20 countries for the poor outcome, with the US, Brazil, Australia, Saudi Arabia and major oil, gas and coal companies implicated in undermining climate ambition. Leading economies were faulted for their complacency -- failing to deliver more support to vulnerable nations in the face of brutal impacts and push for a tougher collective response in 2020 -- when new climate plans are mandated under the Paris Agreement. The EU tried to play its role as bridge-builder between developing and developed countries. However, it will take a major diplomatic push and bigger leadership alliance to deliver substantial outcomes at the next COP26 in Glasgow. Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends, who was following the climate negotiations, said the impacts of not acting adequately on climate change are clear and visible not just in the global south, but also in the global north. EU announced an ambition for 2050 leaving out what it can do in 2030. China, as the largest global emitter has not felt the need to take leadership. India with its largest renewables programme of any country, has the opportunity of moving away from coal which it hasn't seized, said an observer. Laurence Tubiana, CEO European Climate Foundation and Paris Agreement Architect, said: ""The result of this COP25 is really a mixed bag, and a far cry from what science tells us is needed. Major players who needed to deliver in Madrid did not live up to expectations, but thanks to a progressive alliance of small island states, European, African and Latin American countries, we obtained the best possible outcome, against the will of big polluters."" The Paris Agreement saved but huge work needed to make Glasgow summit a success, said Britain-based Christian Aid. It Global Climate Lead Katherine Kramer said: ""The UK now has a gargantuan task of overseeing a successful climate summit in Glasgow next year. That meeting is supposed to be the moment the world responds to the climate crisis by strengthening the pledges made in the Paris Agreement.

"COP25","India","COP25_India413","Climate Emergency CoP 25: A storm is brewing on 'Loss and Damage'","December 19, 2019","Indian Agriculture News","December 19 -- Loss and damage has a specific meaning in climate policy. It deals with unavoidable and irreversible impacts of climate change, where mitigation has failed, and adaptation is not possible.Six years ago, at COP 19, the 'Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage' (WIM) was set up to ""address loss and damage associated with impacts of climate change, including extreme events and slow onset events in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change"".Two years later, in 2015, Article 8 of the Paris Agreement installed loss and damage as a third pillar of climate policy (with mitigation and adaptation being the first two). The Agreement committed parties to ""enhance understanding, action and support, including through the Warsaw International Mechanism, as appropriate, on a cooperative and facilitative basis with respect to loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change"".The key is the commitment to enhance support, which can be interpreted as finance, or technology, or capacity building, but has to involve some material transfer of resources to those who are already being hit by irreversible impacts.This requirement is most stark in the case of small island states, who are losing their land to the climate crisis, and who were at the forefront of the push for loss and damage to be included in the Agreement. However, the demand for support is much larger than island states - some climate-economy models indicate $1.1-1.7 trillion each year of damage in developing countries by 2050.When we think of farmers whose crops are destroyed by unseasonal weather, or coastal communities devastated by cyclones of unprecedented intensity, we are (in some part) thinking of climate-induced loss and damage. These losses are somewhat compensated through national funds, and some international aid. To the extent they are caused or worsened by climate change, we need to move beyond this kind of ad hoc compensation, and toward an equitable compensation mechanism, hence the WIM.However, WIM has no finance arm. This is a result of developed countries' paranoia that accepting the need for loss and damage finance amounts to an admission of legal liability. To drive home the point, a paragraph on loss and damage was added to the Decision of the Conference of the Parties in Paris stating that ""Article 8 of the Agreement [which deals with loss and damage] does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation"".The legal implications of this sentence are uncertain because it is in the Paris Decision, which accompanied the Paris Agreement, but does not share its legal status. In any case, all the legal hair-splitting in the world will not remove the need to compensate for climate-induced loss and damage.On December 2, a meeting was held in Madrid to review the performance of WIM. Delegates from particularly vulnerable countries pressed for direct answers: Where was WIM when their country was being torn apart by a climate-exacerbated natural disaster? Why has WIM's work been so slow? And what is being delivered on finance?There were no answers forthcoming. As a somewhat conciliatory gesture, some delegates from developed nations suggested that the way forward for WIM would be to develop the scientific basis for loss and damage, by commissioning technical reports or papers.Delegates from vulnerable countries responded that their previous efforts to include science-based language on loss and damage in past decisions were consistently blocked on political grounds. Even the existing technical papers which have been submitted to WIM (on issues such as climate-induced displacement) have not resulted in any impactful activities in the countries affected.Some developed country stakeholders have shown signs of taking loss and damage finance seriously - a Resolution by the European Parliament regarding this CoP calls for the EU Commission and Member States to ""provide climate finance for loss and damage"" and ""recognises the need for progress on the issue of loss and damage, for which additional resources should be raised through innovative sources of public finance under the Warsaw International Mechanism"".The Resolution is not binding. It reflects the position of one of the EU institutions, not necessarily the EU as a whole or its member states. However, it is a significant acknowledgment that compensation for climate impacts is distinct from mitigation and adaptation, and is a necessity in its own right.The acknowledgement comes not a moment too soon. The frustration among the most vulnerable countries is at a boil; at least one delegate in Madrid referenced the possibility of international litigation, if the Madrid CoP does not deliver agreement on a finance facility for loss and damage.Some developing country delegates had a different view. They considered that it would be impossible to obtain finance to compensate for loss and damage, but that it might be possible to reach compromise on obtaining finance to prevent loss and damage.This may look like nuance, but it will, in all likelihood, backfire. Preventing loss and damage is achieved either through mitigation and adaptation. The very fact that loss and damage finance is needed is proof that prevention is not enough. This kind of compromise will play into the worst instincts of those who would look the other way as climate change takes apart communities.\l"

And I still believe that the biggest danger is not inaction, the real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening when in fact almost nothing is being done apart from clever accounting and creative PR,"" Sputnik quotes Thunberg as saying at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP25) in Madrid.Thunberg called on world leaders to ""keep the carbon in the ground"" and cut greenhouse emissions to hold global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels - the goal enshrined in the Paris Agreement.The eco-activist stressed that mere intentions were not enough to fight climate change, and it was crucially important to strictly comply with given commitments to make progress.People should be aware of what is going on with the climate and realize that the current situation requires urgent actions from politicians, according to Thunberg.""There is no sense of urgency whatsoever [among world leaders]. Our leaders are not behaving as if we were in an emergency. In an emergency you change your behavior. If there is a child standing in the middle of the road, and cars are coming at full speed, you do not look away because it is too uncomfortable, you immediately run out and rescue that child,"" she pointed out, adding that without a sense of emergency, it was impossible to understand that the people were facing a real crisis.The COP25UNI XC ASN 1858Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from United News of India.

Carbon emissions from human activity would need to fall by 45 per cent by 2030, to reach net zero around 2050 that is, when emissions are matched by carbon removed from the atmosphere.Secretary-General Scotland laid out different ways in which the Commonwealth is helping countries face these realities.For one, the Commonwealth Finance Access Hub helps small and vulnerable countries cut through the red tape of international finance and develop successful funding applications for climate-related projects.

It was first celebrated on March 21, 1970, the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere.This day of nature's equipoise was later sanctioned in a proclamation written by McConnell and signed by Secretary General U Thant at the United Nations. A month later a United States Senator Gaylord Nelson proposed the idea to hold a nationwide environmental teach-in on April 22, 1970.He hired a young activist, Denis Hayes, to be the National Coordinator. Nelson and Hayes renamed the event ""Earth Day. It now is observed in 192 countries, and coordinated by the non profit Earth Day Network, chaired by the first Earth Day 1970 organiser Denis Hayes, according to whom Earth Day is now ""the largest secular holiday in the world, celebrated by more than a billion people every year.""Earth Day 2020 is the 50th anniversary of the day. The theme for the Earth Day 2020 is climate action. The world is observed a greener and quieter in these days due to COVID-19 pandemic. With vehicles off the streets, seismologists investigating earthquakes in London, Brussels and Los Angeles report that the ambient noise levels are so low that they are now better able to detect even smaller seismic events in these cities.On Earth Day 2016, the landmark Paris Agreement was signed by the United States, China, and some 120 other countries. This signing satisfied a key requirement for the entry into force of the historic draft climate protection treaty adopted by consensus of the 195 nations present at the 2015 United Nations in Paris.The COVID -19 has made it possible which these agreements even couldn't. This is potentially good news for the climate because oil is the biggest source of the carbon emissions that are heating the planet and disrupting weather systems. Some analysts believe it could mark the start of a prolonged downward trend in emissions and the beginning of the end for oil. Others strike a more cautious note about the fuel that has dominated our lives and polluted our atmosphere for the past century. Ultimately, the most important environmental impact is likely to be on public perceptions. The pandemic has demonstrated the deadly consequences of ignoring expert warnings, of political delay, and of sacrificing human health and natural landscapes for the economy.But there are things we do know for sure about how climate affects some diseases. Malaria, for instance, thrives in hotter regions, which is one reason the World Bank estimates that by 2030, 3.6 billion people will be reckoning with it - 100 million as a direct result of climate change.The most significant way individuals could mitigate their own carbon footprint is to have one less child (""an average for developed countries of 58.6?tonnes CO2-equivalent (tCO2e) emission reductions per year""), followed by living car-free (2.4 tonnes CO2-equivalent per year), forgoing air travel (1.6 tonnes CO2-equivalent per trans-Atlantic trip) and adopting a plant-based diet (0.8 tonnes CO2-equivalent per year). The choice of diet is a major influence on a person's carbon footprint. Animal sources of protein (especially red meat), rice (typically produced in high methane-emitting paddies), foods transported long-distance or via fuel-inefficient transport (e.g., highly perishable produce flown long-distance) and heavily processed and packaged foods are among the major contributors to a high carbon diet. Options to reduce the carbon footprint of humans include 'Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and Refuse.' The carbon handprint movement emphasizes individual forms of carbon offsetting, like using more public transportation or planting trees in deforested regions, to reduce one's carbon footprint and increase their ""handprint"".(Dr Senapati is Dean Science, BPUT & Professor of Chemistry Trident Academy of Technology, Odisha)Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Pioneer.

According to researcher Gustavo Mozzer, this was one of the themes agreed during the UN Conference on Climate (COP25), chaired by the government of Chile, but held in Madrid, Spain, in December 2019.Among the main decisions of COP25, countries should submit contributions to the dialogues scheduled to take place in October of this year by March 31, during the next meeting of the SB52 Convention's subsidiary bodies.For Mozzer, Embrapa's participation in the preparation of Brazilian contributions sent and approved by the UN reaffirms the recognition of the Company's expertise in climate change. ""This is a theme that has mobilized researchers from practically all Units and, under the coordination of the Climate Change Portfolio, it has consolidated Embrapa as a reference institution"", he says. ""All the scientific baggage generated by decades of research in the area of tropical agriculture is a subsidy for work in the area of climate change, for risk assessment and proposing technological solutions appropriate to the current scenario and prospecting for future scenarios"".For the researcher, Embrapa has actively contributed to the advancement of Brazilian agriculture, through scientific studies capable of proposing strategies to face the challenges imposed by climate change, with potential for adoption in other countries. The submission of documents under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in his opinion, is an efficient tool to publicize the potential and sustainability of the tropical agricultural model and technology developed in Brazil.The Brazilian contribution on the theme was the result of the articulation between Embrapa and the Map, through the Department of Sustainable Production and Irrigation (Depros) of the Secretariat of Innovation, Rural Development and Irrigation (SDI), of the Secretariat of Trade and International Relations ( SCRI), the Social and Environmental Affairs Advisory Office of the Minister and the Commission for Sustainable Development of Agriculture (CDSA).Disclaimer: The Above Content is Auto-Translated\l"

"COP25","India","COP25_India426","Climate Emergency CoP 25: A storm is brewing on 'Loss and Damage'","December 3, 2019 Tuesday","Down To Earth","India, Dec. 3 -- It is different from mitigation and adaptation, and it needs financeLoss and damage has a specific meaning in climate policy. It deals with unavoidable and irreversible impacts of climate change, where mitigation has failed, and adaptation is not possible.Six years ago, at COP 19, the 'Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage' (WIM) was set up to ""address loss and damage associated with impacts of climate change, including extreme events and slow onset events in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change"".Two years later, in 2015, Article 8 of the Paris Agreement installed loss and damage as a third pillar of climate policy (with mitigation and adaptation being the first two). The Agreement committed parties to ""enhance understanding, action and support, including through the Warsaw International Mechanism, as appropriate, on a cooperative and facilitative basis with respect to loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change"".The key is the commitment to enhance support, which can be interpreted as finance, or technology, or capacity building, but has to involve some material transfer of resources to those who are already being hit by irreversible impacts.This requirement is most stark in the case of small island states, who are losing their land to the climate crisis, and who were at the forefront of the push for loss and damage to be included in the Agreement. However, the demand for support is much larger than island states - some climate-economy models indicate $1.1-1.7 trillion each year of damage in developing countries by 2050.When we think of farmers whose crops are destroyed by unseasonal weather, or coastal communities devastated by cyclones of unprecedented intensity, we are (in some part) thinking of climate-induced loss and damage. These losses are somewhat compensated through national funds, and some international aid. To the extent they are caused or worsened by climate change, we need to move beyond this kind of ad hoc compensation, and toward an equitable compensation mechanism, hence the WIM.However, WIM has no finance arm. This is a result of developed countries' paranoia that accepting the need for loss and damage finance amounts to an admission of legal liability. To drive home the point, a paragraph on loss and damage was added to the Decision of the Conference of the Parties in Paris stating that ""Article 8 of the Agreement [which deals with loss and damage] does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation"".The legal implications of this sentence are uncertain because it is in the Paris Decision, which accompanied the Paris Agreement, but does not share its legal status. In any case, all the legal hair-splitting in the world will not remove the need to compensate for climate-induced loss and damage.On December 2, a meeting was held in Madrid to review the performance of WIM. Delegates from particularly vulnerable countries pressed for direct answers: Where was WIM when their country was being torn apart by a climate-exacerbated natural disaster? Why has WIM's work been so slow? And what is being delivered on finance?There were no answers forthcoming. As a somewhat conciliatory gesture, some delegates from developed nations suggested that the way forward for WIM would be to develop the scientific basis for loss and damage, by commissioning technical reports or papers.Delegates from vulnerable countries responded that their previous efforts to include science-based language on loss and damage in past decisions were consistently blocked on political grounds. Even the existing technical papers which have been submitted to WIM (on issues such as climate-induced displacement) have not resulted in any impactful activities in the countries affected.Some developed country stakeholders have shown signs of taking loss and damage finance seriously - a Resolution by the European Parliament regarding this CoP calls for the EU Commission and Member States to ""provide climate finance for loss and damage"" and ""recognises the need for progress on the issue of loss and damage, for which additional resources should be raised through innovative sources of public finance under the Warsaw International Mechanism"".The Resolution is not binding. It reflects the position of one of the EU institutions, not necessarily the EU as a whole or its member states. However, it is a significant acknowledgment that compensation for climate impacts is distinct from mitigation and adaptation, and is a necessity in its own right.The acknowledgement comes not a moment too soon. The frustration among the most vulnerable countries is at a boil; at least one delegate in Madrid referenced the possibility of international litigation, if the Madrid CoP does not deliver agreement on a finance facility for loss and damage.Some developing country delegates had a different view. They considered that it would be impossible to obtain finance to compensate for loss and damage, but that it might be possible to reach compromise on obtaining finance to prevent loss and damage.This may look like nuance, but it will, in all likelihood, backfire. Preventing loss and damage is achieved either through mitigation and adaptation. The very fact that loss and damage finance is needed is proof that prevention is not enough. This kind of compromise will play into the worst instincts of those who would look the other way as climate change takes apart communities.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Down to Earth.

Otherwise, natures ability to sustain the life in any form will be at risk of sustaining the life in any form on the Earth, according a press statement released here on Wednesday by the climate change ministrys spokesperson Mohammad Saleem.The world, as shaped by us, is now on a war path with nature and we, the political shapers of this situation, are collectively leading the charge brigade, he said during his keynote address at the plenary session of the UN-led global climate conference known as 25th Session of Conference of Parties (COP25) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the spokesperson told media.The two weeks-long COP25 is taking place (2 13 December 2019) in Madrid, Spains capital city under the Presidency of the Government of Chile. Nearly 50,000 delegations from over 196 countries are attending the event to hammer out an agreed rulebook regarding Paris Climate Agreement which was signed by the countries in France in 2015. The spokesperson Mohammad Saleem While reading out the country statement, Malik Amin Aslam, who is leading Pakistans delegation to the annual UN Climate conference, said, the world leaders gathered here in Madrid must realise that this battle against nature is not a battle that can be won nor a battle that should be won.Instead, A unified climate action by the global community is needed to try and take nature on board, to allow it space to bounce back and to tread on a different path of ecologically balanced growth - before we hit the situation of climate irreversibility, he emphasised. Highlighting the fallouts of the global warming-caused climate change, Malik Amin Aslam told the world leaders during his address that while nature may be resilient, it is no longer silent and an era of consequences is already upon us.The virulent cyclones, rising heat waves, freak floods, melting glaciers and rising sea levels are all vivid and living indicators of not only our failing battle but also of natures forceful reply, he explained. While regretting rich nations deliberate blind eye cast upon crystal-clear climate science that makes reality of climate change clearer, Malik Amin Aslam remarked that the politics of climate change, played out in these hallowed halls of the UN climate conference or so-called COP25, unfortunately remains out of sync with the scientific evidence and the physical reality of climate change.If this continues, all of us may be soon destined to the dustbins of history a history of self-inflicted destruction, he cautioned. The Prime Ministers advisor Malik Amin Aslam said further, Our youth is out on the streets and sees the urgency and emergency, our scientists not only see it but have already predicted the abyss facing us and our economies are already draining under the burden of forced adaptation costs.However, let us negotiate to act and not to further delay direly-needed the global climate action, he urged the global political leaders gathered at the COP25 in Madrid. - Highlighting Pakistans enhanced climate vulnerability, Malik Amin Aslam highlighted that the country faces a climate challenge, which is not only unique but equally inescapable.However, we are always stand united with the global community to deal with the common exacerbating challenge of climate change that threatens our very survival, our food systems and water availability and anything else the nature sustains, Pakistan contribute less than 1% of the total planet-warming carbon emissions, yet every year the country keeps on climbing up the ladder of climate vulnerability, he maintained.The annual Global Climate Risk Index, published on Wednesday (December 4) by environmental think-tank Germanwatch, has rated Pakistan at 5th position in terms of climate vulnerability and 3rd in terms of the combined economic costs borne over last 20 years (1999 and 2018) estimated at $3.2 billion due to climate change-caused disasters, particularly floods. Within this ranking, we also join a small and unique group of countries which is, consistently and simultaneously, appearing on not only the yearly but also the long term climate vulnerability index, Malik Amin Aslam informed the global leaders during his speech.He told them loud and clear, This is not an enviable position to be in, and certainly not a position of our own making nor of our own choosing, as it places Pakistan squarely on the front l"

Indonesia's commitment is realized by using domestic funding sources to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 29% and use international support by 41% when compared to the business as usual scenario in 2030.The Government of Indonesia has also taken various corrective measures, including: 1) making the temporary moratorium policy permanent for the conversion of primary natural forests and peatlands; 2) conserving the remaining forest area through REDD + and sustainable forest management; 3) carrying out a process of transitioning cleaner and more renewable energy; 4) implementing fiscal policies related to climate and innovative financing instruments; 5) establish an environmental finance institution dedicated to managing climate-related fundsRegarding climate change adaptation, Indonesia also has policies to improve climate resilience to the economy, social and livelihoods as well as ecosystems and landscapes. At present, Indonesia is at the stage of updating the NDC, this is part of a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy called ""Indonesia's Vision 2050 on Climate Change"".Then Indonesia also welcomed two of the latest IPCC Special Reports on Land and Sea. In addition to managing terrestrial ecosystems and climate change, Indonesia is aware of the important relationship between oceans and the climate system, including the role of oceans in mitigating and adapting to climate change.Therefore, there is a need to promote sustainable management, conservation and recovery of coastal and marine ecosystems. Indonesia's efforts in this regard include, research on blue carbon, ecosystem-based adaptation, and the development of Marine Conservation Areas.Furthermore with regard to concerns over GHG emission gaps and the need to ""Increase NDC ambitions"", Indonesia urges developed countries to continue to fulfill their commitments to provide means of implementation in accordance with Article 3 and Article 4 of the Paris Convention and Article 3.Ending his statement, Alue expressed Indonesia's concern with unfinished work on the Scope of Next Periodic Review, Article 6, Finance, Transparency Framework and Loss and Damage. Indonesia believes that under the leadership of the President of COP25, the Parties can complete and deliver balanced results - supported by a transparent, inclusive, and supported by member countries - and respects the principle of shared responsibility, but differs according to their respective abilities.\l"

After sailing with very good winds, where more than 50% of our sailing is done by sail, we arrive at the port of Singapore. In this wonderful city we are going to carry out a series of protocol activities framed in the celebration of a new anniversary of our National Holidays, so the Embassy has considered inviting a series of authorities and guests in this framework.Chemamull SculpturesDuring their second day in port, a delegation with the band of musicians participated in an important diplomatic ceremony where two Mapuche sculptures (Chemamull) were donated. Commander Maldonado commented that in the framework of the anticipated celebration of National Holidays, the Chilean Embassy in Singapore made a reception aboard the Ship with government authorities, military authorities, diplomats, guests and general public who were accompanied by the endowment.The celebration was crowned by the delivery of two Chemamulls that were transferred from Chile aboard the 'Emerald' to be donated to the 'Garden by The Bay', a botanical garden that is located in this city. Statues that were delivered in the presence of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Singapore, within the framework of 40 years of bilateral relations between the two countries, explained Commander Maldonado.The School Ship will remain until September 14 in that port, then navigate to Busa (Korea) celebrating September 18 at sea, having various and special activities. It should be remembered that this Instruction Cruise for Asia - Pacific is linked to the important role that Chile will have this year to host the APEC and COP25 forums.\l"

"COP25","India","COP25_India435","Germany : Research for climate protection - We have to push innovative measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions","December 14, 2019 Saturday","TendersInfo","COP25 world climate conference will be held in Madrid from December 2 to 13, 2019 and is now in the decisive phase. At the heart of the negotiations are rules for international emissions trading. The Federal Ministry of Education and Research ( BMBF ) presents the latest results from climate research at COP25. Federal Research Minister Anja Karlizcek explains:The effects of climate change on floods, storms and droughts can already be felt worldwide. The participating nations at the climate summit in Madrid united that they want to preserve the world as we know it for future generations. We know that climate protection is a task that all nations have to face. And science agrees: Significantly more ambitions are needed worldwide if we want to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and limit global warming to 2, if possible 1.5 C. Research and innovative international cooperation are the keys to a successful climate policy, which must offer solutions for effective, economical and socially compatible climate protection.Through targeted funding from my company, research in Germany is excellently positioned especially on these climate economic issues. We are gaining the knowledge we need to be able to ensure through appropriate regulations that the market mechanisms of the Paris Agreement actually contribute to emissions reduction and sustainable development.In the past decades, the BMBF's research funding on climate, environment and sustainability has made a decisive contribution not only to building up comprehensive knowledge about climate change, but also to developing viable options for action. These efforts will now reinforce my house once again and further promote the promotion of technical climate-friendly innovations. This includes promoting ambitious greenhouse gas reduction measures. Because the worldwide emission of climate-damaging CO2 has continued to increase this year. One thing is clear: the earlier the foundations for innovations are laid with research and development, the more it is in our hands to really shape the development.In addition, we have to close the knowledge gaps about the physical processes in the climate system. The better we understand which processes work in the climate system, the better we can reduce the risks. The Arctic expedition MOSAiC started in autumn with the research ship Polarstern shows how we do this: scientifically and in close international cooperation. Internationally, however, we also assume responsibility in countries that are particularly badly affected by climate change. Examples of this are the two regional climate competence centers that we have established together with countries from West and South Africa.\l"
"COP25","India","COP25_India436","Climate Emergency CoP 25: Climatic tipping point is closer than we think","December 3, 2019 Tuesday","Down To Earth","India, Dec. 3 -- Scientists confirm that we are indeed in a climate emergencyIn the climate lexicon, tipping points are thresholds beyond which certain impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures are brought down later. Examples include the loss of the Amazon rainforest or of the West Antarctic ice sheet.When the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) introduced the concept two decades ago, it was thought that these ""large-scale discontinuities"" in the climate system were likely only if global mean temperatures increased by more than 5 degC over pre-industrial levels.Recent IPCC reports, including last year's Global Warming of 1.5degC and this year's Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, suggest that tipping points could be exceeded even between 1 and 2 degC of warming. This is worrying as we are on track to a 3.2 degree warmer world, suggests the UNEP's Emissions Gap Report released last week.Nevertheless, many politicians and even scientists assume that tipping points have a low probability of occurrence. A new article in Nature by a group of scientists summarises the evidence to challenge this notion. The article has been co-authoured by climate scientists from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, the University of Exeter in the UK, Stockholm University in Sweden, University of Copenhagen in Denmark and Australian National University in Australia.On ice, the article notes, Amundsen Sea embayment in West Antarctica may have already reached a tipping point, which could destabilise the rest of the West Antarctic ice sheet like toppling dominoes and lead to a sea-level rise of about 3 metres on a millennial timescale.Together, with similar developments in the East Antarctic and Greenland, this may already have committed the future generation to 10 metres (m) of sea-level rise. But, as the paper emphasises, despite breaching a tipping point, the pace of change, which can partially mitigate the catastrophe, is still in our hands. If warming is limited to 1.5 degC, the 10 m rise could take 10,000 years to unfold, while warming of over 2 degC could mean getting there in just a 1,000 years.The report addresses biosphere tipping points such as Amazonian deforestation, which can trigger abrupt carbon releases into the atmosphere, amplify climate change and reduce remaining emission budgets. Permafrost emissions could total 100 Gigatonnes (Gt), Amazon dieback emissions could be as high as 90 Gt and emissions from boreal forests a further 110 Gt.These three phenomena could thus alone consume 60 per cent of the 500 Gt carbon budget remaining to maintain a 50 per cent chance of limiting warming to 1.5 degC. While estimates of an Amazonian tipping point vary from 40 per cent deforestation to just 20 per cent forest cover loss, about 17 per cent has been lost since 1970.The paper argues that finding the precise tipping point requires understanding deforestation and climate change as interacting drivers, as well as fire and climate feedbacks as interacting tipping mechanisms.The article also claims that the case for a potential global tipping point is strengthened by the early results of studies for the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report due to be published in 2021, which indicate a much larger climate sensitivity (the temperature response to doubling of atmospheric CO2) than in previous models.Some economists assume that climate tipping points are of very low probability and, as a result, suggest that 3 degC warming is optimal from a cost-benefit perspective. The article challenges this notion and argues that as tipping points are more likely, the ""optimal policy"" recommendations of climate-economy models would require warming to be limited to 1.5 degC.To scientists who argue that a global tipping point is highly speculative, the paper's authors respond that given its huge impact and irreversible nature, one must err on the side of caution. ""This is an existential threat to civilization. No amount of economic cost-benefit analysis is going to help us. We need to change our approach to the climate problem,"" the article notes.To evaluate if the world is indeed in a climate emergency, the paper defines an emergency as the product of risk and urgency . Urgency is the ratio between the reaction time to an alert and the intervention time left to avoid a bad outcome. A situation is an emergency if both risk and urgency are high.If the reaction time is longer than the intervention time left, we have lost control. The paper argues that the intervention time left to prevent tipping could already have shrunk towards zero, whereas the reaction time to achieve net-zero emissions is 30 years at best. Thus we might already have lost control and the world is indeed in a climate emergency.Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, one of the authors of the report, told The Guardian Australia that the formula was just the ""tip of a mathematical iceberg"" in defining the climate emergency. He argued: ""It can be illustrated by the Titanic disaster... Yet there are options to avoid the disaster."" Noting that little time was left to act, Schellnhuber warned that beyond the critical point ""only some sort of adaptation option is left, such as moving the Titanic passengers into rescue boats (if available).""Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Down to Earth.

It\' s absolutely criminal that we burn oil.""For feedstock, for plastics, for pretty much every chemical process that gives us our current modern standard of living, it is derived from oil. So why the hell would we burn it and create two problems \- releasing CO2 and diminishing the resource that we rely on for the majority of our modern chemistry?"" he said.Prof Cameron and colleague Prof Tony Ryan are conducting research into using petrochemicals to create a plastic material that shares the properties of soil.They have also been working on a project that uses petrochemicals as the building material for greenhouses, using its properties to shade plants from the intense summer sun. By using solar energy, they are able to turn plastics that were used in greenhouse building to other uses.Less than two per cent of Gulf region\' s land is arable. The result is that the UAE is almost entirely reliant on other countries to feed its population, importing approximately 90 per cent of its food.The solution to growing produce in the desert involves greenhouses and other artificial environments. The problem, they said, was that keeping greenhouses cool in desert heat is energy intensive.""The Gulf has an excess of sunshine, and we need to learn to use the sunshine to grow food,"" said Prof Ryan, the founding director of the Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures.""Once we can do that, using oil for building and the Sun for energy, we begin unlocking technologies that allow for sustainable food production.""Prof Ryan said water demand could be met by making sure that desalination was powered by solar energy, once the process was efficient enough.This would allow oil to be used elsewhere.""But if we can make it rain with solar energy, we can be a lot more efficient.""

Our recent project is the 6th unit of Novovoronezh NPP that was put into operation in August this year in Russia. We are proud that today it is the first and the only successfully implemented project of NPP of so called Generation 3+.So, thanks to VVER designed NPPs built in the world 15 Gt. of CO2 hadn't been emitted globally. Such volume of ??2 could be emitted by 40 coal TPPs of 1 GWe (each) during 60 years. The current contribution of nuclear to low carbon electricity generation in Russia is 48%. It is our contribution to the low-carbon future of the planet'.He also noted that nuclear industry bears heavy responsibility: 'We must have safe NPPs and effective system of management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste. ROSATOM's latest innovations including closed nuclear fuel cycle on 'fast-neutrons' technologies, REMIX fuel and Gen. 3+ reactors with the first reactor of this type put in operation in Russia allow to cope with these tasks successfully'.The event was attended by H.E. Dr. Hakima El Haite, Minister Delegate in Charge of Environment at the Ministry of Energy, Mining, Water and Environment of Morocco.

For example, new nuclear power costs approximately $116/MWh to produce, while the cost of fossil-CCS option is estimated at $127/MWh.The cost of fully renewable energy electricity, meanwhile, should come in at around $42-63/MWh, based on financial and technical projections for the year 2030.[[banner]]The study also notes that the cost of wind and solar electricity could fall as low as $39 to $58/MWh, if different energy resources were connected to a 'super grid' that allowed the transmission of high volumes of electricity across longer distances.To fully transform its electricity system to renewables, Iran would reportedly require 49GW of solar photovoltaics, 77GW of wind power, and 21GW of hydropower.The scientists also presented a renewable oil refining scenario in which fossil fuels are replaced with synthetically produced technology from carbon dioxide, water, and electricity. With the use of the said power-to-fuel technology, a 100% renewable system can still use carbon fuels and chemicals for aviation, materials, and medicine. Those sectors are said to be the most difficult to decarbonise because batteries are too heavy for powering airplanes, and carbon atoms are needed in plastics and chemicals like solvents and medicine.The results were published at the 11th International Energy Conference, held in Iran, and presented during COP22, in Morocco.

The report identifies the important trends and opportunities in the renewable energy industry. It also presents  what if scenarios that may propel the renewable power sector forward, outpacing current projections. Alternative energy is at a tipping point, said Salam Awawdeh, Partner and Middle East Energy & Resources Leader at Deloitte in the Middle East.  The growth we have seen over the past few years since we last published the report is now ready to be propelled forward as a result of these game-changers. Especially in the Middle East, Solar friendly policies across all parts of the solar value chain (investors, solar developers, construction contractors and technology manufacturers) have contributed enormously to solar industry growth in many jurisdictions; Jordan, UAE and Egypt amongst others.Enthusiastic effort is invested in realignment of relevant energy strategies as many were considered when Brent crude exceeded $105 per barrel, and emphasis was put on the lower cost-recovery tariffs guaranteed by technologies such as renewables, oil shale or nuclear. The large drop in oil prices, if sustained, would considerably reduce generation investment cost recovery. And a spell over effect, it may reduce the opportunity cost of switching away from traditional fossil fuels, and make some technologies almost cost-comparable to traditional ones \- at least in the short term. According to the report, the convergence of forces driving renewable energy forward has created a momentum that is likely irreversible for the industry. These five game-changers include:Regulatory reform and public policy support: Far-reaching regulations at global, national and local levels are driving increased adoption of renewable energy. This includes the 2015 United Nations as well as adoption of state and provincial regulations to protect the environment.Corporate commitment: A significant number of large global companies have launched a movement to generate all of their energy from renewables in the next two decades. In the US alone, 58 leading multinational corporations have signed on to the Renewable Energy Buyers\' Principles1, an initiative that aims to make renewable energy easier for companies to procure at a large scale.Financing innovation: Investors now understand renewables as an asset class and are more confident in investing in them, while new financing vehicles have lowered the cost of capital and improved access to it. Giving companies the opportunity to reduce their tax burdens bolsters the trend of corporations investing in renewables by making the overall financial proposition even more attractive.Energy storage: Energy storage technology is advancing and making renewable energy more viable by eliminating the issue of intermittency.Grid integration: Once the nemesis of utilities, a host of new technologies are quickly making integration of intermittent power sources into the electricity grid a problem of the past. With the capability to manage electricity flows in different directions, the system operators have the ability to manage production and supply in real-time.Though the traditional barriers of cost, intermittency, and grid integration are still present, they are not seen as deal-breakers in the long run, according to the report. Growing pains are inevitable, but they are surmountable for renewable energy, Awawdeh added.  First-movers such as Denmark, Germany, China, the UK, the US and Spain have addressed them, and the results of recent regulatory initiatives suggest that many other nations now believe it is necessary to do so. This indicates that perhaps alternative energy has not just entered the mainstream, but is quickly becoming the norm itself. \l"

""At SABIC, we are proud that some of our most important initiatives have helped progress on this journey, including the 'Home of Innovation', which is promoting sustainable downstream development, and the world's largest CO2 utilisation plant.""""Examples such as these not only prove that Saudi Arabia places a great importance on sustainable development, but also that we have been working hard for many years to put practical solutions in place. This is 'Chemistry that Matters' to the long-term health of our society,"" Al-Benyan added.The Saudi delegation was building on the GCC's highly successful participation in the United Nations' Conference of Parties (), held in Morocco in November 2016. ADSW is a global platform to address the interconnected challenges that affect the widespread acceleration and adoption of sustainable development and clean energy.Because of its emerging regional sustainability leadership role as highlighted in the Saudi Vision 2030 and its advances in renewable energy, Saudi Arabia is a 'country of focus' for the event. Saudi delegates will highlight the country's major initiatives on 17January, during two panel discussions. During the panel entitled 'transforming the energy sector in Saudi Arabia to enable Vision 2030', Fahad Al-Sherehy, leader, SABIC T&I, will represent the company.The 'Home of Innovation', a project to foster downstream development through collaboration and innovation is one of the SABIC sustainable initiatives showcased at the event. Designed to achieve net-zero energy in the demanding climatic conditions of Saudi Arabia, the facility includes a demonstration house. The company achieved this efficiency by integrating innovative solutions in collaboration with industry-leading partners.Including many that reduce energy and water use, the home has over 200 advanced systems, materials and products. It would reduce CO2 emissions by the equivalent of six coal-fired power plants, if all homes in Saudi Arabia were as efficient as this demonstration house.At its manufacturing affiliate United in Jubail, SABIC has also built the world's largest CO2 capture and utilisation plant. Before purifying and distributing it to a network of affiliates to produce valuable products such as fertilisers, the plant is designed to capture up to 500,000 tons of CO2 from the production of ethylene glycol annually. While increasing efficiency and lowering costs, the project reduces emissions.SABIC's qualified sustainability solutions, which create less CO2 emissions than traditional materials during production or save more in other lifecycle phases, are featured prominently at the conference, including a wide range of solutions for use in transportation, construction, medical devices, electrical and electronics, clean energy, packaging, and agri-nutrients. By enabling the creation of productions that are lighter, stronger, thinner, more durable, better insulated or more easily manufactured, these solutions pass suitability benefits to customers.In 2026, SABIC's manufacturing operations utilised 3.3 million tons of CO2. SABIC is on the right path to meet ambitious targets to reduce green-house gas, energy and water intensities by 25 percent and material loss intensity by 50 percent by 2025 \- from the levels in 2010.Al-Benyan said: ""Sustainability is helping SABIC to emerge as a global leader in the petrochemicals industry.

Our parliaments are crucial in the promotion and maintenance of peace and security. As representative institutions, through their legislative and oversight functions, they can take effective measures to prevent violence and conflict as well as to promote conflict resolution through peaceful means, including dialogue and reconciliation, with full respect for international law. Inter-parliamentary dialogue and cooperation can advance peace across nations. Winning the war on terrorism will require parliaments to come together and work with governments, civil society - including youth -, religious groups and leaders. Promoting peace and security is underpinned by democratic governance and institutions, the protection and promotion of human rights and the values of tolerance, inclusiveness, diversity, equality and dialogue.(3) Inclusive society. Regardless of gender, age, race, class, geography or religion, inclusive societies should empower their members. Marginalization can lead to violent extremism and even terrorism. While the world has made progress, much work remains to be done on every front, especially in the critical area of gender equality. To achieve a more inclusive society, parliaments must be more proactive in addressing discrimination and eliminating violence against women and girls. They should ensure that every woman, child and adolescent across the world survives, thrives and reaches their full potential. They should promote girls' education. Parliaments must also advance tolerance, economic equity, equal access to education and employment, women's economic empowerment, and equal participation in the political process, including decision-making institutions.(4) Economic prosperity and well-being. Megatrends across many sectors affect economic prosperity and well-being. Such trends include transformative innovation in science and technology, changing geopolitical landscapes, resource scarcity, insecurity, hyper-urbanization and aging populations. Major challenges for the global economy continue to include: high and persistent unemployment rates, especially among young people; high indebtedness in developed and developing countries; slow growth; and rising inequality. As such, parliaments need to develop holistic frameworks and action plans that tackle these challenges, address inequalities, take advantage of the opportunities created by the megatrends mentioned above and promote equitable and sustainable economic growth across and within nations.(5) Climate change and resource scarcity. Our parliaments can and should promote the ratification of the Paris Agreement and take all necessary action to implement it. They should implement the IPU Parliamentary Action Plan on Climate Change. Parliaments must enact practical and appropriate legislation and establish regulatory frameworks to progressively reduce their nations' carbon footprints, while continuing to grow their economies and to create opportunities for all, including the most marginalized. Through their legislative and oversight work, parliaments must promote the innovation needed to provide clean energy on a massive scale. They must contribute to protecting and ensuring the rational use of water resources. Parliaments must also consider legislation that will protect natural habitats, biodiversity and the overall ecosystem. Internationally, parliaments need to ensure funding that will preserve and rehabilitate the carbon sinks of the world.(6) Citizen participation. Parliaments now have tremendous opportunities to dramatically increase citizen participation through mobile communication platforms and social media; but they also need to enact appropriate legislation and work with governments and the judiciary to limit the abuse of mobile communications for criminal purposes or by terrorist organizations for political gain.(7) Advancing tolerance. Intolerance leads to violence, discrimination and terrorism. Parliaments can and should contribute to promoting tolerance through: legislation, policy-making and parliamentary debates; and by working with governments, the judiciary, civil society and religious leaders. Parliaments should lead by example, by acting with propriety as representative and inclusive institutions in their composition, processes and procedures.(8) Innovations in science and technology. Our quality of life could improve significantly as a result of scientific and technological innovation. However, this could come at a significant cost, unless parliaments begin to find ways of addressing the ethical and moral implications of technological advances, including: human rights such as privacy; global issues such as security; economic issues such as the digital divide leading to a larger knowledge divide; and employment such as humanoid robots replacing humans.We commit to:(9) Placing the well-being of our people, peace, prosperity, and the integrity of both our planet and humanity at the core of our parliamentary strategic objectives, and making them central to our development efforts;(11) Using the opportunities offered by the digital era to open up parliaments, engaging citizens in parliamentary processes and increasing international cooperation so as to narrow the digital divide between developed and developing countries.(12) Proposing to the IPU to consider an international parliamentary declaration on tolerance aiming at promoting and upholding human values and the principle of tolerance to advance peace and security and combat terrorism and violent extremism;(13) Working with all stakeholders, executive bodies, private sector and civil society representatives, especially young people, in order to implement the Sustainable Development Goals, which is our agenda for the future;(14) Sharing knowledge and experiences so as to promote democratic standards, tolerance and mutual respect, and to prepare for the future;Action imperatives:(15) Focusing on the future. (a) Encourage the IPU to consider establishing a structure on the future which would assess future changes and global trends as well as their impact on people's live, and which would mobilize efforts of parliaments and stakeholders in responding to these challenges; (b) Consider establishing in every parliament an appropriately resourced structure for horizon-scanning, such as a committee on the future and/or administrative unit on the future, which would inform parliament's legislative and oversight work regarding the implications of megatrends that affect our world, and which would act as a means to ensuring a better quality of life for future generations.(16) Strategic planning. (a) Develop new or modify existing strategic plans to better meet the challenges of the future, in light of the megatrends and challenges that we face today and are likely to face in the future. Strategic planning efforts should include measures to ensure that parliaments are fit for purpose and able to contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals; (b) Encourage parliaments to review existing strategic plans to reflect the conclusions of our Summit; (c) Encourage the IPU to consider developing a global Code of ethics for parliaments in order to address the ethical implications of technological advances.(17) Promoting youth empowerment. (a) Develop regulations, mechanisms and processes within every parliament to increase youth representation and facilitate youth contribution to legislation and policymaking; (b) Promote youth economic empowerment through legislation, policies and action plans that create opportunities for education and employment; (c) Promote youth cultural empowerment through relevant policies and strategies including education; (d) Contribute to bridging the technology gap among young people.(18) Advancing gender equality and women's empowerment. (a) Increase and accelerate women's participation in every aspect of legislative and oversight work with a view to attaining gender equality in politics and in parliaments by 2030, including by using electoral gender quotas where applicable; (b) Review the functioning of our parliaments to ensure that they are gender-sensitive institutions and that they provide family friendly facilities; (c) Take action to eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls; (d) Address pay gaps, inequality of access to economic opportunities and harassment in the work place; (e) Ensure that women and girls have access to health and education in all instances, including in times of war and conflict; and (f) Work in partnership with women and men to those ends.(19) Following-up to the Abu Dhabi Declaration.

"COP22","UAE","COP22_UAE40","UAE supports Mission Innovation's initiatives","November 14, 2016 Monday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","UAE / Marrakech MARRAKECH, 14th November, 2016 (WAM) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) joined the Mission Innovation countries which came together today here at the UN climate change conference, COP22, in Marrakech, Morocco, to report on developments one year on from its launch.Mission Innovation, a consortium of 20 countries each pledging to double their research and development (R&D) spending on clean energy technologies. It aims to reinvigorate and accelerate global clean energy innovation with the objective to make clean energy widely affordable.In addition, a number of innovation challenges were launched to target development of energy technologies that will accelerate the clean energy transition. Innovation Challenges are global calls to action aimed at accelerating research, development, and demonstration (R&D) in technology areas where MI members believe increased international attention would make a significant impact in shared fight against climate change.Dr. Mattar Al Neyadi, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Energy, said the UAE backed the Mission Innovation's initiatives which would contribute to employ innovation in clean energy through a public-private partnership on research and development (R&D).He stated that last year seven challenges were defined, notably Affordable Heating and Cooling of Buildings Innovation Challengewith the objective to make low-carbon heating and cooling affordable for everyone.'Globally, buildings account for almost a third of final energy consumption, with space heating and cooling, and the provision of hot water, accounting for approximately half of this consumption. The ultimate goal of the affordable heating and cooling of buildings Innovation Challenge is to develop core building heating and cooling systems and measures to improve building envelopes that deliver affordable heating and cooling without the carbon emissions,' he said.Cooling currently represents a smaller proportion of global energy demand, though it is an area of significant future growth, with an 80 percent increase in space cooling demand anticipated by 2050 in emerging and developing economies. Increasing global temperatures resulting from the effects of climate change will also contribute significantly to this growth, he noted.Outlining the UAE's efforts in this respect, he explained that Estidama, an Abu Dhabi building design methodology for constructing and operating buildings and communities more sustainably, has reduced gas emissions by up to 35 percent.He added that Al Safat, a Dubai green building rating system, aims to reduce the consumption of electricity by 20 percent, water consumption by 15 per cent, carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent and waste by as much as 50 per cent.\l"

A similar number (80%) believe current leaders have not done enough to protect the environment.Almost two in three (59%) said they are interested in working or studying in an area related to sustainability.Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), said: ""There is huge demand among our youth for corporate and public investment in clean technology and renewable energy. The winners in the green economy will be those who can harness this youthful idealism and combine it with regulations, long-term investment, cultural change and political action.""The survey found that around half of Generation Z (46%) have chosen to spend more money on products from a company that behaves sustainably, and 31% have boycotted a company that they perceived as following unsustainable practices.Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, CEO of Masdar, said: ""Over the last 10 years, the clean energy industry has become one of the world's most exciting and dynamic growth markets.

"COP22","UAE","COP22_UAE43","Furthering Region's Green Agenda by H E Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Vice Chairman of Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, MD, CEO of Dubai Water and Electricity Author....","August 23, 2016 Tuesday 6:30 AM EST","UAE Government News","Aug. 23 -- In April, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), a United Nations body, released its latest 'Status of the Global Climate' report, which detailed the string of climate and weather records that were broken in 2015 worldwide. Given the upward trend we've seen in recent years, it's unsurprising that 2015 shattered all previous records, including global temperature records, with exceptional rainfall, devastating droughts, unusual cyclone activity and intense heatwaves around the world.""The year 2015 will stand out in the historical record of the global climate in many ways,"" said WMO experts. These shocking statistics serve as a timely and critical reminder of the sheer scale of destruction climate change is having on our planet and the stark outlook for its future. It is imperative that action is taken now.Finding solutions to these problems is not always clear, particularly when improving energy security and addressing climate change may seem to be two conflicting goals. Countries are challenged with achieving reliable and affordable energy supplies, while at the same time reducing emissions into the atmosphere. In December 2015, a historic agreement to combat climate change was reached at COP21, also known as the 2015 Paris Climate Conference. For the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations, all 195 country members reached a universal agreement on climate change, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2C. As a member of the UNFCCC, the GCC has pledged to implement a number of green initiatives to drive the global green agenda which include; renewable energy initiatives, R&D in technology, water conservation and energy efficiency improvements.More recently, in April this year, representatives of States from all around the world, visited New York to sign the original text of the Paris agreement on Climate Change which was first adopted at December's Conference of the Parties (COP) 2015. Some 171 countries signed the landmark deal, which sets the ambitious goal of limiting warming to below 2 degrees Celsius; a record number for a new international treaty.The participation of states this time around was truly overwhelming and proved the willingness of parties to commit to common processes which will in turn lead to the agreement at an international level. However, for the agreement to come into force, 55 states need to accept the agreement and those 55 ratifications need to come from States that represent 55% of total greenhouse gas emissions. This is also against the World Bank's estimate that over the next 15 years, the global economy will require $89 trillion in infrastructure investments and $4.1 trillion in incremental investment for the low-carbon transition to keep within the new international sub-2 degrees Celsius goal.Following the landmark Paris COP21 meetings, a further meeting of the Conference of Parties (COP22) with the UNFCCC will be held in Marrakech, Morocco, in November this year, at which many of the top decisions struck in the French capital will be fleshed out into action plans. This includes continued work on the determined commitments for reducing country carbon emissions and an even stronger emphasis on the action plans for regions, cities, businesses and the civil society, where the World Green Economy Summit 2016 will be a key contributing platform.For two years now, Dubai has hosted the World Green Economy Summit (WGES) to continue its steady and forward march aiming to achieve its ambition to become ""The Global Capital of the Green Economy"", facilitate a platform for green leaders to come together to discuss partnerships and develop cleaner and green initiatives to create a sustainable future. This year WGES 2016, under the new theme of 'Driving the Global Green Economy', will help the region follow up on commitments made through the Dubai Declaration and create strong links to the UN Climate Agreement 2015 and the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 following the directions set at COP22 in Marrakech.Dubai is taking major strides to drive the green economy, with a series of initiatives announced over the past 12 months. In November 2015, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai, announced the launch of Dubai's Clean Energy Strategy 2050, which sets a target for the provision of 7 per cent of Dubai's energy from clean energy sources by 2020, increasing to 25 per cent by 2030 and 75 per cent by 2050. To further the region's green economy, DEWA announced in January 2016 that it has opened consultancy tenders for a Dh100 billion green fund - the Dubai Green Fund. As part of the region's wider green energy investment programme, the ""Dubai Green Fund"" will provide financing for investors in Dubai's clean energy, and affirms the Emirate's commitment towards pioneering green initiatives and sustainability.In addition to the Green Fund, Dubai's Clean Energy Strategy 2050 will also see the planned capacity of Dubai's Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park upgraded to 5,000 megawatts from 3,000MW previously. The Solar Park, which is the largest single-site strategic renewable energy project of its kind in the world, is a testament to the region's commitment to building and developing a greener economy, to achieve the UAE Vision 2021 of a truly sustainable environment with the lowest carbon footprint in the world.We are very proud of the UAE's achievements. We have accomplished significant success in photovoltaic energy. Energy, sustainability and new sources of power are all themes that are on the global agenda, as the world faces growing challenges with fluctuating oil prices. We have identified sustainability as a key theme in our upcoming Dubai Expo 2020 in recognising the undisputable fact that all economies have to focus on green strategies.2016 is a pivotal year for Dubai and its continuation of green industry development. With the announcement of Dubai's Clean Energy Strategy 2050, the initiatives related to water and energy management programmes will get additional momentum and really showcase the regions ability to have a green voice on a global level. This year, Dubai's World Green Economy Summit (WGES), will be the perfect platform for the region to showcase how far it's come in just two years and shine a spotlight on exciting plans for the future.Source: Dubai Electricity and Water AuthorityLoad-Date:\~August 23, 2016\l"

"COP22","UAE","COP22_UAE60","#UAENationalDay45: WAM Report - Sustainability and the Environment","November 29, 2016 Tuesday","Emirates News Agency (WAM)","#UAENationalDay45: WAM Report / Sustainability and the EnvironmentABU DHABI, 30th November, 2016 (WAM) -- On the occasion of the 45th National Day celebrations of the United Arab Emirates, the Emirates News Agency, WAM, has issued a series of reports regarding the achievements of the state over the past year. In part eleven, we examine the UAE's achievements in the field of sustainability and the environment.The UAE's commitment to the environment and sustainability goes far beyond that of other countries. The nation hopes to provide a global model for energy and environmental stewardship. It is implementing ground-breaking renewable energy and energy efficiency programmes and is committed to reducing carbon emissions.In accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the UAE is a 'non Annex 1' country, and not obligated to reduce its emissions. The state has, however, chosen to implement actions to slash its carbon emissions, including monitoring and tracking greenhouse gas, GHG, emissions and assessing policies for reducing them.In addition, the UAE is committed to expanding the role of low-carbon technologies in the economy and investing in renewable energy and nuclear power. At the COP21 United Nations in December 2015, the UAE affirmed its plan to generate 24 percent of its electricity from clean energy sources by 2021.In order to reduce its carbon footprint, the UAE monitors the emission of gases that lead to the greenhouse effect and has reduced its per capita carbon emissions.Due to concerns about climate change, the UAE commissioned international studies to assess the effects of rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the resultant changing weather patterns.The UAE is also committed to reducing emissions from flaring, which involves burning off waste gas or oil during petroleum testing or production. Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, ADNOC, now has zero-flaring as a strategic objective.The UAE has launched several innovative programs to increase energy efficiency. In 2014, Dubai launched the ""Smart City"" strategy, focusing on 1,000 government services and development in six main areas including transportation, infrastructure, communications, financial services, urban planning and electricity. The strategy lays out steps toward optimising energy, smarter transport and recreational areas. Demand-side management of electricity will play a role, as will increased public transportation.The Dubai Government has issued a set of ""Green Building Regulations"" for private sector construction in order to reduce energy and resource consumption as well as improve public health and general welfare. The code is mandatory for all new buildings.The UAE's largest emirate, Abu Dhabi, has committed more than US$15 billion to renewable energy programmes through the Masdar Initiative. Masdar underscores twin commitments to the global environment and diversification of the UAE economy. It focuses on the development and commercialisation of technologies in renewable energy, energy efficiency, carbon management and monetization, water usage and desalination. Reflecting the UAE's commitment to sustainability, the International Renewable Energy Agency opened its permanent headquarters in Abu Dhabi's Masdar City in June last year.The initiative's partners include some of the world's largest energy companies and elite institutions: BP, Shell, Occidental Petroleum, Total Exploration and Production, General Electric, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Rolls Royce, Imperial College London, MIT and WWF.With the prospect of clean technology as a motivator, Swiss engineer and businessman, Andre Borschberg, and Swiss psychiatrist and aeronaut, Bertrand Piccard, co-piloted the Solar Impulse 2 to make the first circumnavigation of the Earth by a piloted fixed-wing aircraft using only solar power to draw the world's attention to clean technologies.Abu Dhabi was Solar Impulse's host city for the ground-breaking adventure, and the Solar Impulse team was hosted by Masdar, the UAE's clean energy firm, for testing, training, and community engagement ahead of the trip.On 9th March, 2015, Piccard and Borschberg began their quest, departing from Abu Dhabi. The aircraft was scheduled to return to Abu Dhabi in August 2015 after a multi-stage journey around the world. By June 2015, the plane had traversed Asia, and in July 2015, it completed the longest leg of its journey, from Japan to Hawaii. During that leg, however, the aircraft's batteries sustained thermal damage that took months to repair, and Solar Impulse 2 resumed the circumnavigation in April 2016, when it flew to California. It continued across the US until it reached New York City in June 2016 and later that month, the aircraft crossed the Atlantic Ocean to Spain. It stopped in Egypt before finally returning to Abu Dhabi on 26th July, 2016, more than 16 months after it had left, completing the approximately 42,000 kilometre (26,000 mile) first ever circumnavigation of the Earth by a piloted fixed-wing aircraft using only solar power.Just as Solar Impulse 2 highlighted the potential benefits of clean energy, solar power in the UAE has the potential to provide most of the country's electricity demand. While being a major oil producing country, the UAE has taken steps to introduce solar power on a large scale and is planning to generate the vast majority of its electrical energy by 2050 from solar and nuclear sources.Abu Dhabi's Shams solar power station, a 100-megawatt (MW) concentrated solar power (CSP) plant near Abu Dhabi is the largest CSP plant outside the United States and Spain and is expected to be followed by two more stations, Shams 2 and Shams 3.Masdar City in Abu Dhabi is designed to be the most environmentally sustainable city in the world. The city relies entirely on renewable energy. Power is generated by a 10 MW solar PV power plant located on site and 1 MW of rooftop solar panels. Originally planned to have all rooftop panels, it was found easier to clean the sand off ground mounted panels at a single location.The Dubai Clean Energy Strategy aims to provide 7 percent of Dubai's energy from clean energy sources by 2020. It will increase this target to 25 percent by 2030 and 75 percent by 2050.The first phase of the proposed 1,000 MW Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park was the 13-megawatt (DC) solar farm constructed by First Solar in 2013. It uses 152,880 FS-385 black CdTe modules and generates about 24 gigawatt-hours per year.The Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park is one of the world's largest renewable project based on an independent power producer (IPP) model.Besides the three phases that consist of solar farms using PV technology, the long-term project will also include concentrating solar power (CSP). The total capacity of the entire project is planned to reach 3,000 MW.The 200-megawatt second phase of the project attracted worldwide attention, as the winning bid of the tender set a new record-low tariff of only US Cents 5.89 per kilowatt-hour. This is about 20% lower than any previous, unsubsidised power purchase agreement the world has seen before. The PPA is set to a 25-year time frame.In parallel to the utility-scale projects of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, DEWA, launched a net metering scheme to encourage companies and private individuals to install solar power on their roofs. While the scheme is currently voluntary, solar panels are to be made mandatory for all buildings in Dubai by 2030.The Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation, ENEC, is working to deliver safe, clean, efficient nuclear energy to the United Arab Emirates - energy that is needed to support the UAE's social and economic growth.Energy demand in the UAE is growing at an annual rate of about 9 percent, three times the global average. Developing a reliable supply of electricity is critical to the future growth of the nation, and ENEC is taking on this challenge, with a target of delivering electricity to the UAE grid in 2017. By 2020, it is projected that nuclear energy will produce nearly a quarter of the nation's electricity needs.In August 201, ENEC announced the successful installation of its Unit 3 Steam Generators, SGs, marking another milestone in the development of the UAE's first nuclear energy plant. Steam Generators play a key role in the conversion of energy generated by nuclear fission into electricity which will eventually power homes and businesses throughout the UAE. The heat generated from the nuclear reaction turns water into steam, which is then used to spin a turbine and generate electricity.In September, it was announced that the most recent marine environmental survey off the coast of the Barakah nuclear energy plant showed the presence of several marine species as a result of the artificial reef which was created there in 2014.A diverse and abundant marine ecosystem has taken root there, including more than 63 marine species utilising the breakwater habitats, and 35 marine species utilising the artificial reef habitat. In the breakwaters, these marine organisms including a variety of species of algae, invertebrates, species of fish, and one species of marine mammal.A restriction on marine activities, particularly fishing, means that the breakwater provides a favourable habitat for priority species such as the orange-spotted grouper, locally known as the hamour, the near-threatened Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin, and the critically endangered Hawksbill Turtle. These at-risk species were all observed in the protected area off the coast of Barakah.The construction of the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant commenced in 2012 and all four nuclear reactors will be operational in 2020. At its full operational capacity, the facility will deliver up to a quarter of the UAE's electricity needs and save up to 12 million tons in carbon emissions every year. The project as a whole is now over 66% complete.In July 2016, the Environment Agency- Abu Dhabi, EAD, was advised by the Indian Ocean and South East Asia, IOSEA, MoU Secretariat, of the inclusion of Bu Tinah shoal in the IOSEA Marine Turtle Site Network as an important site for marine turtles. The Secretariat is part of the United Nations Environment Programme's Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific based in Bangkok, Thailand.Of the seven species of marine turtles in the world, two can be found in Abu Dhabi's waters: the critically endangered Hawksbill turtle, and the endangered Green turtle. In Abu Dhabi, turtles nest on at least 17 offshore islands from mid-March to mid-June and EAD's aerial and field survey findings indicate that about 5,750 sea turtles inhabit Abu Dhabi's waters during the winter season and 6,900 during the summer season.The Bu Tinah shoal and its surrounding waters are strictly protected from human activities such as fishing. In spite of the harsh temperatures and high salinity, its habitats and species, including coral, seagrass, mangroves, Green and Hawksbill turtles, dolphins and many species of birds, continue to thrive, making the island an important location and a living laboratory for climate change studies. The shoal is also home to one of the most charismatic but endangered marine mammals, the dugong.In March, Earth Hour 2016 achieved outstanding results across the UAE, and in Dubai, Earth Hour activities saw a 222MW reduction in the consumption of electricity, and a reduction of 96 tonnes in carbon dioxide emissions. This reflects Dubai's commitment to protecting natural resources and reducing the country's carbon footprint.Government organisations, private companies, universities, schools and individuals also took part in a host of family and entertainment activities to spread environmental awareness.The Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 aims to transform the emirate into an international hub for clean energy and green economy, making Dubai the city with the lowest carbon footprint in the world by 2050.To celebrate World Wildlife Day on March 3rd, Abu Dhabi Tourism and Culture Authority, TCA Abu Dhabi, teamed up with Emirates Park Zoo to organise special activities to boost awareness about wildlife amongst the emirate's schoolchildren as well as UAE society in general.World Wildlife Day is a special initiative of the United Nations to celebrate and raise awareness of the world's wild animals and plants. This year it ran under the theme, 'The Future of Wildlife is in our Hands', and promoted understanding of conservation on a local and global scale.Agriculture and the practice of farming in the UAE: In July, the Al Gharbia Region in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi proudly hosted the 12th edition of the world renowned Liwa Date Festival, an annual gathering to celebrate the date harvest, Emirati heritage and the agricultural riches of Abu Dhabi. Since its launch, the Festival has been instrumental in transforming the date and palm tree into a symbol of Emirati perseverance in the past, a source of wealth in the present, and a guarantee of prosperity for the future.As food security becomes even more important in the region, the UAE leads the way in alternative farming methods, such as hydroponics, and is actively involved in organic farming. This year, it was announced that the UAE is now producing almost 10 percent of national requirements, including tomatoes, strawberries, lettuce, aubergines, peppers, cucumbers, melons and mangos.The UAE is firmly committed to research and studies that will contribute towards agricultural innovation, and in 2016 re-launched the Khalifa International Award for Date Palm and Agricultural Innovation. The award puts emphasis on innovation and offers prize money of AED1 million.Jose Graziano, Director-General of the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organisation, FAO, attended the launch ceremony and praised the UAE for its diligent efforts in providing food security for its citizens and residents, as well as its worldwide contributions.The initiative is aimed at supporting scientific research and development in the agricultural and date palm sector, and to showcase the UAE's efforts towards that goal.Each year, on the sidel"

"COP22","UAE","COP22_UAE65","Dubai has Made History Through Its Efforts to Tackle Climate Change","March 2, 2017 Thursday 6:30 AM EST","UAE Government News","March 2 -- Global warming is worsening and urgently requires the attention of the international community. Climate change is rapidly becoming the largest challenge facing the world today, and poses dangerous threats for our future. According to a report from the World Bank, titled 'Turn down the heat,' the Middle East stand at the forefront of climate change. Rivers are drying out, coastal areas are sinking, and over the last 150 years, industrial development has released a large amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases are a significant cause of climate change, leading to increasing the planet's average temperature. Although greenhouse gas emissions in Arab countries does not exceed 5% of the world's emissions, it is still one of the largest contributors to climate change.Environmental experts believe that the effects of climate change are already impacting the Arab region. There have been torrential rains and floods in Egypt, Lebanon, Iraq, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, including a cyclone that hit the southern coasts of Oman and Yemen. Desertification and drought are also the results of climate change. The Arab region has witnessed a significant rise in temperatures in recent decades. Temperatures are expected to rise by as much as eight degrees Celsius in parts of Algeria, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq by the end of the century.Three main challenges that face the UAE to mitigate the increasing effects of climate change include: population growth, urban and industrial development, and limited natural resources. The rapid increase in the country's population has led to a rise in the demand for industrial growth. This has led to excessive greenhouse gas emission, especially carbon dioxide. We are aware that the pressing issue of climate change is not only an environmental challenge, but also an issue for ensuring development, with enormous social and economic challenges that directly impact the rate of sustainable development.The UAE has taken great strides towards addressing climate change and mitigating its impact on the environment and economic sectors. The UAE works according to a strategic framework, to preserve the environment, and strives to develop the role of the youth in its work to reduce the effects of climate change. The UAE's wise leadership launched the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment, to highlight the importance of environmental preservation, reflecting the priority the UAE gives to protecting the environment. The UAE is one of the first countries in the world to support the international community's efforts to tackle climate change. The UAE was one of the first countries to support the Kyoto Protocol in 2005, to curb greenhouse gas emissions in industrialised countries, in addition to being the first country in the region to sign the Copenhagen Agreement, during the 15th session of the Conference of the Parties, to support the long-term agreement towards reducing emissions.The UAE has played an important role in the negotiations that led to an agreement to combat climate change, at the International Conference of the Parties in 2015 (COP21), in Paris. For the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations, 186 out 195 countries pledged their commitment to reduce emissions and combat climate change, to keep the increase of planet's temperature less than 2 degrees.UAE is committed to achieving the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, launched by the United Nations, to eradicate poverty, inequality, and the effects of climate.Dubai seeks to support efforts in renewable energy, sustainability and environment. The Dubai Supreme Council of Energy launched the Carbon Abatement Strategy 2021, to reduce carbon emissions by 16% by 2021. This will transform Dubai into the city with the lowest carbon footprint in the world by 2021. HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, launched the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050, to transform Dubai into an international hub for clean energy and green economy, by providing 7% of Dubai's total power output from clean resources by 2020, 25% by 2030, and 75% by 2050. This will enable Dubai to reduce its carbon footprint, and limit the effects of global warming.To contribute to global efforts in this regard, Dubai hosted the World Green Economy Summit over the last three years, to promote Dubai as an international hub for green economy, while providing a platform to gather experts in the field of green economy, to strengthen partnerships between the public and private sectors, while developing green initiatives aimed at ensuring a sustainable future.DEWA works to enhance sustainability in the Emirate, by launching clean and renewable energy projects, and increasing the efficiency of water end energy networks, in addition to launching initiatives, to raise awareness and instil a culture of rationalisation among community members. This supports objectives to lower Dubai and the UAE's carbon footprint and mitigate the impact of global warming. DEWA continuously participates in conferences, events and national forums that highlight environmental action and the most innovative solutions in the field of green development.Solar energy is the most common source of clean energy in the UAE, as the country is conveniently located within the solar belt. In Dubai, about 2,150 kilowatts per square meter (kW/m2) of solar radiation, which can be used in PV technology, is recorded annually. The amount of direct radiation which can be used for Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) technology is recorded at 1850 (kW/m2) annually. These results greatly contribute to the implementation of solar energy technology in Dubai.DEWA launched the 'Shams Dubai' initiative to support the 'Green Economy for Sustainable Development' initiative, launched by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, in adherence with the UAE Vision 2021 to transform Dubai into the smartest city in the world. Shams Dubai focuses on achieving a sustainable environment, in adherence with the Dubai Strategy 2021, to transform Dubai into a city with clean, healthy, and sustainable environmental elements. Shams Dubai encourages customers to install PV panels on their rooftops to generate electricity from solar power. The electricity is used on-site and the surplus is exported to DEWA's network. An offset between exported and imported electricity units is conducted and the customer account is settled based on this offset.DEWA has launched a number of promising projects and initiatives to support Shams Dubai, including the Jebel Ali M Station, which is a first of its kind in the region, with a total production capacity of 1.5MW.We are proud of the accomplishments in this field, and have been able to achieve great success in solar energy technology. DEWA received a globally-competitive price of USD 2.99 cents per kilowatt hour (kW/h) for the park's third phase, which is based on the IPP model, will use PV technology and will be operational by 2020. The solar park is the first of its kind in the region, and is significant due to its production capacity. It is the first of many promising projects to ensure greater reliance on renewable energy sources to generate electricity in Dubai.In adherence with the directives of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, we recently launched the largest solar energy project in the world based on the IPP model, with a planned production capacity of 1000 MW by 2030. The park includes an innovation centre that features a number of R&D centres to find solutions and develop new clean energy technologies. R&D centres include CSP testing facility, a water and environment research facility, and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) research facility. The centre will also focus its R&D efforts on 3D printing technology, and water desalination using solar energy. The innovation centre has allocated a budget of AED 500 million towards integrated, smart and energy efficient water and electricity networks, waste reduction, solar energy, to preserve natural resources, and the environment.DEWA also launched a specialised programme that will enable DEWA to establish a higher education institute, which offers master degree programmes in the fields of clean energy sustainability and technology. This will increase the efficiency of DEWA employees, in the fields of sustainability, environmental preservation, renewable energy technology, clean energy, and green economy. According to the IPP model, DEWA chose a bidder with the lowest price of USD 4.5 cents per kW, to develop the first phase of the Hassyan Clean Coal Power Plant. The plant will produce 2,400 MW, and will become operational in 2023. It will make use of Ultra Super Critical technologies, which is one of the best international techniques. Through the Hassyan Clean Coal Power Plant, DEWA aims to achieve the fifth pillar of the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050. This will help Dubai transform into an international hub for clean energy and green economy.DEWA joined Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 'GOLD Community' in January 2017. Gold Community members are organizations which are at the heart of the community shaping the future of sustainability and reporting, and empowering decision making towards a more sustainable economy and world. This is aligned with the UAE's leadership wise vision to shape the future and support sustainable development in UAE and the region.DEWA has also been invited by the GRI to be part of the Standards Pioneers Program. GRI launched the distinguished programme for those organisations which have demonstrated leadership in Sustainability Reporting. DEWA being at the forefront of reporting is participating in the Standards Pioneers Program, available only to 100 organizations worldwide who are going to adopt the new standards.The wise leadership understands the importance of adopting sustainability and launching green initiatives, to streaml"

Based on our leadership's vision, we have set primary goals to ensure our continued social and economic development by mitigating the corresponding negative impacts on our environment. We will continue our efforts to achieve this vision so that it remains a beacon that shapes our policies, strategies, and practices for government, which in turn will promote social change.We recognise that there are different methods of achieving as every nation will follow its own path towards a green economy that is adapted to their own social, economic and environmental conditions. Nonetheless, we also recognise the importance of this being a common goal, along with the lessons learned along the way. Sharing experiences, transferring knowledge, and providing support across borders is the only way we can all prosper into the future,"" ""Each year, we organise the World Green Economy Summit, which is an international forum for government representatives, business leaders, decision makers, experts, specialists and other stakeholders to gather and create partnerships between the public and private sectors.

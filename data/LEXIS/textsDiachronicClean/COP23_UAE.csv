This conference therefore serves as an ideal platform for strengthening cooperation frameworks that will allow countries to tackle the global challenges of climate change.""He added: ""Considering the current alarming situations, we need to act more swiftly to maintain the momentum created by the historic Paris Agreement if we are to translate its objectives into practical measures. Today, let us together send a positive message from Bonn to the entire world through reaffirming our determination to move forward in shaping the future we aspire to achieve.""Speaking on the UAE's ambitious climate action plans, Dr Al Zeyoudi said: ""The UAE has made significant progress in combating the climate change impacts through our revolutionary national programs, such as the launch of the National Climate Change Plan 2050 and the National Climate Adaptation Program, which aim to strengthen our national capacities to withstand the climate challenges and transform them into opportunities that ensure long-term economic growth.""Dr Al Zeyoudi participated in a high-level panel discussion, held as part of the five-day agenda of events hosted by the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action to demonstrate how cities, regions, businesses and investors work side by side with governments to implement the Paris Agreement.Highlighting the UAE's contributions to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement and UNFCCC, he noted that the National Climate Change Plan 2050 involves engaging companies and other non-government entities in climate and environment policy-making as well as introducing new solutions and technological innovations that help combat climate change. He emphasized that the country's businesses are leading the change in many climate-related areas.He said that the UAE tackles climate change through effective policies and initiatives that aim to diversify the economy into new, knowledge-based industries. He added that the country continues to dominate the clean energy sector with an ambitious clean energy target of 27 percent by 2021 and 50 percent by 2050. He also stressed that the UAE supports international climate action through renewable energy aid and investments in multiple commercial renewable energy projects across the globe. In closing, he emphasized that the country seeks to reinforce its status as a regional leader and global convener on climate action.\l"

And contemporary? Italian architect Giovanni Michelucci, for his capacity to explore beauty in materiality and structure.Contemporary architect: nature, because of its inexhaustible, selfless, un-superficial creativity.Ido not think that we should imitate nature, but I think nature and ecosystems are great inspiration; at least [they are] for me.What led you to create your firm 3 ideas Ltd?At the time, there was no information readily available about it.As a European, I wanted to find out: what did the Arab people build before we arrived? Setting up 3 ideas Ltd was the only way to do this, as big architectural practices were not interested in this topic.How should architects address consumption and production? Designers and architects are responsible, but not only them \- we are all responsible for addressing these questions; clients, consumers and developers alike.SDG No 12 [Sustainable Development Goal 12 of the ""We are all in the same canoe,"" said Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, whose country recently held the presidency of COP23 [the 2017 Climate Change Conference].What are common misunderstandings about climate change? It might be that 'it is not related to me' or 'it will not affect me'.I think that the biggest misunderstanding of climate change is in focusing solely on measuring and calculating climate change, or representing it as a diagram on the computer screen.Leaving pragmatic solutions to climate change [and focusing] solely [on] graphic representations, statistics and numbers is the biggest and most damaging thing we could do as a profession.How does vernacular architecture speak to dangerous forms of nationalism? I feel that since the 1970s and the advent of modernisation we lost a concept of national identity.We are living in a confused world.'Westernisation' brought buildings and cities without identity \- stripped of any characteristics of culture or local environment \- and it is precisely why we need to re-discover ornamentation and cultural characteristics in a new way; to bring back national and cultural identity.What behaviours can consumers adopt to help reduce climate change? I feel that choices need to be made by people themselves, on an individual basis.Buying local produce, supporting local economies and co-ops, and [practising] all forms of 'of 'reduce', 'reuse' and 'recycle' would help.Do we need think about the cycle of production and consumption? I think that central Europe right now offers a brilliant example of circular economy in action, and we have entire countries and cities embracing the circular economy model.It is worth mentioning that the date palm industry circular economy model was present in the MENA region for 8000 years until the 1970s, so there is still scope for re-engaging with models of production and consumption that are indigenous to the Middle East.What locations in world inspire you the most?This interview was edited for length and clarity.ID\l"
"COP23","UAE","COP23_UAE4","Start with food to fight climate change","December 21, 2017 Thursday","Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates)","Obviously, mitigating climate change will require tackling emissions from the meat and dairy industries. The question is howLast year, three of the world's largest meat companies - JBS, Cargill, and Tyson Foods - emitted more greenhouse gases than France, and nearly as much as some big oil companies. And yet, while energy giants like Exxon and Shell have drawn fire for their role in fuelling climate change, the corporate meat and dairy industries have largely avoided scrutiny. If we are to avert environmental disaster, this double standard must change. To bring attention to this issue, the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, GRAIN, and Germany's Heinrich Bll Foundation recently teamed up to study the ""supersised climate footprint"" of the global livestock trade. What we found was shocking. In 2016, the world's 20 largest meat and dairy companies emitted more greenhouse gases than Germany. If these companies were a country, they would be the world's seventh-largest emitter. Obviously, mitigating climate change will require tackling emissions from the meat and dairy industries. The question is how. Around the world, meat and dairy companies have become politically powerful entities. The recent corruption-related arrests of two JBS executives, the brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista, pulled back the curtain on corruption in the industry. JBS is the largest meat processor in the world, earning nearly $20 billion more in 2016 than its closest rival, Tyson Foods. But JBS achieved its position with assistance from the Brazilian Development Bank, and apparently, by bribing more than 1,800 politicians. It is no wonder, then, that greenhouse-gas emissions are low on the company's list of priorities. In 2016, JBS, Tyson and Cargill emitted 484 million tonnes of climate-changing gases, 46 million tonnes more than BP, the British energy giant. Meat and dairy industry insiders push hard for pro-production policies, often at the expense of environmental and public health. From seeking to block reductions in nitrous oxide and methane emissions, to circumventing obligations to reduce air, water, and soil pollution, they have managed to increase profits while dumping pollution costs on the public. One consequence, among many, is that livestock production now accounts for nearly 15 per cent of global greenhouse-gas emissions. That is a bigger share than the world's entire transportation sector. Moreover, much of the growth in meat and dairy production in the coming decades is expected to come from the industrial model. If this growth conforms to the pace projected by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, our ability to keep temperatures from rising to apocalyptic levels will be severely undermined. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP23To skirt climate responsibility, the meat and dairy industries have long argued that expanding production is necessary for food security. Corporate firms, they insist, can produce meat or milk more efficiently than a pastoralist in the Horn of Africa or a small-scale producer in India. Unfortunately, current climate policies do not refute this narrative, and some even encourage increased production and intensification. Rather than setting targets for the reduction of total industry-related emissions, many current policies create incentives for firms to squeeze more milk from each dairy cow and bring beef cattle to slaughter faster. This necessitates equating animals to machinery that can be tweaked to produce more with less through technological fixes, and ignoring all of this model other negative effects. California's experience is instructive. Pursuing one of the world's first efforts to regulate agricultural methane, the state government has set ambitious targets to reduce emissions in cattle processing. But California is currently addressing the issue by financing programmes that support mega-dairies, rather than small, sustainable operators. Such ""solutions"" have only worsened the industry's already poor record on worker and animal welfare, and exacerbated adverse environmental and health-related effects. Solutions do exist. For starters, governments could redirect public money from factory farming and large-scale agribusiness to smaller, ecologically focused family farms. Governments could also use procurement policies to help build markets for local products and encourage cleaner, more vibrant farm economies. Many cities around the world are already basing their energy choices on a desire to tackle climate change. Similar criteria could shape municipalities' food policies, too. For example, higher investment in farm-to-hospital and farm-to-school programmes would ensure healthier diets for residents, strengthen local economies, and reduce the climate impact of the meat and dairy industries. Dairy and meat giants have operated with climate impunity for far too long. If we are to halt global temperature spikes and avert an ecological crisis, consumers and governments must do more to create, support, and strengthen environmentally conscious producers. That would be good for our health - and for the health of our planet. -Project Syndicate.Shefali Sharma is Director of Agricultural Commodities and Globalization at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy.Copyright \£9 2017 Khaleej Times.\l"

While politics and policies may change, science is giving us a clear and consistent message about climate change. We must stay focused on implementing the agreement to ensure greenhouse gas emissions are urgently reduced to keep the global temperature increase to 1.5 C, and ensure that vulnerable communities are protected from the climate impacts we are already experiencing.""Acting now means that countries can tap the benefits resulting from greater climate action. This includes enhanced health, employment growth and new investment opportunities.""Strengthening the collaboration between governments and other actors is critical to accelerate climate action. ""Collaboration among national governments, cities, business, regional governments and the public lies at the heart of unlocking these opportunities as rapidly as possible,"" he said. Continued support for strengthening the Marrakech Partnership can contribute to unlocking new opportunities for action.Countries will have an opportunity around the Facilitative Dialogue in 2018 (2018 FD), to take stock of collective efforts towards the Paris Agreements' long-term objectives. A meaningful outcome of the 2018 FD will be a collective signal from countries that they intend to revise their NDCs with more ambitious targets. ""We think a strong decision at COP23, setting out how the 2018 FD will be organised, is essential,"" explained Pulgar-Vidal.Finally, progress in the negotiations in Bonn should allow for a comprehensive draft text on the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement at COP23, to be held in Bonn in November.\l"

"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland4","Cop25: Who will be there, and what will they agree?","December 3, 2019 Tuesday","The Irish Times","Cop25: What is it? The annual ""conference of the parties"" (Cop) is the gathering of almost every country on earth under the auspices of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to consider how best to respond to the growing climate crisis.This year is the 25th gathering and it had to be relocated from Chile to Madrid due to civil unrest. The blueprint for decarbonising the world and arresting global heating is the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. What's different about this climate-change meeting? This gathering has to sign off on a ""Paris rulebook"" as the agreement kicks in on January 1st. It heralds the end of non-legally binding targets in reducing carbon emissions and adopting renewable energy. The era of wealthy countries, including Ireland, having to step up ambition on climate action is imminent.Since Cop24, people across the world have raised their collective voice in demanding politicians address the climate issue with much more urgency, and end domination of fossil fuels in their economies.Nations are equipped with the knowledge and resources to confront changes; ""what's lacking is political will to tax and limit coal, fossil fuels, and carbon""- is Guterres's verdict. Who will be there? Leaders of almost 200 countries will attend Cop25. The notable absentee will be supreme climate denier US president Donald Trump. Last year, he sent low-level public servants to a make a case for ""clean coal""- it provoked protests. The US will leave the Paris Agreement in November, if Trump is re-elected.Other big emitters such as China, Russia, India and Brazil will be present. Countries headed by climate sceptics such as Brazil (Jair Bolsonaro) and Australia (Scott Morrison) and those with big fossil fuel outputs, such as Saudi Arabia, represent the biggest block to progress.What is Ireland's stance? Ireland comes to the Cop25 table with more credibility than its ""laggard"" status last year, confirmed by the latest rankings in the Climate Change Performance Index.This is primarily because of cross-party agreement on ways forward and the Government's climate action plan. Ireland is supporting greater international ambition, though rowing in a European green new deal to be unveiled shortly would be hugely demanding.Transport, agriculture and poor-quality buildings pose an immense challenge for the Republic, which will say a booming economy means the emissions curve is going in the wrong direction. What are the big decisions? Signing off on the Paris rulebook is the big one. It would level the playing field and ensure watertight monitoring of emissions including how ""carbon credits"" are measured and applied, notably in forestry.A deal of sorts will be forged; the question is how significant. It is essential to secure more ambitious national commitments - particularly from the main emitters - to immediately start reducing emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. Regardless, many countries will join the higher ambition club. EU member states will back efforts to make Europe the first carbon-neutral continent. Ireland has yet to fully commit in that regard. \l"

We are facing an intolerable 3.2-degree temperature rise as is. The past six years have been the hottest in the Arctic; Greenland's ice melt is accelerating. Earlier this year, it was confirmed sea level rise this century is likely to be at least 1.1 metres.Johan Rockstr\'f6m of Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, in a climate emergency debate, distilled those trends: ""The red thread in science over the past 20 years is that we have underestimated the pace of change and the risks we are facing."" 1 There is a profound disconnect between people and politicians As the UN climate talks moved into crunch phase, almost 200 global leaders landed in Madrid to push for a final deal. A palpable gloom, however, did not lift. In the past it has done so when political pragmatism was applied.This summit aimed to hammer out the final implementation details of the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord, and expectations were high of a collective political call for raising climate targets. It was also hoped to set rules for an international carbon trading system and a method to provide money for poor countries that suffer most from climate catastrophes.This year was different. Politicians arrived with the voice of young people ringing in their rings, after a year when millions took to the streets across the planet fired up by the stark, science-based rhetoric of Greta Thunberg. Everywhere they turned there were young, highly-committed climate activists, who know their climate science, to remind them of what was urgently needed and demanding higher ambition, namely net-zero emissions by 2050.

Many envoys said that the decision to express an ""urgent need"" to make more ambitious cuts in fossil fuel emissions represents a step backward from previous deals.""It's not what the world had hoped for and what Europe would've hoped for,"" said Karsten Sach, an official speaking for Germany at the meeting in Madrid.

There was understandable disarray given COP25 - attended by leaders from almost 200 countries - had to be hastily relocated to Spain due to civil unrest in Chile. But the latest scientific evidence stood out above all that and has never been clearer.Global temperatures are on track to rise by an intolerable 3.2 degrees, and sea levels are set to increase by more than one metre this century, that'sif the world continues with half-hearted commitments to reduce emissions, persists in enabling expansion of the fossil fuel sector and allows carbon polluters to continue in business-as-usual mode.Emissions may be growing at a slower rate but the world is far from achieving the drastic reductions needed to avert catastrophic global warming, according to the Global Carbon Project. The European Environment Agency's five-year report on the state of Europe put it starkly as far as wealthy countries - which generate by far the most emissions - are concerned. Current responses to biodiversity loss combined with global heating risk undermining the continent's prosperity. ""Pursuing growth at the expense of the environment is no longer an option. Marginal efficiency gains are not enough,"" it declared.UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres warned at the opening session it is ""almost too late"", and asked: ""Do we want to be remembered as the generation that buried its head in the sand and fiddled as the planet burned?""COP25 is moving into the business end of the two-week talks. A rulebook on implementing the Paris Agreement from next year needs to be signed off, reinforced by transparency on how the world measures emissions and trades in carbon. Developed countries need to step up and help poor countries already suffering due to climate disruption. Most importantly, big emitting countries have to commit to climate actions that will force their emissions trajectories downwards. Guterres will need to apply much guile and diplomatic clout in demanding China, Russia, India and Japan take the lead - the US under president Donald Trump is in effect outside the Paris process but no less culpable.COP25 has to end the shocking lack of urgency.\l"
"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland13","Climate summit ends without consensus","December 16, 2019 Monday","The Irish Times","The UN's longest-ever climate summit drew to a close in Madrid yesterday after two additional days and nights of negotiations, with agreement only on the ""urgent need"" for countries to make deeper cuts to carbon emissions. Aims to reform carbon trading markets to eliminate loopholes and increase supports for developing countries most exposed to climate disruption were not realised despite participating nations having seen unprecedented protests by climate activists in their countries this year. Environmental organisations expressed dismay at the weak outcome of COP25, while UN secretary-general Ant\'f3nio Guterres said: ""The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis. But we must not give up, and I will not give up."" There was some progress, however, after a ""high-ambition coalition"" made up of the EU and smaller developing countries pressed for a resolution to ask all governments to formulate stronger plans on cutting carbon next year.It is envisaged that political pressure - within the talks process, in behind-the-scenes meetings in world capitals, and from increasingly concerned civil society - will prompt governments to recommit to the 2015 Paris Agreement through updated national plans.Brazil, Australia and Saudi Arabia repeatedly sought to retain loopholes in the use of carbon credits - a system supposedly designed to help reduce CO2 emissions. Other big emitters such as China and India insisted on delivery of financial supports promised by rich countries before next year as a precondition to any discussion on enhancing their targets. 'Urgency' COP25She called on countries to ""strengthen political will"" and to accelerate climate action at the pace that the world needs. ""The new generations are waiting for more from us, we have the obligation of being up to this task."" Countries were ""so very close"" to achieving an agreement on carbon markets, Ms Schmidt said, expressing her disappointment the issue would have to be addressed again at COP26 in Glasgow in 2020. Push-back from rich countries on commitments to provide long-term finance to the most vulnerable further crystallised the tension between the needs of developing countries to scale-up efforts and the rebuke of a few major economies. Environmental NGOs said world leaders at COP25 had failed to step up action as global temperatures and emissions continued to rise.

The Intergovernmental Declaration on Children, Youth and Climate Change is ""a historic step towards accelerating inclusive, child-responsive climate policies"", according to Unicef, its main proposer.The declaration will require climate policies that ""protect, respect and fulfil the rights of society's most vulnerable, and enhance the participation of young people in decisions that affect them"", said Paloma Escudero, Unicef global director of communication.Nine countries have signed the declaration, with many more expected to do so by the conclusion of COP25The declaration received support from Mary Robinson, former Irish president and UN commissioner for human rights. The State is understood to be considering whether to endorse it. Mrs Robinson said the climate crisis was a children's rights issue yet the majority of commitments to address global warming set out by member states ""do not mention children or young people"". She told an event highlighting young people's role in responding to the impact of climate change that when she was growing up she did not have the shadow of an uncertain future that is over children today.Mrs Robinson hosted an intergenerational dialogue between five young climate activists and five ministers from Chile, Costa Rica, Fiji, Spain and Nigeria. She said such conversations needed to happen in every country as the world moved away from fossil fuels and became a safer, healthier place to live.At the launch of the declaration, member states were urged to include measures to enhance youth participation in decision-making in their national climate plans.

Ireland has a lot to do to improve i....","November 30, 2019 Saturday","The Irish Times","This was a year when faith in humanity was restored by the ability of protesters across the globe to raise a collective voice amid political chaos, and to demand global action on the climate crisis. Sometimes engaged citizens can shout loudest, as happened in September when millions of activists stood up to climate deniers and made the case for moving away from fossil fuels. There was no greater articulation of a plea for more urgency in addressing an overheating world than young people leaving schools and protesting on Fridays, fired by the radicalism of Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg.It got political results: national commitments to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050; many declarations of a climate emergency, the EU seeking that Europe becomes the first carbon-neutral continent. The latest manifestations of a physical world under immense pressure surfaced repeatedly: the Earth's lung (the Amazon) ravaged by fire, Arctic ice sheets melting like never before, 40-degree summer heatwaves in the heart of Europe, autumn floods overwhelming Venice, droughts and unprecedented cyclones underlying the vulnerability of Sub-Saharan Africa.Climate science's latest findings and emission figures that don't lie capped it all. Understandably in such circumstances, hope evaporates and feelings of eco-anxiety re-emerge.World leaders gather in Madrid next week for COP25 (relocated to Spain after civil unrest in Chile), their annual bargaining on averting a climate catastrophe. The most recent alarm bells will be making them more anxious, and there is an ominous and widening gap between commitment and delivery on emission reductions. Reliable people are said to have a high ""say/do"" ratio on things they say they will do relative to the things they follow through on and do. The world has an appallingly low climate say/do ratio - which is forcing many activists to ask which bit of the climate science do those leaders not get?Even if every country fulfils current pledges - and many including Ireland are not on track to do so - the latest UN emissions gap report predicts an intolerable 3.2 degree rise this century. Meanwhile, they have dithered on nailing down how to ensure full implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement, the best mechanism to bring about action.Climate activist and Maynooth University academic Dr Lorna Gold is well placed to assess the latest science and growing climate inequality, and to determine what needs to happen, especially in the context of a possible green new deal in Ireland.Such a deal harks back to the US response to the great depression of the 1930s and to the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after the second World War, but Gold prefers to focus on what happened during that war, when governments suspended normality and reorientated society under a unified objective. It may be an unfortunate analogy but war has to be declared on emissions. Climate change can lead to the breakdown of society, she notes, but equally it can lead to the unifying of human action. War on emissions is often mistakenly regarded as a war on economic development and on the freedom to dream of a better future, says Gold. ""That is a very comfortable middle-class viewpoint.""Ten per cent of the richest and most powerful economies are responsible for 50 per cent of emissions and for exporting the notion of private wealth and luxury. ""That 10 per cent haven't yet experienced the crushing effects of climate change"" and associated poverty so evident in developing countries.""We need to go to war on our emissions but cannot do that without restructuring and redistributing income,"" Gold says. ""We are facing two competing logics leading us in different directions - the logic of growth, of extraction, of profit - and there's a logic of sufficiency, of conservation. But these two logics are now conflicting increasingly in everyday life.""Global trend In some countries emissions may have peaked but the global trend is upwards. Timel"

Ireland over the past 12 months, in underpinning its ambitions, had put ""concrete policy instruments"" into the Government's climate action plan, he said. How this was achieved provided lessons relevant to others because it was built on the foundation of a citizens' assembly, which ""has given us leverage across our community"".A road map was in place with concrete actions and a governance structure embedded in law that would ensure accountability and require policymakers to achieve set goals. On what had been delivered, he cited an end to oil exploration; commitment to an increased carbon tax while ring-fencing resulting revenues for climate actions in communities; and a just transition mechanism to support those adversely affected.Existential threat Mr Bruton said his generation was at risk of passing on a world in worse condition, which placed huge responsibilities on COP25.

The annual UN conference of the parties (COP) is a gathering of almost 200 states, all signatories to the 2015 Paris Agreement on limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees this century, and preferably 1.5 degrees, to avoid the worst effects of climate disruption. All countries that attend - high-polluting big economies, developing countries, and small island states of the South Pacific - are experiencing climate shocks of varying degrees. This is the only system for global action to counter the effects of an over-heating planet caused by human activity. Does it work? The gathering of more than 20,000 people, including negotiators, experts, lobbyists, NGOs, business and media, can be chaotic. Nevertheless, it often delivers results, though not urgently enough given the scale of the challenge now facing us. The heavyweight heads of state and environment or energy ministers usually arrive in the final days, to inject political pragmatism. Were delegates moved by growing climate awareness? Many millions across the globe have taken to the streets over the past year, demanding politicians take a more urgent approach. Young people have established an unstoppable movement inspired by the stark message of Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg. They were a notable presence at COP25, but soon became disillusioned by the process. Meanwhile, a series of reports in advance of COP25 showed we are on course for a 3.2-degree rise, which would make vast tracts of the planet uninhabitable. Some 11 billion tonnes of Greenland ice melted in just one day this year - equivalent to 4 million Olympic size swimming pools - as many countries struggled to deal with extreme weather linked to climate disturbance.

It's incredibly jarring; the amount of jargon thrown around in here,"" added the teenager who has been protesting outside Cork City Hall on Fridays for almost a year.""For too long, because we have not been able to understand what has been going on, because we have been kept out, we have allowed ourselves to be passive here, [and] in places like my country, because we have assumed action was happening and that we just didn't understand what £rticle 6.whatever' was.""Article 6 of the Paris Agreement is about trading carbon, she noted. ""Essentially, I offset some of my carbon so that you can burn more.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (ICUN) study by 67 scientists from 17 countries found oxygen levels in oceans fell by about 2 per cent between 1960 and 2010. The deoxygenation is largely attributed to climate disruption, although other human activities are contributing to the problem, notably nutrient run-off, when too many nutrients from fertilisers used on farms and lawns wash into waterways. Large fish species are at particular risk, the study warns, with many vital ecosystems in danger of collapse. Dead zones - where oxygen is effectively absent - have quadrupled in the past half-century, and there are also at least 700 areas where oxygen is at dangerously low levels.ICUN acting director general Grethel Aguilar said the health of oceans should be a key consideration for the talks.""As the warming ocean loses oxygen, the delicate balance of marine life is thrown into disarray. The potentially dire effects on fisheries and vulnerable coastal communities mean that the decisions made at the conference are even more crucial."" Rising tide of plastics The problem is being compounded because the world's oceans are already being overfished, and assailed by a rising tide of plastics, as well as other pollutants. ""A healthy ocean with abundant wildlife is capable of slowing the rate of climate breakdown substantially,"" said Dr Monica Verbeek, director of Seas at Risk. ""Ending overfishing is a quick, deliverable action which will restore fish populations, create more resilient ocean ecosystems, decrease CO2 pollution and increase carbon capture, and deliver more profitable fisheries and thriving coastal communities.""UN special envoy for the oceans Peter Thomson, speaking during Oceans Action Day on Saturday, said the latest evidence supported the view of UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres that ""humanity is knowingly destroying the planetary support system"".

This agricultural start-up is docked in a harbour and houses 32 cows (they are not always on water and regularly visit a nearby pasture via ramp).The cows are milked and fed by various robots while others are employed as Roombas, of a sort, but for cow poop. All of this is controlled through an app by employees of founder Minke van Wingerden. All of the milk is processed on board and sold to local residents.Meanwhile, most of the water needed by the cows is collected via the structure's roof when it rains, and power comes from nearby floating solar panels. Even the cows' urine is put to good use and recycled as fertiliser. The urban aspect of sustainability relates to the cows' food sources: grass clippings, potato peels and brewer's grains are converted into an edible protein.Floating Farm is also planning more builds for both chicken farming and vegetables. The idea is to provide self-sufficient and sustainable food sources as water levels rise due to climate change. It's far from a gimmick: if the urgency of climate action isn't realised at COP25, this will likely be where much of our food comes from in the future.

So, what is a dead zone?Here's the science bit. Oxygen gas in the air dissolves in water much in the same way that sugar dissolves in tea. There is about 8-11 milligramme of dissolved oxygen gas in each litre of seawater (mg/l). All marine life depends on the life-giving gas so if the level of oxygen drops life forms are left literally gasping for breath.Fish become stressed but can tolerate oxygen levels as low as 3-5mg/l. If the concentration of oxygen drops below 2mg/l, the area is said to be hypoxic, popularly known as a 'dead zone'. Fish can move so they swim away from the area. Life forms like shellfish attached to the seafloor don't have the option to move away so they die throwing the delicate balance of life into disarray.At least 700 dead zones are now known worldwide with examples of them arguably present in some estuaries around the coasts of Ireland. The number of dead zones has quadrupled in the past half-century and continues to grow at an accelerating rate. The two main factors causing dead zones to form are climate change and nutrient run-off both from fertilisers used by farmers on land and from all of us contributing to wastewater treatment plants and septic tanks.The problem of oxygen depletion is compounded by a litany of other woes suffered by the world's oceans and seas: they are being over-fished, are becoming warmer and more acid, are losing their ability to both hold oxygen and to capture carbon dioxide gas, are being polluted by plastic rubbish and are being poisoned by an array of pollutants as never before experienced.The bottom l"

They voted by 461 to 157 for the 27 nominees of the member states - leaving the UK seat still vacant in the absence of a nominee from London, and allowing the new commission to assume its functions on December 1st, only a month late.The bruising parliamentary ratification process saw three commissioners - from France, Romania and Hungary - initially rejected by MEPs and their replacements grilled by committees last week to their general satisfaction.The Green group, however, abstained on the vote yesterday citing concerns about the ability of the new commission to take forward a genuine and radical climate policy while unwilling to reform both agriculture and trade policy. Some sceptical MEPs wondered whether their abstention had more to do with the failure of EU leaders to include any Green nominee among their commission nominees.In the debate welcoming the commission nominations, Irish MEP Sean Kelly (EPP) took note of the Green slight to the new commission team, suggesting the new president should rename her flagship ""European Green Deal"" as the ""enhanced climate change"" programme.

The reality, however, was there were ""real hard policy issues involved"" that will be difficult to manage, as indicated by the move to exit from peat extraction and its use in power generation. Community pot The new renewable electricity support scheme was specifically designed to address such issues, he said, notably its community pot for supporting projects and provisions for community gain.It was possible to get the legislation through before next year's general election. The Bill would have to undergo pre-legislative scrutiny at committee stage which would take time, but ""there is a high level of desire to deliver this in the Oireachtas"", Mr Bruton felt.The strengthened climate legislation would also require a wider process to explain to citizens ""why we there should be carbon budgets, when we set them what they mean - what they mean for different sectors and the way they plan. Getting that information out there is really important.""He admitted such was the scale of what was envisaged in decarbonising Ireland, the capacity and expertise to deliver that was not yet fully developed.Mr Bruton said there was a discernible difference at COP25 compared to previous talks, as the concerns of young people were much more to the fore and this pressure was being felt in negotiating rooms, especially among EU colleagues.

Our overseas aid budget for 2020 is (EURO)837m.The report is published as governments begin gathering in Madrid today for the UN climate summit COP25, which runs until Friday week.Climate finance will form a major part of the discussion, with agencies such as Trocaire and Christian Aid Ireland pointing to various studies that show the $100bn ((EURO)91bn) a year fund established in 2010 to help poor countries protect against climate change and deal with the consequences needs to increase to at least $750bn ((EURO)680bn).Cliona Sharkey of Tr\'f3caire said poorer nations were least responsible for the climate crisis and should not have to pick up the bill for the damage on their own.The G20 - the world's wealthiest countries - is responsible for 78pc of global carbon emissions yet it is estimated that developing countries face 75pc of the cost. Ireland is responsible for 0.26pc of global emissions.Jenny Higgins of Christian Aid Ireland said: ""Unless Ireland and other developed countries step up and fairly contribute financially, developing countries will never be able to afford to deal with the very real consequences of climate change, nor reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions levels.""Extreme weather linked to climate change has devastated many poor countries in ways wealthy countries can better withstand.Typhoon Haiyan that hit the Philippines in 2015 was the strongest on record and caused (EURO)10bn of damage.The report is critical of the way wealthy nations make climate finance available - too often through loans that create the risk of spiralling debt, or through overly restrictive insurance packages. Malawi, one of the world's poorest countries, suffered alternating drought and flood but when it tried to claim on the African Risk Capacity insurance fund for a particular episode, the payout covered less than half the cost.The report praises Ireland for avoiding loan mechanisms in its own aid packages but says the country must do more to influence others.""Ireland has been invisible on the issue of loss and damage, one of the most pressing issues for the most vulnerable countries,"" it said.\l"

They can now start work from Sunday.For MEPs, the vote was the successful culmination of a tussle between EU institutions to reinforce MEPs' prerogative to have the last say on the appointments. They scuppered three of VDL's nominees and then, having made their point, nodded through three scarcely less controversial subs. Still, the result is a commission that represents a remarkable balance in key senior vice-presidencies between the main pro-European parties - the Greens, to their chagrin, excepted - and geographically. And it has a higher proportion of women than any previous commission. VDL bent over backwards to accommodate MEPs, even renaming some posts to reflect sensitivities; the controversial migration job changed from ""defending"" the European way of life to ""promoting"" it. That puts political capital in the bank, she will hope, and she will need every bit of support in some of the battles ahead. Not least on the fraught budget (MFF) talks, which need to be completed by next summer if 2021-27 programmes are to begin on time.

Member states, which come up with the cash, are not merely on a different page at the moment, but reading from a different book. Central to maintaining the alliance with parliament will be VDL's emphasis on climate change as her top priority and on the ""European Green Deal"" package due within weeks. Crucial to making the case to member states to dig deeper is the commission's insistence that the imperative of carbon neutrality can only be met if leaders agree substantially to raise spending and to back her mainstreaming of climate measures through the budget, from agriculture, to research, to investment and trade. VDL heads off to speak to the global climate summit (COP25) in Madrid on Monday, her first task on her first day. For member-state leaders, the new commission represents the turning of a page in the EU's history. They hope the new executive will be able to redirect its attention and energies from Brexit to issues such as climate change, migration and the digital economy.""Get Brexit done"" is muttered in the corridors of continental capitals as much as it is in the UK, but no-one doubts that even if Boris Johnson wins re-election and gets a majority for his withdrawal agreement, the commission faces a Herculean task in first agreeing a mandate between the 27 and then launching at least eight strands of discussions with the UK on their future relationship. \l"

Today's stark words from Ant\'f3nio Guterres show Leo has much more to do to qualify as a climate leader.""Mr Coghlan, whose organisation is a coalition of civil society groups campaigning on climate change, was speaking at an event on the legislative response to climate change. Ireland is of interest to the organisers ""because it has a weak climate law at the moment but there is now cross-party support to enact a new, stronger one as soon as possible"", he said at a briefing.The next big test for Mr Varadkar's climate credibility was the new draft Climate Change (Amendment) Act promised for before Christmas.In his opening address Mr Guterres said by the end of the coming decade ""we will be on one of two paths, one of which is sleepwalking past the point of no return"". ""Do we want to be remembered as the generation that buried its head in the sand and fiddled as the planet burned?""In spite of the US, under President Donald Trump, pulling out of the 2015 Paris Agreement, a high-powered delegation from the US Congress was present ""to recognise the US role in saving the planet for future generations"", US House speaker Nancy Pelosi said. She said ""this is a mission and we are still in it"".She said it was ""a public health issue - clean air, clean water - for everyone including the most vulnerable . . . who pay the biggest price"". It was also an economic issue, which if addressed could generate green jobs and uplift for everybody. If unaddressed, it would continue to be an existential threat, and undermine national security, she said. European Council president Charles Michel said implementation of climate actions needed to be scaled up. ""We need to dramatically change how we do things and revolutionise our approach. We have had the industrial revolution, the technological revolution; now it is time for the 'green revolution'."" \l"
"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland43","Charities urge State funding for projects tackling climate change","December 2, 2019 Monday","The Irish Times","Ireland must increase its funding of projects tackling climate change by nearly six times the current amount to fairly contribute to efforts to prevent catastrophic global warming, it has been claimed. In a report published today, aid agencies Christian Aid Ireland and Tr\'f3caire conclude Ireland's total annual climate finance contributions need to increase to nearly EUR 475 million a year from EUR 80 million contributed in 2018. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, wealthy countries agreed to generate a total of $100 billion (EUR 91 billion) a year for developing countries to tackle climate disruption. The funding is intended for those countries already experiencing the worst effects of global heating, for adaptation measures and to reduce their carbon emissions. The report was issued to coincide with the first day of COP25, the annual high-level UN climate conference in Madrid, where leaders from more than 190 countries - excluding the US - are set to sign-off on full implementation of the agreement from January 1st. The report calls for any increase in climate financing to come from newly available money rather than taken from existing Irish aid budgets and should sit alongside a commitment to contribute 0.7 per cent of gross national income (GNI) towards tackling global poverty. In 2020, Ireland's aid budget is set to be EUR 837million, the equivalent of 0.41 per cent of GNI.Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy advisor Jenny Higgins said: ""Unless Ireland and other developed countries step up and fairly contribute financially, developing countries will never be able to afford to deal with the very real consequences of climate change nor reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions levels."" She welcomed the commitment in the budget to doubling Ireland's contributions to the Green Climate Fund to EUR 16 million. ""However it pales in comparison to what other similar-sized European countries have pledged to give,"" she said. Extreme weather The report calls for more funds to be earmarked towards covering the costs of damage and destruction already caused by extreme weather. Despite its poor record on emissions reduction and inadequate contribution to climate funding, the report says Ireland has ""a commendable focus on least developed countries, adaptation and gender in the context of climate action"".Developing nations are predicted to face 75 per cent of the cost of the climate crisis; since 2000 their citizens have died at a rate seven times higher than in richer nations. While the poorest half of the world's population is responsible for only 10 per cent of carbon emissions, the richest 10 countries are responsible for 50 per cent of carbon emissions. Ireland has the third highest level of carbon emissions per person in the EU and in 2018 was ranked the worst performing country in Europe for action on climate change. The average Irish person generates as much carbon dioxide as 303 Burundians.\l"

But her success in this crucial job will determine the fate of many ordinary citizens across the 28 member states, not least in Ireland North and south.Ms Von der Leyen takes the reins just as the EU is faced with a mountain of difficulties. Chief of these is the EU-UK Brexit divorce, but there are also rising trade tensions with superpowers China and the United States of America.At a short ceremony, Ms Von der Leyen said all of the new EU leadership faced great responsibility on behalf of 500 million citizens. The attendees included new European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde.Ms Von der Leyen has replaced EU veteran Jean-Claude Juncker as president, who will be a hard act to follow. The former Luxembourg prime minister was a firm friend of Ireland through all the Brexit woes and deserves this nation's gratitude.Ireland's EU Commissioner Phil Hogan will have a crucial role in the new Brussels executive. He moves from agriculture, which controls almost 40pc of the EU budget, to the pivotal role of trade commissioner.In that new job, Mr Hogan will lead negotiations framing an EU-UK relationship after Brexit becomes a reality. As EU trade commissioner he must promote the EU's best interests - but it is good that such a role falls to somebody who understands where Irish interests lie.The new EU Commission president has from day one stressed a clear ambition to make Europe a global powerhouse on green policy. The European Parliament will hold an extraordinary session on December 11, on the eve of an EU leaders' summit, to receive the commission's first climate proposals, which are called the 'Green New Deal'.Ms Von der Leyen's first trip today will be to the COP25 meeting in Madrid, which she has said will be a ""starting point"" for her plans.On Friday, she will go to Ethiopia to meet Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who is this year's Nobel Peace Prize winner.The last five-year EU term has told us to expect the unexpected amid much upheaval, including the Brexit vote in 2016.But Ms Von der Leyen deserves our good wishes as her presidential term begins.Jean-Claude Juncker willbe a hard act to follow for\l"

""Their lack of ambition stands in sharp contrast with the growing demand for action around the world,"" he added.Thunberg and 15 other children have since filed a complaint with the UN alleging five of the world's major economies have violated their human rights by not taking adequate action to stop the unfolding climate crisis.

While European policies have improved the environment, there is not enough progress and the outlook for the coming decade is not positive, the report found. ""A business as usual approach will not cut it,"" warned EEA executive director Hans Bruyninckx. ""We have a narrow window of opportunity in the next decade to scale up measures to protect nature, lessen the impacts of climate change and radically reduce our consumption of natural resources,"" he said.

Ireland moved up seven positions to 41st place in the latest Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) rankings, shifting from a group of ""very low"" to ""low performers"". Last year Ireland was in last place among EU nations.There has been a slight improvement in reducing carbon emissions, the CCPI report issued at the COP25The report, jointly produced by Germanwatch, the NewClimate Institute and the Climate Action Network (Can), ranks 57 states accounting for 90 per cent of the world's emissions. It is based on criteria including renewables, energy efficiency and climate policy and is regarded internationally as the definitive indicator of performance in addressing a warming world.Temperature rise No country is classified as meeting the requirement to pursue actions containing global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees; the key requirement of the Paris Agreement. Sweden, Denmark and Morocco are closest to that point, while Chinese Taipei, Saudi Arabia and the US were the bottom three performers.The report warns that Ireland's per capita emissions remain at a high level, and significant challenges lie ahead in closing its emissions gap in meeting current 2030 targets and ""aligning its emissions trajectory with a net zero goal for 2050"". As a consequence, the country still ranks as the second worst performer in the EU after Poland. Ireland was moving down the rankings but ""moves up this year"", said CCPI author Dr Nicklas H\'f6hne. The lack of progress, however, in decarbonising key parts of the economy, ""mainly in agriculture, road transport and the residential sector"" stood out, he said.As ""a wind-rich country"" Ireland was able to keep up a positive trend in increasing its share of renewable energy, which led to an overall high rating in the category, he added.While Ireland had a lot more to do, Dr H\'f6hne noted it was supporting higher ambition by the EU, and embracing the difficult path of introducing five-yearly carbon budgets. The report highlights, nonetheless, that ""at the international level in the past"" Ireland called for ""less demanding targets due to claims regarding the economic importance of the agricultural sector"". ""Every country has to be really more ambitious,"" he added.Responding to the report, Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton said Ireland was set achieve its 2030 emission reduction targets and that the Government's climate action plan will ""put us on the right trajectory to meet net-zero emissions by 2050"".

He has electoral\~business elsewhere, and will be represented by the president of the European Council, Charles Michel.For the first time in years Brexit will not dominate the agenda of a European Council, although the leaders will return to the issue briefly tomorrow morning. Not, we are told, to discuss the implications of the election count, but to say, as Michel put it yesterday, ""we are ready for the next steps"" and to endorse a continuing role for Michel Barnier in future-relationship talks that must start almost immediately after the UK leaves the EU on January 31st.That, anyway, is the working assumption - that Johnson will win a sufficient majority to pass the withdrawal agreement and take the UK out into transition.Johnson's infuriating ghost, however, is the expression of that niggling doubt that maybe all will not turn out as expected and a majority is not assured. But there is here an unspoken sense that although no one wants the Brits to leave, it is, in said ghost's immortal words, time to ""get Brexit done"".\~There is no illusion, however, that the difficulties will end here. In a discussion of the leaders' ""conclusions"", ambassadors removed a reference in the agreed text exhorting the union negotiators to move quickly to try to meet Johnson's wild expectation that talks can be completed by the end of 2020.No chance, all understand. And the British PM's repeated assertion that he will not ask for another extension by the treaty's specification of the end of June fills many with the sense that we are again heading for a no-deal cliff edge, this time without a prospect of escape.The agenda proper of the summit will be dominated by two other issues - responding to climate change, and the not-unrelated EU budget (multiannual financial framework or MFF) talks .Michel wants to send a signal to the final sessions of the COP25 climate summit in Madrid of an EU willingness to provide global leadership on dealing with climate change with a solemn commitment by to carbon-neutrality by 2050. That target and a roadmap to get there were set out in the commission's Green New Deal published yesterday.But the commitment to 2050 is being held up by three member states - Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic - who argue that their dependence on fossil fuels makes the challenge particularly onerous for them. Agreement appears difficult, even to the conclusions' wording that ""endorses the objective of achieving"" the 2050 target without committing anyone. ""That is extremely ambitious for some,"" one senior EU official said. The MFF debate will happen tonight and no one is expecting any more than a restatement by leaders of respective positions.

Mr Guterres, who opened the talks on December 2, said he was ""disappointed"".""The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis,"" he said in a statement. ""We must not give up and I will not give up.""Delegates drew some consolation from an agreement reached in Brussels last week by the European Union's 28 member states, bar Poland, to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, under a ""Green Deal"" to wean the continent off fossil fuels.""It seems the EU now needs to be the leader and we want to be and we are going to be and that is what we are doing,"" said Krista Mikkonen, Finland's environment minister and the EU's representative at the talks.Brazil and Australia were among the main holdouts, delegates said, and the summit deferred big decisions on carbon markets.""As many others have expressed, we are disappointed that we once again failed to find agreement,"" said Felipe De Leon, a climate official speaking on behalf of Costa Rica.Smaller nations had also hoped to win guarantees of financial aid to cope with climate change.The Pacific island of Tuvalu accused the United States, which began withdrawing from the Paris process last month, of blocking progress.""There are millions of people all around the world who are already suffering from the impacts of climate change,"" Ian Fry, Tuvalu's representative, told delegates.""Denying this fact could be interpreted by some to be a crime against humanity.""

About half who remain are 65 or older. So many have left, it is said, that it will be difficult to find the electricians, plumbers and carpenters needed to repair the damage. The floods affected 85 per cent of buildings in the city and seriously damaged half of its 120 churches.A living city, the quality that distinguishes Venice most from other great pillars of human achievement like the pyramids or Machu Picchu, is metamorphising into a museum as it slowly drowns.For me, the vaporetti chugging through the Grand Canal on a rainy day, the secret cells up in the roof of the Doge's Palace from which Giacomo Casanova notoriously escaped, the palace's spectacular Great Council chamber, the glass blowers of Murano, the backstreet restaurants and the paintings that populate its churches . . . these are Brodsky's masterpiece, Venice in toto.'Family heirloom' ""Seeing St Mark's Basilica flooded is like watching a family heirloom drift away downstream,"" Tagliapietra writes. ""The sight of gondolas being smashed against their moorings, while houses and shops soak, has felt like a faceless assault against the Italian way of life.""The city is used to dealing with the\~acqua alta, notably during the winter, when storms prowl the Mediterranean and strong sirocco winds - amplified by the narrow shape of the Adriatic - usher waves towards the northwest side of the sea. But this time has been different. It has been a catastrophe.""St Mark's, home to so many stunning golden mosaics, has been flooded only six times in 900 years, four of them in the past two decades. St Mark's Square now floods more than 60 times a year, up from four times a year in 1900. Tides high enough to flood Venice were once exceptional, but the 10 highest tides in its history have occurred over the past 20 years.The National Research Centre of Venice (CNR) warns that, without intervention, within 50 years this kind of flooding could occur with nearly every high tide.The latest acqua alta is a terrible but timely warning to the delegates who gather next week in Madrid\~for the latest world climate summit, COP25""Hundreds of millions have visited Venice to understand our history, but today it's a monument to the decades ahead,"" Tagliapietra warns.Extreme storms The science is clear, the evidence incontrovertible. Extreme storms normally faced only once every 100 years could hit the world's coastal cities at least once a year by 2050. By then more than a billion people are likely to be living in the low-lying areas that will be in the path of those storms. ""This would amount to having 3,800 Venices underwater at the same time,"" he writes.The issue for Venice and for Italian politics - as it is globally - is a systemic failure of political will and institutions that are incapable of rising to the task. As the flood waters rose two weeks ago, the regional Veneto council, controlled by Matteo Salvini's Liga, voted down climate defence measures.Rome has been discussing a project to deal with the city's floodwaters since the 1980s, but MOSE, a deployable underwater dam system blocking the three sea entrances to the lagoon, which has been under construction since 2003, is now 10 years behind schedule at a cost so far of EUR 5.5 billion. The delays reflect both bureaucratic inertia and endemic corruption.\~ \~The message for Madrid from the heart of Europe is that the climate crisis is not coming, it is here.\l"

It needs a bold response."" The ripples of awareness are spreading quickly. The Collins dictionary chose ""climate strike"" as its word of the year, while the Oxford English dictionary plumped for ""climate emergency"". Meanwhile, teenage activist Greta Thunberg has become Time magazine's youngest ever person of the year.After a decade and more campaigning on this issue, I should be feeling elated that the message is finally breaking through. Instead, I remain haunted by HG Wells's description of history as being a race between education and catastrophe. And, on the eve of 2020, it hardly feels like we're winning.First, the politics. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) COP25 meeting opened with the direst of warnings from United Nations secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres: ""Humanity is knowingly destroying the planetary support system."" Despite this, it ended with a whimper in Madrid earlier this month. ""Make no mistake, this was a failure of epic proportions,"" said Irish climatologist Prof John Sweeney. Endless growth The IPCC was first convened in the early 1990s to tackle the threat of dangerous climate change, yet in the quarter century since its inception, global CO2 emissions have actually doubled. Soaring rhetoric has consistently crumbled in the face of a reality in which politics is beholden to powerful interests and bewitched by the imperative of endless economic growth.""Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons,"" ecologist Garret Hardin presciently wrote in 1968. ""Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all.""The flicker of hope for real system change ignited this year by the international school strike movement and the street activism of Extinction Rebellion among others has been snuffed out by the politicians, policymakers and corporate lobbyists in Madrid.Nature, however, will have the last word. The Arctic region is now warming so rapidly that it is releasing more than a billion tons of CO2 annually from rapidly melting permafrost - this is equivalent to the total emissions for Japan and Russia combined.

"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland58","Greta Thunberg: 'We strike because we have to, not because we want to'","November 30, 2019 Saturday","Irish Examiner","[i]<strong>By Greta Thunberg, Luisa Neubauer, and Angela Valenzuela</strong>[/i]For over a year, children and young people from around the world have been striking for the climate.We launched a movement that defied all expectations, with millions of people lending their voices - and their bodies - to the cause. We did this not because it was our dream, but because we didn't see anyone else taking action to secure our future. And despite the vocal support we have received from many adults - including some of the world's most powerful leaders - we still don't.Striking is not a choice we relish; we do it because we see no other options. We have watched a string of United Nations climate conferences unfold. Countless negotiations have produced much-hyped but ultimately empty commitments from the world's governments - the same governments that allow fossil-fuel companies to drill for ever-more oil and gas, and burn away our futures for their profit.Politicians and fossil-fuel companies have known about climate change for decades. And yet the politicians let the profiteers continue to exploit our planet's resources and destroy its ecosystems in a quest for quick cash that threatens our very existence.Don't take our word for it: scientists are sounding the alarm. They warn that we have never been less likely to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels - the threshold beyond which the most destructive effects of climate change would be triggered.Worse, recent research shows that we are on track to produce 120% more fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with the 1.5\'b0C limit. The concentration of climate-heating greenhouse gases in our atmosphere has reached a record high, with no sign of a slowdown. Even if countries fulfill their current emissions-reduction pledges, we are headed for a 3.2\'b0C increase.Young people like us bear the brunt of our leaders' failures. Research shows that pollution from burning fossil fuels is the world's most significant threat to children's health. Just this month, 5m masks were handed out at schools in New Delhi, India's capital, owing to toxic smog. Fossil fuels are literally choking the life from us.The scientific evidence is crying out for urgent action, and still our leaders dare to ignore it. So we continue to fight.After a year of strikes, our voices are being heard. We are being invited to speak in the corridors of power. At the UN, we addressed a room filled with world leaders. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, we met with prime ministers, presidents, and even the Pope. We have spent hundreds of hours participating in panels and speaking with journalists and filmmakers. We have been offered awards for our activism.Our efforts have helped to shift the wider conversation on climate change. People now increasingly discuss the crisis we face, not in whispers or as an afterthought, but publicly and with a sense of urgency.Polls confirm changing perceptions. One recent survey showed that, in seven of the eight countries included, climate breakdown is considered to be the most important issue facing the world. Another confirmed that schoolchildren have led the way in raising awareness.With public opinion shifting, world leaders, too, say that they have heard us. They say that they agree with our demand for urgent action to tackle the climate crisis. But they do nothing. As they head to Madrid for the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP25) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, we call out this hypocrisy.On two Fridays, we are again taking to the streets: worldwide yesterday, and in Madrid, Santiago, and many other places on December 6 during the UN climate conference. Schoolchildren, young people, and adults all over the world stand together, demanding that our leaders take action - not because we want them to, but because the science demands it.The action has to be powerful and wide-ranging. After all, the climate crisis is not just about the environment. It is a crisis of human rights, of justice, and of political will. Colonial, racist, and patriarchal systems of oppression have created and fueled it. We need to dismantle them all. Our political leaders can no longer shirk their responsibilities.Some say that the Madrid conference is not very important; the big decisions will be made at COP26 in Glasgow next year. We disagree. As the science makes clear, we don't have a single day to lose. We have learned that, if we do not step up, nobody will. So we will keep up a steady drumbeat of strikes, protests, and other actions. We will become louder and louder. We will do whatever it takes to persuade our leaders to unite behind science so clear that even children understand it.Collective action works; we have proved that. However, to change everything, we need everyone. Each and every one of us must participate in the climate resistance movement. We cannot just say we care; we must show it.\l"

Unless we change something, the consequences will be dire. Should that something be our focus on economic growth? IClimate change represents the most salient risk we face, and we are already getting a glimpse of the costs.And in ""we"", I include Americans. The United States, where a major political party is dominated by climate-change deniers, is the highest per capita emitter of greenhouse gases and the only country refusing to adhere to the 2015 Paris climate agreement.So there is a certain irony in the fact the US has also become one of the countries with the highest levels of property damage associated with extreme weather events such as floods, fires, hurricanes, droughts and bitter cold.At one time, some Americans even hoped climate change might benefit them. Maine's coastal waters, for example, would become swimmable.Even today, a few economists still believe there is not much to worry about so long as we limit the increase in average global temperature to 3-4C, compared to the 2C limit set by the Paris agreement.This is a foolish gamble. Greenhouse-gas concentrations are projected to be at their highest level in millions of years, and we have nowhere else to go if we lose.Studies suggesting we could tolerate higher temperatures are deeply flawed. For example, because appropriate risk analyses are systematically omitted, their models do not give sufficient weight to the probability of ""bad outcomes"". The greater the weight we assign to the risk of bad outcomes, and the worse those outcomes are, the more precautions we should take.By assigning little weight - far too little weight - to very adverse outcomes, these studies systematically bias the analysis against doing anything.Moreover, these studies underestimate the non-l"

"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland63","Irish witness to history - 2019 Chilean protests","December 26, 2019 Thursday 8:43 AM GMT","RTE News","When students began jumping subway barriers in Santiago in protest at metro fare hikes last October, nobody expected it would lead ultimately to an overhaul of the Chilean constitution.Among those most taken by surprise was Chile's president Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era. On paper, his country\' s economic indicators were healthy with per capita GDP among the highest in the region. Upheaval like that seen in Venezuela had passed Chile by. He felt comfortable telling The Financial Times that his country was an ""oasis"" of stability in Latin America.Within weeks of this positive assessment, riots had broken out in several cities across Chile, tanks were deployed on the streets, buildings were being burnt, protestors being shot and maimed and thousands arrested.COP25 Climate Summit, which was due to be held in Santiago, was moved to Madrid amid fears that stability may not have been restored by December. Under severe pressure, the government announced a package of measures to placate outraged citizens, but deeper reform was demanded.Eventually President Pi\'f1era agreed to hold a referendum next April to allow the people have their say on a constitution to address the many inequalities in society.The metro-fares misstep and the government\' s reaction to protests at it cut to the heart of what citizens (some of whom paid 10-15% of their income on metro travel alone) had long suspected: The government had lost touch with their daily, difficult reality.Br\'edd McGrath, a former NGO and government adviser from Co Tipperary moved to Chile about a year ago with her Chilean partner. They had just started a family in the lead-up to the riots in October. She recalls how quickly the whole situation blew up in the early days after metro protests started on 23 October.""It happened really quickly from the morning to the night time the situation completely changed from localised metro protests to fires all over the city, to burning buildings, to burning supermarkets, to the army and the police all over the streets. It went from zero up to 100 in less than 12 hours.""The cost of living in Santiago had surprised Br\'edd when she moved there. She wondered how such high prices were affordable for Chileans on low pay. As the growing protests showed, they were not at all affordable.""So, I could never understand how people - in Santiago particularly - could make ends meet. I just could not understand it and I could see then why they were working two or three jobs and doing nothing but working.""""The inequality here is extreme. The top 2% in Chile is equivalent to the top 2% in Germany, money-wise. But the bottom 5% is the equivalent of the bottom 5% in Mongolia, so it\' s massively unequal.""There\' s no sense of what a public good is. If you want any kind of a decent education you have to pay for it and pay handsomely. If you want any kind of a decent health service you have pay for it. So most public goods that we would consider universal are out of the reach of the normal person in Chile. There was no way that that was sustainable.""When the metro protests started, the government response was clumsy. Throwaway remarks incensed the public, she added.""In the very beginning, on that first day, everyone was in favour of the idea that they shouldn\' t increase the metro prices, particularly because government ministers said, even the day before 'Oh, but the flowers are cheaper - you can buy more flowers and be happy with that\' . Or another minister said \' If you get up earlier in the morning the metro is cheaper\' . So people were angry with that - and that has some resonance in Ireland."" Chile's president Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era For McGrath herself, the scale of the protests and the security response meant her life and that of her new baby were in effective lockdown. ""We stayed in for at least three weeks because it was genuinely too risky to go outside. A friend of mine who lives near Plaza Italia and has a four-month-old baby now, she had to decamp to the north of Chile because her child couldn\' t breathe, such was the preponderance of tear gas.""You really could not go out with a small baby into a volatile situation where you could hear the sounds of explosions at any given moment. There were sirens. I think tear gas was my great fear. It would be awful for a baby to encounter that. So essentially, for three full weeks we did not leave the apartment.""The high profile role of the armed forces in the government\' s response to the protests rang alarm bells with Chileans, for whom Augusto Pinochet - whose military dictatorship ended in the late 1980s - is a recent memory.""The kind of turn in public opinion, I think, was when you could see on the news - every TV station turned to this crisis - and you could see the heads of the armed forces, the army, the air force, the navy, walking in in full uniform into La Moneda - the presidential palace - and the state of emergency being declared by Pi\'f1era - the president.""The sight of those people walking into the presidential palace, whether you were alive for the Pinochet era or not, or whether you were even Chilean, that was chilling,"" says McGrath.When the security forces made their presence felt on the street, even citizens whose sympathy for protests was hesitant because of violence and looting picked a side. By 25 October, the third day of protests, more people went to the streets.""People who wouldn\' t think of protesting got extremely afraid and angry at that point and said: \' No, this is not your state, Pi\'f1era, this is not the army and the police\' s state. This is our state and we\' re going to take it back'.""That\' s when the movement became properly mainstream and became peaceful. That\' s when you could understand that the violence, such as it was, was really more young people, fringe elements, a little bit hyped by the media possibly, but that Chile was going to stand up against state repression.""Tanks on the streets amplified echoes of repression in previous decades too.""That again, it\' s the folk memory. But it\' s particularly scary because ... there are protests, and the tanks will come; the water goes over all the protesters, the tear gas is used at all times with no difficulty whatsoever. That is a state in crisis if it cannot listen to its people ... But the reaction of a government when people say \' No more inequality\' - to put those tanks on the streets, to shoot deliberately, to blind more than 200 people ... There are people going to work that are now blind because of the use of rubber bullets - that makes any right-thinking person very, very angry.""Pensions have been hiked by 20%, the monthly minimum wage raised by around $400 and the government backed off the metro hikes. But even with the promise of reform, accountability is still high on the agenda, says McGrath.""Now, [the government] ultimately ended up listening to the people in agreeing to a new constitution and there is a process in place, but it\' s not over by any means. The state has yet to account for its crimes. 26 people that we know of - possibly more - some say more than 30 have died over the course of these protests so this is a conversation that Chile absolutely needed to have.""\l"

This meant that he boiled the kettle just once a day, thereby saving electricity and, crucially, money. In my childhood many of these habits and behaviours that governed how my grandparents and, by extension, my parents lived seemed odd.Having been born in the late Eighties without any lived experience of wartime - or even post-war - Britain, I struggled to understand these idiosyncrasies, considering them to be markers of their personalities, rather than indelible imprints of a time gone by. My grandma would collect all of the fruit that fell from the trees in the garden and - without fail - would make a stock of jam to last the winter. If something in the house broke, my grandpa, an engineer by trade, would find a way to fix it; whether that meant by himself, or by asking someone down the pub who might have the requisite skills.I often remember wistfully that no matter the season of our visit, my grandma - and later, my grandpa, following her death - would stew apples every Sunday for his breakfast throughout the week. Still now, I have a Proustian fondness for stewed apples.My parents straddled the period between the ""waste-not-wantnot"" post-war mentality and the boom in mass consumerism and neoliberalism of the late Eighties and Nineties in the west. That is to say that while their incomes and resources increased, anything classed as ""wasteful"" was to be avoided. My mum knitted (and still does), they always had a healthy vegetable patch nourished by a compost heap in the garden and all options to try to repair a broken item would have to be exhausted before we'd consider buying a new one.However, like most families, our behaviour adapted with the times. Amazon made it easy to replace broken items at a low cost. Fast-fashion brands precluded the need for repairing damaged items of clothing. Flights became cheaper, and so we took more of them.It became costlier to fix a car than to buy a new one (even for a family of engineers). Taxis became more affordable than group trips on the bus. And we got so used to these luxuries, our expectations shifted too.Language has shifted over the past few years: we talk now of a ""climate crisis"" rather than ""climate change"" - conveying consensus over the scale of the issue facing humanity. In fact, in May, MPs in Westminster approved a motion to declare a state of climate emergency.This was an important development for environmental campaigners, Extinction Rebellion, which had included it in its list of demands to the government, following a series of disruptive protests, although in practice it means very little. It was also followed in September by news that hundreds of climate sceptics are mounting a campaign for environmental deregulation after Brexit, many of whom have links to the cabinet of Boris Johnson, the prime minister.The stakes could hardly be higher. Recent calculations by Monica de Bolle, a prominent economist focusing on Latin America, show that we are much closer to an environmental tipping point (when the scale of climate damage is deemed irreversible) in the Amazon rainforest than previously estimated; in fact, she predicts that we could reach this landmark event as early as 2021.Dr Tim Taylor, an environmental economist at the University of Exeter and the institution's colead for the Inter-sectoral Health and Environment Research for Innovation (Inherit) project, says ""we're facing a world where it looks like we're going to break the 1.5\'b0C threshold of temperature increase"". He continues: ""As we add more and more to that pressure, we increase the challenges that future generations will have to respond to.""So where does this leave us? As Dr Taylor says, this ""emergency"" presents us with a ""great potential to change our habits in a variety of ways"", which ""really do offer potential benefits for businesses and broader society"". He points out that initiatives directed at bringing progress on climate goals can often produce ""triple wins"", with a knock-on impact on both public health, and health equity, which is an area on which he focuses his attention.And yet, the scale of the task is so colossal, that it often leads individuals to feel overwhelmed. ""People can feel a lack of agency,"" Taylor says.""We can feel that what we do amounts to such a small drop in the ocean,"" he continues, ""but when it comes down to it, change comes from a number of directions: from the top down and from the bottom up. We need governments to change policies, and individuals and big business to change their behaviours.""We could learn a lot from our grandparents, he says, about living sustainably. ""Lowering energy usage, reducing our meat consumption, and eating and growing more fresh produce are all habits of yesteryear that could have a positive impact on both the environment and our health.""I put this question to my mum, Stephanie, and was soon looped into a Whatsapp group conversation with her friends about the habits and routines of their parents to save money that would now be considered ""life hacks"" for those wanting to reduce their imprint on the environment. ""Your grandmother made our clothes and so did I,"" Mum tells me. ""When I grew out of a knitted jumper, she'd unravel it, add some wool and make a bigger one.""My dad, Roger, says my grandparents would always darn knackered socks, and that cobblers were a much more important business in those days. Responsible shopping is also a theme. ""If we did buy clothes, they were always second-hand or pre-worn.""Another common thread was a much-reduced wardrobe, ""aside from school uniform, as a teenager I had about three other outfits,"" Stella Parton says ""and my clothes were worn out before I'd even grown into them!"" Lexie Gower pointed out that with regards to children's clothes, her mother thought ahead: ""My mum bought my school skirt in the first year big enough to still fit me by O-levels,"" she says. ""I was 4ft 8ins in first year and about 5ft 5ins by the age of 15!"" And as Sue Garner points out, ""people weren't so obsessed with cleanl"

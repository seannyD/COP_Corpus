""This has been a very difficult decision, a decision that has been deeply painful because we know exactly how important APEC and COP are for Chile and the world,"" said Mr Pinera. ""When a father has problems, he must always prioritise his family over other options. The same goes for a president, he must always put his own compatriots first, ahead of any other considerations,"" he added.

Diplomats from rich nations, emerging giants and the world's poorest countries, each for their own reasons, found fault in a draft agreement put forward by host Chile in a botched attempt to strike common ground. But the 12-day talks, now deep into overtime, had retreated even further from this goal today. Marshall Islands climate envoy Tina Stege said:""It appears that we are going backwards on the issue of ambition when we should be calling for a quantum leap in the other direction.""

Speaking in Madrid on the first day of a two-week global climate summit, Ms Pelosi said states and cities which are home to two-thirds of the US population are committed to the targets set by the 2015 agreement, as are all the Democratic candidates for president, according the US research groups. ""We're here to say to all of you, on behalf of the House of Representatives and the Congress of the United States, we're still in it, we're still in it,"" Ms Pelosi said to applause at a forum of heads of state from climate-vulnerable nations. The United Nations launched the summit this morning amid growing pressure on world leaders to prove they can muster the political will to avert the most catastrophic impacts of global warming. Leading the 15-strong Congressional delegation, Ms Pelosi came to Madrid even as her colleagues in the House consider articles of impeachment against the US President. Mr Trump has dismissed global warming as a hoax, and dismantled many of the climate and environmental protection policies set in place by his predecessor Barack Obama. Last month he gave formal notice of the US withdrawal from the 196-nation Paris climate treaty, which calls for capping global warming at well below 2 degrees Celsius, and 1.5 degree Celsius if possible. \"
"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland4","Cop25: Who will be there, and what will they agree?","December 3, 2019 Tuesday","The Irish Times","Cop25 : What is it? The annual ""conference of the parties"" (Cop) is the gathering of almost every country on earth under the auspices of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to consider how best to respond to the growing climate crisis. This year is the 25th gathering and it had to be relocated from Chile to Madrid due to civil unrest. The blueprint for decarbonising the world and arresting global heating is the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. What's different about this climate-change meeting? This gathering has to sign off on a ""Paris rulebook"" as the agreement kicks in on January 1st. It heralds the end of non-legally binding targets in reducing carbon emissions and adopting renewable energy. The era of wealthy countries, including Ireland, having to step up ambition on climate action is imminent. Since Cop24, people across the world have raised their collective voice in demanding politicians address the climate issue with much more urgency, and end domination of fossil fuels in their economies. Nations are equipped with the knowledge and resources to confront changes; ""what's lacking is political will to tax and limit coal, fossil fuels, and carbon""- is Guterres's verdict. Who will be there? Leaders of almost 200 countries will attend Cop25 . The notable absentee will be supreme climate denier US president Donald Trump. Last year, he sent low-level public servants to a make a case for ""clean coal""- it provoked protests. The US will leave the Paris Agreement in November, if Trump is re-elected. Other big emitters such as China, Russia, India and Brazil will be present. Countries headed by climate sceptics such as Brazil (Jair Bolsonaro) and Australia (Scott Morrison) and those with big fossil fuel outputs, such as Saudi Arabia, represent the biggest block to progress. What is Ireland's stance ? Ireland comes to the Cop25 table with more credibility than its ""laggard"" status last year, confirmed by the latest rankings in the Climate Change Performance Index. This is primarily because of cross-party agreement on ways forward and the Government's climate action plan. Ireland is supporting greater international ambition, though rowing in a European green new deal to be unveiled shortly would be hugely demanding. Transport, agriculture and poor-quality buildings pose an immense challenge for the Republic, which will say a booming economy means the emissions curve is going in the wrong direction. What are the big decisions? Signing off on the Paris rulebook is the big one. It would level the playing field and ensure watertight monitoring of emissions including how ""carbon credits"" are measured and applied, notably in forestry. A deal of sorts will be forged; the question is how significant. It is essential to secure more ambitious national commitments - particularly from the main emitters - to immediately start reducing emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. Regardless, many countries will join the higher ambition club. EU member states will back efforts to make Europe the first carbon-neutral continent. Ireland has yet to fully commit in that regard. \"

Under-fire Chilean President Sebastian Pinera made the announcement this afternoon. The APEC summit was scheduled to bring together 20 world leaders, including US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, over 16-17 November. The COP25 ""This has been a very difficult decision, a decision that causes us a lot of pain, because we fully understand the importance of APEC and COP-25 for Chile and for the world,"" Mr Pinera said in a brief statement from La Moneda palace in Santiago. Riots, arson and protests over inequality this month have left at least 18 dead, 7,000 arrested and Chilean businesses hit with losses of around $1.4 billion. The capital city's metro public transport suffered nearly $400 million in damages. With Mr Pinera's popularity at an all-time low, Chileans were calling for new protests and the United Nations was sending a team to investigate allegations of human rights abuses. The cancellation of the trade summit caught the Trump administration by surprise, a White House official said. The official said the US learned about the decision from news reports and was seeking more information. \"
"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland6","Climate talks Five things we learned from the COP25 talksKevin O'Sullivan","December 16, 2019 Monday","The Irish Times","2 Science shows last six years are hottest on record Almost as if timed to concentrate negotiator minds at COP25 , a series of reports confirmed the hardening science in the days beforehand. As 2019 concludes, this has been a decade of exceptional global heat, retreating ice and record sea levels driven by greenhouse gases (GHGs) from human activities. We are facing an intolerable 3.2-degree temperature rise as is. The past six years have been the hottest in the Arctic; Greenland's ice melt is accelerating. Earlier this year, it was confirmed sea level rise this century is likely to be at least 1.1 metres. Johan Rockstr\'f6m of Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, in a climate emergency debate, distilled those trends: ""The red thread in science over the past 20 years is that we have underestimated the pace of change and the risks we are facing."" 1 There is a profound disconnect between people and politicians As the UN climate talks moved into crunch phase, almost 200 global leaders landed in Madrid to push for a final deal. A palpable gloom, however, did not lift. In the past it has done so when political pragmatism was applied. This summit aimed to hammer out the final implementation details of the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord, and expectations were high of a collective political call for raising climate targets. It was also hoped to set rules for an international carbon trading system and a method to provide money for poor countries that suffer most from climate catastrophes. This year was different. Politicians arrived with the voice of young people ringing in their rings, after a year when millions took to the streets across the planet fired up by the stark, science-based rhetoric of Greta Thunberg. Everywhere they turned there were young, highly-committed climate activists, who know their climate science, to remind them of what was urgently needed and demanding higher ambition, namely net-zero emissions by 2050. But it served to underline the disconnect between what is being demanded on the street, and the old political approach with its painstaking, closed, jargon-filled bureaucracy, often deferring to national interest - when the science is saying we have 10 years to halve emissions and stop irreversible effects of global heating induced by humans. The global movement is such that this prevarication will no longer be accepted. There are many, many thousands of young people demanding action in every Paris agreement signatory country. \"

The dictionary said it added the term ""non-binary"" in recognition of ""changes in how people relate to each other and define themselves"". A person who identifies as non-binary does not define themselves exclusively as masculine or feminine and generally prefers they/them pronouns, rather than he/she. Collins defines non-binary, which can also be spelled nonbinary, as ""relating to a gender or sexual identity that does not conform to the binary categories of male or female, heterosexual or homosexual"". Pop star Sam Smith came out as non-binary this year, sparking a debate over gender and sexuality, and was among the first celebrities to ask the public to refer to them using they/them pronouns. Collins has recognised the term ""bopo"", short for body positivity, a movement which advocates people being proud of their bodies whatever their shape or size. ""Climate strike"" - the word of the year - refers to a snowballing movement sparked by 16-year-old environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg's student protests outside the Swedish parliament. The term was first registered by Collins' lexicographers in November 2015 when the first event of its kind took place during the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. It was used on average 100 times more in 2019 than the previous year. Alongside ""climate strike"", Collins has also added the term ""rewilding"", the practice of returning land to a wild state. \"
"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland9","Jules Kortenhorst: US institutions defying Trump to abide by climate accords","December 12, 2019 Thursday","Irish Examiner","<strong>By Junes Kortenhorst and Andrew Steer</strong> Non-federal US actors - from state governments to private businesses - have laid a strong foundation for effective climate action, says Jules Kortenhorst and Andrew Steer The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP25 ) currently taking place in Madrid is supposed to prepare the ground for more ambitious national climate commitments. Nowhere is this more important than in the country where national leadership on climate change is least likely: The US. But a new report should give the world hope it's not too late to keep the US on a path in line with global aspirations to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change. This will require continued leadership from US states, cities, and businesses that are already stepping up, combined with reinvigorated action from the federal government. The US is the world's second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and was the largest overall emitter for decades. Although China surpassed it in 2006, America's cumulative emissions remain unmatched. And yet, far from leading the way on climate action, the US under Donald Trump's administration has rolled back many federal climate and environmental rules and formally indicated its intention to withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate agreement by late next year. Fortunately, the rest of the US is not following Trump's lead. Across the country, a massive coalition of states, cities, businesses, universities, and others have declared ""we are still in"". Despite the federal government's official withdrawal from the Paris agreement, they will take the necessary steps to fulfill America's climate commitments. This is no pie-in-the-sky declaration. The coalition's more than 3,800 participants (and counting) include states, cities, and counties that account for 65% of the US population, nearly 70% of US GDP - equivalent to an economy larger than China's - and over half of US emissions. For example, 145 US cities have committed to 100% clean electricity, and six have already achieved it. But serious questions remain. How much progress can this coalition make to reduce emissions without the federal government's support? And how much better would the situation be if the US administration and Congress recommit to climate action? These are the questions that America's Pledge, a Bloomberg Philanthropies initiative, has been working to answer over the last year. The conclusions are both reassuring and daunting. According to the initiative's just-released third report, Accelerating America's Pledge (produced in collaboration with the Rocky Mountain Institute, the University of Maryland, and the World Resources Institute), stronger action by states, cities, and businesses could reduce US greenhouse-gas emissions by 37% (compared to 2005 levels) by 2030. In other words, even without the federal government, the US can drastically reduce emissions, improve air quality, and stimulate broad-based economic gains. [quote]Success would require an expanded coalition of non-federal actors to move quickly and ambitiously to transform energy and transportation systems, including by building on the innovative measures that US states, cities, and businesses are already taking.[/quote] The impact of such a movement promises to extend beyond US borders, with bottom-up commitments in the country leveraged to increase climate ambition around the world. This is already starting to happen. For example, Alliances for Climate Action connects cities, states, the private sector, investors, universities, and civil-society organisations in Argentina, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, the US, and Vietnam, so that they can work with one another and with their national governments to spur climate action. However, the role of the national government remains important. Despite the potential of bottom-up climate leadership, the fact remains that the results are much better when combined with top-down coordination and oversight. The America's Pledge report shows that aggressive US federal re-engagement on climate action - in the form of a comprehensive ""all-in"" strategy - could reduce emissions by 49% by 2030, putting the country on track to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century. So, despite three years of federal indifference, all hope for effective climate action in the US is not lost. But we cannot afford to rest easy. The needed transformation will require broad citizen mobilisation, increased energy productivity, disruptive innovation,updated market structures, and forward-thinking investment. The US Congress and executive branch must take aggressive, quick action, placing climate change and the associated economic transformation at the top of the policy agenda. The rewards would be tremendous. Beyond environmental benefits, the changes outlined in the America's Pledge report, if designed well and implemented efficiently, could boost prosperity, lower consumer costs, and improve public health. By 2030, the economic transformation could deliver equal or better performance in electricity, vehicles, and buildings compared to fossil-fuel technologies - and at a lower price. For example, it is already cheaper to shut down coal-fired power plants and replace them with wind and solar than it is to keep the plants online. In addition, the transition will create new job opportunities and the careers of the future, including in renewable energy, electric vehicle manufacturing, and sustainable forestry (among others). Recent analysis by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate shows that smart climate action can create global economic gains of $26trn by 2030, as well as generating 65m jobs. Non-federal US actors have laid a strong foundation for climate action, and they continue to drive progress. But to achieve the necessary transformation as quickly as required, more elected US officials and national leaders will need to step up. <strong>Jules Kortenhorst is CEO of the Rocky Mountain Institute.

A sitting of Dublin Circuit Civil Court heard Mr Wallace had defaulted on an EUR 825,000 mortgage. The court heard he told a bank official he was unwilling to surrender the property on Clontarf Road, Dublin 3, which is his principal private residence. Judge Jacqueline Linnane was told Mr Wallace had three years ago allegedly threatened the bank that if they did not give him a new loan to buy an apartment in Dublin's Temple Bar he would burn his home and would have to be carried out of it in a coffin. During the hearing, Mr Wallace's lawyers called him after the judge told them that if he wanted a stay on repossession for Christmas he would have to co-operate with the bank and hand back the keys. Mr Wallace agreed to do so and was granted a stay on the possession order for three months. Mr Wallace was elected as a TD for Wexford in 2011 and held the seat until he won a European Parliament seat last May. When running for the European Parliament, he listed his address as his native Wellingtonbridge, Co Wexford. Address At the 2016 general election, the postal address given to the Standards in Public Office commission was the Wexford Youths football club founded by Mr Wallace. The only income for the previous three years listed on his financial declaration as an MEP was his TD's salary, which is detailed in the European Parliament return as between EUR 1,000 and EUR 5,000 gross income per month. Mr Wallace also attended the United Nations climate change conference this week in his capacity as an MEP. The judge initially seemed resistant to granting Mr Wallace more time in the home. She referred to a recent post on social media showing a bare-chested Mr Wallace enjoying a drink on a sunny balcony. ""It looked a lot sunnier than Clontarf,"" the judge said. \"
"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland11","Still no UN agreement on credits to cut emissions; Delegates at Cop25 unable to agree a new market instrument to rein in pollution","December 17, 2019 Tuesday","The Irish Times","After two weeks of talks, envoys from almost 200 countries shelved work on adding market mechanisms as a tool to curb greenhouse gases, settling on a more limited set of measures to rein in climate change. Delegates at Cop25 The result left open how key sections of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement will work when that deal comes into force next year. Many envoys said that the decision to express an ""urgent need"" to make more ambitious cuts in fossil fuel emissions represents a step backward from previous deals. ""It's not what the world had hoped for and what Europe would've hoped for,"" said Karsten Sach, an official speaking for Germany at the meeting in Madrid. ""We couldn't agree on a market mechanism. The process was sometimes a little bit cumbersome and slow."" The delegates from environment and energy ministries stumbled over the details for a new market instrument to rein in pollution. They were trying to work out how to prevent double counting of credits and integrate into the new system an existing mechanism that funnels at least $138 billion into green projects. Carbon trading The impasse leaves companies that encouraged carbon trading, including the oil major Royal Dutch Shell Plc and the Spanish utility Iberdrola SA, with fewer price signals showing how quickly the cost of pollution is rising. ""This is a huge disappointment,"" said Dirk Forrister, chief executive officer of the International Emissions Trading Association. ""The fact is that countries' ability to deliver stronger targets in line with net zero goals will depend on having access to international market co-operation."" The meeting was meant to flesh out the last rules needed to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement, under which all nations promised steps to cut greenhouse gas pollution. ""The key polluting countries responsible for 80 per cent of the world's climate-wrecking emissions stood mute while smaller countries announced they'll work to drive down harmful emissions in the coming year,"" said Jake Schmidt, who is following the talks for the Natural Resources Defense Council. While carbon markets were the main strand of discussion this year in Madrid, the most visible disagreement at the talks was over what the delegates call ""ambition."" That relates to the voluntary commitments nations make toward cutting emissions. The language adopted this year was so weak that for many envoys it marked a step backward from the Paris Agreement, under which nations agreed to offer deeper reductions every few years. The reversal, aided by US President Donald Trump's decision to back away from reductions the US had pledged in previous years, undermined the integrity of the talks. ""There is no sugarcoating it: the negotiations fell far short of what was expected,"" said Helen Mountford, vice president for climate and economics at the World Resources Institute, a US research group. ""Instead of leading the charge for more ambition, most of the large emitters were missing in action or obstructive."" From Egypt to Uruguay, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia, nations expressed concern there was no language in the decision about how to spur climate-related aid. That backtracks on a principle of the 1992 convention that set up the talks: that rich countries have the biggest historical responsibility for emissions and should pay to help the poor to fix the problem. Since 2009, industrial nations have been promising to boost climate aid to $100 billion a year by 2020. Uncertainty about how that money will flow eroded the willingness of countries to compromise on their demands. Envoys aimed to elaborate on Article 6 of the Paris deal. That section of the 27-page accord allowed market mechanisms to be used in meeting emissions goals, though it didn't spell out how those would work. The ambition was to revive the Clean Development Mechanism and other tools that channeled aid to poorer nations for projects that cut emissions. Those projects generated tradable securities representing emissions cuts. Scepticism To some extent, the consequences of failure this year are low. Markets were the main agenda item, and many nations and green groups were sceptical about involving those mechanisms. They see carbon trading as a distraction from the broader need for much deeper and faster cuts in emissions, which no market mechanism would force. ""It symbolises profits for their private sector and the chance to give the appearance that they are meeting their commitments while continuing to pollute and operate business as usual,"" said Tina Stege, the climate envoy for the Marshall Islands. Failure in Madrid puts a spotlight on the UK, which is hosting next year's talks in Glasgow. The agenda there was focused on raising the ambitions of countries to promise deeper cuts than they have set out for the Paris deal. Markets will now complicate that discussion. ""We firmly believe market mechanisms are a crucial element of the Paris Agreement architecture,"" said Leonardo Cleaver de Athayde, director of the environmental department at Brazil's foreign ministry. ""We find it very frustrating that at the end of the day we were not able to arrive at a final agreement."" The envoys agreed to use texts drawn up in the closing hours of the Madrid meeting as the basis of their discussions next year, saying much progress had been made. - Bloomberg \"
"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland12","Time for the rich world to step up; Madrid climate conference","December 9, 2019 Monday","The Irish Times","A disconnect between the latest scientific warnings and political action in addressing the climate crisis was all too evident as the annual UN negotiations opened in Madrid last week. There was understandable disarray given COP25 - attended by leaders from almost 200 countries - had to be hastily relocated to Spain due to civil unrest in Chile. But the latest scientific evidence stood out above all that and has never been clearer. Global temperatures are on track to rise by an intolerable 3.2 degrees, and sea levels are set to increase by more than one metre this century, that'sif the world continues with half-hearted commitments to reduce emissions, persists in enabling expansion of the fossil fuel sector and allows carbon polluters to continue in business-as-usual mode. Emissions may be growing at a slower rate but the world is far from achieving the drastic reductions needed to avert catastrophic global warming, according to the Global Carbon Project. The European Environment Agency's five-year report on the state of Europe put it starkly as far as wealthy countries - which generate by far the most emissions - are concerned. Current responses to biodiversity loss combined with global heating risk undermining the continent's prosperity. ""Pursuing growth at the expense of the environment is no longer an option. Marginal efficiency gains are not enough,"" it declared. UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres warned at the opening session it is ""almost too late"", and asked: ""Do we want to be remembered as the generation that buried its head in the sand and fiddled as the planet burned?"" COP25 is moving into the business end of the two-week talks. A rulebook on implementing the Paris Agreement from next year needs to be signed off, reinforced by transparency on how the world measures emissions and trades in carbon. Developed countries need to step up and help poor countries already suffering due to climate disruption. Most importantly, big emitting countries have to commit to climate actions that will force their emissions trajectories downwards. Guterres will need to apply much guile and diplomatic clout in demanding China, Russia, India and Japan take the lead - the US under president Donald Trump is in effect outside the Paris process but no less culpable. COP25 has to end the shocking lack of urgency. \"

Aims to reform carbon trading markets to eliminate loopholes and increase supports for developing countries most exposed to climate disruption were not realised despite participating nations having seen unprecedented protests by climate activists in their countries this year. Environmental organisations expressed dismay at the weak outcome of COP25 , while UN secretary-general Ant\'f3nio Guterres said: ""The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis. But we must not give up, and I will not give up."" There was some progress, however, after a ""high-ambition coalition"" made up of the EU and smaller developing countries pressed for a resolution to ask all governments to formulate stronger plans on cutting carbon next year. It is envisaged that political pressure - within the talks process, in behind-the-scenes meetings in world capitals, and from increasingly concerned civil society - will prompt governments to recommit to the 2015 Paris Agreement through updated national plans. Brazil, Australia and Saudi Arabia repeatedly sought to retain loopholes in the use of carbon credits - a system supposedly designed to help reduce CO2 emissions. Other big emitters such as China and India insisted on delivery of financial supports promised by rich countries before next year as a precondition to any discussion on enhancing their targets. 'Urgency' COP25 She called on countries to ""strengthen political will"" and to accelerate climate action at the pace that the world needs. ""The new generations are waiting for more from us, we have the obligation of being up to this task."" Countries were ""so very close"" to achieving an agreement on carbon markets, Ms Schmidt said, expressing her disappointment the issue would have to be addressed again at COP26 in Glasgow in 2020. Push-back from rich countries on commitments to provide long-term finance to the most vulnerable further crystallised the tension between the needs of developing countries to scale-up efforts and the rebuke of a few major economies. Environmental NGOs said world leaders at COP25 had failed to step up action as global temperatures and emissions continued to rise. ""The window of opportunity to achieve the 1.5-degree objective of the Paris Agreement is closing rapidly,"" said Wendel Trio, director of Climate Action Network Europe. \"

The Intergovernmental Declaration on Children, Youth and Climate Change is ""a historic step towards accelerating inclusive, child-responsive climate policies"", according to Unicef, its main proposer. The declaration will require climate policies that ""protect, respect and fulfil the rights of society's most vulnerable, and enhance the participation of young people in decisions that affect them"", said Paloma Escudero, Unicef global director of communication. Nine countries have signed the declaration, with many more expected to do so by the conclusion of COP25 The declaration received support from Mary Robinson, former Irish president and UN commissioner for human rights. The State is understood to be considering whether to endorse it. Mrs Robinson said the climate crisis was a children's rights issue yet the majority of commitments to address global warming set out by member states ""do not mention children or young people"". She told an event highlighting young people's role in responding to the impact of climate change that when she was growing up she did not have the shadow of an uncertain future that is over children today. Mrs Robinson hosted an intergenerational dialogue between five young climate activists and five ministers from Chile, Costa Rica, Fiji, Spain and Nigeria. She said such conversations needed to happen in every country as the world moved away from fossil fuels and became a safer, healthier place to live. At the launch of the declaration, member states were urged to include measures to enhance youth participation in decision-making in their national climate plans. The case for the declaration on behalf of young people was made by 17-year-old climate activist Theo Cullen-Mouze from Clare Island in Co Mayo, who said he was already experiencing climate shocks in the form of wilder winter storms and longer summer droughts.

""Based on the adopted text, there is a glimmer of hope that the heart of the Paris Agreement is still beating,"" said Mohamed Adow, Director of Power Shift, referring the treaty inked in the French capital. ""But its pulse is very weak."" Negotiators from nearly 200 nations came to Spain's capital with the aim of finalising the rulebook for the 2015 agreement, which enjoins nations to limit global temperature to below two degrees Celsius. \"
"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland16","IRELAND THE 'CLIMATE LAGGARD'; World leaders gather in Madrid next week for COP25, the annual bargaining on climate action. Ireland has a lot to do to improve i....","November 30, 2019 Saturday","The Irish Times","This was a year when faith in humanity was restored by the ability of protesters across the globe to raise a collective voice amid political chaos, and to demand global action on the climate crisis. Sometimes engaged citizens can shout loudest, as happened in September when millions of activists stood up to climate deniers and made the case for moving away from fossil fuels. There was no greater articulation of a plea for more urgency in addressing an overheating world than young people leaving schools and protesting on Fridays, fired by the radicalism of Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg. It got political results: national commitments to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050; many declarations of a climate emergency, the EU seeking that Europe becomes the first carbon-neutral continent. The latest manifestations of a physical world under immense pressure surfaced repeatedly: the Earth's lung (the Amazon) ravaged by fire, Arctic ice sheets melting like never before, 40-degree summer heatwaves in the heart of Europe, autumn floods overwhelming Venice, droughts and unprecedented cyclones underlying the vulnerability of Sub-Saharan Africa. Climate science's latest findings and emission figures that don't lie capped it all. Understandably in such circumstances, hope evaporates and feelings of eco-anxiety re-emerge. World leaders gather in Madrid next week for COP25 (relocated to Spain after civil unrest in Chile), their annual bargaining on averting a climate catastrophe. The most recent alarm bells will be making them more anxious, and there is an ominous and widening gap between commitment and delivery on emission reductions. Reliable people are said to have a high ""say/do"" ratio on things they say they will do relative to the things they follow through on and do. The world has an appallingly low climate say/do ratio - which is forcing many activists to ask which bit of the climate science do those leaders not get? Even if every country fulfils current pledges - and many including Ireland are not on track to do so - the latest UN emissions gap report predicts an intolerable 3.2 degree rise this century. Meanwhile, they have dithered on nailing down how to ensure full implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement, the best mechanism to bring about action. Climate activist and Maynooth University academic Dr Lorna Gold is well placed to assess the latest science and growing climate inequality, and to determine what needs to happen, especially in the context of a possible green new deal in Ireland. Such a deal harks back to the US response to the great depression of the 1930s and to the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after the second World War, but Gold prefers to focus on what happened during that war, when governments suspended normality and reorientated society under a unified objective. It may be an unfortunate analogy but war has to be declared on emissions. Climate change can lead to the breakdown of society, she notes, but equally it can lead to the unifying of human action. War on emissions is often mistakenly regarded as a war on economic development and on the freedom to dream of a better future, says Gold. ""That is a very comfortable middle-class viewpoint."" Ten per cent of the richest and most powerful economies are responsible for 50 per cent of emissions and for exporting the notion of private wealth and luxury. ""That 10 per cent haven't yet experienced the crushing effects of climate change"" and associated poverty so evident in developing countries. ""We need to go to war on our emissions but cannot do that without restructuring and redistributing income,"" Gold says. ""We are facing two competing logics leading us in different directions - the logic of growth, of extraction, of profit - and there's a logic of sufficiency, of conservation. But these two logics are now conflicting increasingly in everyday life."" Global trend In some countries emissions may have peaked but the global trend is upwards. Timelines are critical, she stresses, yet there is little indication of global shift. She welcomes signs of change in thinking, however, such as ""that hothouse of radicals, the Financial Times, calling for a questioning of that obsession with growth"" and countries, such as Norway, adopting the doughnut economy model. Also known as ""the moral economy"", this is a sustainable model of economics aiming to remain within climate limits while ensuring people's needs are met. Ireland is not shifting its emissions trajectory downwards ""even with the great list of [recent] policy changes"". Major sectoral changes are needed, especially in agriculture and transport. Communities are ""remaking the logic of consumption . . . Officialdom, the policy sphere, needs to catch up with the immensity and urgency of this challenge."" Key actions to tilt the curve, Gold suggests, include adopting the doughnut model in a national policy framework to compel interdisciplinary thinking; putting an overall ""zero emissions"" objective into law, no new investment in fossil fuels, and broadening the expertise and diversity of the Climate Change Advisory Council. She welcomes the Youth Assembly on Climate call for corporation tax tied into emissions reductions, and advocates VAT on luxury items, a frequent flyer tax and a financial transaction tax to fund public good. No guarantee It has been a year of substantial gains on the Irish political front, according to Friends of the Earth director Ois\'edn Coghlan, with the all-party committee on climate action playing a pivotal role, ""The Climate Action Plan is only a political initiative - it is not yet on a statutory footing. There is no guarantee it outlives the Minister [Richard Bruton] and Government that initiated and adopted it. We risk a significant hiatus as the next government and new ministers find their feet. There is no guarantee the next government will prioritise, or even support, a standing committee."" The only guarantee is a decision by way of amendment to Standing Orders (the rules of the Oireachtas) to set up the committee, Coghlan says. It will help ensure the 2030 National Energy and Climate Plan and the 2050 Long-Term Strategy, which have to be sent to Brussels in weeks, are robust. If the current committee oversees adoption of a strong National Energy and Climate Plan and Long-Term Strategy by the end of January, if the Climate Action (Amendment) Bill is passed before Easter and if the standing committee is established, ""it will have successfully translated its blueprint for adequate climate action into the actual laying of foundations with strong cornerstones"", Coghlan says. Ireland's difficulties, however, are about to become even more challenging, warns climatologist Prof John Sweeney. UN climate scientists last year indicated that to avoid warming of 1.5 degrees, a global emission reduction of about 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030 is required, reaching net zero around 2050. ""Recent work by Irish scientists based on equity and the remaining carbon budget suggest that Ireland will have used its fair share of the remaining global carbon budget within five years and will enter into 'carbon debt' to the rest of the world within the next five to 10 years."" The Paris Agreement targets coming into force on January 1st ratchets up things considerably, adds Sweeney, as it demands regular increasing of ambition. What's more, the new European Commission is set to push for reductions of ""at least 55 per cent by 2030"". All indications are this will be a central element of the EU's green new deal. Refused to sign In Sweeney's view, Ireland is not in that higher ambition zone though we purport to want to be a global leader in climate action. At COP24, the UN climate meeting in 2018, 27 countries resolved to step up ambition by 2020 - ""Ireland refused to sign"". More recently, eight member states wrote to the commission urging an increase in the EU's 2030 target from 40 to 55 per cent. ""The signatories did not include Ireland."" Ireland has indicated willingness to embrace greater ambition but has not specified a revised target. Sweeney says Irish foot-dragging is evident on many fronts; it has not distinguished itself as generous to the Green Climate Fund, which helps those affected by climate disruption. ""The five years since the Paris Agreement was reached in 2015 have largely been wasted and [have] not delivered on the intentions for increased efforts prior to 2020. This has been partly as a result of political regime changes in key large emitting countries."" The EU as a whole will achieve its 20 per cent reduction target for 2020. ""Ireland is currently projected to achieve 5-6 per cent reduction and has exceeded its annual binding limits since 2016. It is likely to be identified again as a climate laggard at COP25 ."" 1. Public awareness on need for urgent climate action is fired up by young climate activists. The radical message of Greta Thunberg out-guns environmental cynicism. 2.

In an address to COP25 by way of national statement, Mr Bruton said Ireland was enshrining a ""net-zero emissions"" target for 2050 in law and confirmed it was joining the Carbon Neutrality Coalition (CNC), a global alliance of countries intending to decarbonise and to lead others in the transition. Ireland over the past 12 months, in underpinning its ambitions, had put ""concrete policy instruments"" into the Government's climate action plan, he said. How this was achieved provided lessons relevant to others because it was built on the foundation of a citizens' assembly, which ""has given us leverage across our community"". A road map was in place with concrete actions and a governance structure embedded in law that would ensure accountability and require policymakers to achieve set goals. On what had been delivered, he cited an end to oil exploration; commitment to an increased carbon tax while ring-fencing resulting revenues for climate actions in communities; and a just transition mechanism to support those adversely affected. Existential threat Mr Bruton said his generation was at risk of passing on a world in worse condition, which placed huge responsibilities on COP25 . He said civilisation reached its most creative and collaborative level when faced with an existential threat. ""This is such a time,"" he added. Referring to a simultaneous protest by young climate activists in an adjoining venue, Mr Bruton said: ""We hear the call of the coming generation ringing in our ears from next door."" They were owed a debt of gratitude, he believed, for highlighting the real damage that climate disruption was causing, confirmed by hardening science. \"

It will be her first visit to the US since she launched her environmental drive a year ago. Ms Thunberg, who has inspired thousands of her peers in many parts of the world to press their elders to act on climate change, refuses to fly owing to the negative impact on the environment. German Boris Herrmann and the Monaco-based founder of the Malizia team Pierre Casiraghi will steer the boat, which is to carry a sail marked ""#Fridays for future"". The phrase stems from Ms Thunberg's decision to skip school on Fridays so she could push for action against climate change in front of the Swedish parliament. ""After months of research and considering different options for her journey, Greta will sail across the Atlantic in a zero-carbon racing boat called Malizia II, a foiling sailboat built in 2015, which is fitted with solar panels and underwater turbines to generate electricity on board the vessel,"" Mr Herrmann said on his website.

"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland19","Give Me a Crash Course In ... Climate talks","December 21, 2019 Saturday","The Irish Times","What climate talks were taking place in Madrid? The annual UN conference of the parties (COP) is a gathering of almost 200 states, all signatories to the 2015 Paris Agreement on limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees this century, and preferably 1.5 degrees, to avoid the worst effects of climate disruption. All countries that attend - high-polluting big economies, developing countries, and small island states of the South Pacific - are experiencing climate shocks of varying degrees. This is the only system for global action to counter the effects of an over-heating planet caused by human activity. Does it work? The gathering of more than 20,000 people, including negotiators, experts, lobbyists, NGOs, business and media, can be chaotic. Nevertheless, it often delivers results, though not urgently enough given the scale of the challenge now facing us. The heavyweight heads of state and environment or energy ministers usually arrive in the final days, to inject political pragmatism. Were delegates moved by growing climate awareness? Many millions across the globe have taken to the streets over the past year, demanding politicians take a more urgent approach. Young people have established an unstoppable movement inspired by the stark message of Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg. They were a notable presence at COP25 , but soon became disillusioned by the process. Meanwhile, a series of reports in advance of COP25 showed we are on course for a 3.2-degree rise, which would make vast tracts of the planet uninhabitable. Some 11 billion tonnes of Greenland ice melted in just one day this year - equivalent to 4 million Olympic size swimming pools - as many countries struggled to deal with extreme weather linked to climate disturbance. And did the meeting deliver? This year, there was high expectation of increased commitments: a deal on carbon trading to help reduce emissions and scale up of funds for vulnerable countries. But the weak final text, recognising the need for increased actions next year, emerged 40 hours after the deadline, and was a failure on all three fronts. Big emitters - Brazil, the US, Australia, India, China and Saudi Arabia - blocked what should have been a strong signal of intent going into a critical decade. This was supposed to be a progressive COP, with the Paris pact coming into force in January. Instead, efforts to halve global emissions by 2030, essential if the world is to become ""carbon-neutral"" by 2050, have stalled. Is there are any hope? It's hard to discern grounds for optimism right now. Key issues were unresolved, pushed on to COP26 in Glasgow, another year lost while global emissions continue to climb. With so many countries not keeping pledges to contain emissions, the Paris Agreement looks frayed at the edges. A further round of stricter pledges is due next year. Some of the biggest emitters questioned whether they would comply with this requirement. The US, which is about to leave the Paris Agreement, maintained an inglorious obstructionist role during COP25 , underlining the global leadership void. The EU, however, indicated it wants to take that lead. It announced a green new deal last week, putting climate policy on a par with economic policy. The EU is part of an ambitious coalition of 80 countries pursuing net-zero emissions by 2050. Ireland is part of that club but its credibility will only be restored if it hits its 2030 targets. China has indicated it wants to pursue a low-carbon path. It will attend a summit with the EU in Leipzig next September. Goodwill and strong commitments from the two on climate action would be the single biggest way to get the Paris process back on track.

"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland20","A failure on all fronts; UN climate talks","December 16, 2019 Monday","The Irish Times","There is a terrible empty feeling following the outcome of the UN climate talks in Madrid. It could - and should - have been different. National self-interest was allowed to prevail. The need for collective action in the best interests of Planet Earth had never been greater. The latest alarm bells from climate science rang loudly in the days before COP25 opened two weeks ago. The agenda was clear: a need for countries to declare bolder climate actions, to end abuses in the way big countries trade in carbon with the pretence of helping to cut global emissions, and to scale up funding for developing countries already experiencing climate shocks. This was to bolster the Paris Agreement as it goes into its critical implementation phase next year and to reinforce its environmental integrity. Joint hosts Chile and Spain failed on all three fronts. Moreover, the outcome underlines a gaping disconnect between politicians and people across the world demanding much more urgency in the response to an accelerating climate crisis. It was a time when consensus and solidarity were desperately needed. Many political leaders deserve to pay a heavy price for this grossly inadequate response, not least those big carbon-emitting countries such as Brazil, the US, and Australia. Their leaders deserve to be ostracised as they continue to pedal climate denialism and to facilitate fossil fuel expansion - though many climate activists, regions, businesses and citizens in their countries should be supported in their decarbonisation efforts. The announcement last week of the EU's green new deal, with a carbon-neutral Europe as its overarching objective, provided a welcome fillip to the talks as they entered their final phase. Some 120 countries, including Ireland, confirmed they would be matching the EU's climate ambition for 2030 in cutting greenhouse gas emissions and seeking carbon neutrality by 2050. Europe is set to stake its economic future on an environmental clean-up that will overhaul the way the world's biggest single market polices businesses and manages trade relations - with decarbonisation and a just transition moving to the heart of economic policy. Globally, it shows the kind of leadership that has been lacking, though China looks to row in with such efforts and address its vast emissions. Such a course is vital to have any chance of keeping global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees. But COP25 failed to match such ambition. During its closing segment Norway's youth delegate Sofie Nordvik was allowed address negotiators and summed up best the dereliction of environmental duty: ""We lack the ambition needed to avoid this climate emergency. Our leaders need to step up. The world would have looked very different if young people were in charge today."" \"

Thunberg launched a grassroots campaign when she was 15 by skipping school every Friday to demonstrate outside the Swedish parliament, pushing for her government to meet its ambitious goals to curb carbon emissions. ""In the 16 months since her protests began, she has addressed heads of state at the UN, met the Pope, sparred with the president of the United States and inspired four million people to join the global climate strike,"" the magazine said. She is the youngest individual to have won the accolade. ""Margaret Atwood compared her to Joan of Arc. After noticing a hundredfold increase in its usage, Collins Dictionary named Thunberg's pioneering idea, climate strike, word of the year,"" 'Time' added.

Thunberg, who turns 17 next month, was in Madrid yesterday, and addressed negotiators at the UN's COP25 Thunberg was blunt in her assessment of politicians' efforts, telling the Madrid audience: ""It seems to have turned into some kind of opportunity for countries to negotiate loopholes and to avoid raising their ambition. ""I'm sure that if people heard what was going on and what was said during these meetings, they would be outraged."" Former US vice-president Al Gore, a long-time environmentalist, said the magazine made a ""brilliant choice"" in choosing the reluctant celebrity. Thunberg, who said her Asperger's syndrome can be an advantage in her campaigning, sailed across the Atlantic to get to the Madrid event in order to avoid travelling by air. Thunberg's uncompromising stance has brought her into confrontation with some of the world's most powerful people. A video of her giving Donald Trump what media described as a ""death stare"" at a UN climate summit in New York in September went viral. During a speech at around the same time, Thunberg bristled with anger, saying: ""I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean, yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you? ""You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words."" \"

Speaking at a FridaysForFuture press briefing at COP25 , the teenager from Skibbereen, Co Cork, said negotiators ""are not putting value on our lives, our countries, our futures"". Instead, big wealthy countries, responsible for by far the most carbon emissions, were attempting to ensure they continue to live comfortable lives while pursuing ""a system of carbon trading to make them look good"". Ordinary people attending the COP were incredibly confused and alienated from the process because ""it's all article 6.4, whatever it is. It's incredibly jarring; the amount of jargon thrown around in here,"" added the teenager who has been protesting outside Cork City Hall on Fridays for almost a year. ""For too long, because we have not been able to understand what has been going on, because we have been kept out, we have allowed ourselves to be passive here, [and] in places like my country, because we have assumed action was happening and that we just didn't understand what £rticle 6.whatever' was."" Article 6 of the Paris Agreement is about trading carbon, she noted. ""Essentially, I offset some of my carbon so that you can burn more. Effectively, the countries that are here, despite what they're talking about, despite their wonderful speeches - truly wonderful speeches - still thinking that our past, present and future is something that can be bought and sold. And I don't think we're going to take that.""

"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland24","Threat to marine life as oxygen levels drop; Climate talks hear humanity is destroying planetary support system","December 9, 2019 Monday","The Irish Times","Oxygen in the world's oceans is depleting at an unprecedented rate, leaving species gasping for breath and devastating marine habitats, a report issued at the annual UN climate talks in Madrid has warned. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (ICUN) study by 67 scientists from 17 countries found oxygen levels in oceans fell by about 2 per cent between 1960 and 2010. The deoxygenation is largely attributed to climate disruption, although other human activities are contributing to the problem, notably nutrient run-off, when too many nutrients from fertilisers used on farms and lawns wash into waterways. Large fish species are at particular risk, the study warns, with many vital ecosystems in danger of collapse. Dead zones - where oxygen is effectively absent - have quadrupled in the past half-century, and there are also at least 700 areas where oxygen is at dangerously low levels. ICUN acting director general Grethel Aguilar said the health of oceans should be a key consideration for the talks. ""As the warming ocean loses oxygen, the delicate balance of marine life is thrown into disarray. The potentially dire effects on fisheries and vulnerable coastal communities mean that the decisions made at the conference are even more crucial."" Rising tide of plastics The problem is being compounded because the world's oceans are already being overfished, and assailed by a rising tide of plastics, as well as other pollutants. ""A healthy ocean with abundant wildlife is capable of slowing the rate of climate breakdown substantially,"" said Dr Monica Verbeek, director of Seas at Risk. ""Ending overfishing is a quick, deliverable action which will restore fish populations, create more resilient ocean ecosystems, decrease CO2 pollution and increase carbon capture, and deliver more profitable fisheries and thriving coastal communities."" UN special envoy for the oceans Peter Thomson, speaking during Oceans Action Day on Saturday, said the latest evidence supported the view of UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres that ""humanity is knowingly destroying the planetary support system"". Critical year A series of major international gatherings on oceans, biodiversity loss and COP26 would make 2020 the critical year to ""get it right for the next decade"" in reversing declines. ""If we get that wrong, we might as well put up the surrender flag,"" he added. The COP25 Though many details were agreed last year at COP24, fractious negotiations failed to satisfy some countries, especially Brazil, on how far carbon credits for forestry would be permitted as offsets for greenhouse gas emissions. This has continued to provide an obstacle to progress over the first week of COP25 , according to Irish climatologist Prof John Sweeney. Countries such as Brazil, India and China want to be able to carry over a huge number of unused credits gained in former years. ""This would allow them continued large scale increases emissions and severely compromise achievement of the Paris objective of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels . . . there is a real risk that 'creative accounting' will allow double counting of emission reductions to enable a compromise of sorts to be achieved,"" he told The Irish Times. The organisers of a protest last Friday claimed 500,000 people marched through Madrid to demand more urgency to address global warming in what was the largest climate rally ever staged in Europe ""The change we need is not going to come from people in power,"" climate activist Greta Thunberg told the crowds.

The Swedish teenager, who arrived at COP25 in Madrid after crossing the Atlantic by catamaran, said she was availing of ""some media attention"" to give a voice to people whose stories needed to be listened to, including those from Africa and places where climate activism is actively suppressed. She stayed largely silent during her first official appearance at the summit to allow a young Native American, a Chilean, a Pacific islander, a Russian and a Filipino to speak. ""Their rights are being violated across the world, and they are also among the ones being hit the most and the quickest by the climate and environmental emergency,"" she said. Their testimonies indicated the emergency was not an issue for today's children when they grow up, Ms Thunberg said. ""People are suffering and dying from it today."" Failed Rose Whipple of the Santee Dakota, native to Minnesota in the US, said: ""The climate crisis is a spiritual crisis for our entire world. Our solutions must weave science and spirituality and traditional ecological knowledge with technology."" She described the decline of the Mississippi, a ""sacred river that fed people for thousands of years"", and her people's failed attempt to halt a Limetree oil pipeline in the courts. She said ""the system continues to value corporate profit over indigenous lives"". ""While countries congratulate each other for their weak commitments, the world is literally burning out,"" said Chilean activist Angela Valenzuela. She said the people of Chile were not protesting about 30 pesos but 30 years of governments ""that failed to protect us and fuelled the climate crisis for the benefit of a few"". She said it was unacceptable that the Chilean government came to COP25 to clean up its reputation when human rights violations were being committed every day. The low-lying Marshall Islands was the first nation to comply with a requirement in the Paris Agreement to scale-up its planned emissions reductions in 2018 - a move bigger emitters are under pressure to follow by next year. Carlon Zackhras, representing the atoll nation, said rising sea levels threatened his home, which is only two metres above the waterline. ""We are having to deal with issues we did not create."" He said two weeks ago the island had its latest inundation, while infectious diseases such as dengue fever and measles were being made worse by global warming. ""Migration is the only plan B."" Arshak Makichyan from Russia said a year ago he knew nothing about the climate crisis. When he heard Thunberg say ""the world is on fire"" he believed it was a metaphor. Seeing fires in the Amazon and Congo last summer proved otherwise. He has been arrested for protesting in solidarity with the global Fridays For Future movement and detained for a few days but that did not bother him. It was an action he expected to be repeated. He said people stood up against Adolf Hitler ""who almost invaded the world"". ""People stopped him for their children's sake,"" he said, suggesting a similar global effort was now needed to address the climate crisis. Oceans The Madrid meeting was supposed to be a ""blue cop"" to underline the importance of oceans, but negotiating nations had not brought the issue centre stage, said Kisha Erah Muana from the Philippines. As a consequence the colourful coral and rich marine life ""is a playground I once knew"" that no longer existed. At the conclusion of the briefing, Ms Thunberg said indigenous people had lived in balance with nature for hundreds of years, and had valuable knowledge that needed to be taken on board ""in this crucial time of crisis"". \"

"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland29","IRELAND AMONG WORST-PERFORMING EUROPEAN COUNTRIES FOR CLIMATE ACTION - REPORT","December 10, 2019 Tuesday 3:07 PM BST","Regional Press Releases: Ireland","Ireland ranked among the worst-performing European countries for climate action, according a global report. The 2020 Climate Change Performance Index, launched on Tuesday at the UN Climate Conference ( COP25 ) in Madrid, shows that although Ireland has slightly improved its position since last year, it still ranks among some of the worst-performing countries in Europe. In this year's index, using data from 2017, Ireland ranked 41st out of 57 countries worldwide, moving up from the group of ``very low'' to ``low'' performers. In greenhouse gas emissions, Ireland ranked third from bottom for EU countries. The ranking is an improvement on last year, moving up by seven places, after Ireland was ranked the worst EU performer. The report reads: ``Ireland's GHG (greenhouse gas) per capita emissions remain at a relatively high level, and significant challenges lie ahead in closing Ireland's emissions gap, meeting the (current) 2030 target and aligning Ireland's emissions trajectory with a net zero goal for 2050. ``Therefore, the country still ranks among the bottom ten performers in this indicator.'' The report also criticises ``the significant lack of progress in decarbonising key parts of the economy, mainly in agriculture, road transport and the residential sector''. It said: ``The Government must go much further in implementing policies across all sectors that drive sustained emissions reductions over the next decade.'' On a positive note for the Government, the index report welcomed Ireland's new proposals set out in the 2019 Climate Action Plan, including putting the 2050 target into law and introducing legally binding five-year carbon budgets. Campaigners have long criticised Environment Minister Richard Bruton's policies on the climate emergency, which they say do not go far enough to tackle the issues. Catherine Devitt, head of policy at the Stop Climate Chaos Coalition, said: ``Ireland's polluting emissions remain on an upward trend, the Government has yet to join other member states in calling for the EU to urgently raise its ambition in line with the Paris Agreement, and the scale of 2% emissions cuts per year presented in the Government's action plan is wholly inadequate. ``The science and the mounting evidence clearly demonstrates that we need far-reaching transformation across all aspects of society. ``If the Government is serious about wanting to improve its reputation on climate change and to do its fair share of the global effort, there needs to be a frontloading of concrete action across all sectors to ensure the scale of reductions needed can be delivered.'' The publication of the CCPI report comes as Mr Bruton is expected to participate in the high level segment on December 10 and 11 at COP25 , where heads of state and government will make national statements on increasing their targets. ``The report shows that the country is now in the ignominious position of being worst on climate action in western Europe and still among the top 20 worst performers globally,'' she said. ``It is shameful and hugely damaging to our international reputation that this expert analysis again shows up Ireland's response as being completely inadequate to the climate crisis. ``It is noted in the report that major challenges lie ahead in closing Ireland's emissions gap, meeting our 2030 target and aligning emissions with a 2050 net zero goal.'' A spokesperson for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment said the report does not take into account its new policy arrangements for climate, adding: ``This report, prepared by a German climate NGO, based on 2017 data and interviews from other NGOs, highlights the urgency of the work the Government are doing with the Climate Action Plan. ``The Climate Action Plan, launched earlier this year, will ensure Ireland will reach our 2030 targets and will put us on the right trajectory to meet net zero emissions by 2050. ``The plan have actions across all sectors of society and will have timelines with clear lines of responsibility.'' end \"

This agricultural start-up is docked in a harbour and houses 32 cows (they are not always on water and regularly visit a nearby pasture via ramp). The cows are milked and fed by various robots while others are employed as Roombas, of a sort, but for cow poop. All of this is controlled through an app by employees of founder Minke van Wingerden. All of the milk is processed on board and sold to local residents. Meanwhile, most of the water needed by the cows is collected via the structure's roof when it rains, and power comes from nearby floating solar panels. Even the cows' urine is put to good use and recycled as fertiliser. The urban aspect of sustainability relates to the cows' food sources: grass clippings, potato peels and brewer's grains are converted into an edible protein. Floating Farm is also planning more builds for both chicken farming and vegetables. The idea is to provide self-sufficient and sustainable food sources as water levels rise due to climate change. It's far from a gimmick: if the urgency of climate action isn't realised at COP25 , this will likely be where much of our food comes from in the future.

Speaking to journalists after a meeting with Chilean president Sebastian Pinera in Brasilia, Mr Bolsonaro said a meeting with regional neighbours except Venezuela to discuss a common policy in defence of the Amazon will be held on September 6th in the Colombian city of Leticia. In a statement released by Chile, the two leaders said environmental challenges must be met while respecting ""national sovereignty"", and that each country should have control over the ""rational and sustainable use of their natural resources, in line with their environmental obligations and needs of their citizens, including indigenous peoples"". It also highlighted as ""valuable and important"" the use of bilateral co-operation and international financial support to deal with the crisis.

Speaking in the European Parliament in Strasbourg this evening, he said the commission believes in a Green Deal for Europe. He said the COP25 summit in Madrid did not deliver what it was supposed to on carbon markets and other issues. Mr Timmermans said Europe will build on a global consensus to increase climate ambitions worldwide. The UN Climate Summit ended on Sunday with just a modest agreement on the key question of increasing the global response to curbing carbon. The final agreement highlighted the ''urgent need'' to cut greenhouse gases in line with the goals of the landmark 2015 Paris climate change Agreement. However, divisions over other issues including carbon markets - were delayed until COP26 in Glasgow in Scotland next year. Officials from almost 200 countries had extended their stay in Madrid as they struggled to resolve outstanding issues under the 2015 Paris Agreement.. Mr Timmermans told the Parliament that by COP26 long term strategies need to be submitted in line with the Paris Agreement objectives. He also said the most vulnerable must be helped in their climate efforts so they have the capacity to deal with the changes. Mr Timmermans said Europe remains committed to boosting climate finance and support developing countries. He said the Commission and the Parliament know that young people want a concrete climate plan. He said the Green Deal was a start for Europe to reinvent itself and he said it was a once in a lifetime opportunity to develop a greener and a cleaner future. \"

Speaking to journalists after the first meeting of the new commission, Ms Von der Leyen tore into EU budget 2021-27 proposals from the Finnish EU presidency, which leaders will discuss, but are unlikely to agree, at the summit in Brussels next week. The Finnish ""negotiating box"",\~which puts its suggested, tentative figures on the budget compromise being discussed by member states, cuts commission overall spending proposals by up to EUR 50 billion in a bid to placate the big contributor countries. The difficult talks on the next five-year budget are expected to run well into next year, with commission officials warning that failure to agree - a unanimous vote is required - could jeopardise funding to programmes due to start in 2021. \~ ""The Finnish proposal is not enough,"" she said. ""I am concerned at the severe cuts in this proposal compared to the commission proposal."" If the leaders want to see the strategic programmes already agreed by member states - ""If we do want to do all of this, we have to look each other in the eyes and discuss how it will be done"". She also urged leaders to take seriously proposals only touched on in passing in the ""box"" for new EU Europe-wide taxes, known as ""own resources"", not popular with many member states, specifically taxes on single-use plastics and emissions trading schemes. Ms Von der Leyen also pledged to bring forward her commission's much- vaunted climate change Green Deal package as soon as next week, insisting that from the start of this week's COP25 climate summit in Madrid, the EU was already showing that it was the global front-runner on the issue. She quoted UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres at the conference warning that ""it is almost too late"". Ms Von der Leyen, who is heading this week on her first foreign trip to Addis Ababa, said that she wanted to emphasise her and the commission's commitment to Africa by a visit to the headquarters of the African Union. \"
"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland35","Increase in number of Dead Zones a cause for concern","January 11, 2020","Sligo Champion","Just before Christmas, media reports from the COP25 climate conference in Madrid informed us that marine life is being left literally gasping for breath as oxygen levels in the world's oceans and seas are being depleted and dead zones are becoming more common. So, what is a dead zone? Here's the science bit. Oxygen gas in the air dissolves in water much in the same way that sugar dissolves in tea. There is about 8-11 milligramme of dissolved oxygen gas in each litre of seawater (mg/l). All marine life depends on the life-giving gas so if the level of oxygen drops life forms are left literally gasping for breath. Fish become stressed but can tolerate oxygen levels as low as 3-5mg/l. If the concentration of oxygen drops below 2mg/l, the area is said to be hypoxic, popularly known as a 'dead zone'. Fish can move so they swim away from the area. Life forms like shellfish attached to the seafloor don't have the option to move away so they die throwing the delicate balance of life into disarray. At least 700 dead zones are now known worldwide with examples of them arguably present in some estuaries around the coasts of Ireland. The number of dead zones has quadrupled in the past half-century and continues to grow at an accelerating rate. The two main factors causing dead zones to form are climate change and nutrient run-off both from fertilisers used by farmers on land and from all of us contributing to wastewater treatment plants and septic tanks. The problem of oxygen depletion is compounded by a litany of other woes suffered by the world's oceans and seas: they are being over-fished, are becoming warmer and more acid, are losing their ability to both hold oxygen and to capture carbon dioxide gas, are being polluted by plastic rubbish and are being poisoned by an array of pollutants as never before experienced. The bottom line is that we are on the slippery slope of knowingly destroying the planet's life-support systems while lacking the sense of urgency needed to take action to try to reverse the trend. Dead zones range from ones with relatively mild issues to ones with acute problems. The EU Water Framework Directive sets out targets to be achieved by 2027. The targets are doable if the political will is there at both central government and local authority level to address the issues in a meaningful way. \"

They voted by 461 to 157 for the 27 nominees of the member states - leaving the UK seat still vacant in the absence of a nominee from London, and allowing the new commission to assume its functions on December 1st, only a month late. The bruising parliamentary ratification process saw three commissioners - from France, Romania and Hungary - initially rejected by MEPs and their replacements grilled by committees last week to their general satisfaction. The Green group, however, abstained on the vote yesterday citing concerns about the ability of the new commission to take forward a genuine and radical climate policy while unwilling to reform both agriculture and trade policy. Some sceptical MEPs wondered whether their abstention had more to do with the failure of EU leaders to include any Green nominee among their commission nominees. In the debate welcoming the commission nominations, Irish MEP Sean Kelly (EPP) took note of the Green slight to the new commission team, suggesting the new president should rename her flagship ""European Green Deal"" as the ""enhanced climate change"" programme. ""No one group has a monopoly on climate change concern,"" he said. Introducing her team to the parliament, Ms Von der Leyen placed particular emphasis on the issue as her top priority, promising that the EU ""will mainstream climate financing throughout its budget, but also throughout capital markets and the entire investment chain"".

And Phil Hogan [the new trade commissioner] will ensure that our future trade agreements will include a chapter on sustainable development."" The challenge of persuading member states to commit to carbon neutrality by the ambitious but necessary date of 2030 will be a central task of the new commission. Speaking to journalists following the vote, Ms Von der Leyen said she saw it as a ""vote of confidence"" by a broad majority of MEPs for an ""agenda of change"" on issues like climate, digitalisation and migration. \"
"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland37","Bruton says climate legislation will go before Cabinet by Christmas","December 13, 2019 Friday","The Irish Times","Legislation to ensure Ireland pursues more ambitious climate actions, including five-yearly carbon budgets setting emissions limits, is to go before Cabinet by Christmas, the Minister for Climate Action, Richard Bruton, has confirmed. The heads of the Climate Change (Amendment) Act were ready to be considered by the Government, with a view to undergoing scrutiny in the Oireachtas early next year. It will enshrine revised 2030 targets and a commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Under carbon budgeting elements, key sectors such as transport and agriculture will have carbon limits in terms of how much carbon they can emit on a five-yearly basis. Mr Bruton said he was heartened by the degree of consensus across the political system around climate and even around carbon pricing. The reality, however, was there were ""real hard policy issues involved"" that will be difficult to manage, as indicated by the move to exit from peat extraction and its use in power generation. Community pot The new renewable electricity support scheme was specifically designed to address such issues, he said, notably its community pot for supporting projects and provisions for community gain. It was possible to get the legislation through before next year's general election. The Bill would have to undergo pre-legislative scrutiny at committee stage which would take time, but ""there is a high level of desire to deliver this in the Oireachtas"", Mr Bruton felt. The strengthened climate legislation would also require a wider process to explain to citizens ""why we there should be carbon budgets, when we set them what they mean - what they mean for different sectors and the way they plan. Getting that information out there is really important."" He admitted such was the scale of what was envisaged in decarbonising Ireland, the capacity and expertise to deliver that was not yet fully developed. Mr Bruton said there was a discernible difference at COP25 compared to previous talks, as the concerns of young people were much more to the fore and this pressure was being felt in negotiating rooms, especially among EU colleagues. Momentum had been built since the recent UN climate summit in New York, Mr Bruton believed. ""They are articulating the sense of anger and frustration"" in their determination to find solutions and contribute, he added. \"
"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland38","Climate deal entails legal commitments; The EU wants its commitment to climate diplomacy to be known","December 13, 2019 Friday","The Irish Times","As ""commitments"" go it might appear somewhat half-hearted. ""The European Council endorses the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050,"" is how the EU summit's expected ""conclusions"" yesterday express the support by leaders for the commission's Green New Deal. The deal was close and likely, but not quite there as we go to press. But a real commitment it is, with teeth and serious purpose, with real legal obligations and heavy financial commitment coming down the line, as the EU was telling the participants at the Cop25 climate summit. Europe is determined as Council President Charles Michel echoed yesterday morning to provide the ""leadership"" on a world scale on the issue. The slightly ambivalent language, a product of the constraints of unanimity voting, was the result of a necessary compromise with those member states -Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary - who were complaining that their particular dependence on fossil fuels needed to be recognised with special financial assistance. Hence also the support in principle for the commission's proposed EUR 100 billion Just Transition Mechanism, although approval of the actual cash would have to wait on the outcome of the 2021-27 budget (MFF) talks. Just enough to placate the Poles. Critically, however, the leaders gave an enthusiastic green light to the commission to continue to set out their ambitious programme of action internally and to step up its climate diplomacy internationally. There is an explicit acknowledgment of the scale of likely investment challenges with the leaders welcoming a commitment by the European Investment Bank, the EU's huge bank, to one trillion euros of investment in climate and environmental diplomacy. Nothing is sacred, they said, inviting the commission to examine ""an adjustment of the existing rules , including on state aid and public procurement"". Backed idea And they backed the idea proposed first by the French of border customs duties on goods produced using too much carbon. The EU will police not only its own emissions but use trade and other tools to toughen up international standards and compliance with the Paris agreement. ""The climate objective needs to be achieved in a way that preserves the EU's competitiveness including by developing effective measures to tackle carbon leakage in a WTO-compatible way,"" the conclusions say. \"
"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland39","Nations deadlocked at UN climate talks in Madrid","December 14, 2019 Saturday","The Irish Times","As world leaders remained deadlocked at the UN climate talks in Madrid, pressure from countries seeking a deal built throughout yesterday - with blame being heaped on Brazil, Australia and the US. Countries pushing for ""higher ambition"" included the EU, and small island states already badly affected by climate disruption, who were insisting on a deal matching the integrity of the landmark Paris Agreement. The French economist Laurence Tubiana, head of the European Climate Foundation, who played a central role in getting the agreement across the line, outlined at a press briefing what she believed was realisable in the coming hours at COP25 as the talks among almost 200 countries looked set to run into today. A lot of countries were pushing for enhanced ambition for next year, she said, reflecting ""dissonance on the street"" demanding more urgency, and changes in the real economy already happening. That made it unlike other COPs, she said, as countries in negotiating rooms were considering how ""this process"" could endorse what was going on in the outside world. The potential elements for a strong final decision were agreement that all countries must enhance their climate ambitions for next year; ""no cheating on the carbon market"" and protection of the most vulnerable through ""loss and damage"" measures. By late afternoon, there were some indications of better progress on article 6 in the agreement on carbon market rules, and more positive indications on supports from wealthy countries under loss and damage. Brazil, Australia and the US, however, were identified as the persistent blockers of progress. There had been a lack of political leadership, Ms Tubiana said, but Europe's green new deal endorsing net-zero emissions by 2050 was ""the best news this week"", as it meant the EU was playing a leading role again. She also welcomed prime minister Boris Johnson confirming net-zero by 2050 for Britain in his first speech after winning the UK election. Governments would face a tough time in implementing strong climate policies and needed to give capacity for citizens to voice their concerns. The shift in banking, in not supporting coal investments, was already in train, while the European Investment Bank would no longer finance oil and gas. With renewables becoming so cheap she said there was no excuse for countries not to commit to net-zero. When asked what role China was playing in negotiations, Ms Lubiana said ""they are quiet; they are contributing"". \"

They say Ireland's contribution to an international fund would need to increase six-fold before we came close to making amends for the damage caused. In a report to be published today, Tr\'f3caire and Christian Aid Ireland argue that Ireland's (EURO)80m annual donation needs to increase to (EURO)475m. They also say the money should be additional funding and not sums taken from general overseas aid and recategorised as climate finance. Our overseas aid budget for 2020 is (EURO)837m. The report is published as governments begin gathering in Madrid today for the UN climate summit COP25 , which runs until Friday week. Climate finance will form a major part of the discussion, with agencies such as Trocaire and Christian Aid Ireland pointing to various studies that show the $100bn ((EURO)91bn) a year fund established in 2010 to help poor countries protect against climate change and deal with the consequences needs to increase to at least $750bn ((EURO)680bn). Cliona Sharkey of Tr\'f3caire said poorer nations were least responsible for the climate crisis and should not have to pick up the bill for the damage on their own. The G20 - the world's wealthiest countries - is responsible for 78pc of global carbon emissions yet it is estimated that developing countries face 75pc of the cost. Ireland is responsible for 0.26pc of global emissions. Jenny Higgins of Christian Aid Ireland said: ""Unless Ireland and other developed countries step up and fairly contribute financially, developing countries will never be able to afford to deal with the very real consequences of climate change, nor reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions levels."" Extreme weather linked to climate change has devastated many poor countries in ways wealthy countries can better withstand. Typhoon Haiyan that hit the Philippines in 2015 was the strongest on record and caused (EURO)10bn of damage. The report is critical of the way wealthy nations make climate finance available - too often through loans that create the risk of spiralling debt, or through overly restrictive insurance packages. Malawi, one of the world's poorest countries, suffered alternating drought and flood but when it tried to claim on the African Risk Capacity insurance fund for a particular episode, the payout covered less than half the cost. The report praises Ireland for avoiding loan mechanisms in its own aid packages but says the country must do more to influence others. ""Ireland has been invisible on the issue of loss and damage, one of the most pressing issues for the most vulnerable countries,"" it said. \"

They can now start work from Sunday. For MEPs, the vote was the successful culmination of a tussle between EU institutions to reinforce MEPs' prerogative to have the last say on the appointments. They scuppered three of VDL's nominees and then, having made their point, nodded through three scarcely less controversial subs. Still, the result is a commission that represents a remarkable balance in key senior vice-presidencies between the main pro-European parties - the Greens, to their chagrin, excepted - and geographically. And it has a higher proportion of women than any previous commission. VDL bent over backwards to accommodate MEPs, even renaming some posts to reflect sensitivities; the controversial migration job changed from ""defending"" the European way of life to ""promoting"" it. That puts political capital in the bank, she will hope, and she will need every bit of support in some of the battles ahead. Not least on the fraught budget (MFF) talks, which need to be completed by next summer if 2021-27 programmes are to begin on time. MEPs are the budget authority, as parliament president David Sassoli pointedly reminded VDL on Wednesday, and they are broadly on the same page as the commission in terms of ambition for the MFF. Member states, which come up with the cash, are not merely on a different page at the moment, but reading from a different book. Central to maintaining the alliance with parliament will be VDL's emphasis on climate change as her top priority and on the ""European Green Deal"" package due within weeks. Crucial to making the case to member states to dig deeper is the commission's insistence that the imperative of carbon neutrality can only be met if leaders agree substantially to raise spending and to back her mainstreaming of climate measures through the budget, from agriculture, to research, to investment and trade. VDL heads off to speak to the global climate summit ( COP25 ) in Madrid on Monday, her first task on her first day. For member-state leaders, the new commission represents the turning of a page in the EU's history. They hope the new executive will be able to redirect its attention and energies from Brexit to issues such as climate change, migration and the digital economy. ""Get Brexit done"" is muttered in the corridors of continental capitals as much as it is in the UK, but no-one doubts that even if Boris Johnson wins re-election and gets a majority for his withdrawal agreement, the commission faces a Herculean task in first agreeing a mandate between the 27 and then launching at least eight strands of discussions with the UK on their future relationship. \"

Speaking during the opening day of COP25 in Madrid yesterday, Stop Climate Chaos coordinator Ois\'edn Coghlan said UN secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres had laid down a clear challenge to world leaders; ""we need to cut global emissions by 7 per cent a year to prevent catastrophic climate change"". ""The 7 per cent a year emissions cuts urged by the UN secretary general contrast with the wholly-inadequate 2 per cent a year proposed in [Minister for Climate Action ]Richard Bruton's new action plan,"" he added. ""Leo Varadkar is trying to shake off Ireland's climate laggard status as his Government canvasses for votes to be elected to the UN Security Council next year. Today's stark words from Ant\'f3nio Guterres show Leo has much more to do to qualify as a climate leader."" Mr Coghlan, whose organisation is a coalition of civil society groups campaigning on climate change, was speaking at an event on the legislative response to climate change. Ireland is of interest to the organisers ""because it has a weak climate law at the moment but there is now cross-party support to enact a new, stronger one as soon as possible"", he said at a briefing. The next big test for Mr Varadkar's climate credibility was the new draft Climate Change (Amendment) Act promised for before Christmas. In his opening address Mr Guterres said by the end of the coming decade ""we will be on one of two paths, one of which is sleepwalking past the point of no return"". ""Do we want to be remembered as the generation that buried its head in the sand and fiddled as the planet burned?"" In spite of the US, under President Donald Trump, pulling out of the 2015 Paris Agreement, a high-powered delegation from the US Congress was present ""to recognise the US role in saving the planet for future generations"", US House speaker Nancy Pelosi said. She said ""this is a mission and we are still in it"". She said it was ""a public health issue - clean air, clean water - for everyone including the most vulnerable . . . who pay the biggest price"". It was also an economic issue, which if addressed could generate green jobs and uplift for everybody. If unaddressed, it would continue to be an existential threat, and undermine national security, she said. European Council president Charles Michel said implementation of climate actions needed to be scaled up. ""We need to dramatically change how we do things and revolutionise our approach. We have had the industrial revolution, the technological revolution; now it is time for the 'green revolution'."" \"
"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland43","Charities urge State funding for projects tackling climate change","December 2, 2019 Monday","The Irish Times","Ireland must increase its funding of projects tackling climate change by nearly six times the current amount to fairly contribute to efforts to prevent catastrophic global warming, it has been claimed. In a report published today, aid agencies Christian Aid Ireland and Tr\'f3caire conclude Ireland's total annual climate finance contributions need to increase to nearly EUR 475 million a year from EUR 80 million contributed in 2018. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, wealthy countries agreed to generate a total of $100 billion (EUR 91 billion) a year for developing countries to tackle climate disruption. The funding is intended for those countries already experiencing the worst effects of global heating, for adaptation measures and to reduce their carbon emissions. The report was issued to coincide with the first day of COP25 , the annual high-level UN climate conference in Madrid, where leaders from more than 190 countries - excluding the US - are set to sign-off on full implementation of the agreement from January 1st. The report calls for any increase in climate financing to come from newly available money rather than taken from existing Irish aid budgets and should sit alongside a commitment to contribute 0.7 per cent of gross national income (GNI) towards tackling global poverty. In 2020, Ireland's aid budget is set to be EUR 837million, the equivalent of 0.41 per cent of GNI. Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy advisor Jenny Higgins said: ""Unless Ireland and other developed countries step up and fairly contribute financially, developing countries will never be able to afford to deal with the very real consequences of climate change nor reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions levels."" She welcomed the commitment in the budget to doubling Ireland's contributions to the Green Climate Fund to EUR 16 million. ""However it pales in comparison to what other similar-sized European countries have pledged to give,"" she said. Extreme weather The report calls for more funds to be earmarked towards covering the costs of damage and destruction already caused by extreme weather. Despite its poor record on emissions reduction and inadequate contribution to climate funding, the report says Ireland has ""a commendable focus on least developed countries, adaptation and gender in the context of climate action"". Developing nations are predicted to face 75 per cent of the cost of the climate crisis; since 2000 their citizens have died at a rate seven times higher than in richer nations. While the poorest half of the world's population is responsible for only 10 per cent of carbon emissions, the richest 10 countries are responsible for 50 per cent of carbon emissions. Ireland has the third highest level of carbon emissions per person in the EU and in 2018 was ranked the worst performing country in Europe for action on climate change. The average Irish person generates as much carbon dioxide as 303 Burundians. \"

The deal includes a 50-55 per cent emissions reduction target for 2030, a very demanding target for Ireland. It is expected that EU leaders at today's summit will endorse the 2050 target and agree to establish a just transition mechanism of EUR 100 billion of public and private money to help the transition of economies like Poland, which are most heavily dependent on carbon. The deal was unveiled by EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen who spoke to the press of it as hugely ""ambitious"" and a ""European man on the moon moment"". ""The goal is to reconcile our economy with our planet . . . to make it work for all our people,"" she said. The old growth model based on fossil fuels and pollution is out of date, she said, insisting that Europe could be the frontrunner of change. Annual investment The challenge, the commission said, was the need to find EUR 260 billion in additional annual investment from the state and private sectors, the equivalent of 1.2 per cent of EU GDP in 2018. Ms Van der Leyen presented the package to MEPs following its approval by the commission. Tomorrow she will outline it to EU leaders at their summit, while vice-president Frans Timmermans will do likewise at the COP25 summit in Madrid. Among the measures proposed are a climate law committing the union to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and to boost the bloc's 2030 climate targets; a carbon border tax; up to EUR 100 billion to finance the transition; as well as sectoral initiatives involving legislative measures and action plans spanning agriculture, transport, energy, chemicals, construction and more. Flagship policy The commission's flagship policy, which it sees as defining its and the union's strategic direction for the next seven years, mainstreams climate issues throughout its operations and programmes. In trade, for example, it will require new international agreements to be conditional on observance of the Paris climate emission commitments of partners. And it will propose a carbon border tax, an import tariff charged onto the difference between the EU carbon price and that in the exporting country. Commitments to massively increase investment in the green economy will depend crucially, however, on the currently stalled EU budget (multi-annual financial framework) talks which the leaders will also address today. The commission and the leaders will also be asked to examine whether the spending commitments proposed conform with EU state aid rules and the strict spending disciplines of the growth and stability pact. If not, whether these could be amended specifically to allow climate measures, is a prospect that fills the EU's more fiscally conservative states with horror. \"

It comes one month later than planned, but with promises of a more united Europe ready to face major challenges, especially fighting climate change. The new EU Commission president is Germany's Ursula von der Leyen who, like some of her predecessors, was a compromise candidate and little known before her appointment. But her success in this crucial job will determine the fate of many ordinary citizens across the 28 member states, not least in Ireland North and south. Ms Von der Leyen takes the reins just as the EU is faced with a mountain of difficulties. Chief of these is the EU-UK Brexit divorce, but there are also rising trade tensions with superpowers China and the United States of America. At a short ceremony, Ms Von der Leyen said all of the new EU leadership faced great responsibility on behalf of 500 million citizens. The attendees included new European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde. Ms Von der Leyen has replaced EU veteran Jean-Claude Juncker as president, who will be a hard act to follow. The former Luxembourg prime minister was a firm friend of Ireland through all the Brexit woes and deserves this nation's gratitude. Ireland's EU Commissioner Phil Hogan will have a crucial role in the new Brussels executive. He moves from agriculture, which controls almost 40pc of the EU budget, to the pivotal role of trade commissioner. In that new job, Mr Hogan will lead negotiations framing an EU-UK relationship after Brexit becomes a reality. As EU trade commissioner he must promote the EU's best interests - but it is good that such a role falls to somebody who understands where Irish interests lie. The new EU Commission president has from day one stressed a clear ambition to make Europe a global powerhouse on green policy. The European Parliament will hold an extraordinary session on December 11, on the eve of an EU leaders' summit, to receive the commission's first climate proposals, which are called the 'Green New Deal'. Ms Von der Leyen's first trip today will be to the COP25 meeting in Madrid, which she has said will be a ""starting point"" for her plans. On Friday, she will go to Ethiopia to meet Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who is this year's Nobel Peace Prize winner. The last five-year EU term has told us to expect the unexpected amid much upheaval, including the Brexit vote in 2016. But Ms Von der Leyen deserves our good wishes as her presidential term begins.

In closing remarks he highlighted commitments by 77 countries, including Ireland, to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, though environmental groups said there were insufficient ""concrete actions"" given the latest indications of a worsening climate crisis. Some major asset fund managers said they would aim to get to a net-zero portfolio of investments by the same year, and dozens of businesses - including some major oil companies - said they would aim to abide by Paris Agreement targets. Activist The US did not request a speaking slot at the summit, but President Trump unexpectedly came to the general assembly hall and almost crossed paths with the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. UN climate envoy Michael Bloomberg welcomed Mr Trump's presence and addressed the president directly. ""Hopefully our discussions here will be useful for you when you formulate climate policy."" That was followed by laughter and applause. Head of the World Resources Institute Andrew Steer said most of the major economies fell ""woefully short"" of expectations. ""Their lack of ambition stands in sharp contrast with the growing demand for action around the world,"" he added. Thunberg and 15 other children have since filed a complaint with the UN alleging five of the world's major economies have violated their human rights by not taking adequate action to stop the unfolding climate crisis. The petition names Germany, France, Brazil, Argentina and Turkey, which they say have failed to uphold their obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The 16-year old will not be going back to school soon. She is due to travel to Montreal, Canada, to participate in a rally before attending the annual meeting of UN parties on climate, COP25 , in Chile later this year - by travelling overland. Welcomed Meanwhile, Siobh\'e1n Walsh, the chief executive of the aid agency Goal, has welcomed the Taoiseach's contribution on Monday, in which he pledged to stop oil exploration but warned there was ""no time for apathy if we are to avoid a hot earth scenario"". ""International relief and development agencies see the realities and impact of our changing climate on vulnerable communities around the world,"" Ms Walsh said from New York. ""The scale of this crisis requires a new level of pragmatic discussion and immediacy of action.""

Christian Aid Ireland said the terrifying damage and loss of life from droughts, floods, fires, typhoons and cyclones will be repeated unless the rise in global temperatures is contained. Jenny Higgins, policy and advocacy adviser with the agency, said Ireland needed to do far more to play its part. ""2020 is going to be a makeor-break year for the planet. We are running out of time to make sure temperature rises are kept within the safe limit of 1.5C,"" she said. ""This will only happen if governments finally commit to dramatically reducing their emissions. Ireland needs to cut its emissions by more than half by 2030 and right now it is not on track."" Among the disasters that make the devastating list is the extraordinary flooding that hit Australia in January and February, costing nearly (EURO)1.8bn in loss of property, infrastructure and livestock. Australia ends the year with the opposite problem - unprecedented fires that have burned an area bigger than Belgium since mid-November, affecting a third of the country's population. Argentina and Uruguay were also hit with catastrophic flooding in January, costing (EURO)2.3bn, while March brought Storm Eberhard in Europe, Cyclone Idai in Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Malawi, and floods in the American midwest and Iran. Later, Cyclone Fani and Typhoons Faxai and Hagibis caused havoc in Asia, while Hurricane Dorian killed hundreds along the eastern seaboard of North America. The most expensive event was the autumn's wildfires in California, costing (EURO)21bn. Seven of the disasters cost more than (EURO)9bn. In all cases, according to the Christian Aid report, climate change either exacerbated an extreme weather event or gave rise to it. Ms Higgins said while the financial costs were higher in wealthy countries, the world's poorest were the hardest hit overall despite being least responsible for rising temperatures. The recent COP25 Christian Aid has said Ireland needs to increase its (EURO)80m annual donation sixfold to adequately reflect the country's contribution to the problem of climate change. ""Countries on the frontline of the climate emergency need considerable financial support in order to be able to pay for damage and destruction caused by extreme weather,"" Ms Higgins said. ""Ireland needs to dramatically ramp up its contributions in order to pay its fair share."" This year has been one of the hottest on record, according to the World Meteorological Organisation. Carbon emissions need to fall by almost half by 2030 compared to 2010 if the rise in global temperatures is to be kept to 1.5C and the worst effects of climate change are to be avoided. However, emissions are continuing to rise. \"

They stressed the continuing need for bolder ambition and the full implementation of the Paris agreement, backed by robust rules. Throughout the Madrid talks hosted by Chile and Spain, youth activists, including some from Ireland, highlighted the disconnect between the 192 negotiating member states and the demands of those seeking more urgent action. ""I have never seen the divide between what is happening between the inside of these walls and the outside so large,"" said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace. Those obstructing the process, however, were becoming ""fewer and fewer and increasingly isolated"", according to Felipe De Leon, a climate negotiator for Costa Rica. He hoped young people would continue to push the process forward - delegates identified Brazil, the US, Australia and Saudi Arabia as the most persistent obstructors. Citing movement towards reconciliation in the final hours, Mr De Leon added: ""We would have never had the Paris Agreement without the activism and we would have never had the motion that we are seeing here - which is small but important - without the pressure they apply."" UK climate negotiator Archie Young said countries had told the incoming UK presidency, which will host next year's talks, of their intentions to build on Chile's efforts ""and on those calling on us to go further, faster"". ""We must take people with us as we all raise our ambition in the year ahead,"" he said. Christian Aid's global climate lead, Dr Katherine Kramer, said: ""The UK now has a gargantuan task of overseeing a successful climate summit in Glasgow next year. ""That meeting is supposed to be the moment the world responds to the climate crisis by strengthening the pledges made in the Paris Agreement."" She said that with a deadline of December to negotiate a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, the UK's diplomatic service would simultaneously have a huge challenge to ensure all countries arrive in Glasgow having enhanced their climate plans. ""After a year of even more extreme climate impacts, new and terrifying scientific reports and fury from schoolchildren around the world, we came to Madrid expecting countries to agree to step up their actions to tackle the climate crisis,"" she added. ""Instead we got two weeks of blocking from big polluters like Australia, Japan, Brazil, the US and Saudi Arabia, among others."" The failure to agree rules on emissions trading under Article 6 was probably better than a bad compromise, said Sadhbh O'Neill of Friends of the Irish Environment. ""If emissions trading is to play any meaningful role in reducing emissions, there must be very high standards of environmental integrity attached to projects, a commitment to an overall reduction in emissions, and safeguarding mechanisms to ensure that human rights are not compromised,"" she added. There was a lot of talk from governments and other actors at COP25 about commitments to net zero emissions by 2050, said Cliona Sharkey, policy advisor with Tr\'f3caire, but that was insufficient. ""We need to be clear, achieving net zero by 2050 is not the same as limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. Delivering on the 1.5-degree limit demands steep near-term cuts in emissions, frontloading action rather than hoping for miracles in 2040."" \"

Speaking before the start today of a two-week international climate conference in Madrid, the UN chief said the impact of rising temperatures - including more extreme weather - is already being felt around the world, with dramatic consequences for humans and other species. He noted that the world has the scientific knowledge and the technical means to limit global warming, but ""what is lacking is political will"". ""The point of no return is no longer over the horizon,"" Mr Guterres told reporters in the Spanish capital. ""It is in sight and hurtling toward us."" Delegates from almost 200 countries will try to put the finishing touches on the rules governing the 2015 Paris climate accord at the meeting, including how to create functioning international emissions trading systems and compensate poor countries for losses they suffer from rising sea levels and other consequences of climate change. Mr Guterres cited mounting scientific evidence for the impact that man-made emissions of greenhouse gases are already having on the planet, including record temperatures and melting polar ice. But he insisted that his message was ""one of hope, not of despair"". ""Our war against nature must stop and we know that that is possible."" Countries agreed in Paris four years ago to limit global warming to well below two degrees Celsius, ideally 1.5C, by the end of the century compared with pre-industrial times. Already, average temperatures have increased by about 1C, leaving little room for the more ambitious target to be met. Mr Guterres said growing demands from citizens, particularly young people, have shown there is widespread desire for climate action. ""What is still lacking is political will,"" he said. Mr Guterres noted that some 70 countries - many of them among the most vulnerable to climate change - have pledged to stop emitting more greenhouse gases by 2050. ""But we also see clearly that the world's largest emitters are not pulling their weight. And without them, our goal is unreachable,"" he said. The UN chief said he hoped the meeting in Madrid would see governments make more ambitious pledges ahead of a deadline to do so next year. He also said that creating a worldwide market for emissions, which is a key element of the sixth article of the Paris accord, remained one of the most contentious issues for negotiators. ""We are here to find answers for article 6, not to find excuses,"" Mr Guterres said. He also announced that outgoing Bank of England governor Mark Carney will become his new special envoy on ""climate action and climate finance"" from next year. Organisers expect around 29,000 visitors, including some 50 heads of state and government for today's opening, as well as scientists, seasoned negotiators and activists during the two-week meeting. Some of the world's largest carbon emitters - the United States, China and India - will be represented by ministers or lower-level officials. More than 5,000 police officers are charged with keeping the summit safe, Spain's Interior Ministry said yesterday. \"

An alarming rate of biodiversity loss, increasing impacts of climate disruption and over-consumption of natural resources means ""Europe faces environmental challenges of unprecedented scale and urgency"", it warns. COP25 climate talks in Madrid - predicts Europe will not achieve its 2030 environmental goals and so risks undermining its ability to decarbonise in coming decades. Most solutions are already identified but they risk failure if they are not implemented with the required urgency, concludes the report which evaluates data from 39 countries, and is used to frame EU climate and environmental policy. While European policies have improved the environment, there is not enough progress and the outlook for the coming decade is not positive, the report found. ""A business as usual approach will not cut it,"" warned EEA executive director Hans Bruyninckx. ""We have a narrow window of opportunity in the next decade to scale up measures to protect nature, lessen the impacts of climate change and radically reduce our consumption of natural resources,"" he said. ""We already have knowledge, technologies and tools needed to make key production and consumption systems such as food, mobility [transport] and energy sustainable. Future wellbeing and prosperity depend on this and our ability to harness society-wide action to bring about change,"" Mr Bruyninckx added. He said Ireland's biggest task was to improve its carbon emissions curtailment; most notably in transport and agriculture. SOER 2020 is the most comprehensive environmental assessment ever undertaken on Europe. It provides a snapshot of where Europe stands in meeting 2020 and 2030 policy targets as well as 2050 goals in shifting to a sustainable, low carbon future. Progress It acknowledges progress over the past two decades in cutting emissions. Signs of progress are also evident in tackling air and water pollution, addressing plastic waste, ""and bolstering climate change adaptation [to address physical impacts of global heating] and the circular and bio-economy"". The EU's sustainable finance initiative means the bloc's financial sector is driving the necessary shift to a sustainable future - a world first. But based on current delivery rates, Europe will not achieve its sustainability vision of ""living well within the limits of the planet by continuing to promote economic growth and seeking to manage the environmental and social impacts"". The report calls on Europe's leaders and policymakers to use the next decade to radically scale up - and speed up - actions to put Europe on track ""to avoid irreversible change and damage"". Investing in sustainability while stopping subsidies for environmentally damaging activities, especially fossil fuels, are needed. ""At the same time, it will be crucial to listen to public concerns and ensure widespread support for such a shift - a socially-fair transition,"" the report says. The report ""is perfectly timed to give us the added impetus we need as we start a new five-year cycle in the European Commission and as we prepare to present the European green deal"", said commission vice president Frans Timmermans.

In her formal address to UN climate talks - COP25 -- in Madrid she outlined what the science is now saying about accelerating climate shocks, and wished to let the evidence speak for itself, rather than deploying her usual approach of telling politicians ""the world is on fire"" in an effort to shock them into action. It was also announced yesterday that Ms Thunberg was named Time Magazine's Person of the Year for 2019. She was critical of how global leaders were negotiating when the world was reaching dangerous tipping points: ""Finding holistic solutions is what the COP should be all about, but instead it seems to have turned into some kind of opportunity for countries to negotiate loopholes and to avoid raising their ambition. ""Countries are finding clever ways around having to take real action, like double-counting emissions reductions, and moving emissions overseas, and walking back on their promises to increase ambitions, or refusing to pay for solutions or loss and damage. This has to stop."" Their fair share Rich countries needed to do their fair share and get down to real zero emissions much faster and then help poorer countries do the same so people in less fortunate parts of the world can help raise their living standards, Ms Thunberg said. ""We indeed have some work to do but some more than others."" Commitments to reduce their emissions by a certain date, including promises to achieve net-zero by 2050, appeared impressive at first glance. ""This is not leading, this is misleading,"" she added, warning that the targets did not include aviation and shipping, or emissions created by goods made in other countries and imported - and did include ""offsetting"" emissions. ""Zero by 2050 means nothing if high emissions continue for even a few years. ""Then the remaining budget will be gone,"" Ms Thunberg pointed out. The latest science showed that, at the current rate of emissions, the world was set to use up the whole ""carbon budget"" - the amount of pollution that can be put into the atmosphere and still keep global warming to 1.5 degrees - in eight years. She said real, drastic emissions cuts were needed, and carbon had to stay in the ground to keep temperature rises below 1.5 degrees. ""The biggest danger is not inaction; the real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening, when in fact almost nothing is being done apart from clever accounting and creative PR,"" Ms Thunberg warned.Countries previously committed to curbing global warming at ""well below"" two degrees above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to keep temperature rises to 1.5 degrees in the Paris Agreement secured in 2015 but were way off achieving what was required. ""Our leaders are not behaving as if we are in an emergency."" Hopeful note She finished her speech on a more hopeful note: ""In just three weeks we will enter a new decade, a decade that will define our future. ""Right now we are desperate for any sign of hope. There is hope - I've seen it - but it does not come from the governments or corporations, it comes from the people. "" The activist concluded by adding: ""Every great change in history comes from the people. We can start the change right now, we the people."" \"

Ireland moved up seven positions to 41st place in the latest Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) rankings, shifting from a group of ""very low"" to ""low performers"". Last year Ireland was in last place among EU nations. There has been a slight improvement in reducing carbon emissions, the CCPI report issued at the COP25 The report, jointly produced by Germanwatch, the NewClimate Institute and the Climate Action Network (Can), ranks 57 states accounting for 90 per cent of the world's emissions. It is based on criteria including renewables, energy efficiency and climate policy and is regarded internationally as the definitive indicator of performance in addressing a warming world. Temperature rise No country is classified as meeting the requirement to pursue actions containing global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees; the key requirement of the Paris Agreement. Sweden, Denmark and Morocco are closest to that point, while Chinese Taipei, Saudi Arabia and the US were the bottom three performers. The report warns that Ireland's per capita emissions remain at a high level, and significant challenges lie ahead in closing its emissions gap in meeting current 2030 targets and ""aligning its emissions trajectory with a net zero goal for 2050"". As a consequence, the country still ranks as the second worst performer in the EU after Poland. Ireland was moving down the rankings but ""moves up this year"", said CCPI author Dr Nicklas H\'f6hne. The lack of progress, however, in decarbonising key parts of the economy, ""mainly in agriculture, road transport and the residential sector"" stood out, he said. As ""a wind-rich country"" Ireland was able to keep up a positive trend in increasing its share of renewable energy, which led to an overall high rating in the category, he added. While Ireland had a lot more to do, Dr H\'f6hne noted it was supporting higher ambition by the EU, and embracing the difficult path of introducing five-yearly carbon budgets. The report highlights, nonetheless, that ""at the international level in the past"" Ireland called for ""less demanding targets due to claims regarding the economic importance of the agricultural sector"". ""Every country has to be really more ambitious,"" he added. Responding to the report, Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton said Ireland was set achieve its 2030 emission reduction targets and that the Government's climate action plan will ""put us on the right trajectory to meet net-zero emissions by 2050"". Christian Aid's policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins said Ireland still ranked among some of the worst performing countries in Europe. Catherine Devitt, head of policy with Stop Climate Chaos Coalition, said the group expected Ireland to rise a little as ""we could hardly go any lower"". Yesterday, a law firm representing 16 children from around the world, including Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg, sent letters to the governments of Norway and Canada. Those countries' support for their oil and gas industries breached the children's rights under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the letters said. \"

For the first time in years Brexit will not dominate the agenda of a European Council, although the leaders will return to the issue briefly tomorrow morning. Not, we are told, to discuss the implications of the election count, but to say, as Michel put it yesterday, ""we are ready for the next steps"" and to endorse a continuing role for Michel Barnier in future-relationship talks that must start almost immediately after the UK leaves the EU on January 31st. That, anyway, is the working assumption - that Johnson will win a sufficient majority to pass the withdrawal agreement and take the UK out into transition. Johnson's infuriating ghost, however, is the expression of that niggling doubt that maybe all will not turn out as expected and a majority is not assured. But there is here an unspoken sense that although no one wants the Brits to leave, it is, in said ghost's immortal words, time to ""get Brexit done"".\~ There is no illusion, however, that the difficulties will end here. In a discussion of the leaders' ""conclusions"", ambassadors removed a reference in the agreed text exhorting the union negotiators to move quickly to try to meet Johnson's wild expectation that talks can be completed by the end of 2020. No chance, all understand. And the British PM's repeated assertion that he will not ask for another extension by the treaty's specification of the end of June fills many with the sense that we are again heading for a no-deal cliff edge, this time without a prospect of escape. The agenda proper of the summit will be dominated by two other issues - responding to climate change, and the not-unrelated EU budget (multiannual financial framework or MFF) talks . Michel wants to send a signal to the final sessions of the COP25 climate summit in Madrid of an EU willingness to provide global leadership on dealing with climate change with a solemn commitment by to carbon-neutrality by 2050. That target and a roadmap to get there were set out in the commission's Green New Deal published yesterday. But the commitment to 2050 is being held up by three member states - Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic - who argue that their dependence on fossil fuels makes the challenge particularly onerous for them. Agreement appears difficult, even to the conclusions' wording that ""endorses the objective of achieving"" the 2050 target without committing anyone. ""That is extremely ambitious for some,"" one senior EU official said. The MFF debate will happen tonight and no one is expecting any more than a restatement by leaders of respective positions. The issue is now taken on board by Michel, whose team expect to convene a summit in February to finalise agreement. The Finns have attempted to put figures on the broad outlines of a deal which is significantly less ambitious in spending terms than the commission's original proposals. Few have been kind about it, although Dutch and Irish sources ventured that the ""negotiating box"" ""has some merits"". The leaders will also agree conclusions on the establishment from next year of a conference on the future of Europe. Some member states, like Ireland, approve in principle but are adamant it must not lead to treaty changes or an intergovernmental conference. Some scepticism over the project, a particular favourite of the European Parliament, was reflected in a senior official's blunt insistence that the central thrust of the EU's work programme had to remain its strategic agenda, of which climate change is a central part. A senior diplomat echoed the point. The conference ""must not monopolise the bandwidth"", he warned. \"

The COP25 Many developing countries and campaigners had wanted to see much more explicit language spelling out the importance of countries submitting bolder pledges on emissions as the Paris process enters a crucial implementation phase next year. Brazil, China, Australia, Saudi Arabia and the United States had led resistance to bolder action, delegates said. ""These talks reflect how disconnected country leaders are from the urgency of the science and the demands of their citizens in the streets,"" said Helen Mountford, "" said Helen Mountford, vice president for Climate and Economics, at the World Resources Institute think-tank. ""They need to wake up in 2020."" up in 2020."" The gathering had been due to end at the two-week mark on Friday but ran on for two extra days - a long delay even by the standards of often tortuous climate summits. After final decisions were made, Chile's Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt - who served as president of the talks - said she was ""of mixed emotions"". The country had earlier triggered outrage after drafting a version of the text that campaigners complained was so weak it betrayed the spirit of the Paris Agreement. The process set out in the Paris deal hinges on countries ratcheting up emissions cuts next year. The final draft did acknowledge the ""significant gap"" between existing pledges and the temperature goals adopted in 2015. Nevertheless, it was still seen as a weak response to the sense of urgency felt by communities around the world afflicted by floods, droughts, wildfires and cyclones that scientists say have become more intense as the Earth rapidly warms. Mr Guterres, who opened the talks on December 2, said he was ""disappointed"". ""The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis,"" he said in a statement. ""We must not give up and I will not give up."" Delegates drew some consolation from an agreement reached in Brussels last week by the European Union's 28 member states, bar Poland, to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, under a ""Green Deal"" to wean the continent off fossil fuels. ""It seems the EU now needs to be the leader and we want to be and we are going to be and that is what we are doing,"" said Krista Mikkonen, Finland's environment minister and the EU's representative at the talks. Brazil and Australia were among the main holdouts, delegates said, and the summit deferred big decisions on carbon markets. ""As many others have expressed, we are disappointed that we once again failed to find agreement,"" said Felipe De Leon, a climate official speaking on behalf of Costa Rica. Smaller nations had also hoped to win guarantees of financial aid to cope with climate change. The Pacific island of Tuvalu accused the United States, which began withdrawing from the Paris process last month, of blocking progress. ""There are millions of people all around the world who are already suffering from the impacts of climate change,"" Ian Fry, Tuvalu's representative, told delegates. ""Denying this fact could be interpreted by some to be a crime against humanity.""

"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland55","We are losing Venice to rising waters and inexorable depopulation; City falling victim to serious climate change and political inertia","November 28, 2019 Thursday","The Irish Times","For Simone Tagliapietra, climate change is personal. Yes, climate change is about disappearing islands in the Pacific, the desertification of Africa, hunger and melting polar ice. But in the heart of Europe it is also killing the place he loves most, his birthplace, Venice. ""I feel devastated,"" he says of the latest four consecutive acqua alta (high -water) floodings. Writing for Brussels think tank Bruegel after the city suffered the second-worst flooding in its history 10 days ago, and the worst since 1872, the professor of climate and energy science cites the Russian poet and essayist Joseph Brodsky's description of it as ""the greatest masterpiece our species produced"". We are losing Venice to rising waters, as it sinks into the mud of the bay by a millimetre a year while record tides become the norm, and to its inexorable depopulation in the face of touristification - 36 million visitors a year. A thousand Venetians leave for good every year - the population of the city is down to about 55,000, from 175,000 in the postwar period. About half who remain are 65 or older. So many have left, it is said, that it will be difficult to find the electricians, plumbers and carpenters needed to repair the damage. The floods affected 85 per cent of buildings in the city and seriously damaged half of its 120 churches. A living city, the quality that distinguishes Venice most from other great pillars of human achievement like the pyramids or Machu Picchu, is metamorphising into a museum as it slowly drowns. For me, the vaporetti chugging through the Grand Canal on a rainy day, the secret cells up in the roof of the Doge's Palace from which Giacomo Casanova notoriously escaped, the palace's spectacular Great Council chamber, the glass blowers of Murano, the backstreet restaurants and the paintings that populate its churches . . . these are Brodsky's masterpiece, Venice in toto. 'Family heirloom' ""Seeing St Mark's Basilica flooded is like watching a family heirloom drift away downstream,"" Tagliapietra writes. ""The sight of gondolas being smashed against their moorings, while houses and shops soak, has felt like a faceless assault against the Italian way of life. ""The city is used to dealing with the\~acqua alta, notably during the winter, when storms prowl the Mediterranean and strong sirocco winds - amplified by the narrow shape of the Adriatic - usher waves towards the northwest side of the sea. But this time has been different. It has been a catastrophe."" St Mark's, home to so many stunning golden mosaics, has been flooded only six times in 900 years, four of them in the past two decades. St Mark's Square now floods more than 60 times a year, up from four times a year in 1900. Tides high enough to flood Venice were once exceptional, but the 10 highest tides in its history have occurred over the past 20 years. The National Research Centre of Venice (CNR) warns that, without intervention, within 50 years this kind of flooding could occur with nearly every high tide. The latest acqua alta is a terrible but timely warning to the delegates who gather next week in Madrid\~for the latest world climate summit , COP25 ""Hundreds of millions have visited Venice to understand our history, but today it's a monument to the decades ahead,"" Tagliapietra warns. Extreme storms The science is clear, the evidence incontrovertible. Extreme storms normally faced only once every 100 years could hit the world's coastal cities at least once a year by 2050. By then more than a billion people are likely to be living in the low-lying areas that will be in the path of those storms. ""This would amount to having 3,800 Venices underwater at the same time,"" he writes. The issue for Venice and for Italian politics - as it is globally - is a systemic failure of political will and institutions that are incapable of rising to the task. As the flood waters rose two weeks ago, the regional Veneto council, controlled by Matteo Salvini's Liga, voted down climate defence measures. Rome has been discussing a project to deal with the city's floodwaters since the 1980s, but MOSE, a deployable underwater dam system blocking the three sea entrances to the lagoon, which has been under construction since 2003, is now 10 years behind schedule at a cost so far of EUR 5.5 billion. The delays reflect both bureaucratic inertia and endemic corruption.\~ \~ The message for Madrid from the heart of Europe is that the climate crisis is not coming, it is here. \"
"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland56","Nature will have the last word on climate crisis; Hope for systemic change ignited by activism was snuffed out by policymakers and lobbyists in Madrid","December 30, 2019 Monday","The Irish Times","The climate crisis, according to Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz, ""is our third World War. It needs a bold response."" The ripples of awareness are spreading quickly. The Collins dictionary chose ""climate strike"" as its word of the year, while the Oxford English dictionary plumped for ""climate emergency"". Meanwhile, teenage activist Greta Thunberg has become Time magazine's youngest ever person of the year. After a decade and more campaigning on this issue, I should be feeling elated that the message is finally breaking through. Instead, I remain haunted by HG Wells's description of history as being a race between education and catastrophe. And, on the eve of 2020, it hardly feels like we're winning. First, the politics. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) COP25 meeting opened with the direst of warnings from United Nations secretary general Ant\'f3nio Guterres: ""Humanity is knowingly destroying the planetary support system."" Despite this, it ended with a whimper in Madrid earlier this month. ""Make no mistake, this was a failure of epic proportions,"" said Irish climatologist Prof John Sweeney. Endless growth The IPCC was first convened in the early 1990s to tackle the threat of dangerous climate change, yet in the quarter century since its inception, global CO2 emissions have actually doubled. Soaring rhetoric has consistently crumbled in the face of a reality in which politics is beholden to powerful interests and bewitched by the imperative of endless economic growth. ""Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons,"" ecologist Garret Hardin presciently wrote in 1968. ""Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all."" The flicker of hope for real system change ignited this year by the international school strike movement and the street activism of Extinction Rebellion among others has been snuffed out by the politicians, policymakers and corporate lobbyists in Madrid. Nature, however, will have the last word. The Arctic region is now warming so rapidly that it is releasing more than a billion tons of CO2 annually from rapidly melting permafrost - this is equivalent to the total emissions for Japan and Russia combined. Equally dramatic has been the precipitous decline of Arctic sea ice, which has been shrinking at the rate of more than 10 per cent a year since the 1970s. An ice-free Arctic in the summer is now within sight, with profound climatic consequences for the entire northern hemisphere, including Ireland. The vast Greenland ice sheet is melting seven times more quickly than in the 1990s, dumping more than 250 billion tonnes of melt water into the north Atlantic annually. Unsurprisingly, 2019 has been confirmed as the second-hottest year on record. All five hottest years have occurred since 2015. In just the first six months of 2019, extreme weather displaced a record seven million people worldwide. Higher temperatures have fanned epic fires this year, from the Amazon to California, Africa, Australia and even sweeping the boreal forests of Canada and Siberia. Among the areas hit by mega flooding events this year were India, Mozambique, Japan, the Philippines and the US midwest. Earlier this month fund managers Legal & General warned of an ""unparalleled climate catastrophe"" this century, with between one billion and two billion people being exposed to fatal levels of heat and humidity. ""The next 10 years are going to decide what sort of climate outcome we end up with,"" said analyst Nick Stansbury. Many have already decided. Oil titan Saudi Aramco was recently floated, with a share value of $2 trillion, making it the most valuable company on Earth. What are the odds of this vast fortune remaining unburned to preserve the global commons? Unearned wealth of this kind is also blatant intergenerational theft. To prop up the present bubble of affluence for some, corporations consume ""unpriced natural capital"" worth $7.3 trillion a year, leaving a bitter legacy of unmanaged emissions, unmanageable pollution and gravely degraded biodiversity for all future generations. Anaemic response Ireland's politicians were caught off guard by the force of street protests this year, and have since been scrambling to catch up. The rhetoric has certainly improved, but between system inertia and constant lobbyist pressure, the response remains anaemic. I have spoken with groups all around the country this year and, for the first time, am routinely encountering anxiety, bordering on panic. And people are right to be afraid. If you are still feeling calm about the climate emergency, you simply haven't been following the science. Politicians and their advisers want you to believe we can tackle this existential crisis through small, painless personal behavioural nudges, while knowing this is patent nonsense. The changes required will be wrenching, both at an individual and at a system level. Radical decarbonisation will mean rationing and restrictions only ever seen in wartime. The public may come accept this once it truly grasps that the alternative is collapse and ruin. Welcome to the radical new politics of the 2020s.

"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland58","Greta Thunberg: 'We strike because we have to, not because we want to'","November 30, 2019 Saturday","Irish Examiner","[i]<strong>By Greta Thunberg, Luisa Neubauer, and Angela Valenzuela</strong>[/i] For over a year, children and young people from around the world have been striking for the climate. We launched a movement that defied all expectations, with millions of people lending their voices - and their bodies - to the cause. We did this not because it was our dream, but because we didn't see anyone else taking action to secure our future. And despite the vocal support we have received from many adults - including some of the world's most powerful leaders - we still don't. Striking is not a choice we relish; we do it because we see no other options. We have watched a string of United Nations climate conferences unfold. Countless negotiations have produced much-hyped but ultimately empty commitments from the world's governments - the same governments that allow fossil-fuel companies to drill for ever-more oil and gas, and burn away our futures for their profit. Politicians and fossil-fuel companies have known about climate change for decades. And yet the politicians let the profiteers continue to exploit our planet's resources and destroy its ecosystems in a quest for quick cash that threatens our very existence. Don't take our word for it: scientists are sounding the alarm. They warn that we have never been less likely to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels - the threshold beyond which the most destructive effects of climate change would be triggered. Worse, recent research shows that we are on track to produce 120% more fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with the 1.5\'b0C limit. The concentration of climate-heating greenhouse gases in our atmosphere has reached a record high, with no sign of a slowdown. Even if countries fulfill their current emissions-reduction pledges, we are headed for a 3.2\'b0C increase. Young people like us bear the brunt of our leaders' failures. Research shows that pollution from burning fossil fuels is the world's most significant threat to children's health. Just this month, 5m masks were handed out at schools in New Delhi, India's capital, owing to toxic smog. Fossil fuels are literally choking the life from us. The scientific evidence is crying out for urgent action, and still our leaders dare to ignore it. So we continue to fight. After a year of strikes, our voices are being heard. We are being invited to speak in the corridors of power. At the UN, we addressed a room filled with world leaders. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, we met with prime ministers, presidents, and even the Pope. We have spent hundreds of hours participating in panels and speaking with journalists and filmmakers. We have been offered awards for our activism. Our efforts have helped to shift the wider conversation on climate change. People now increasingly discuss the crisis we face, not in whispers or as an afterthought, but publicly and with a sense of urgency. Polls confirm changing perceptions. One recent survey showed that, in seven of the eight countries included, climate breakdown is considered to be the most important issue facing the world. Another confirmed that schoolchildren have led the way in raising awareness. With public opinion shifting, world leaders, too, say that they have heard us. They say that they agree with our demand for urgent action to tackle the climate crisis. But they do nothing. As they head to Madrid for the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, we call out this hypocrisy. On two Fridays, we are again taking to the streets: worldwide yesterday, and in Madrid, Santiago, and many other places on December 6 during the UN climate conference. Schoolchildren, young people, and adults all over the world stand together, demanding that our leaders take action - not because we want them to, but because the science demands it. The action has to be powerful and wide-ranging. After all, the climate crisis is not just about the environment. It is a crisis of human rights, of justice, and of political will. Colonial, racist, and patriarchal systems of oppression have created and fueled it. We need to dismantle them all. Our political leaders can no longer shirk their responsibilities. Some say that the Madrid conference is not very important; the big decisions will be made at COP26 in Glasgow next year. We disagree. As the science makes clear, we don't have a single day to lose. We have learned that, if we do not step up, nobody will. So we will keep up a steady drumbeat of strikes, protests, and other actions. We will become louder and louder. We will do whatever it takes to persuade our leaders to unite behind science so clear that even children understand it. Collective action works; we have proved that. However, to change everything, we need everyone. Each and every one of us must participate in the climate resistance movement. We cannot just say we care; we must show it. \"

Unless we change something, the consequences will be dire. Should that something be our focus on economic growth? IClimate change represents the most salient risk we face, and we are already getting a glimpse of the costs. And in ""we"", I include Americans. The United States, where a major political party is dominated by climate-change deniers, is the highest per capita emitter of greenhouse gases and the only country refusing to adhere to the 2015 Paris climate agreement. So there is a certain irony in the fact the US has also become one of the countries with the highest levels of property damage associated with extreme weather events such as floods, fires, hurricanes, droughts and bitter cold. At one time, some Americans even hoped climate change might benefit them. Maine's coastal waters, for example, would become swimmable. Even today, a few economists still believe there is not much to worry about so long as we limit the increase in average global temperature to 3-4C, compared to the 2C limit set by the Paris agreement. This is a foolish gamble. Greenhouse-gas concentrations are projected to be at their highest level in millions of years, and we have nowhere else to go if we lose. Studies suggesting we could tolerate higher temperatures are deeply flawed. For example, because appropriate risk analyses are systematically omitted, their models do not give sufficient weight to the probability of ""bad outcomes"". The greater the weight we assign to the risk of bad outcomes, and the worse those outcomes are, the more precautions we should take. By assigning little weight - far too little weight - to very adverse outcomes, these studies systematically bias the analysis against doing anything. Moreover, these studies underestimate the non-linearities in the damage functions. In other words, our economic and ecological systems may be resilient to small changes in temperature, with damage increasing only proportionally to temperature, but once climate change reaches a certain threshold, the increase in damages accelerates relative to the rise in temperature. For example, crop loss becomes serious as a result of frosts and droughts. Whereas a below-threshold level of change may not affect the risk of frost or drought, a higher level increases disproportionately the risk of extreme events. It is precisely when the consequences of climate change are large that we are least able to absorb the costs. There's no insurance fund to draw upon if we need investments to respond to large increases in sea levels, unforeseen health risks, and migration on a massive scale as a result of climate change. The fact is in these circumstances, our world will be poorer and less able to absorb these losses. Finally, those who argue for a wait-andsee approach to climate change - that it's a waste of money to take large actions today for an uncertain risk far in the future - typically discount these future losses at a high rate. That is, whenever one takes an action that has a future cost or benefit, one must assess the present value of these future costs or benefits. If a dollar 50 years from now is worth the same as a dollar today, one might be motivated to take strong action to prevent a loss; but if a dollar 50 years from now is worth three cents, one wouldn't. The discount rate (how we value future costs and benefits relative to today) thus becomes critical. US President Donald Trump's administration has in fact said that one wouldn't want to spend more than roughly three cents today to prevent a dollar loss in 50 years. Future generations just don't count much. This is morally wrong. But the do-nothing advocates, ignoring all the advances in public economics over the past half-century that have explained otherwise, argue that economic efficiency requires it. They are wrong. We must take strong action now to avoid the climate disaster toward which the world is heading. And it is a welcome development so many European leaders are spearheading efforts to ensure the world is carbon-neutral by 2050. The report of the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices, which I co-chaired with Nicholas Stern, argued we could achieve the Paris agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 2C in a way that enhanced living standards: the transition to a green economy could spur innovation and prosperity. That view sets us apart from those who suggest the Paris agreement's goals can be achieved only by stopping economic expansion. I believe that is wrong. However misguided the obsession with ever-increasing GDP may be, without economic growth, billions of people will remain without inadequate food, housing, clothing, education and medical care. But there is ample room to change the quality of growth, to reduce its environmental impact significantly. For example, even without major technological advances, we can achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. wouldn't cents today to Future But it won't happen on its own, and it won't happen if we just leave it to the market. It will happen only if we combine high levels of public investment with strong regulation and appropriate environmental pricing.

"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland63","Irish witness to history - 2019 Chilean protests","December 26, 2019 Thursday 8:43 AM GMT","RTE News","When students began jumping subway barriers in Santiago in protest at metro fare hikes last October, nobody expected it would lead ultimately to an overhaul of the Chilean constitution. Among those most taken by surprise was Chile's president Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era. On paper, his country\' s economic indicators were healthy with per capita GDP among the highest in the region. Upheaval like that seen in Venezuela had passed Chile by. He felt comfortable telling The Financial Times that his country was an ""oasis"" of stability in Latin America. Within weeks of this positive assessment, riots had broken out in several cities across Chile, tanks were deployed on the streets, buildings were being burnt, protestors being shot and maimed and thousands arrested. COP25 Climate Summit, which was due to be held in Santiago, was moved to Madrid amid fears that stability may not have been restored by December. Under severe pressure, the government announced a package of measures to placate outraged citizens, but deeper reform was demanded. Eventually President Pi\'f1era agreed to hold a referendum next April to allow the people have their say on a constitution to address the many inequalities in society. The metro-fares misstep and the government\' s reaction to protests at it cut to the heart of what citizens (some of whom paid 10-15% of their income on metro travel alone) had long suspected: The government had lost touch with their daily, difficult reality. Br\'edd McGrath, a former NGO and government adviser from Co Tipperary moved to Chile about a year ago with her Chilean partner. They had just started a family in the lead-up to the riots in October. She recalls how quickly the whole situation blew up in the early days after metro protests started on 23 October. ""It happened really quickly from the morning to the night time the situation completely changed from localised metro protests to fires all over the city, to burning buildings, to burning supermarkets, to the army and the police all over the streets. It went from zero up to 100 in less than 12 hours."" The cost of living in Santiago had surprised Br\'edd when she moved there. She wondered how such high prices were affordable for Chileans on low pay. As the growing protests showed, they were not at all affordable. ""So, I could never understand how people - in Santiago particularly - could make ends meet. I just could not understand it and I could see then why they were working two or three jobs and doing nothing but working."" ""The inequality here is extreme. The top 2% in Chile is equivalent to the top 2% in Germany, money-wise. But the bottom 5% is the equivalent of the bottom 5% in Mongolia, so it\' s massively unequal. ""There\' s no sense of what a public good is. If you want any kind of a decent education you have to pay for it and pay handsomely. If you want any kind of a decent health service you have pay for it. So most public goods that we would consider universal are out of the reach of the normal person in Chile. There was no way that that was sustainable."" When the metro protests started, the government response was clumsy. Throwaway remarks incensed the public, she added. ""In the very beginning, on that first day, everyone was in favour of the idea that they shouldn\' t increase the metro prices, particularly because government ministers said, even the day before 'Oh, but the flowers are cheaper - you can buy more flowers and be happy with that\' . Or another minister said \' If you get up earlier in the morning the metro is cheaper\' . So people were angry with that - and that has some resonance in Ireland."" Chile's president Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era For McGrath herself, the scale of the protests and the security response meant her life and that of her new baby were in effective lockdown. ""We stayed in for at least three weeks because it was genuinely too risky to go outside. A friend of mine who lives near Plaza Italia and has a four-month-old baby now, she had to decamp to the north of Chile because her child couldn\' t breathe, such was the preponderance of tear gas. ""You really could not go out with a small baby into a volatile situation where you could hear the sounds of explosions at any given moment. There were sirens. I think tear gas was my great fear. It would be awful for a baby to encounter that. So essentially, for three full weeks we did not leave the apartment."" The high profile role of the armed forces in the government\' s response to the protests rang alarm bells with Chileans, for whom Augusto Pinochet - whose military dictatorship ended in the late 1980s - is a recent memory. ""The kind of turn in public opinion, I think, was when you could see on the news - every TV station turned to this crisis - and you could see the heads of the armed forces, the army, the air force, the navy, walking in in full uniform into La Moneda - the presidential palace - and the state of emergency being declared by Pi\'f1era - the president. ""The sight of those people walking into the presidential palace, whether you were alive for the Pinochet era or not, or whether you were even Chilean, that was chilling,"" says McGrath. When the security forces made their presence felt on the street, even citizens whose sympathy for protests was hesitant because of violence and looting picked a side. By 25 October, the third day of protests, more people went to the streets. ""People who wouldn\' t think of protesting got extremely afraid and angry at that point and said: \' No, this is not your state, Pi\'f1era, this is not the army and the police\' s state. This is our state and we\' re going to take it back'. ""That\' s when the movement became properly mainstream and became peaceful. That\' s when you could understand that the violence, such as it was, was really more young people, fringe elements, a little bit hyped by the media possibly, but that Chile was going to stand up against state repression."" Tanks on the streets amplified echoes of repression in previous decades too. ""That again, it\' s the folk memory. But it\' s particularly scary because ... there are protests, and the tanks will come; the water goes over all the protesters, the tear gas is used at all times with no difficulty whatsoever. That is a state in crisis if it cannot listen to its people ... But the reaction of a government when people say \' No more inequality\' - to put those tanks on the streets, to shoot deliberately, to blind more than 200 people ... There are people going to work that are now blind because of the use of rubber bullets - that makes any right-thinking person very, very angry."" Pensions have been hiked by 20%, the monthly minimum wage raised by around $400 and the government backed off the metro hikes. But even with the promise of reform, accountability is still high on the agenda, says McGrath. ""Now, [the government] ultimately ended up listening to the people in agreeing to a new constitution and there is a process in place, but it\' s not over by any means. The state has yet to account for its crimes. 26 people that we know of - possibly more - some say more than 30 have died over the course of these protests so this is a conversation that Chile absolutely needed to have."" \"

"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland68","CLIMATE POLITICS COMES UNSTUCK; As we enter a make-or-break decade for addressing the global crisis, just three of 197 countries have met an agreed deadline to ....","February 22, 2020 Saturday","The Irish Times","To say humanity is entering a make-or-break decade is no exaggeration, given the latest climate science. The year 2020 arrived with much talk of what had to be done by 2030. It is becoming increasingly clear that actions over the coming months will be critical. Get it wrong, and we are in uncharted territory, and the Paris Agreement of 2015 risks foundering. If activated now, long overdue measures will set the correct course for the coming years in addressing the climate crisis. This is the case globally and in the Irish context. Yet only three signatories out of 197 countries - Norway, the Marshall Islands and Suriname - met a symbolic deadline of February 9th to strengthen plans to fight climate change. These involved hard decisions on cutting carbon emissions, adopting renewable energy and making the world more climate-resilient. Only if vague aspirations become binding targets is there any chance of containing global temperature rise. Such decisions become even more important if Donald Trump, head of the world's second biggest carbon-emitting country, is re-elected later this year. China, the biggest emitter, has been showing signs of stepping up to the plate but its coronavirus crisis could derail efforts. The short-term timetable is looking ever less realistic. ""Global Britain"" with Boris Johnson at the steering wheel has said it wants to lead the world into more ambitious climate actions. In November, Britain co-hosts with the UN the COP26 (the 26th ""Conference of the Parties"") summit in Glasgow. But Johnson's first steps this month in attempting to forge a new global consensus were widely considered a car crash. He sacked COP26 president and former energy minister Claire O'Neill. O'Neill responded on the BBC by accusing him of not understanding the climate emergency, of lack of commitment and of being untrustworthy. Since then, Alok Sharma was promoted to business secretary and put in charge of COP26. The UK has been in the vanguard of global climate action over the past decade, yet Johnson's only new measure has been to move from 2040 to 2035 the deadline for phasing out diesel and petrol cars. It was dismissed by the motoring industry as ""a date without a plan"". Damaging Former UN climate envoy Mary Robinson said the perception that major British politicians - including ex-prime minister David Cameron and former foreign secretary William Hague - were unwilling to take on the role of leading COP26 summit was damaging. ""It is not helpful that we are getting the impression that nobody in the UK wants the job. I mean, come on!"" she told the Guardian. ""The UK asked for this, they pitched for this responsibility ... They must carry it forward. I do not see a coherent drive for [the summit] in the UK."" This was to be the year to firm up the Paris pact, yet the risk is it will unravel. This risk has increased, notwithstanding the European Green Deal, under which the EU has committed to becoming the first carbon-neutral continent. In parallel, Ireland's recent momentum on climate action has been stalled by the election, while its ""how to"" plans (the National Energy and Climate Plan and the long-term strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 required by the EU) are overdue. This is the decade when global carbon emissions will finally be forced down by collective action, or we will fail and experience increasingly catastrophic effects of an overheating world. The 2020s are the last opportunity to retain control over what happens to this generation. In the next decade we have a chance of avoiding the worst impacts of climate disruption. The one piece of good news defying expectations is global CO2 emissions flatlined in 2019 - it remains to be seen if that is a temporary blip. By 2030 global emissions have to be cut by 55 per cent if there is to be any realistic chance of achieving carbon-neutrality by 2050. The Paris deal is emphatic: keeping temperature increases to within 1.5 degree above pre-industrial (late 19th century) levels is the over-riding priority. Human-induced warming reached 1 degree in 2017 and, if this pace of warming continues, it will hit 1.5 degrees around 2040. Wildfires, cyclones, droughts, melting ice sheets and record temperatures point to ""here and now"" extremes driven by a disturbed climate. The latest UN Environment Programme (UNEP) ""emissions gap report"" provides the best where-we-are-at summary. Unless the world begins to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the 1.5 degree goal of the Paris Agreement ""will slip out of reach"". There is an ever-growing gap between actual emission reduction commitments by the countries necessary to achieve the Paris goals. Global emissions have increased by 11 per cent since the first ""gap report"" in 2010. Each year of growing emissions means deeper and faster cuts are needed to meet Paris targets. This increases the amount of CO2 needing to be removed from the atmosphere to make the 1.5 degree target realisable. There is no sign of emissions peaking - Ireland is typical in that regard. Even if countries meet their existing climate pledges, emissions will continue to rise modestly over the next decade, the UNEP says. By 2030, it estimates emissions will be 38 per cent higher than what is needed. Current projections are for a three-degrees-warmer world - one of flooded cities, repeated agricultural failures and deadly heat. Many of the models that flagged that scenario in recent years are now predicting a far worse one of 5 degrees plus. Many countries have enacted climate mitigation policies, and clean energy technologies have fallen dramatically in cost, but global emissions are still far too high. Safe quantity of emissions A carbon budget is defined as a safe quantity of emissions over a specified time. It needs to be in line with what is scientifically required to keep global warming, and thus climate change, ""tolerable"". Environmental commentator John Gibbons says the amount of carbon that can be emitted globally to keep within 1.5 degrees is running out. If it was a bucket, based on current emissions, it would be almost full, with only 9 per cent of our global carbon budget left. ""At the current rate, it expires by the end of the 2020s,"" says Gibbons, after which dangerous tipping points loom. This requires facing up to the demands of ""stopping distance""; similar to driving a car, where you need to hit the brakes well before the critical point to avoid a collision ie climate catastrophe. Difficulties are compounded by unravelling of global solidarity and an increase in populism, ""when we need to act in a multilateral way"". Everybody is protecting their own patch, Gibbons adds. On energy, ""a colossal jump is needed"", he says, to ensure rapid decarbonisation. The recent $2 trillion Saudi Aramco initial public offering, the world's biggest share offering ever, illustrates the scale of the task as ""markets have baked in the burning of billions of barrels of oil for the coming decade"". It's business as usual for the industry and enterprise. There is no dramatic change, just ""a garnish of greenwashing"". Carbon is not part of the critical dialogue, which makes Gibbons profoundly pessimistic. ""If we have another decade like the past one, we will pass the point of no return."" Prof Brian \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir, director of the MaREI energy research institute in UCC, says strong political consensus built in Paris ""has not translated into necessary action to deliver on that ambition"". There was optimism then, though analysis was needed to articulate what was required. Now climate science is confirming how bad things are, ""and getting worse"". What's more, there is a pattern of ""increased living experience of climate change"". While young people are getting more anxious at the failure of the political system, society and industry continue to grasp what is required to remain within a carbon budget of 1.5 degrees. \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir underlines the need for a broad range of measures that must be adopted and quickly implemented by a new government. Massive electrification (especially for transport) is required, he says, and there was huge ambition in the outgoing government's climate plan in aiming to cater for 70 per cent renewables on the power grid. Based on current trends, however, we would only achieve 14 per cent of renewables in overall energy use by 2030. We are doing well in some areas but complacent in others, \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir adds. There is a pressing need to improve the energy performance and carbon impact of buildings; there has been an emphasis on shallow retrofitting homes (ie insulating attics) when deep retrofitting (insulating walls and windows and utilising a heat pump) is required. With plans to deep-retrofit hundreds of thousands of houses by 2030 at up to EUR 50,000 per building, an innovative financial mechanism to make it affordable is urgently needed. Householders don't know where to start on this. There are blindspots too, says \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir. There is huge potential from biogas (biomethane), he insists, in helping to reduce emissions in agriculture and as a partial solution in freight transport. Yet the policy focus has been on a limited number of options. ""If they don't deliver, then we fail."" Energy performance overall is not what it should be, and Irish emissions continue to rise. The scale of the challenge is not fully understood, \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir adds. There are significant issues in agriculture including a growing emissions scenario. Beef is not providing sufficient income. Efforts to reduce the problem often consist of little more than finger-pointing at the agriculture sector. This, he notes, leads to defensiveness from the sector, which points to the low-carbon footprint of a litre of milk or a steak - ""which is not untrue"". Proper discourse is needed but polarisation, the kind engendered by Brexit and Trump, risks making it intractable, ""where you cannot even discuss issues"". The need for energy efficiency is widely recognised along with the importance of renewable electricity from wind and solar. But ""anything involving burning fuels"" has become divisive, he says. Path to decarbonisation The Marine and Renewable Energy Ireland centre is a global leader on energy modelling. Its projections on the path to decarbonisation indicate that renewables ""get us only half way there"". So bioenergy and biogas have to be in the medium-term mix. Where gas is used, \'d3 Gallach\'f3ir stresses, it should be the fossil-free form. Renewable gas/biomethane is a clean, renewable and carbon-neutral fuel usable in the national grid. Its potential as a fuel for heat, electricity and transport is undeniable. How can polarisation be overcome to ensure proper discourse? The citizens' assembly approach can work in this case, but needs to move centre stage, he adds. The science demands a sense of emergency, but that too can lead to polarisation. It is not a matter of achieving consensus but proper evaluation of what is required, leading to actions and solutions. Urgency is growing; ""intention is there but will is a challenge"". An added complication has been the worrying evidence of growing eco-anxiety among young people. ""They should be commended for how they raised the issue but it's totally unfair that it required them to go on strike."" Anxiety is being added to by lack of action, he says. The level of political discourse has changed dramatically in the past year. If everybody became more proactive on climate and were assured they are being heard ""in a way they are comfortable with"", there would be a much stronger platform to take on board the immense challenge of the coming decade. Ireland has to pull its weight in terms of meeting its international obligations in realising its fair share of the carbon budget, according to climatologist Prof John Sweeney. Governments will have to face up to what is required not only in making a global contribution to reducing emissions but also must address the reality of adaptation. The costs of ensuring Ireland is adequately protected from the effects of climate disruption, especially from inevitable flooding and pounding of the coastline from more frequent storm surges. There will also be consequences for the way we produce food and for tourism, Sweeney adds. The outgoing government's climate plan was ""wholly deficient in contributing appropriately to emission reductions which the UN secretary general [Ant\'f3nio Guterres] estimated as requiring on a global basis 7.6 per cent reductions every year for the next decade"". The current Irish trajectory is a mere 2 per cent reduction. ""We cannot criticise other nations for playing the national self-interest card if we ourselves seek to do the same."" Whereas in Paris countries came together to do business, in 2019 at COP25 in Madrid some of them, notably wealthy G20 states, came to obstruct progress and to place narrow national and financial interests ahead of urgent global community needs. ""The stakes are unbelievably high and the 'egg timer' of the remaining carbon budget is fast emptying,"" Sweeney adds. There are those who believe 2020 is the world's last chance to tackle climate change and protect biodiversity. When world leaders gather this year at the UN General Assembly and at COP26, strong leadership will be needed if the tide of climate disruption has any chance of being turned during the next decade. \"
"COP25","Ireland","COP25_Ireland69","From mending clothes and household appliances to stewing apples and using a hot water bottle... what our grandparents can teach us about making our lifestyle mo....","December 28, 2019 Saturday","Belfast Telegraph","When I was young, my grandpa used to fill the kettle in the morning, boil it and decant the contents into a flask. This meant that he boiled the kettle just once a day, thereby saving electricity and, crucially, money. In my childhood many of these habits and behaviours that governed how my grandparents and, by extension, my parents lived seemed odd. Having been born in the late Eighties without any lived experience of wartime - or even post-war - Britain, I struggled to understand these idiosyncrasies, considering them to be markers of their personalities, rather than indelible imprints of a time gone by. My grandma would collect all of the fruit that fell from the trees in the garden and - without fail - would make a stock of jam to last the winter. If something in the house broke, my grandpa, an engineer by trade, would find a way to fix it; whether that meant by himself, or by asking someone down the pub who might have the requisite skills. I often remember wistfully that no matter the season of our visit, my grandma - and later, my grandpa, following her death - would stew apples every Sunday for his breakfast throughout the week. Still now, I have a Proustian fondness for stewed apples. My parents straddled the period between the ""waste-not-wantnot"" post-war mentality and the boom in mass consumerism and neoliberalism of the late Eighties and Nineties in the west. That is to say that while their incomes and resources increased, anything classed as ""wasteful"" was to be avoided. My mum knitted (and still does), they always had a healthy vegetable patch nourished by a compost heap in the garden and all options to try to repair a broken item would have to be exhausted before we'd consider buying a new one. However, like most families, our behaviour adapted with the times. Amazon made it easy to replace broken items at a low cost. Fast-fashion brands precluded the need for repairing damaged items of clothing. Flights became cheaper, and so we took more of them. It became costlier to fix a car than to buy a new one (even for a family of engineers). Taxis became more affordable than group trips on the bus. And we got so used to these luxuries, our expectations shifted too. Language has shifted over the past few years: we talk now of a ""climate crisis"" rather than ""climate change"" - conveying consensus over the scale of the issue facing humanity. In fact, in May, MPs in Westminster approved a motion to declare a state of climate emergency. This was an important development for environmental campaigners, Extinction Rebellion, which had included it in its list of demands to the government, following a series of disruptive protests, although in practice it means very little. It was also followed in September by news that hundreds of climate sceptics are mounting a campaign for environmental deregulation after Brexit, many of whom have links to the cabinet of Boris Johnson, the prime minister. The stakes could hardly be higher. Recent calculations by Monica de Bolle, a prominent economist focusing on Latin America, show that we are much closer to an environmental tipping point (when the scale of climate damage is deemed irreversible) in the Amazon rainforest than previously estimated; in fact, she predicts that we could reach this landmark event as early as 2021. Dr Tim Taylor, an environmental economist at the University of Exeter and the institution's colead for the Inter-sectoral Health and Environment Research for Innovation (Inherit) project, says ""we're facing a world where it looks like we're going to break the 1.5\'b0C threshold of temperature increase"". He continues: ""As we add more and more to that pressure, we increase the challenges that future generations will have to respond to."" So where does this leave us? As Dr Taylor says, this ""emergency"" presents us with a ""great potential to change our habits in a variety of ways"", which ""really do offer potential benefits for businesses and broader society"". He points out that initiatives directed at bringing progress on climate goals can often produce ""triple wins"", with a knock-on impact on both public health, and health equity, which is an area on which he focuses his attention. And yet, the scale of the task is so colossal, that it often leads individuals to feel overwhelmed. ""People can feel a lack of agency,"" Taylor says. ""We can feel that what we do amounts to such a small drop in the ocean,"" he continues, ""but when it comes down to it, change comes from a number of directions: from the top down and from the bottom up. We need governments to change policies, and individuals and big business to change their behaviours."" We could learn a lot from our grandparents, he says, about living sustainably. ""Lowering energy usage, reducing our meat consumption, and eating and growing more fresh produce are all habits of yesteryear that could have a positive impact on both the environment and our health."" I put this question to my mum, Stephanie, and was soon looped into a Whatsapp group conversation with her friends about the habits and routines of their parents to save money that would now be considered ""life hacks"" for those wanting to reduce their imprint on the environment. ""Your grandmother made our clothes and so did I,"" Mum tells me. ""When I grew out of a knitted jumper, she'd unravel it, add some wool and make a bigger one."" My dad, Roger, says my grandparents would always darn knackered socks, and that cobblers were a much more important business in those days. Responsible shopping is also a theme. ""If we did buy clothes, they were always second-hand or pre-worn."" Another common thread was a much-reduced wardrobe, ""aside from school uniform, as a teenager I had about three other outfits,"" Stella Parton says ""and my clothes were worn out before I'd even grown into them!"" Lexie Gower pointed out that with regards to children's clothes, her mother thought ahead: ""My mum bought my school skirt in the first year big enough to still fit me by O-levels,"" she says. ""I was 4ft 8ins in first year and about 5ft 5ins by the age of 15!"" And as Sue Garner points out, ""people weren't so obsessed with cleanliness, so we washed clothes less"". Repairing broken items was also considered the norm: ""Our house, like many of my friends', more often than not had some appliance dismantled on the kitchen table next to a soldering iron,"" Gower says. ""Cars were always sitting with bonnets up being fixed at home,"" she says. ""When a teddy wore out, my nan would knit it new clothes and there was a dolls' hospital in town where we would take them if they broke."" Of course, these days, the state education system has moved away from more ""practical"" skills towards those that are considered to be more relevant to the modern world (and those that will be more in demand as artificial intelligence - AI - replaces certain jobs): science, maths, English and computing. An aversion to or lack of access to central heating is a shared experience that carried its own related habits. ""We would always shut the door when leaving the room to preserve the heat,"" my mum tells me, ""and put on extra layers or use hot water bottles if cold at home, rather than altering our environment."" And, of course, ""lights were always turned off when you left a room"", adds Garner. On a day-to-day level, there were fewer disposable items. ""We used handkerchiefs rather than single-use tissues"", mum says. ""I even remember your grandma washing plastic bags in the sink to reuse them!"" According to Garner: ""We used paper bags for everything, if not then wicker or rattan."" She continues: ""Products in those days were packaged much less ostentatiously too."" ""We didn't have any clingfilm,"" mum says, ""we just covered food with a plate."" Food is a huge topic. I opened up the question to my social media. ""My grandma still lives by the rule that you can use a single teabag seven times,"" says Jess Commons, an editor from London. ""It was very common for houses to have compost heaps out the back,"" says Gower. ""And more people would grow their own food. Indeed, if I can't get hold of my mum she is probably on her knees in the veg patch."" ""We'd regularly go and pick hedgerow fruit,"" my dad says, and of course in those days, milk was delivered in glass bottles, a trend that is seeing a resurgence. ""On a Sunday, we'd cook all of the food in the oven we needed for the week, to avoid having to use it more than once,"" says mum. ""We'd have stews, cakes and animals roasting in there. And, if we did eat meat, it was more often than not cheaper cuts, like shin beef, neck and breast of lamb, belly pork, liver, kidneys and other offal, making use of the whole animal."" Garner adds: ""Food was never wasted. Everything was used up and waste was considered terrible because people had grown used to having so little during the war."" They were creative with cooking leftovers and making sure every single thing was eaten too - a huge leap from where we are today, when you consider that research by the Hubbub Foundation and Knorr estimates that in the UK, eight million pumpkins will have been thrown away last week. And then there is transport. ""We walked to school and if your family had the luxury of a car, you'd still only use it when necessary,"" mum says. ""Your grandma would do her shopping on foot and only buy what she could carry."" ""And if you were lucky enough to go on holiday, it would be much closer to home,"" Garner adds. ""If it rained on holiday,"" my mum says, ""you'd still enjoy yourself."" Obviously our cultures and expectations with regards to travel have changed a lot since those days, particularly with the advent of low-cost airlines, and it has become much more common for people to live in different countries or regions to where they were born. But making domestic holidays cool again would certainly help. It feels important to mention here that not all of the habit changes since those days are negative. As Gower points out: ""In those days, it was common for people to burn their waste in a bonfire at the end of their garden, and you'd often see big billowy black clouds floating up into the air, as well as big fossil-fuel burning factories."" Taylor also highlights how new packaging technology, particularly for food, has transformed food sanitation, which obviously ""carries with it a public health benefit"". Vehicles these days, though used more frequently, have also been the focus of much innovation, meaning they are more efficient and produce fewer emissions. And new technologies and solutions are being studied and implemented all the time to reduce these to HYPERLINK http://www.zero.No www.zero.No one is advocating for a unilateral return to the past - the steady march of progress has afforded rights to women, LGBTQ+, Bame and other marginalised groups that were non-existent then. Technology has brought with it efficiency gains, greater standards of living for more people and a better understanding of the human body and how to care for it, adding years to many people's lives, among other things. But there is a lot to be said for looking to the past for ideas when it comes to sustainable living. The recent decision of Sebastian Pinera, the president of Chile, to pull his country out of hosting the UN's annual environment conference, COP25 , demonstrates how quickly the climate emergency can be pushed down the priority list in favour of domestic politics. ""No matter what we do, there will still be costs to future generations from climate change,"" Taylor says. ""We can't mitigate all of the existing damage through adaptation, but we can prevent the situation worsening, which is why we need to start today."" In the absence of real leadership at a policy level, the role of the individual becomes more important in influencing change in a demand-led economy. Current trends towards sustainable living have fallen short of being inclusive. The narrative needs to change to one that promotes the economic benefits to individuals of moving towards a circular economy. And - in the face of such immediate threats to human and animal life, and biodiversity - why waste time innovating new methods when there are so many good ones we can reuse and recycle? ? We can't mitigate all the existing damage, but we can prevent the situation worsening ? Habits of yesteryear could have a positive impact on our health and the environment \"

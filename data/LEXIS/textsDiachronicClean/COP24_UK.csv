The government has committed at least \Â£35.8 billion of funding between 2016 and 2020 to help developing countries reduce emissions, and mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The UK will use our role leading on Climate Resilience at the 2019 UN Climate Summit to advance this work.FCO Minister Mark Field said:This year marks 10 years since Britain enacted the world's first comprehensive climate change law. It has been instrumental in our progress on climate change. Since then, we have decarbonised our economy faster than any other country in the G20, and we are leading the way in the shift from coal to renewable energy. But the reality is that we all need to do more.COP24 has brought us together across government, civil society and business boundaries, to build on the Paris Agreement 2015. It is vital parties make good on their commitment to finalise a set of rules that apply to all and will ensure continuous improvement in the fight against climate change.The conference will continue for another week, with Ministers from BEIS and DEFRA in attendance, as well as the Foreign Secretary's Special Representative on Climate Change. \l"

Kamia, who is a PhD researcher in climate change mitigation and adaptation in the power sector, presented her views last week at the United Nations in Katowice, Poland.'Developing countries like Indonesia face challenges to provide universal and reliable electricity access throughout the country', Kamia says. 'At the same time, they also pledge to reduce their carbon emissions under the Paris Agreement. On top of the vital electrification and climate change mitigation goals, the Indonesian power sector has already been affected by severe weather and changes in climate variables. Widespread power cuts due to severe weathers commonly occur in the country. Therefore, future development of the power sector in Indonesia should focus on both shifting to the low-carbon and also to the climate-resilient power grid.'Kamia took part in an expert session in the Indonesian Pavilion at the Conference of the Parties (COP), in a panel including Dutch climate envoy Marcel Beukeboom and various young experts, reflecting on the challenges for young professionals in tackling climate change. She has been an PhD candidate at the University of Twente since 2016, her research is funded by the Indonesian Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP).

These new rules will help ""create a stronger foundation for countries to implement the historic accord,"" said Ceres CEO and President Mindy Lubber.Investors and businesses will benefit from the new rules as they will ""improve transparency and allow for consistent reporting and monitoring for greenhouse gas emissions reductions, enabling stepped-up climate ambition"" she added.Lubber said:The urgency to tackle the world's greatest sustainability and climate challenges has never been greater. That urgency was on full display at COP 24, especially on the heels of a sobering report from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that called for dramatically increasing the pace and scale of greenhouse gas emission reductions.The investor and business community is acutely aware of the economic imperative of climate action. That's why a record number of investors -- 415 investors with $ 32 trillion in assets under management -- called on governments last week to not only scale up ambition to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, but to also put a price on carbon and phase out thermal coal power.And, at the U.S. Climate Action Center at COP24, We Are Still In leaders highlighted the 500 companies that have already committed to science-based targets to reduce emissions, and the hundreds of other companies that have already committed to power their operations with 100 percent renewable energy.It is clear that the transition to a low-carbon economy is well underway and momentum is building. But, we know there is much more work to be done, and government and private sector leaders will need to step up climate action by 2020 in order to achieve the Paris Agreement's goals of limiting warming to well below 2-degrees Celsius and pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5-degrees CelsiusCeres and its network members are more committed than ever before to ensuring that the U.S. is on track to meet and ratchet up the ambition of its goals under the Paris Agreement.

The European Commission welcomed the outcome but Green MEPs and NGOs said COP24 had ""failed to deliver."" The completion of the ""rulebook"" designed to enforce the Paris Agreement on climate change was the EU's top objective in the negotiations, which ran a day over time. RELATED CONTENT COP24: The EU's moment of truth Bas Eickhout: Man on eMission EU needs 'paradigm shift' in climate policy to reach Paris agreement goals Concerns raised over COP24 chances of success The Commission says that the rulebook will enable the parties to the Paris Agreement to ""implement, track and progressively enhance"" their contributions to tackling climate change. The meeting, which ended after two weeks of negotiations, saw delegates agree on the first ever universal system for parties to track and report progress in climate action, which provides flexibility to those countries that genuinely need it. This, said the Commission, will ""inspire all to improve their practices over time and communicate the progress made in clear and comparable terms."" Reacting to the outcome of the climate summit on Monday, EU commissioner for climate action and energy Miguel Arias Ca\'f1ete said: ""In Europe, and working united as Europeans, we have reached a balanced deal on the rules to turn the Paris Agreement into action."" ""We have responded to the urgency of science by acknowledging positively the IPCC special report on global warming of 1.5\'b0C"" Miguel Arias Ca\'f1ete, European Commissioner ""The EU played an instrumental role in reaching this outcome, working with allies from both developed and developing countries and with major economies - in particular China - to raise ambition and strengthen global efforts to fight climate change. We have responded to the urgency of science by acknowledging positively the IPCC special report on global warming of 1.5\'b0C."" ""This was a key ask for the EU and its allies. The Paris rulebook is fundamental for enabling and encouraging climate action at all levels worldwide - and success here also means success for multilateralism and the rules-based global order."" ""The EU will continue to lead by turning our commitments into concrete action in the transition to a climate-neutral future and inspiring other countries to make this necessary transition,"" Ca\'f1ete added. ""BIG DISAPPOINTMENT"" Not all reactions to the conference outcome were as positive, however. Dutch MEP Bas Eickhout, Greens/EFA representative to the European Parliament delegation in Katowice and leading candidate of the European Greens for the next European elections, said that the COP24 conference was meant to agree on how to keep global warming well below 2\'b0C, preferably 1.5\'b0C, but that governments ""did not deliver."" ""This COP was a big disappointment. It showed that there is a major gap between the expectations of citizens and the analysis of scientists on one hand and the decisions of governments on the other hand."" ""In Katowice, only technical progress was made but the thousands of people on the street don't demonstrate for a rulebook. They want ambitious climate protection. The governments disregarded citizens and scientists, who showed in the recent IPCC report that more ambitious action is urgently needed to keep global warming well below 2\'b0C."" ""In Katowice, only technical progress was made but the thousands of people on the street don't demonstrate for a rulebook. They want ambitious climate protection"" Bas Eickhout MEP Further reaction came from Yannick Jadot, climate spokesperson of the Greens/EFA group, who said, ""Member states have a major responsibility for the weak COP24 outcome. After the dropout of the United States, the EU was the only party that could have brought the climate talks forward. But European governments didn't show any leadership on more ambition."" ""The EU can't hide anymore behind a vague long-term strategy, if we want [to reach] the global climate targets. To put pressure on the other governments, the EU needs to come to the UN General Assembly in September with a clear commitment to reduce emissions by 55 percent in 2030."" ONE STEP FORWARD FOR BUSINESSES Elsewhere, BusinessEurope director general Markus J. Beyrer said, ""After years of negotiations, it is positive to see that the Paris Rulebook has been agreed upon. Throughout the two weeks, the COP24 presidency has worked hard and the EU was mobilised to promote a set of strong monitoring, verification and accounting rules."" ""We were expecting even more guarantees that all major economies will apply the same rules, but the end result brings us one step forward. That is important to acknowledge."" ""These common rules are key for European businesses because many of them compete on a global stage. These rules are crucial to give clarity and guarantees to companies to enhance their business activities and investments in zero- and low-emissions solutions."" ""The weak outcome of this COP runs contrary to stark warnings of the IPCC report and growing demand for action from citizens"" Wendel Trio, Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe But Beyrer warned, ""Much more work will be required to create the conditions for a collective effort to enhance global emissions reduction. All major economies will need to deliver on this ambitious agenda. The European business community stands ready to work with policymakers."" Wendel Trio, director of Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe, said: ""The weak outcome of this COP runs contrary to stark warnings of the IPCC report and growing demand for action from citizens."" ""Governments have again delayed adequate action to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown. The EU needs to push ahead and lead by example, by providing more support to poor countries and increasing its climate pledge before the UN secretary general summit in September 2019.""

It is not only the environment that is at stake, but health, nutrition, trade, jobs and the economy. Agriculture and consumer choices are major factors driving disastrous climate change. We need a robust and ambitious policy response to address the climate impacts of agriculture and consumer choices \- and scientists have a major role to play. Our new report is a wake-up call to leaders Agriculture, forestry and land-use change alone makes up around 20 to 25% of global annual emissions, not including food transport, meaning the environmental impact of the global food system is significant. The report warns that limiting agriculture\' s greenhouse gas emissions alone will not be enough to address food systems\' impact on climate change, and instead leaders should look to science to drive innovation and inform policy.The issue of nutrition As well as the issue of climate change, the report also found that the global food system is failing to deliver basic nutrition to many people. Although food consumption continues to rise in the developed world, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization found that the number of undernourished people increased between 2016 and 2017.Many more people suffer from micronutrient deficiency and from the disorders associated with being overweight or obese as high-calorie diets have become cheaper.The food security status has worsened in particular in parts of Africa, South-East Asia and Western Asia, most notably in situations of conflict and in combination with droughts or floods.What kinds of changes need to be made to the global food industry?It is clear that changes to the global food industry must be made to ensure global access to nutritious, affordable and environmentally sustainable food. Climate-smart food systems may be one way to do this.It is important that more is done to incentivise people to improve their diets from both a public health and environmental perspective. The report recommends that policymakers help consumers understand the environmental implications of food choices and food waste.Balancing a need to improve access to nutritionally balanced food, whilst acknowledging the environmental impacts of expanding agricultural production, is one that is not easily solved. As a result, the IAP recommends that more should be done to encourage changes to dietary consumption habits, such as a reduction in meat consumption.Innovative foods, such as meat\- mushroom mixes, lab-grown meat, algae, and insect-based foods, are another way to incorporate foods that are both eco-friendly and nutritionally balanced.The IAP recommends creating an international advisory panel on food and nutrition security and agriculture, including participation by academies, to implement these chances and strengthen international governance mechanisms related to the global food industry.\l"

This means that 2\'b0C warming could have disastrous consequences, making the Paris goal to stay ""well below"" 2\'b0C an imperative rather than an objective.

The Pan-African Parliament (PAP) and the African Risk Capacity (ARC) co-organized the day.Africa Day 2018 focused on how to ensure that all development partners deepen their partnerships and commitments to deliver concrete actions and resources for African countries to deliver their NDC targets and enable the imlpementation of the Paris Agreement.Highlights of the event included a high-level statement by Gabon's Minister of Foreign affairs, Regis Immongault, on behalf of President Ali Bongo Ondimba, Coordinator of the Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC). Josefa Sacko, African Union Commissioner for Rural Economy and Agriculture represented the chair Person of the African Union commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat.A high level Ministerial panel and a Parliamentary dialogue provided a platform for detailed discussions on this year's theme and Africa's position at COP24. The last segment of the Africa Day was an expert panel discussion from various technical institutions on the theme of the day.Foreign Minister Immongault noted that the outcomes of COP 24 should facilitate development in Africa. He emphasised the need to develop strong partnerships to implement the NDCs in Africa. 'I also extend appreciation to the Africa NDC Hub for reaching out to Partners to support Africa. In this regard, I wish to urge more Partners to come on board to support African countries in the implementation of the NDCs for the achievement of Africa's commitment to the Paris Agreement,' he added.Africa Union Commissioner Sacko stated that African countries remain committed to tackling climate change and its impacts. 'Countries in Africa continue to suffer from the adverse impacts of climate change with the costs of climate change threatening the realization of the aspirations of Agenda 2063 the Africa we want. Climate change is also partially to blame for increased migration of African youths to Europe through the deadly Mediterranean Sea due to shrinking livelihood opportunities'. She further highlighted the link between climate change and conflicts in Africa as demonstrated by the Boko Haram' insurgency in Western and Central Africa partly as a result of the shrinking of Lake Chad.'As Parliamentarians we carry the hopes, aspirations and concerns of the peoples of Africa. The Africa Day accords us an opportunty to emphasize the need for parties to adopt concrete actions towards effective and adequate implementation of the Paris Agreement, especially in the context of the African Climate Legislation Initiative (ACLI),' said Kone Dognon, Chairperson of the Pan-African Parliament Committee for Rural Economy, Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment.Anthony Nyong, Director of Climate Change and Green Growth, representing the President of the African Development Bank Group said, 'African countries require significant resources to meet their commitments to the Paris Agreement.. The Africa NDC Hub hosted at the African Development Bank, represents a concerted effort by development partner institutions to leverage each other's comparative advantage in mobilizing resources necessary for Africa to embark on a low-carbon and climate-resilient development pathway.'In a statement read on her behalf by James Murombedzi, the Officer in Charge of the African Climate Policy Centre and Executive Secretary of UNECA, Vera Songwe said: 'The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa is implementing organizational reforms which will deepen engagement with the public and private sectors and ensure that public policy provides incentives for the private sector to contribute to the implementation of the NDCs and to take advantage of the investment opportunities offered by the transition to carbon neutral development pathways.'African Heads of State and Government instituted Africa Day during COP17 in Durban.#AfricaCOP24Contacts:African Development Bank (AfDB)Faiza Ghozali, Principal Communication Officer, Communication and External relations Department - T. +225 20 26 19 34 / HYPERLINK mailto:f.ghozali@afdb.orgf.ghozali@afdb.orgSonia Borrini, Communication and Knowledge Management Specialist, Climate Change and Green Growth Department, - T. +225 2026 5562 / HYPERLINK ; Websites: HYPERLINK http://www.afdb.orgwww.afdb.org or \~ HYPERLINK http://www.cop24afdb.orgwww.cop24afdb.orgAfrican Union Commission (AUC)Molalet Tsedeke, Media and Communication Liaison, Directorate of Information and Communication - C. +251 911 630 631 / HYPERLINK mailto:molalett@africa-union.orgmolalett@africa-union.org HYPERLINK http://www.au.intwww.au.intNEPADTeko Nhlapho, Communication Advocacy Officer - HYPERLINK mailto:tekoh@nepad.orgtekoh@nepad.org ; Website: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.nepad.orgwww.nepad.orgUnited Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) Charles Muraya, Information Management Officer, African Climate Policy Center - HYPERLINK mailto:murayac@un.orgmurayac@un.org; Website: \~ HYPERLINK http://www.uneca.orgwww.uneca.org[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to HYPERLINK mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uknewswire@enpublishing.co.uk\l"
"COP24","UK","COP24_UK19","-AfDB-Paris Agreement takes center stage as climate negotiations - COP24 - open in Poland","December 4, 2018 Tuesday","ENP Newswire","The core business of climate negotiations officially opened today, Monday 3 December, in the heart of the Silesia region of southern Poland.At the Katowice Conference Centre, more than 20,000 people all over the world are expected to gather to push for effective climate dealSymbolically, the climate summit was officially launched on 2 December by Frank Bainimarama, former Prime Minister of Fiji and Chair of COP23, MichalKurtyka, Secretary of State in the Polish Ministry of Energy and Chair-Designate of COP24, and Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).There is a remarkable level of expectation at COP24. Stakeholders expect this year's climate talks to rekindle the momentum around climate finance and commitment to limit global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees.It is a case, no less, of agreeing on the ways and means to give the Paris Agreement real force (interview with SeyniNafo here), so that the commitments made do not remain a forlorn hope.The day started with the 'high-level segment' attended by Heads of State and Government as well as plenary sessionsIf this COP resonates less with the general public than, for example, COP21 in Paris, which led to the historic signing of the Paris Agreement, this is because it is much more technical, or even technocratic.And this is why it is so crucial.Developed countries have pledged to increase climate finaning for developing countries to $ 100 billion by 2020. Developing countries, including the 54 African countries, are expecting clearer commitments on this financing promise from the advanced countries.And yet, only about 30 Heads of State and Government, essentially from Africa, the European Union and Small Island States made the journey to Katowice for the opening of COP24.The presidents of Nigeria, Benin, Senegal, Botswana, Mauritania and Congo, for example, are present in this climate talks. On the other hand, none of the leaders of the G20 member states, who are responsible for 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions, seem to have listed Katowice as a priority on its diplomatic agendaGeneral feeling of climate emergencyIn early October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published an alarming report, which reveals that at the current rate of warming, the 1.5 C threshold will be breached between 2030 and 2052.In mid-November, a study published in Nature Climate Change modelled the extreme concurrent disasters to which humanity will be exposed by 2100, if we fail to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.On the eve of the opening of COP24, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reiterated that'if current trends in the concentration of greenhouse gases continue, the average surface temperature of the globe is set to increase by 3 to 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the twenty-first century'.Such scenarios do not bode well for Africa, which is bearing thebrunt of the effects of climate change. In other words, Africa needs to unite all its advocacy efforts and strength to fight climate change and counter its effects.Africa Day: African momentum intensies around action against climateThe first day of COP24 marks the holding of Africa Day, a joint initiative of the African Development Bank (AfDB), The African Union Commission (AUC), the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) and the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). This year's Africa Day theme is: 'The Africa NDC Hub: Going further and faster with NDC implementation in support of Agenda 2063'.Currently about 90% of African countries - 49 out of 54 - have ratified their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). This affirms the continent's awareness and increasing commitment to the fight against climate change.The urgency of climate risk, particularly to Africa's transformation, points to another urgent matter: taking action and quickly. This is fundamental to building an Africa that is resilient, green and prosperous.ContactsFaiza Ghozali HYPERLINK mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uknewswire@enpublishing.co.uk\l"

"COP24","UK","COP24_UK21","COP24: It's Time for a New Climate Compromise","December 20, 2018 Thursday 6:30 AM EST","Fair Observer","If COP24 and its successors want to create lasting impact, rational thought and realistic appraisals of global conditions must prevail over ideological fervor.Even though the outcomes of the UN Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland, are to be celebrated as a step in the right direction despite all odds, a somewhat bitter aftertaste remains. In the wake of news that our species has merely 12 years to pull the ship around by making swift changes to global energy infrastructure, it was clear that something had to be done. This year's COP24 talks resulted in huge fossil fuel divestments, yet the uncomfortable truth is that fighting climate change can only progress with them. It is impossible to abandon fossil fuels overnight, so a more realistic and humane approach to reducing carbon emissions has to be found.It was a difficult task from the outset. The reporting of the international and domestic media on the horrors of climate change and the use of coal has effectively stifled debate and the ability to formulate clear thinking on the subject. The 2015 Paris Climate Agreement in its current form has become untouchable, notwithstanding that its goals were highly Western-centric and near impossible to implement on a global scale. Pundits now cheer that COP24 represents a common move of institutions to cut ties to fossil fuel producers - ""this most destructive of industries."" But things never are that simple.In order for the Paris goals to be met, global emissions from power plants, factories, transport and deforestation would have to be eliminated entirely in short order. Ironically, not only is this ignorant of the realities on the ground, but, more damningly, it completely misses the point: Developing countries rely on coal and other cheap resources for economic growth, electricity and poverty alleviation. Still, activists and the media chose to focus on the political game rather than the actual situation, thereby exposing their immaturity when it comes to dealing with pressing issues like climate change.A case in point is the vicious reaction to US President Donald Trump's announcement to pull out of the agreement and his ongoing support for the continued use of coal through the promotion of high efficiency, low emissions (HELE) solutions. Even if it is hard to accept, the weight of evidence in concerned countries suggests that favoring technology conducive to reducing the carbon-intensity of fossil fuels is a viable compromise. Which is why the push for HELE is so important. The US hosted a forum at COP24 to advocate use of this tech and to promote the Clean and Advanced Fossil Fuel Alliance. Originally presented after last year's climate conference in Bonn, Germany, the alliance is exploring the benefits of more efficient fossil fuel technologies, as well as those - such as carbon capture and storage (CCS)- that have a part to play in reducing emissions in the long term.Unlike the conventional approach that seeks to cut out all fossil fuels no matter the cost, this initiative sticks out because it takes into account the needs of developing countries. One billion people, mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, live without electricity. It's a problem that adversely impacts development indicators such as health, education, food security and poverty reduction. Furthermore, electrifying the poorest countries and thus improving living conditions is, notably, the primary objective of the UN Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7).It's a cruel irony then that the same people who agreed on the SDG7 are also those who now undermine their own good intentions by denying developing countries access to the one energy resource that can bring about these changes. In a move dripping with hypocrisy, global institutions like the World Bank have stopped coal financing, thereby denying access to affordable electricity for millions - a dynamic this COP has only reinforced.The accusation of hypocrisy weighs even heavier considering that African leaders directly confronted World Bank President Jim Yong-kim in October, lamenting how the West is outraged about climate change but strangles African countries out of using fossil fuels. Their outrage is even more understandable since very little has actually been achieved by those who demand radical action and brand themselves as climate saviors. Far from raising the billions promised to help poor nations fight climate change, rich countries have continually failed to mobilize the $100 billion a year promised by 2020 to developing states for climate finance. Instead of the money, developing countries only get self-righteous finger-wagging and preachy talks for insisting on using cheap energy sources. But rich countries are willfully ignoring that without funds to finance emission-mitigating technologies like HELE, developing nation's CO2 emissions will only keep rising.While it may be hard for us to understand in the plentiful West, in countries like Indonesia, energy production - not climate change - is the most pressing concern. The government seeks to build more than 100 coal-fired power plants, and projections suggest that within 10 years, energy will be the largest contributor to Indonesian emissions. And it's not an isolated case: Across Asia, hundreds of gigawatts of new coal-fired power generation is under construction, showing that the growing appetite for coal is unlikely to diminish any time soon.Developing nations are rightly indignant that Western powers who are responsible for most of the carbon emissions to date - and who are failing on their own climate pledges - are lecturing them on cutting fossil fuel use. Instead of berating the lack of progress in fighting climate change, it would be best to accept that impact could be mitigated without compromising on economic prosperity. More efficient HELE and CSS technologies are the way to go. If COP24 and its successors want to create lasting impact, rational thought and realistic appraisals of global conditions must prevail over myopic ideological fervor.\l"
"COP24","UK","COP24_UK22","Slow progress at COP24 as nations struggle to agree on key climate report","December 13, 2018 Thursday 3:30 PM GMT","MarketLine NewsWire (Formerly Datamonitor)","At the end of the first week, climate talks have been stalled by a lingering debate over whether the conference and parties should ""welcome"" or ""note"" a key report from the IPCC. The IPCC's report on global warming, released in October, warned the world would have to cut greenhouses gas (GHG) emission by about 45% by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5oC. \'c2\~The report said the world is currently far off the track, and is likely to head towards a temperature rise to 3oC this century, potentially leading floods, droughts and extreme heat to increasingly threaten people's safety and livelihoods.Reducing CO2 emissions is vital; the United Nations Environment Programme suggests that the voluntary national contributions agreed during the Paris summit need to be tripled if the world is to limit the global warming below 2oC.First Half of the UN Climate Summit A Diplomatic StandoffThe first week's discussions and talks ended on a sour note when the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait 'noted' the key findings of the study on global warming by IPCC rather than 'welcoming' them. Several participants, observers and campaigners described the effort of these four major oil and gas producers as myopically short-sighted and self-serving.Saudi Arabia had wrestled until the last minute during October's IPCC meeting in South Korea to limit the conclusions of the document. They eventually gave in, but it now seems that they had waited to raise their objections again in Poland.Most of the participating countries spoke out in fierce opposition to the oil allies' block. Maldives, leader of the alliance of small island states, pushed to adopt the wording ""welcome"", which was supported by the European Union, a block of the 47 least developed nations, the independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean, African, American and European nations, and Pacific countries such as the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu.Australia's silence during the debate further raised tensions and was considered as a tacit support for the four oil and gas allies. According to the latest Australian government figures, released last month, carbon emissions continue to rise at a significantly higher rate. Australia's emissions, seasonally adjusted, increased 1.3% over the past quarter.Poland's determination to continue to provide financial assistance to coal power plants beyond 2030 has dented attempts to reform Europe's electricity market. The country is the largest coal producer in the EU; it sources around 60% of the country's overall energy demand from coal and has shown little intent to cut carbon emissions to fight global warming.Another hurdle to the success of COP 24 is a lack of commitment by developed countries towards their financial obligations. Under the Paris Agreement (COP 21), these countries have committed to provide $100 billion by 2020 and thereafter $100 billion per year to finance the Green Climate Fund (GCF). At COP 24, the US and European Union have failed to discuss the process for setting a new collective goal on providing the funding to developing countries.Because of the political unwillingness of few major countries to fight climate change, the urgency to tackle global warming is at the verge of a failure. This is the second year in a row that the US government has tried to promote fossil fuels at a UN climate event.According to the Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) 2019, only a few countries have started working towards limiting global warming below 2oC. The Index shows that Sweden leads this ranking, followed by Morocco and Lithuania. On the other hand, the bottom five ranked countries are Saudi Arabia, the United States, Islamic Republic of Iran, Republic of Korea and Chinese Taipei, which have scored low or very low in almost all categories.Looking AheadAs participants close the week of technical talks on Saturday, almost all 200 countries present in Katowice wanted to ""welcome"" the IPCC report, making it the benchmark for future action.Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have always played the role of spoilers, however, though they could be ignored when alone. This year they have been joined by the US and Russia, making it even harder to obtain a global consensus. Many delegates are now hoping that ministers and bureaucrats, who will arrive for week two, will try and revive efforts to put this key report at the heart of the conference.In the coming week, more of practical discussions rather than conceptual proposals and reiteration of commitments need to happen. Additionally, backed by scientific evidence and the inadequacy of climate actions, decisions at COP 24 also require Parties to update their Nationally Determined Contributions by 2020 and provide greater clarity on their financial commitments towards restricting global warming.Global parties understand the dire need for an urgent, audacious and ambitious climate action plan to save this planet from global warming. The good thing is that we know what is required to decarbonise the global economy.\l"

To achieve this will require the construction of 1000 GWe of new nuclear capacity to work together with other low-carbon technologies.The future decarbonization of the electricity sector is central to tackling climate change: global electricity production accounts for 40% of total emissions and coal and gas still dominate generation, producing 63% of the world's electricity.Nuclear power is a low-carbon source of energy. The median lifecycle emissions from nuclear are 12g/kWh, similar to wind energy. Thanks to nuclear displacing fossil fuels, more than 60 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions have been avoided globally since 1970.Decarbonizing the electricity sector is a considerable challenge. Despite massive investments, renewable energies alone will not be enough to achieve the decarbonization required. A recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology shows that the cost of decarbonizing electricity is much lower when the mix includes substantial amounts of nuclear together with renewables.Abundant low-carbon electricity will not only be needed for today's uses of electricity. Greater use of clean electricity is the preferred tool for achieving deep decarbonization in other sectors, such as transport.There have been significant developments in 2018 that have highlighted the importance of nuclear energy as a major contributor to climate change mitigation.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's latest report, detailing what would be needed to limit global warming to 1.5oC above pre-industrial levels, notes that the 'scalability and speed of scaling of nuclear plants have been high in many nations' - highlighting the case of France, which successfully decarbonised much of its electricity mix in under 20 years by establishing a generation mix predominantly supplied by nuclear power.Global nuclear generation exceeded 2500 TWh for the first time in five years in 2017, with nuclear supplying 10.5% of the world's electricity needs.Nine nuclear reactors with a total capacity of 10.4GWe have started up so far this year, the highest amount since 1990. Next year 14 reactors with a total capacity of nearly 15 GWe are due to start operations.Poland, COP24's host nation, announced in its draft energy strategy, published on 22 November, that it expects its first nuclear power plant to be running by 2033, with nuclear capacity growing to 6-9 GWe by 2043. The Polish Energy minister Krzysztof Tchorzewski said 'The nuclear power plant will help us accelerate carbon emissions reductions.'These developments are vital to achieving the nuclear industry's Harmony goal. But to accelerate this progress will require governments to bring about policy change to allow nuclear energy to make its full contribution. Only by decarbonizing electricity generation, with nuclear energy playing a major role, can we deliver on the Paris agreement commitments.Notes To EditorsWorld Nuclear Association is the international organisation that represents the global nuclear industry. Its mission is to promote a wider understanding of nuclear energy among key international influencers by producing authoritative information, developing common industry positions, and contributing to the energy debate, as well as to pave the way for expanding nuclear business.The NICE Future side event on 'Clean, Reliable Energy: Accelerating Emissions Reductions and Energy Security through Innovative Technology and uses of Advanced Nuclear Energy' will take place during COP24 on December 6, 10:00-11:30 CET, Lubelskie Climate Room 3.Contact:Jonathan CobbTel: +44 20 7451 1536Email: HYPERLINK press@world-nuclear.org[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to HYPERLINK mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uknewswire@enpublishing.co.uk\l"

Serving as a risk cushion, this investment helped the fund to attract further private investors, thus enhancing its outreach and impact.This operation was first committed at a ceremony held during COP 23, the 2017 UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany. Since then, GGF's outstanding portfolio in the MENA region has grown stronger to over EUR 110 million spread across 14 partner institutions and has generated cumulative sub-loans of over EUR 60 million.

PAUL - From Post-it Notes to the connected roads of the future, tens of thousands of products made by global company 3M are moving toward becoming even more sustainable.Today, at the United National Climate Change Conference (COP24), 3M is building on its legacy of Sustainability leadership and announcing its first formal requirement that a Sustainability Value Commitment will be included in all new products introduced beginning in 2019.'Sustainability is at the core of 3M-but we're looking to do more,' said John Banovetz, Chief Technology Officer, 3M. 'Today at COP24 we are proud to formalize our commitment to this next step in innovating for a sustainable future.'The impact of 3M's new product requirement is global in scale: 3M launches approximately 1,000 new products each year, with roughly one-third of its revenue generated from products released in the past five years. Beyond 3M's own operations, a primary reason for the goal is to help customers achieve their Sustainability goals. This new product goal creates even more opportunities to collaborate with customers on solutions that improve lives around the world.Examples of 3M's Sustainability Value Commitment for new products include reusability, recyclability, energy, waste, water savings, responsible sourcing, and/or renewable materials appropriate to the specific product, from the beginning to the end of each product's lifecycle. This commitment also includes products with a core purpose of helping to solve an environmental or social challenge, such as improving air quality, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving worker and patient safety in healthcare and industrial settings. 3M will measure progress and impact of this commitment and report on it annually.3M invests approximately 6 percent of revenue into research and development, much of it for creating new products. The new requirement will take effect in 2019 and will apply to all five of 3M's business groups: Health Care, Consumer, Electronics Energy, Industrial and Safety Graphics.'As a large and diverse global science company with customers spanning many industries and global markets, we have the opportunity to make an even greater impact in Sustainability,' said Gayle Schueller, Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer, 3M. 'We've made such significant progress on the 2025 Sustainability goals we set in 2015 that we're raising the bar. The new product goal is an example of the aggressive targets we'll be setting in coming months as part our strategic focus on empowering science for Circular, Climate and Community.'3M has a long-standing commitment to Sustainability from the Pollution Prevention Pays program that began in 1975 to 3M's 2025 Sustainability goals that include water, climate, and energy targets. 3M has long been a recognized leader in Sustainability and has been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for 19 consecutive years.Requiring Sustainability Value Commitments in all new products builds on 3M's history of creating products that emphasize reuse, recycling and reduced resource use for 3M's operations and for their customers. Those products range from energy-saving cooling immersion fluids for data centers and window and solar film, to lightweighting vehicles and shipping materials for fuel efficiency, to water and waste-reducing cleaning solutions.3M leaders will participate in events during the UN Climate Change Conference (COP24) in Katowice. 3M is holding a 'Business for the Global Good' event on Thursday, December 6 with Sustainability leaders from the public and private sector.About 3MAt 3M, we apply science in collaborative ways to improve lives daily.

Subsequently, , he was Chair of the African Climate Negotiators' Group (AGN) in 2016 and 2017, when he launched the landmark proposal for the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative. Still under the AGN, Ambassador Nafo continues to defend Africa's climate agenda, supporting all African Union initiatives and, most especially, those of the Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC).Below is an interview he gave from Katowice, Poland, which hosts COP24 from 3 to 14 December 2018.You chaired the AGN on Climate Change discussions at the United Nations, and this group has the support of the African Development Bank. What is the AGN, and how does the Bank support it?The AGN was formed with the Climate Convention (Ed. 1992) and represents the 54 African countries which negotiate from a common position within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The AGN is mobilized whenever there is a need to defend the interests of Africa in negotiations around the fight against climate change. Unlike the European Union, whose negotiating mandate on climate is vested in the European Commission, it is the AGN that negotiates on behalf of the African continent, directly mobilizing the 54 governments and their experts.The support of the African Development Bank comes into play on three levels: firstly, the Bank is a learning and knowledge. It has proven expertise in many areas, including climate change and in all the areas concerned: adaptation, mitigation, finance, water, agriculture, and so on. This give us a partnership and support in terms of advice. The Bank also has a number of initiatives to combat climate change, including the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI) Independent Delivery Unit (IDU). The Bank supports us financially, particularly valuable for research activities, and even offers the Group logistics support for its negotiators and experts to attend various meetings. Lastly, the Bank not only has considerable resources of its own, but also the capacity to mobilize resources and partnerships essential for accelerating the pace of specific urgent initiatives. It is also accredited to the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which, at the October 2018 meeting of its Board, - where the Bank has three directors and three alternates - considered three of its projects, two related to renewable energy (Burkina Faso and DRC) and one related to adaptation in the Niger basin.The signing of the Paris Agreement at the close of COP21 in Paris was hailed as a great step forward and the role of the AGN in defending the interests of Africa was crucial during the preliminary negotiations. What is its role now?The climate negotiations are unique in that they are held in successive rounds. Between 2011 and 2015, or in other words, between COP17 in Durban and COP21 in Paris, a cycle of negotiations was held on a global treaty. These are highly political negotiations. COP22 in Marrakesh, where the Paris Agreement was ratified, witnessed the start of a more technical round. The countries of Africa committed themselves legally, as did the other countries. What now remains to be done in COP24 in Poland is to move onto the implementing decrees stage. To be more specific, we now need to establish the procedures, rules and terms for application of the Agreement. But, apart from the technical aspect, this COP's second 'big issue' is the matter of funding. The GCF's funding replenishment meeting will be held in October 2019. These resources were capitalized to the tune of US $ 10 billion at the Lima conference. We expect to raise as much this time.The role of the AGN has evolved. Since 2015, we have had an additional mandate, one that I would describe as an 'incubation mandate', that moves us onto a kind of AGN 2.0. Our mandate now is to help our member countries to mobilize resources and build their capacities in order to facilitate their tangible actions. This leads to the formulation of concrete initiatives such as the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI) and the Africa Adaptation Initiative (AAI). That's what we do!Three years on from ratification of the Paris Agreement, can Africa really be optimistic?Yes, for several reasons: it cannot be denied that awareness has been raised throughout Africa, with real consideration of the policy issues. In 2014, all we had was an annual meeting of African Heads of State on the subject, and the Committee of Heads of State and Government on Climate Change was the only body we had. Since 2015 there have been three or four meetings every year in Africa and we now have six initiatives covering all or specific parts of the continent,[1] each led by a Head of State. And then, we have never before been as well-structured operationally, the AGN working closely with member countries to speed up implementation on the ground.International politics is going through a difficult time, with gaps and weaknesses - you only have to look at the current position of the United States to see this. But the fact is that Africa has no choice. The last IPCC report demonstrates how the impacts of climate change affect every development sector: agriculture, industry, transport, urbanization, and more. Africa is not merely affected but, worse than that, if nothing is done, these impacts will continue to grow in strength, consequently threatening to wipe out everything that we have gained, all the progress made by African countries in terms of development in recent years. So, we need to firm up our actions and speed up implementation of dedicated initiatives.If there is consensus on the urgent need to act, funding continues to pose problems, especially in Africa. We still do expect the developed countries to keep their promises. Can you take action when the money is not there?The fact is, the current situation is making it difficult for the developed countries to keep to their commitments, especially that of achieving the mobilization of at least $ 100 billion per annum by 2020, promised way back in 2009 at COP15 in Copenhagen and confirmed in Paris at COP21. The task is made even more difficult by the fact that there was no prior agreement on the rules of accounting to be used within this framework to clarify funding. And it is specifically on the establishment of these common rules that AGN has been working within a multilateral framework at the UN, for COP24.Despite this situation, African countries are working on the development of their own strategies to mobilize resources, in order to make the most not only of international opportunities, but also of those available on the continent. The drying -up of aid and concessional finance is a reality, hence the need to maximize every opportunity. Never has there been so much funding (mostly private) available worldwide; everyone agrees that there are very significant amounts of capital, even in Africa. The first Africa Investment Forum, held by the Bank in South Africa in early November is the most striking example of this: we cannot simply hold out our hands and wait for the funding to come to us. The funds exist; what we have to do is ensure we have the means and capacity to mobilize them. But a huge amount of work remains to be done on this, in terms of financial engineering and intermediation and of improving national and regional business climates in order to capture these resources. This task must involve every stakeholder on the continent through a truly transformative partnership. Africa needs to trust in itself and pick up the pace. And it is probably therein that the ultimate challenge for the African Negotiators' Group, AGN 3.0, lies.[1] African Adaptation Initiative (AAI); Initiative for the Adaptation of African Agriculture to Climate Change (AAA); Climate Commission for the Sahel; Climate Commission for Insular States and the Oceanic Economy; Africa Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI).[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uknewswire@enpublishing.co.uk\l"

Hence, it is of the opinion that the capacity mechanism will ensure long term electricity supply and will be a cost effective way to ensure stable power supply.Supporting coalThe auction ended in the fifth round with a closing price at PLN240.32/kW/year (EUR55/kW/year). This price is around six times more than that of the recently completed UK auctions which was cleared at a record low price of EUR9.43/kW securing 50.4GW of capacity for delivery in 2021-22. The contracts in Poland are being offered for up to 15 years starting from 2021.Industry experts believe that the taxpayers' money is being used to provide additional profit for utilities, which provide uneconomical, inefficient and heavily polluting power. In a way, the Polish government is subsidising coal-based power capacity in the country. The subsidies are a source of additional profit for the utilities on top of their regular revenues from the actual supply of electricity. The country's Energy Ministry had recently issued a statement in favour of coal-based generation.Under the capacity mechanism, 3.6GW of coal plants will receive subsidies, some till 2035. These include four new units currently under construction and an additional unit that has been operational for a year now. The cost for subsidising these is estimated at EUR3 billion which is equivalent to half the construction cost of these plants.Renewable energy: the new kid of the blockEarlier this month, Poland had held mixed energy auctions for wind and solar projects greater than 1 MW. A total of 31 wind projects were awarded, with a capacity of nearly 1 GW which would generate 41.996 TWh over 15 years. The prices ranged between $41.98/MWh to $57.73/MWh, with average price being $52.19/MWh. The auction was dominated by wind power while solar power became noncompetitive at the prices were realised. These low prices mean that the government can award another 850 MW of capacity with the savings in budget.In a recent article, the Energy Minister of Poland has also emphasised on the use of nuclear energy for the country to attain a stable supply of electricity. The article talks about the challenges faced in using renewable energy, such as intermittency and inability to store the energy. In the summer months of 2018, the country witnessed an extreme heat wave, which led to record electricity demand. The lack of wind led to very low generation from wind power plants. In July, wind farms provided just 4% of the energy consumed; and for a number of days it contributed nothing. The usage of all the installed wind power capacity was just 14% on an average during this time.So, the use of nuclear power is strongly advocated as it is considered as a stable and safe source of power. The Ministry has prepared an amendment to the Polish Nuclear Energy Programme, which will be submitted to the Council of Ministers by the end of 2018.The EU has been the key advocate of climate change mitigation policies and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the upcoming COP24, it will be interesting to see how the EU leaders will influence the subsidisation of coal-based power. This will be a major platform for the EU to take its stand on Poland capacity mechanism and take it clean energy transition forward.\l"

We need the right enabling environment to attract investment at scale. We've developed a programme with McKinsey to provide governments with legal, technical and financial support to allow this to happen.'Panel speakers called for innovative approaches to attract and steer financial ?ows consistent towards low-carbon and climate-resilient development to achieve the NDCs that Africa has set out.Statistics have it that Africa offers the highest returns compared to most emerging market economies. For the last two decades, the continent has seen steady economic growth underpinned by commodity exports, growing market demand, and strengthened structural elements.Between 2011 and 2015, and as part of its previous Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP), the African Development Bank mobilized approximately US$ 12 billion of climate finance to support climate-resilient and low-carbon development in Africa. Nonetheless, Africa has not succeeded as much as other regions of the world in mobilizing the funding needed to implement climate-smart initiatives.With new Green Climate Fund (GCF) finance now available to be channeled through the Bank, African countries will have additional resources to access.David Jackson, Director of Local Development Finance at UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), said: 'Adaptation is going to be a very expensive process; it's also a localized process. It can only be done by those responsible for land-use planning, agriculture, water management, transport etc.'Jackson emphasized the need to encourage access at a local level and to set up national platforms for adaptation, which bring together national and local governments.'Experts emphasized how programming adaptation efforts presents a unique challenge given the evolving nature of climate risks, associated uncertainties, and existing implementation issues.Gareth Phillips, Chief Climate Change and Green Officer at the African Development Bank, said: 'Strengthening the capacities of national and subnational bodies to access, manage, and channel finance and collectively work together is critical to making adaptation happen at the speed and scale we need. At the same time, we have to do better at engaging national and sub-national stakeholders in the decision-making process. Unlocking finance is critical to achieving the African NDCs.'The African Development Bank is working closely with international climate funds as well as other partners to scale up climate finance on the African continent and to strengthen institutions to directly access climate funds.In the words of Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank: 'Africa's financial actors need to work together creatively to mobilize global financial resources at a scale that can support local innovation, and that drives climate-resilient and low-carbon development on the continent. Having been short-changed by climate change, Africa must not be short-changed by climate finance.'The Bank's climate spending will increase to 40% of its total new investments by 2020 compared to 26% on average from 2011 to 2014.[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uknewswire@enpublishing.co.uk\l"

Cop24 summit ; Fossil fuels are dominant in Polish city hosting talks aimed at implementing Paris acc....","December 1, 2018 Saturday","Financial Times (London, England)","As international delegates converge on Katowice in the heart of Poland's coal country for the most significant climate talks for three years, the host city gives those battling global warming cause for hope and despair in equal measures.The smog from local heavy industry that often hangs over Katowice, in southern Poland, is a reminder of the wider challenge of the transition from coal to renewable sources amid insurgent populist forces often sceptical about the need to curb greenhouse gas emissions.The city has made strides to diversify its economy away from fossil fuels as mines have closed down, while also cultivating the amount of urban green spaces. The conference centre that will host tens of thousands of delegates for the Cop24 summit that begins on Monday was built on the site of a former mine. A state-owned coal company is one of the official sponsors of the talks.""Everything here is connected with mining. My father was a miner, my grandfather was a miner, my greatgrandfather was a miner,"" said Marek Jozwiak, who also worked in a local mine until it closed two years ago.Poland remains heavily dependent on coal, the source of 80 per cent of its energy. The ruling Law and Justice party aims to cut this to about a third by 2040 but Poland is also one of the few European nations that continues to build new coal-fired power plants.Katowice ""is a microcosm of everything that's happening in the world"", said Christiana Figueres, a former head of the UN climate secretariat and one of the architects of the 2015 Paris accord.""It is interesting to have [Cop24] in precisely an area that denotes that very difficult and complex transition"" from coal to renewables, she said. ""What do we do with these people that still depend on that industry?"" The main task of the two-week Cop24 summit will be to thrash out a deal on how to implement the Paris accord, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2C. The main sticking points will be agreeing on a rule book for the deal, and arguments over the $100bn in annual funding that rich nations promised poor countries.Michal Kurtyka, the Polish environment secretary who will preside over the summit, said reaching a deal would be challenging. Crumbling global unity had made the likelihood of a deal more difficult, with the US planning to withdraw from the Paris agreement. Brazil's decision this week to renege on its plan to host the climate talks next year only added to the difficulties.""There is a general will to get an agreement in Katowice, but it's not done,"" Mr Kurtyka told the Financial Times.An important theme for the Polish hosts will be how to design a ""just transition"" away from fossil fuels, which could involve more investment in training and financial support for people who are negatively affected. Poland also plans to focus on the role that technologies, such as electric vehicles, can play in reducing emissions, as well as on how forests can be used to soak up carbon dioxide.But pro-coal voices will also be in attendance in Katowice. The US is hosting a coal event on December 10, with President Donald Trump expected to deliver a video address.While the 190 signatories to the Paris accord pledged to limit global warming to below 2C and pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5C, the language was left murky. Yet, a recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that coal would have be cut out almost completely by 2050 to meet the 1.5C target.Environmental groups say Poland's plans are not enough. ""The government talks about everything except the elephant in the room, which is coal,"" said Marek Jozefiak from Greenpeace.Mr Kurtyka acknowledged the country had further to go, but said Katowice's experience showed what was possible. ""The city itself is a symbol of transformation,"" he said.""I think it will be an occasion to show that it is possible to change.""'Everything here is connected with mining. It gave people work and a high standard of living' \l"

"COP24","UK","COP24_UK48","This climate strike is a stark warning to neglectful MPs","February 16, 2019 Saturday","The Independent - Daily Edition","Climate change poses a serious threat to global prosperity, security and wellbeing. Leading climate scientists have recently warned that unless we act now, we have just 12 years before global warming risks drought, floods and extreme heat. Despite these stark warnings, the climate crisis is being almost entirely ignored by the Conservative government.Of course, Brexit is one major reason why every other issue is being pushed to the side. Gone are the days of David Cameron's forays into the Arctic with huskies. The Tories are frankly as environmentally friendly as a dustbin fire. It is therefore no surprise to me that tens of thousands of students will walk out of lessons to raise awareness of the climate crisis, including in my Oxfordshire constituency.Inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist, Greta Thunberg, who held a solo protest outside the Swedish parliament, this movement has now seen protests from 70,000 schoolchildren each week across 270 towns and cities worldwide.As a former teacher, I know how frustrating it must be to watch students walk out of class, particularly if they have important exams on the horizon. But, given the gravity and urgency of this issue, I support this strike, and the students, wholeheartedly.In fact, I think the strike is what we call in the profession a ""teachable moment"". OK, lessons may not go to plan, but if I was their teacher, I'd be using the strike to discuss the physics behind climate change (I was a science teacher), the benefits of activism, and why this issue is important to them. I would also, however, encourage the students to be responsible. That means being safe and ensuring they make up for the work they will be missing.At the end of the day, I trust the judgement of head teachers to decide if they should authorise the absences. However, I'm sure many heads will feel hamstrung by fears that they'll be taken to court, as rules around absences are currently being interpreted particularly strictly. I'm concerned that many will be forced to come down hard on students.This raises the wider point that head teachers should be given more discretion on whether to authorise pupil absences. I believe, as do the Liberal Democrats, that a system in which up to 10 days' absence within term time per year can be authorised with the support of the head teacher - I believe this system would resolve the current issue.That said, the message from these students in protest today is to demand better for our environment. When Liberal Democrats were in a coalition government from 2010, we more than trebled investment in renewable power, helped developed Britain's offshore wind industry into a world leader and secured an EU-wide agreement on new ambitious climate change targets for 2030. But this progress is not being taken forward by the Tories.What we want to see is a carbon neutral Britain by 2050, backed by a suite of policies like new financial regulations to promote green finance and fast track away from fossil fuels to create an economy that is truly green and sustainable. It would be a radical solution to an imminent problem. My challenge to other parties is they need to be just as radical, and we cannot wait for them to catch up.These strikes are a call for us MPs to take much stronger action on the climate crisis. In 2018, there were just three debates on climate change, and just one of those was in the main chamber of the House of Commons. While Labour MP Anna McMorrin's Westminster Hall debate on COP24 - otherwise known as the 2018 United Nations - last month was excellent, it was only given one hour of parliamentary time. This is nowhere long enough for MPs to express their views, especially considering the UK has bid to hold the crucial UN climate change conference in 2020. That's why I'm working with groups of MPs from all political parties to find a way to debate the issue on the floor of the house.After all, that's what the students are challenging us to do. Act now, for their futures. It is vital that MPs take the issue of climate change seriously and support the students in their activism. They can rest assured that I certainly do.Layla Moran is a Liberal Democrat MP for Oxford West and Abingdon\l"
"COP24","UK","COP24_UK49","-University of Reading: COP24: UN TALKS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALIGN RULES WITH THEIR LONG-TERM TEMPERATURE GOAL","December 13, 2018 Thursday","ENP Newswire","Leading thinkers on climate change from the University of Reading, the University of Oxford and the University of Victoria, Wellington today warned the UNFCCC that measurement rules in current draft texts at COP 24 could make it impossible to assess mitigation measures against a long-term temperature goal.They assert that the CO2-equivalent metric as presented 'seriously misrepresents the climate impact of methane emissions' as methane does not accumulate in the atmosphere over time as CO2 does.The full statement from Professor Keith Shine, University of Reading; Professor Myles Allen, Dr Michelle Cain, Dr John Lynch and Professor Raymond Pierrehumbert, University of Oxford; and Professor David Frame and Dr Adrian Macey, University of Victoria, Wellington follows:'Without an assessment of its impact, or a thorough review of available options, the UNFCCC negotiations in Poland may be converging on accounting rules for different greenhouse gases that could miss an opportunity clarify what their commitments actually mean, and lock in problems on multiple fronts for the future. Current proposals could make it more challenging for countries with historically large rice production or bovine agriculture sectors to engage in climate action while at the same time failing to appropriately discourage climatically dangerous increases in methane emissions from new sources such as fracking. Worst of all, they make it impossible to assess the implications of countries' commitments against progress to a long-term temperature goal.'The draft text of the 'transparency framework' in support of the Paris Agreement states 'each Party shall use the 100-year time horizon global warming potential (GWP) values ... to report aggregate emissions and removals of GHGs, expressed in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq).' This enshrines the practice of combining emissions of long-lived cumulative pollutants such as CO2 with relatively short-lived pollutants such as methane (produced by cows, sheep, rice cultivation and fracking) into a single aggregate 'CO2-equivalent' emission.'The problem, as has long been known, is that global temperatures respond fundamentally differently to methane and CO2: the rate of methane emissions determines methane's contribution to the current temperature level, while the rate of CO2 emissions determines CO2's contribution to current rate of temperature increase. Adding them together seriously misrepresents the climate impact of methane emissions especially when these are constant or falling.'If only a single number for CO2-equivalent emissions is reported using conventional GWP, it will perpetuate misunderstandings about the contributions of different gases to global temperature, leading to an increasingly indefensible split between our climate policy framework and climate science.'There is, however, a simple solution: in pursuit of an ambitious global temperature goal, treat all gases equally in terms of their impact on global temperature. This can still be done with GWP but via a different usage. Instead of equating one-off ('pulse') emissions of two gases using the GWP, as is conventional, a more sound comparison of climate impact is to equate a permanent one-tonne-per-year increase in emissions of any short-lived pollutant, such as methane, with a one-off emission of a fixed number of tonnes of CO2: the conversion factor is just the GWP times the time-horizon.'Global temperatures react to a one-tonne-per-year increase in methane emissions just like a one-off emission of 2800 tonnes of CO2. The climate system also equates steady, or gently declining, methane emissions (such as produced by a long-established agricultural sector) with near-zero CO2 emissions, since steady or declining methane emissions are no longer contributing to any further increase in global temperatures (even though they could still present an opportunity for mitigation).'As noted in the recent IPCC 1.5-degreeC Special Report, aggregate emissions combined in this way track the progress of global temperature remarkably accurately, making it easy to assess their implications for a long-term temperature goal. By contrast, the conventional usage of GWP-100 would equate that increase in methane emissions with only a 28-tonnes-per-year increase in CO2 emissions, massively underestimating its immediate impact, while at the same time incorrectly equating steady or declining methane emissions with a long-term commitment to increasing temperature.'The single extra piece of information required in the transparency framework to make clear the implications of reported emissions for global temperature is for countries to report, in addition to their aggregate total CO2-equivalent emissions, the contribution to that total of very long-lived gases (those, like CO2 and nitrous oxide, with effective lifetimes exceeding 100 years). These gases, unlike methane, accumulate in the climate system, so we need to know how fast they are accumulating to determine the resulting long-term temperature commitment. With that additional information, everything becomes transparent. It is not too late to include it.'Professor Myles Allen, Dr Michelle Cain, Dr John Lynch and Professor Raymond Pierrehumbert, University of Oxford; Professor Keith Shine, University of Reading; Professor David Frame and Dr Adrian Macey, University of Victoria, Wellington.[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uknewswire@enpublishing.co.uk\l"

Evidently, the band had not received the memo.These musicians, in their ceremonial uniforms and feathered hats, were part of a proud history that stretches back centuries, and despite hosting in recent years, this heritage is very much alive and well in 's Silesia region.Inside the conference centre where the UN's event is taking place, attendees could visit the Katowice city stall, which stood as a proud testament to this fact.- Katowice PressOffice (@BiuroPrasoweKce) Manned by locals steeped in mining history, it sold soap, earrings and other jewellery, all made from coal. There was even a ""shrine"" to coal, displaying lumps of the black mineral in all their glory behind sheets of glass and metal mesh.Among the sponsors ofCOP24- which has been lauded as the most important climate event since the Paris climate agreement was agreed three years ago - are three Polish state-owned coal companies. Stepping outside the centre, and taking a lungful of the city's smog-filled air, a visitor could spot coal power plants in the distance, and just a stone's throw away is a museum built on the site of a former mine shaft.A cynical observer might suggest Poland was mocking the earnest environmental campaigners and scientists who had come hoping to achieve a fossil-free world. After leading climate researchers in October that coal must be virtually eliminated as a fuel source by the middle of the century, its presence in such abundance seems like some kind of unpleasant joke.The Polish pavilion decorated with coal at the summit on climate change in Katowice, Poland (JanekSkarzynski / AFP)But it's clear that with 80 per cent of Poland's electricity generated by coal-fired plants, and plans to build more, the government is quite serious about its commitment to the dirtiest of dirty fuels.After informing those assembled at COP24 he had ""no plan today to fully give up on coal,""Polish president Andrzej Duda reiterated his case to assembled miners in the southern town of Brzeszcze on Tuesday. He assured those gathered that on his watch, he would not allow anyone to ""murder"" Polish mining.The president said that with coal supplies set to last another 200 years, it would be ""hard not to use them"". Good news for the miners, perhaps, but bad news for the planet - not to mention the health of Polish people.Rich countries urged to pay 'fair share' as emissions hit record highsPoland is Europe's smog capital, home to 33 of Europe's 50 most polluted cities. As delegates gathered in Katowice last week, data collected by the European Environment Agency revealed it was the second most polluted city onthe continent. Its levels of particulate matter were twice as high as those deemed safe by the World Health Organisation.Considering the toxic air, the mounting pressure to drop coal altogether and the dire climate warnings, it seems remarkable that Polish politicians are gripping on to fossil fuel with such tenacity. ""For years, we have had this dogma - particularly among politicians - that coal is the future of Polish energy policy, the basis of the Polish economy and even the basis of Polish identity,"" says Piotr Trzaskowski, an energy expert and activist with 350.org.Chief safety engineer Piotr Grabon stands next to a painting of St Barbara, the patron saint of coal miners, underground at the KWK Pniowek coal mine (Sean Gallup/Getty)This dogma is not unique to Poland. On the other side of the Atlantic, Donald Trump has professed his love for ""beautiful, clean coal"" in a bid to appease beleaguered American miners. Germany too, has shown an unwillingness to ditch coal, but other EU nations have seen more success.In fact by cutting coal power from 42 per cent to 7 per cent of electricity generation in just five years, the UK has set a remarkable example of how transition can be achieved.At the same time, considering the massive social upheaval that came with the dismantling of Britain's coal industry-which will end for good when coal is phased out totally in 2025-it also reveals why Polish politicians might be unwilling to follow suit. Mining trade unions are powerful in Poland, and are clearly unwilling to go the way of their UK counterparts.Read moreWhat are the Paris climate agreement and the COP24 summit?But there is also a growing movement among conservative communities sick of air pollution and coal mine expansion. Polling suggests nearly a third of Polish people consider climate change ""one of the gravest threats to our civilisation"", and most would support a switch away from coal.""In the last few years, there has been a revolution,"" says Marek Jozefiak, a climate campaigner with Greenpeace, explaining that people have made the link between smog and coal.""People are like - you don't want to quit coal, so you want us to basically die for it?"" he says. ""Because that is a fact, people are dying prematurely, thousands of them.""Despite this opposition, breaking Poland's coal addiction will not be easy. The recent ""gilets jaunes"" protests in France, a response to a ham-fisted attempt to cut emissions by raising fuel tax, caused ripples of unease to spread around many of those gathered at COP24. Clearly, forcing people to be greener requires a subtler approach, and onethat leaves no one behind.That is why most attendees at the Katowice summit are in favour of a so-called ""just transition"" - trading dirty industries for renewable ones, and ensuring that people hold onto lucrative and fulfilling jobs.COP24 so far, this message has not yet penetrated the upper echelons of Polish government.Read moreCivilisations to collapse because of climate change, says AttenboroughWe're running out of chances to save the planet from climate changeTrump officials downplay major climate report as 'worst-case scenario'On Saturday, Poles intend to show their displeasure in a climate march through Katowice.

But people know that the future will look different,"" says Mr Bialas.""I believe in transformation in Silesia and that we may turn from coal to renewables with benefits for everyone.

The committee is also pleased that the country has set key priorities stemming from the Paris Agreement where the South African leadership played a critical role. Priorities such as enough mitigation ambition to avoid dangerous human-made climate change, to have enough international financial, technology and capacity building support to make the whole system work and to have effective transparency to build trust and share experiences. These priorities are critical in ensuring that as a country, South Africa plays its part in participating globally in fighting climate change.The Chairperson of the committee remarked that the Katowice climate change negotiations are very critical in the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The Katowice COP 24 is mandated to adopt the Paris Agreement Work Programme, which should set out the mechanism for the full implementation of the historic Paris Agreement and for this reason, it is the committee's wish that the global climate negotiations succeed for the sake of humanity.The committee has noted the alarming report of the scientific advisory body to the UNFCCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which confirms that it is now evident more than ever before, that climate change is currently the greatest threat to humankind and that dramatic changes by all countries are urgently required in order to limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C.Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Republic of South Africa: The Parliament.(Distributed by M2 Communications ( HYPERLINK www.m2.com)) \l"

Following the successful first MOCA in Montreal last year, we have convened this opportunity for ministerial guidance on the successful conclusion of the Paris Agreement Work Programme and on the other key political events at COP 24.At a time where multilateralism is being challenged, this meeting is a living proof of our commitment to implementing the Paris Agreement and determination to find solutions and compromises, all of us, multilaterally. We will need Ministerial leadership to achieve comprehensive, balanced, effective results that are consistent with the spirit of Paris. The EU, China and Canada are determined to continue work with all Parties to this end.The MOCA brings together Ministers and high-level representatives from the world's largest economies and other countries from the different regional groups. In this more intimate and informal setting we hope to support - but not to replace or prejudge-the formal negotiations. As we have just heard in Berlin, achieving results at COP 24 will require us all to pick up the pace of negotiations, and to be well-prepared to send strong messages of political leadership. The agenda we have prepared reflects a subset of the key challenges that still need to be resolved.The Petersberg Climate Dialogue hosted by Germany and Poland earlier this week provided for excellent high level exchanges. We see the next two days as an opportunity for deeper and more detailed peer-to-peer conversations on the political differences that we will need to resolve if we are to ensure a successful conclusion to COP 24.We will kick off the meeting with general reflections on the outcome for COP 24 and its main deliverables, and tomorrow we will address key matters of the Paris Agreement Work Programme as it relates to action and as it relates to support. With six months between now and the closing plenary in Katowice, we must seize the opportunity of this MOCA to discuss-openly and sincerely-our individual asks and limitations.At COP24 we must agree on guidance for the implementation of the Paris Agreement that unites Parties and does not divide them. This means a 'rulebook' that is comprehensive, balanced, and carefully tailored to address each aspect of the Paris Agreement: cutting emissions, adapting to impacts and supporting implementation. The guidance agreed at COP 24 should be robust enough to deliver confidence that we are on track to implementing Paris, flexible enough to reflect relevant differences in Parties' capacities, and dynamic enough to ensure that all Parties are improving their performance over time.In addition, through the Talanoa Dialogue, the High Level Ministerial Dialogue on Climate Finance, and the stocktake on pre-2020 action, Parties should be prepared to share our achievements and the lessons we have learned so far, and on how we can advance action and raise ambition from now into the future.These processes will set the scene for the next round of NDCs and Long term strategies.I look forward, in the plenary discussion to come, to sharing with you the details of how the EU is preparing for Katowice. This will include an update on the agreement of EU climate policies necessary for us to achieve our NDC, preparations for a new long term strategy to put us on track towards the Paris goals, and an EU Talanoa Dialogue, launched last week with the involvement of 600 stakeholders from across the EU and around the world.Last Thursday, EU negotiators agreed to increase the 2030 renewable energy target to 32% up from the original 27% target on the basis of which our at least 40% emissions reduction target in our NDC was modelled. And yesterday evening, EU negotiators agreed on a new 32,5% energy efficiency target by 2030 up from the 30% original target. EU negotiators also agreed the governance rules to meet our climate and energy targets. Both new targets would de facto mean that the European Union would be in a position to raise the level of ambition of the NDC and increase its emissions reduction target from the current 40% to slightly over 45% by 2030.Each of these recent developments in the EU shows that in addition to raising headl"

A map of pavilions showed one for the United States, but when visitors went to the spot it was empty. The US negotiating team had no idea why their country was even listed among the displays. President Trump is in the process of withdrawing from the Accord.Nigeria, Benin and Congo Brazzaville did have stands, but for much of the time there were no staff to run them.French leader Emmanuel Macron was due here, but couldn't leave Paris because of violent protest against his plan to increase a tax on fossil fuels. On Wednesday he agreed to scrap the hike, but a spokesman for the demonstrators said it was, 'too little too late,' and the riots look set to continue.The aim of COP24But to the horror of green protestors, the president of Poland arrived to sign a 'solidarity accord' with miners, confirming there would be no end to Polish coal any time soon.Most African countries have a presence here, some with teams larger than wealthy nations.John Owusu is a retired engineer originally from Ghana, but for 50 years he has worked across all regions of Africa.'There's a crisis of energy on our continent,' he said 'More than 600 million people have no electricity but we have African countries with huge delegations, all staying in top hotels, and for what?'He said a key to saving the environment was to stop the loss of forest across Asia and Africa. 'Where people have no other way to cook or heat their homes, they will use firewood,' he said. 'We need electricity for Africa and we need it now. That's where the money should be spent, not on flying to summits.'The main US team will arrive on Monday to promote an alliance between countries who could share technology on how to use coal without putting off harmful emissions. Australia, the US, India and South Africa are considered world leaders in the science.Indian environment minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, a former ear, nose and throat surgeon said his work as a doctor left him 'in no doubt' on the need for clean air.But he also defended his country's coal program, saying ultra-supercritical systems had changed the way it was used, reducing emissions to levels that allowed India to meet its obligations under the Paris deal.And, he said, India 'stands ready to share clean technology of all kinds,' with the world. 'This is a battle for the planet, not for any one country,' he said.Zimbabwe is represented by minister for agriculture Perence Shiri was was previously banned from entering the European Union under sanctions against the former regime of Robert Mugabe. The official UN list shows 86 people in the Zimbabwe delegation.The World Bank announced it would spend $200bn over the next five years to help countries limit climate change though it will not fund projects using fossil fuel, a policy opposed by the US which is the banks largest donor.But there was a light moment for the Zimbabwe delegation when they passed by the Polish stand to find a display marked, 'Sadza Soap.'In Zimbabwe's Shona language, sadza is a stiff maize-meal porridge and the national dish. In Polish, it means soot or powdered coal.The soap was displayed in glass cases surrounded by Polish coal.Countries in the region are using oil, coal and nuclear power to lessen their dependence on Russian gas in wake of Moscow's annexation of Crimea and eastern Ukraine. With winter temperatures falling below -20\'baC, there is a fear President Vladimir Putin could freeze his neighbours into submission, simply by turning off the gas.COP 24 will wrap up next week, but John Owusu said it reminded him of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries or OPEC.'OPEC ministers come together and pledge to reduce output in order to maintain a high price of oil. Then they go home and pump as much as they like.'Sadly it's the same thing here. Everyone wants cheap electricity and they'll make it with whatever works best.'He said at least the Polish president had been honest.

I am afraid of the lack of accountability in the space, knowing that the people with power will be patted on the back for simply coming together without making meaningful policy commitments.When the news stories come out about successful negotiations, we forget about when leaders pushed to leave ""human rights"" out of policy wording, or stood on the floor advocating for fossil fuels as a solution (hint: they're not), all to placate to their own interest in power and maintaining it. They are voluntarily blind to the suffering their decisions cause. Homes will be lost, families will be torn apart by displacement and at borders, and the sea will encroach upon whole societies, exterminating cultures and livelihoods. Developed countries like the US, corrupted by fossil fuel interests, are to blame.UN negotiators have been trying to solve the climate crisis since before I was born. When will global leaders admit that this is a broken and dysfunctional charade instead of burying the reality under false solutions and jargon? What will be the catalyst for people in power to do what is right? Do millions of people have to be displaced? Do we have to be stealing a livable planet from people not even born yet? How many millions of people will have to die from climate damage such as drought, famine, superstorms and wildfires before world leaders commit to implementing real solutions to defeat this crisis?I've been doing this work for five years and have given up a lot to do the things I know are right. I've given up personal finances, friendships, a normal adolescence and more to get up on the global stage. I've taken breaks from school, failed a few classes.Youth activists everywhere make personal sacrifices every day in order to protect the world we'll inherit and our governments can't do the same for us. The institutions meant to protect me don't seem to care as much as I do and it's a burden I carry everyday.I watch my government and governments around the world trade my future for profit. A future my mother fought hard to secure through sacrifice, when she made the journey to immigrate to the United States. There's a lot of anger and depression inside of me because of this, but I found happiness and reward in seeing the solutions, power and love in the climate movement.Though political institutions have fallen short, being on the ground here does offer hope: it proves the strength of people power. Politicians will never be the core of this movement. We need to highlight and uplift genuine grassroots movements that properly address the lived experiences of the people they protect.

In the last six months, the FairPlay social justice network in north Oxford has held a Climate Justice Campaign for the community to raise awareness of this inequality, and to suggest practical and accessible ways ourselves to be climate justice champions.Addressing a large public meeting for the campaign in Summertown, Myles Allen, an Oxford University Professor of Geosystem Science, said it was still possible to bring climate change under control and keep global temperature rises to 1.5C - the new meaningful target recognised at COP24. Limiting warming to this level will have a significant impact on the poorest communities worldwide, who have less ability to resist and manage the impacts of storms, droughts and sea level rise.An immediate priority is developing the capability for mass carbon capture and storage. Last year a record of at least 40 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide was added to the atmosphere: Professor Allen pointed suggested that in almost all 1.5C scenarios, that 40 billion tonnes will need to be pulled back out of the atmosphere, and we still have no idea how best to do this.He called it a huge technological challenge, but an achievable one, arguing that responsibility and funding should be put at the door of fossil fuel industries.Political and international will is needed to make this happen. Simultaneously we all need to radically cut our emissions and move towards a zero carbon economy - both national life and individual behaviour needs dramatic change.The professor also pointed out that life will change dramatically in various ways over the coming decades, so it was wrong to think of a zero-carbon future as simply 'doing without'.Also at the meeting was Abingdon South County Councillor Neil Fawcett, representing Oxford West and Abingdon MP Layla Moran, who stressed the Liberal Democrat commitment to achieving the UK's goal to reduce carbon emissions, and their backing for a legally binding target of a zero-carbon Britain by 2050.Ms Moran has backed a number of climate change initiatives in Parliament, including working with Green MP Carol"

The introduction by the regulator, the Guernsey Financial Services Commission, of the world's first regulated green fund product, the \â¬  Guernsey Green Fund\â¬ puts us at the forefront of green finance development. The objective of the GGF is to provide a platform upon which investments into various green initiatives can be made. The GGF will enhance investor access to the green investment space by providing a trusted and transparent product contributing to the internationally-agreed objectives of COP21, the 2015 United Nations , and provides certainty, consistency and simplicity for investors. Investors in a GGF will be able to rely on the GGF designation, provided through compliance with GGF rules, to represent a scheme that meets strict eligibility criteria of green investing and will have the objective of a net positive outcome on the planet. The island already has a number of cleantech funds established, and although the sector is growing, green funds are still at an embryonic stage. Investors are often hesitant to invest in funds which may not ring true to their green label, or do not want to sacrifice a good return for the sake of their environment. The GGF rules use standards developed by international financial institutions with the appropriate scientific background to ensure that the various assets held in a GGF are green within the true meaning of the word. Guernsey's trend-setting progress so far has been welcomed by Michael Mainelli, chairman and co-founder of the think tank Z/Yen, which has listed Guernsey as an 'emerging global contender' in its inaugural Green Global Finance Centres Index. \â¬  I am extremely encouraged to hear about Guernsey bringing out green fund regulation,\â¬ he said on the pro-sustainability podcast Planet Pod. \â¬  We are seeing regulators begin to pay attention and I hope that's picked up.\â¬ offTargetted ads:\~campaign 1Flag:\~\l"

"COP24","UK","COP24_UK80","Tax systems evolution is vital for future of our planet","December 10, 2018 Monday","The Western Mail","HERE is nothing more certain in life than death and taxes.TUsually attributed to the American revolutionary Benjamin Franklin, this phrase confirms the two things we can't avoid.Certainties are hard to predict, but there is a growing view that tax systems and policies are not fit for purpose or aligned to the challenges ahead.The foundations of modern tax systems were created during the Industrial Revolution, before globalisation and mass consumption, the emergence of climate disruption and water supply risks, and digitisation and automation.Challenges lie ahead. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report said that global carbon emissions must start to reduce well within 12 years if we are to prevent large-scale natural and human risks from becoming irreversible reality.The Welsh Government's efforts echo this and potential issues are being taken just as seriously here, with the recent drafting of a Climate Change Adaptation Plan, which launched last week, with insights from Met Office Hadley Centre's UK Climate Projections (UKCP18).This highlighted the impacts from climate change we should all expect in the coming decades, including warmer summers, wetter winters and further sea-level rise.We also face equally important social challenges, including a growing global population.In many countries, unemployment, underemployment and vulnerable employment are placing unprecedented demands on national budgets.These are huge megatrends which our governments need to prepare for with the creation of coherent strategies to deal with them. And tax must play an important part in this because tax costs have a fundamental impact on investment, employment and consumption decisions. Given these scenarios, ACCA has published a discussion paper called Tax as a Force for Good, focusing on taxes that are less-publicised than corporate income tax but directly related to today's socio-economic challenges - labour taxes, which include personal income tax, payroll taxes and social security contributions, and green taxes on pollution and resource-use such as carbon emissions, fossil fuels, water, waste and metals.The paper argues the merits of the circular economy - a carbon-neutral and regenerative model in which products are made to be made again.Last year, the Welsh Government pledged \Â£36.5m for small businesses to move towards this new economy. Studies suggest it could save the Welsh economy \Â£32bn and potentially create up to 30,000 jobs.It's a timely publication, coming as the COP 24 met in Katowice, Poland - the 24th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).At this meeting, global agreement was sought on actions to mitigate climate change - including taxation and levies.Currently, public revenue is raised largely on employment. In OECD countries, labour taxes account for 52.1% of total public revenue raised, while green taxes account for only 5.1%.A big question about tax design is whether specific taxes can help tackle massive issues such as climate change. Green taxes can be effective in changing behaviour and averting environmental damage. For example, according to UK Government information, the UK Landfill Tax has been instrumental in reducing the amount of waste dumped in the ground by 44% since 2000.So how can governments make the move away from labour to green taxes? While changing fiscal systems is difficult, the basic principle is simple: ""tax less what you want more of"". We propose three steps: \Â£6 Put a price on pollution and use of natural resources - such as fossil fuels, waste, water and the extraction of metal ores. Governments have more than 100 green tax bases at their disposal, from carbon emissions to waste streams; \Â£6 Use revenues to lower the tax burden on labour and improve social protection - the revenues of step one are used to lower personal income tax, social contributions (both for employees and employers) and payroll taxes. Careful design is required to make sure that the needs of vulnerable groups are addressed through increased social protection or income support; \Â£6 Monitor and adjust - as in the current system, reforms need to be monitored and adjusted.

Brazil was constantly involved in negotiations to ensure COP24 delivered a workable toolbox to limit global warming. So we warmly welcome the positive outcome of COP24, including the agreement to keep working on a stronger global market mechanism for emission reductions.Unfortunately, there have been several misrepresentations made about Brazil's positions ( HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/16/katowice-we-can-move-forward-now-un-climate-talks-take-significant-stepEncouraging signs - but new rifts also exposed by hard-won deal at climate talks, 17 December), which do not help in the work ahead for all countries.Brazil is absolutely opposed to double counting when it comes to carbon credits, and has consistently supported efforts to prevent double counting. We believe that emissions reductions generated under the sustainable development mechanism must be additional to the emissions-reductions targets made by the country where the reductions are generated.This means that if the private sector develops a project and sells additional emissions reductions to any country, those reductions should be counted only towards the national targets of the purchasing country, with no impact on the targets of the country that hosted the project. If the purchasing country then on-sells those emissions reductions, they should absolutely be required to make an adjustment in respect of their national emissions targets. Otherwise, double counting will occur, which is exactly what Brazil and many other countries have sought to prevent.Accurate representation of all countries' positions is vital if the world is to make the necessary progress on climate change. Brazil of course has been a leader not just in global discussions on climate change, but also through its actual actions.

"COP24","UK","COP24_UK84","A lot of hot air over diesel car emissions [...]; LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","December 16, 2018 Sunday","The Sunday Times (London)","David Quinn's claim that ""diesel cars emit lots of carbon dioxide and will have to be phased out"" is without scientific foundation (""Road to a carbon tax is too bumpy for Leo"", Comment, last week). Anyway, carbon taxes will not solve this problem but will add to the cost of living and increase the price of our exports. We could change to electric propulsion, but this is not a viable answer at the present time. It cannot apply to the trucking and heavy-machinery industry, and ""range anxiety"" means it is viable only in city cars.To go electric in the future, we must put in place comprehensive infrastructure, starting with generation. But can we create the capacity to supply the cumulative demands of electric cars, city buses, home and workplace heating, industry and so on? Or will this be dependent on ""when the wind blows"", to quote former minister Pat Rabbitte when asked about continuity of supply in the face of an ESB strike.Jack Leighton Crossmolina, Co Mayo Driving to despair While Quinn's piece was interesting and thoughtprovoking, I suspect the assertion that ""diesel cars emit lots of carbon dioxide"" may be misleading. Those cars that use petrol instead of diesel in a spark-ignition engine emit higher levels of CO2 and lower levels of particulate matter and other pollutants. Cars that burn diesel in a compression engine emit lower levels of CO2, but alarmingly high levels of chemicals and particulate pollutants that are harmful to human health - especially respiratory health.The mass migration to petrol in the UK has probably yielded better air quality, but led to an escalation in the volume of greenhouse CO2. Donal Hoban, by email Roadblock ahead I have been wondering why the Irish government has been sitting on its hands regarding climate-change action. Quinn's article, unfortunately, answers the question in simple terms. What government knows how to make truly carbon-busting policies politically and publicly acceptable? And a more rhetorical question: when will we wake up and realise the steam train that is severe climate change coming down the track? I believe the scientists who contributed to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, and I believe the human race is in for challenging times. The sooner we act, the more we mitigate against catastrophe. Peter McMahon, by email Hiding the facts Given global temperatures over the past eight months, we can now see the temperature increase of 2015-16, at the time of the Paris agreement, was a natural El Ni\'f1o type driven by geothermal heating. Yet this was the false foundation on which Paris 2015 and the IPCC's 2018 special report were built.There is, therefore, no risk of the ""potential environmental catastrophe"" that Quinn mentions. Rather, there is widespread suppression in the media of any research findings contrary to the dogma that CO2 emissions are a dangerous threat. Tony Carey Enniskerry, Co Wicklow Asleep at the wheel There was not a word in your newspaper on COP 24, the 24th conference on climate change in Katowice, Poland.

It requires every country to follow a set of standards for measuring their emissions and tracking their policies.More recently, the COP24 summit negotiations, which finished on Saturday in Katowice, Poland, also agreed that countries would step up their plans to cut emissions before another round of talks in 2020.COP24 postponed any pledges for more ambitious emission reductions until next year. It also provided no clarity on how to account for the financial pledges in the Paris agreement, which included a goal of $100 billion to help developing countries tackle global warming by 2020.Ireland has consistently been criticised for its efforts to mitigate climate change, which will not meet its EU targets for 2020 and thus result in fines of up to (EURO)600 million a year.Oisin Coghlan, spokesman for the Stop Climate Chaos coalition of environmental groups, said that the negotiations failed to adequately respond to the catastrophic impacts of climate change. He added that there was no clear commitment to strengthen emission pledges. ""At this climate conference negotiators took baby steps, when we need a giant leap,"" he said. ""Thankfully communities and campaigners around the world are forging ahead to create the just transition we so desperately need. The people will lead and politicians will follow.""A report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this year said that emissions would have to be cut by nearly half by 2030 to keep average temperature rises to no more than 1.5C. The report said that a twodegree increase would wipe out most Arctic summer sea ice and 99 per cent of the world's coral reefs.Clodagh Daly, spokeswoman for the Friends of the Irish Environment charity, said she was disappointed that aspects of the Paris agreement, including emission trading between countries, were not negotiated.She said it was vital that loopholes in achieving emission targets were not permitted.""Unfortunately the substantive decision has been left to next year, effectively moving environmental integrity of the Paris agreement into the long grass,"" she added.Richard Bruton, the environment minister, said the COP24 talks were a ""significant milestone"" but that international co-operation was crucial to tackling climate change. He said Ireland was fully committed to implementing the Paris agreement. ""The agreed rules put in place the structures for tracking global emissions, providing capacity-building and financial support and facilitating action to adapt to the impacts of climate change,"" he said. ""We must step up our response across the board.""Mr Bruton also announced a new ""all of government"" climate plan setting out each department's duties.

The conference's main goal was to agree on rules to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement, which seeks to curb greenhouse-gas emissions to mitigate the rise in global temperatures.The conference got off to an inauspicious start, with conference attendees arriving in Katowice greeted by the incongruous sight of a miners' orchestra and an installation exhibiting Silesian coal. The impression of a Polish government committed to maintaining the use of fossil fuels was compounded by the president, Andrzej Duda, who averred that it would be ""strange"" if Poland was to compromise its energy security by ceasing to exploit its remaining reserves of coal. According to BP's Statistical Review of World Energy 2017, Poland is the second-largest coal producer in Europe and Eurasia, behind Russia, and had the fifth-largest proven coal reserves in Europe and Eurasia at the end of 2016.Mr Duda's ambiguous words set the tone for a conference that ended with the signing of a document committing the signatories to a ""rulebook"" on measuring and reporting emissions-cutting measures, but that abandoned more ambitious attempts to scale up existing commitments on reducing emissions and avoided reaching conclusions on whether countries were making a sufficient attempt to reduce their emissions.Although the Polish government declared itself satisfied with the efficient organisation and outcome of the summit, frustration at the lack of ambition in the concluding document was evident in the words of the UN secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, who had opened the conference with a declaration that it must result in the setting of ambitious goals, but concluded it by observing that such goals would be the topic of the next COP conference. In an intervention that was uncomfortable for Catholic Poland, the Vatican criticised the lack of ambition and urgency in the declaration, observing that human rights and the interests of ""the weakest"" were given insufficient priority.\l"

"COP24","UK","COP24_UK100","Sir David Attenborough isn't the right choice to speak about climate change","November 25, 2018 Sunday","The Independent - Daily Edition","The forthcoming UN climate change conference in Katowice, Poland, is unlikely to attract the same attention as its predecessors in Paris in 2015, or Kyoto in 1997. But amongthe dull, humdrum monotony of the bureaucratic implementation of the Paris Agreement, there is one feature of this year's conference - or ""COP24"" - that has already attracted some interest.This year, one of the seats will be occupied, not by any politician or civil servant, but by ""The People"".But of course, fitting over seven billion people onto a single chair is not without its difficulties. Luckily for us, the UN has identified the perfect man to speak on our behalf. At the opening session of COP24, the soft, soporific tones of Sir David Attenborough will treat the conference's attendees to a warm fireside (or some electrical, environmentally sustainable alternative) rendition of the concerns of ""real people"".Now, it may be a failing on my part, but I have to confess an almost intuitive distrust of anyone (whether an individual or a group) who claims to speak for the people. To make that claim is to assume a homogeneity and consensus of thought which is as dangerous as it is boring. That distrust grows greater still when that assumption is mixed with the as-yet-undimmed influence of celebrity. Make no mistake about it, while he might not be a likely candidate in the Celebrity Big Brother house, or selling his holiday beach pictures to OK! magazine, Sir David is very much part of that culture which favours mass appeal over expertise, style over substance, and feelings over knowledge.The proponents of the People's Seat might point to the fact that Sir David is expected to include in his address a number of accounts provided by people from around the world, about how climate change will affect, or is already in the process of affecting, them. But why not simply allow those people to speak for themselves? Technology would certainly allow their views to be seen or heard in a way that did not involve them being ventriloquised by an old, white, middle-class male.And let's be clear: Sir David Attenborough is not a climate change expert. There's no reason to think he knows any more about climate change, its causes, and the viability of potential solutions than, say, you do.COP24, as dry and mundane as it may sound, is to turn the theory, knowledge and understanding of experts into practical, effective change. ""The people"" - whoever they are - have no useful contribution to make to that process, particularly at a time when they have so consistently proven themselves to be incapable of making good choices.The cocktail of superficiality, the relegation of the importance of expertise and the assumption of consensus that has produced this catchpenny gimmick has a name, as it turns out. It's called populism. Again, you may think that populism is a good thing. On the other hand, you may, like me, find it hugely troubling. But what is clear is that populism cannot be good only when it leads to David Attenborough speaking for the people of the world on climate change, and bad only when it leads to Brexit.\l"

That is easy to say, it's easy to get energised about, but then it's hard work,' Mr Brodin added.Referring to the businesses previous eco-friendly endeavours, Mr Brodin, said Ikea was a 'world leader in sustainability' and will continue on its plight to positively impact the environment.Ikea has vowed to power its entire operation by renewable energy by 2020, and by 2025 it plans to use only electric vehicles.The first set of trucks are scheduled to arrive at Australian distribution centres in the coming months.'When it comes to the whole value chain, we find ways, everything from sequestration to other means to make sure also that the energy footprint from the forest all the way to the store is also covered by that.'But that's going to take all the way until 2030,' Mr Brodin, who recently went to a United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poland, told the publication.As well as making environment-friendly decisions internally, Ikea is also encouraging consumers to make energy-positive choices and will start stocking low-cost solar panels in Australian stores later this year.The multinational group, which was founded in 1943, has already invested around $2.7billion in renewable energy, and has 441 wind turbines and 750,000 solar modules.{\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\parAs of November 2018, there are 424 IKEA stores operating across 52 countries.Ikea's big warehouse-style stores have been in Australia for 43 years.\l"

The new funding could unlock an extra \Â£3156 million of private finance into renewable energy markets in Africa by 2023.Developers of small-scale solar, wind, hydro and geothermal projects will be supported to harness each country's natural resources, and the electricity generated is expected to provide 2.4 million people a year with new or improved access to clean energy. Power produced from new projects funded is expected to save around three million tonnes of carbon over their lifetime, compared with fossil fuel generation - the equivalent to the emissions from burning 21,000 railway cars of coal or from 800,000 cars in a year.Energy and Clean Growth Minister Claire Perry said:""At home we're world leaders in cutting emissions while growing our economy and abroad we're showing our international leadership by giving countries a helping hand to shift to greener, cleaner economies.This \Â£3100 million will help communities harness the power of their natural resources to provide hundreds of thousands of people with electricity for the first time. Building these clean, reliable sources of energy will also create thousands of quality jobs in these growing green economies.""The new investment is in addition to \Â£348 million previously committed to the REPP. The programme is already supporting 18 renewable energy projects in a range of countries from Tanzania to Burundi. These projects, featuring solar, wind, biomass, hydro and geothermal technologies, are expected to provide new or improved access for more than 4.5 million people over the project lifetimes, creating 8,000 jobs during development and operation.Expected results from some of the 18 projects already receiving support from REPP are:- hydropower from the Nzoia River in Kenya, providing 290,000 people with energy and creating 330 jobs- solar power for 70,000 people in Kilosa, Tanzania, including for 6,000 people who will have access to energy for the first time, creating 75 jobs in total- mini grids in Nigeria which will provide 72 rural villages with pay-as-you-go clean, reliable energy, creating 2,500 jobs during construction and 430 when it's up and running- biomass plants in Ebolowa and Edea, Cameroon, providing enough clean energy for 520,000 people in a rural area creating 460 jobs- solar power to provide electricity for 87,600 people and business in Burundi, creating 300 part-time jobs and 50-full times posts- a hydropower plant creating enough power for more than 90,000 people for the first time in a remote part of Tanzania, creating 80 jobs in totalThe funding is part of the UK's commitment to invest \Â£35.8 billion in international climate finance by 2020 to encourage ambitious action from other governments, the private sector and communities in the global effort to tackle climate change.To date, UK climate finance has:- provided 17 million people with improved access to clean energy- installed 590MW of clean energyAt COP24 the UK also announced:- \Â£315.6 million to help countries vulnerable to climate change have a voice in United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations- \Â£3771,000 to help developing countries take part in COP24- an additional \Â£345 million to the 'Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions' (NAMA) Facility, co-founded by the UK, to help reduce emissions within an economic sector- an additional \Â£31 million for the Global Innovation Lab, which helps innovative climate finance proposals move more quickly to implementation and attract fundingDistributed by APO Group on behalf of British High Commission Abuja. \l"
"COP24","UK","COP24_UK103","'You don't want to quit coal, so you want us to die for it?'; As a traditional mining city in Poland hosts a key UN climate summit, leaders are still unwilling ....","December 9, 2018 Sunday","The Independent - Daily Edition","As day broke on negotiations at a momentous climate change conference in the Polish city of Katowice, politicians, diplomats and scientists were given a rude awakening.At 6am, a coal miners brass band struck up and marched through the streets to celebrate the day of Saint Barbara, their patron saint.The previous day, beloved nature broadcaster Sir David Attenborough had given an impassioned speech warning of civilisation collapse if the world did not break its fossil fuel addiction. Evidently, the band had not received the memo.These musicians, in their ceremonial uniforms and feathered hats, were part of a proud history that stretches back centuries, and despite hosting one of the most important climate change events in recent years, this heritage is very much alive and well in Poland's Silesia region.Inside the conference centre where the UN's COP24 event is taking place, attendees could visit the Katowice city stall, which stood as a proud testament to this fact.Manned by locals steeped in mining history, it sold soap, earrings and other jewellery, all made from coal. There was even a ""shrine"" to coal, displaying lumps of the black mineral in all their glory behind sheets of glass and metal mesh.Among the sponsors of COP24 - which has been lauded as the most important climate event since the Paris climate agreement was agreed three years ago - are three Polish state-owned coal companies.Stepping outside the centre, and taking a lungful of the city's smog-filled air, a visitor could spot coal power plants in the distance, and just a stone's throw away is a museum built on the site of a former mine shaft.A cynical observer might suggest Poland was mocking the earnest environmental campaigners and scientists who had come hoping to achieve a fossil-free world. After leading climate researchers made it clear in October that coal must be virtually eliminated as a fuel source by the middle of the century, its presence in such abundance seems like some kind of unpleasant joke.But it's clear that with 80 per cent of Poland's electricity generated by coal-fired plants, and plans to build more, the government is quite serious about its commitment to the dirtiest of dirty fuels.After informing those assembled at COP24 he had ""no plan today to fully give up on coal,"" Polish president Andrzej Duda reiterated his case to assembled miners in the southern town of Brzeszcze on Tuesday. He assured those gathered that on his watch, he would not allow anyone to ""murder"" Polish mining.The president said that with coal supplies set to last another 200 years, it would be ""hard not to use them"". Good news for the miners, perhaps, but bad news for the planet - not to mention the health of Polish people.Considering the toxic air, the mounting pressure to drop coal altogether and the dire climate warnings, it seems remarkable that Polish politicians are gripping on to fossil fuel with such tenacity. ""For years, we have had this dogma - particularly among politicians - that coal is the future of Polish energy policy, the basis of the Polish economy and even the basis of Polish identity,"" says Piotr Trzaskowski, an energy expert and activist with 350.org.This dogma is not unique to Poland. On the other side of the Atlantic, Donald Trump has professed his love for ""beautiful, clean coal"" in a bid to appease beleaguered American miners. Germany too, has shown an unwillingness to ditch coal, but other EU nations have seen more success.In fact by cutting coal power from 42 per cent to 7 per cent of electricity generation in just five years, the UK has set a remarkable example of how transition can be achieved.At the same time, considering the massive social upheaval that came with the dismantling of Britain's coal industry - which will end for good when coal is phased out totally in 2025 - it also reveals why Polish politicians might be unwilling to follow suit. Mining trade unions are powerful in Poland, and are clearly unwilling to go the way of their UK counterparts.But there is also a growing movement among conservative communities sick of air pollution and coal mine expansion. Polling suggests nearly a third of Polish people consider climate change ""one of the gravest threats to our civilisation"", and most would support a switch away from coal.""In the last few years, there has been a revolution,"" says Marek Jozefiak, a climate campaigner with Greenpeace, explaining that people have made the link between smog and coal.""People are like - you don't want to quit coal, so you want us to [basically] die for it?"" he says. ""Because that is a fact, people are dying prematurely, thousands of them.""Despite this opposition, breaking Poland's coal addiction will not be easy. The recent ""gilets jaunes"" protests in France, a response to a ham-fisted attempt to cut emissions by raising fuel tax, caused ripples of unease to spread around many of those gathered at COP24. Clearly, forcing people to be greener requires a subtler approach, and one that leaves no one behind.That is why most attendees at the Katowice summit are in favour of a so-called ""just transition"" - trading dirty industries for renewable ones, and ensuring that people hold onto lucrative and fulfilling jobs.COP24 so far, this message has not yet penetrated the upper echelons of Polish government.Yesterday, Poles showed their displeasure in a climate march through Katowice. Patryk Bialas, a city councillor, is one of a group of local politicians calling for the establishment to get on board with the grassroots movements that have sprung up around the country.""In Silesia there is still a lot of respect for coal miners and tradition that comes with it. But people know that the future will look different,"" says Mr Bialas.""I believe in transformation in Silesia and that we may turn from coal to renewables with benefits for everyone. If we will make it here, we will make it in all Polish regions struggling with coal.""\l"

"COP24","UK","COP24_UK108","Schoolgirl teaches our world leaders: 'Listen to the science!","April 25, 2019 Thursday","Daily Post (North Wales)","THE huge demonstrations in London rightly highlight the environmental apathy which typifies politics at Westminster and worldwide.Global warming requires a global response - a message conveyed to political leaders by a sixteen year-old schoolgirl, from Sweden.Last year, Greta Thunberg initiated ""Friday school strikes"", protesting at the failure of politicians to address climate change.Last month, a hundred thousand pupils in sixty countries walked out of school to highlight the world's ecological crisis.Former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams has backed the strikes, stressing that ""the future of the human race is now at stake"".Last week Greta met the Pope.Earlier she addressed the European Parliament and the United Nations Climate Change Conference.At Westminster she met Environment Minister Michael Gove and Jeremy Corbyn - both with Prime Ministerial aspirations. Everyone wants to be seen with this unassuming schoolgirl!Greta is afflicted by Asperger's Syndrome - a high-functioning condition on the autism spectrum.Some forms of autism are characterized by a single-mindedness of purpose. Certainly Greta demonstrates such a focussed approach. In a BBC interview, she said that Asperger's helped her ""think outside the box"". Her message to political leaders was simple: ""Listen to the Science.""The Swedish schoolgirl reminds us all to respect everything that science teaches - particularly regarding climate change.Hallelujah! Many people today ignore - even disparage - science and the practical benefits derived from scientific methods in our everyday lives. One needn't be a scientist, to ""listen to the science"". Science is about establishing objective truth - in all aspects of life.To casually dismiss the messages emanating from scientific study is foolish. Who would have a heart operation undertaken by a witchdoctor? Or board an aircraft piloted by someone from the nearest pub? So why shut our eyes and ears when ninety-percent of the world's scientists warn about the threats to human survival from global warming? Science is a tool. To benefit from it, one has to respect it, understand its approach, and limitations; and listen to its messages.If a sixteen year old from Sweden can see it, why do aspiring Prime Ministers - and American Presidents - wallow in perverse ignorance? Last week, a mentoring programme was launched, to attract more youngsters, particularly women, to study A-level physics in Wales.Perhaps I'm biased: my physics degree stimulated my industrial career!Recent warnings by scientists- such as the polar icecap's accelerating meltdown - were heard by children and triggered international grassroot protest.The Attenborough programmes - highlighting our abuse of the earth's resources and the impact of nonrecyclable plastics on wildlife - has stimulated public outcry.Unless we reverse our mindless abuse of the natural world, we shall, within our children's lifetime, pass the point of no return - with devastating consequences.Little wonder that schoolchildren - in Wales and around the world - are leading the protests to wake up politicians to these threats.If it takes more demonstrations and more school-pupil strikes, so be it.But we can't leave it just to them. Each of us must, in Greta's words, ""Listen to the science"" - and raise our voices.\l"

Using cutting-edge technologies like carbon capture and storage, the UK is aiming to become a world-leader in clean technology and services that will be needed as the world tackles climate change.The UK's low carbon economy has the potential to deliver export sales of low carbon goods and services around the world, by 2030 annual exports could be worth up to \Â£3170 billion and could support up to 2 million 'green collar' jobs by 2030 - a key part of our modern Industrial Strategy.Currently, industry accounts for around 25% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the UK, with more than two-thirds of these industrial emissions coming from energy intensive industries which are often located next to each other in clusters.This new funding of up to \Â£3170 million, which is expected to be backed by industry, will help heavy industries like steel, ceramics, cement, chemicals, paper and glass to share expertise and innovative low-carbon solutions to clean up the air we breathe as we move to a greener, cleaner economy.Energy and Clean Growth\~Minister\~Claire Perry said:Demonstrating climate action and growing the economy go hand in hand is key to building momentum behind global action on carbon. The UK is a leader in both, cutting our emissions by more than 40% while growing our economy by 2 thirds, but to sustain this track record we need to tackle emissions from energy intensive sectors and bring clean growth to our great industrial centres.That's why today I'm launching a mission to create the world's first 'net-zero' carbon cluster by 2040 in the UK with up to \Â£3170 million of new government funding. This will help to develop the technologies of the future to transform industry around the world, ensuring the UK seizes the global economic opportunities of moving to greener, cleaner industry - a key part of our modern Industrial Strategy.By investing in world-leading innovative technology, such as carbon capture usage and storage (CCUS), climate change can be tackled alongside creating highly skilled jobs and generating export opportunities. At the end of last month, Minister Claire Perry co-hosted a global summit in Edinburgh at which she unveiled plans to enable the first UK carbon capture project from the mid-2020s.Today's announcement comes as the UK-Canada led Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA) celebrates one year of success, now with over 70 members. As part of this, the UK has committed \Â£320 million for a World Bank programme (ESMAP) to help developing countries move away from coal power and embrace renewable energy. To make a real impact on the reduction of coal power, UK government has established the Utilities Taskforce to become influential advocates for the PPCA.At international climate talks in Poland this year at COP24, the UK and Canada today will announce new members of the PPCA, committing to eradicating coal power while redirecting resources to renewables. Around 3.5 billion tons of coal are currently burnt globally for power every year, contributing to 45% of the world's emissions.The UK government has put moving to a cleaner, greener economy at the heart of its Industrial Strategy. Through the Clean Growth Grand Challenge, the transformation in the clean energy sector has contributed to the whole of the UK cutting its emissions by more than 40% since 1990 while growing the economy by more than two-thirds - the best performance on a per person basis of any G7 nation.But UK has always been clear that the move to a cleaner economy must be both public and private sector led, which is why the modern Industrial Strategy establishes clean growth as one of the greatest economic opportunities of our time - with heavy industry now set to also benefit from this new clean revolution and seize the vast global economic opportunity that comes with it.Power stations are also set to benefit too from the move to a cleaner economy. To make a real impact on the reduction of coal power, UK government is working with investors to establish the Utilities Taskforce - a group comprising companies which supply electricity to UK homes - to become powerful and influential advocates for the alliance and encourage investors to commit funds into the thriving clean energy market instead of investing in coal projects. Notes to editors1. The UK's modern Industrial Strategy set out 4 Grand Challenges - the long-term trends shaping change in our world today that present enormous potential for the UK economy. As part of this, at her speech in May, the Prime Minister recognised clean growth as a vast economic opportunity. Today's new Clean Growth mission will focus on reducing emissions from these industrial clusters over the coming years and follows the mission to Â£t least halve the energy use of all new buildings by 2030' launched by the Prime Minister in May.2. Up to \Â£3170 million funding for industry will be provided through a competitive process for clusters to research, develop and demonstrate at scale the innovative solutions to lead the way to a decarbonised industrial future. Both the \Â£3170 million Decarbonising Industry and the \Â£366 million Transforming Foundation Industry investment is subject to industry entering into partnership with government and providing significant co-investment to this challenge.3. These energy intensive clusters include Grangemouth, South Wales, Merseyside, Teesside, Humberside and Southampton. They are recognised as key to the UK economy but also as significant contributors to the UK's emissions.4. The government will also be supporting the transformation of our foundation industries (steel, glass, ceramics, chemicals) more broadly through providing up to \Â£366 million through the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund to develop radical new technologies and establish innovation centres of excellence in these sectors.5. In 2017 the government committed to phasing out unabated coal power by 2025 and launched the international Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA) - a voluntary coalition of governments, businesses and other organisations committed to ending the use of dirty coal power.6. Coal-fired power plants produce almost 40% of global electricity today, making carbon pollution from dirty coal a leading contributor to climate change.7. Great Britain\~is\~on track to deliver less than 5% of its electricity from coal for the first time since the first Industrial Revolution by 2025. \l"

The new funding could unlock an extra \Â£3156 million of private finance into renewable energy markets in Africa by 2023.Developers of small-scale solar, wind, hydro and geothermal projects will be supported to harness each country's natural resources, and the electricity generated is expected to provide 2.4 million people a year with new or improved access to clean energy. Power produced from new projects funded is expected to save around 3 million tonnes of carbon over their lifetime, compared with fossil fuel generation - the equivalent to the emissions from burning 21,000 railway cars of coal or from 800,000 cars in a year.Energy and Clean Growth Minister Claire Perry said:At home we're world leaders in cutting emissions while growing our economy and abroad we're showing our international leadership by giving countries a helping hand to shift to greener, cleaner economies.This \Â£3100 million will help communities harness the power of their natural resources to provide hundreds of thousands of people with electricity for the first time. Building these clean, reliable sources of energy will also create thousands of quality jobs in these growing green economies.The new investment is in addition to \Â£348 million previously committed to the REPP. The programme is already supporting 18 renewable energy projects in a range of countries from Tanzania to Burundi. These projects, featuring solar, wind, biomass, hydro and geothermal technologies, are expected to provide new or improved access for more than 4.5 million people over the project lifetimes, creating 8,000 jobs during development and operation.Expected results from some of the 18 projects already receiving support from REPP are: hydropower from the Nzoia River in Kenya, providing 290,000 people with energy and creating 330 jobs solar power for 70,000 people in Kilosa, Tanzania, including for 6,000 people who will have access to energy for the first time, creating 75 jobs in total mini grids in Nigeria which will provide 72 rural villages with pay-as-you-go clean, reliable energy, creating 2,500 jobs during construction and 430 when it's up and running biomass plants in Ebolowa and Edea, Cameroon, providing enough clean energy for 520,000 people in a rural area creating 460 jobs solar power to provide electricity for 87,600 people and business in Burundi, creating 300 part-time jobs and 50-full times posts a hydropower plant creating enough power for more than 90,000 people for the first time in a remote part of Tanzania, creating 80 jobs in totalThe funding is part of the UK's commitment to invest \Â£35.8 billion in international climate finance by 2020 to encourage ambitious action from other governments, the private sector and communities in the global effort to tackle climate change.To date, UK climate finance has: provided 17 million people with improved access to clean energy installed 590MW of clean energy.At COP24 the UK also announced: \Â£315.6 million to help countries vulnerable to climate change have a voice in United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations \Â£3771,000 to help developing countries take part in COP24 an additional \Â£345 million to the Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions' (NAMA) Facility, co-founded by the UK, to help reduce emissions within an economic sector an additional \Â£31 million for the Global Innovation Lab, which helps innovative climate finance proposals move more quickly to implementation and attract fundingNotes to editors1.

"COP24","UK","COP24_UK114","-Afdb-Private sector is the key to Africa's green economic transformation","December 18, 2018 Tuesday","ENP Newswire","Private sector is the key to Africa's green economic transformation.The private sector is key to mobilising green investment and sustainable development in Africa. Climate change presents a US$ 3 trillion investment opportunity in Africa by 2030. 75% of the investment is expected to come from the private sector to complement public sector financing. This calls for innovative approaches to attract and steer financial ?ows consistent with a pathway towards low-carbon and climate-resilient development.In addition to being a force for financing, the private sector in Africa is important in mitigating climate change and implementing adaptation measures. With SMEs constituting 95% of Africa's private sector - which is the continent's main energy user and greenhouse gas producer - ensuring that nascent and growing SMEs are not only climate-responsible but also helping curtail climate change is fundamental.Throughout Private Sector Day at the African Pavilion during COP24 in Katowice, a number of expert panellists stressed the need to ensure private sector development and involving financial sector actors in helping leverage opportunities for Africa to leapfrog to a climate-friendly trajectory.In sessions, including 'Harnessing synergies between market mechanisms and climate finance in Africa' and 'Greenpreneurs and ecoenterprises - climate resilient entrepreneurship and SME development', the need for global financial institutions to support low-carbon and climate-resilient investment schemes and enterprises was mentioned frequently; particularly the catalyst role of governments through enabling market and investment policies and mechanisms.On climate financing, the Paris Agreement established market mechanisms, including cooperative approaches and a new multilateral sustainable development mechanism in the future architecture of the climate regime. Gareth Phillips, Division Manager for Climate and Environment Finance at the African Development Bank, said:'In order to achieve tangible benefits for Africa, market mechanisms should build on those elements of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) reform that have enhanced participation in Africa, and continue to advocate further improvement of rules.Building bridges between market-based approaches and climate financing institutions is crucial to allow for rapid investments into emerging mechanisms, so that the policy instruments of the Paris Agreement can evolve in a 'learning-by-doing' approach.'Louise Brown, Senior Climate Change Advisor at the African Development Bank, spoke about the Adaptation Benefit Mechanism (ABM) that the African Development Bank has been piloting. She explained:'It's a results-based approach to incentivize the private sector to invest in adaptation, by creating a price signal for adaptation results. By assigning a unit of measurement and price to an adaptation result, such as dams built or climate-resilient livestock produced, we are able to price the outcomes of an adaptation project and create a mechanism where developers can go to investors and make a financial case for it.The ABM is governed and regulated through an architecture modelled on the CDM to ensure it is credible and can make the most of the legal structures that exist'.Ensuring strong contributions by African negotiators and policymakers to the COP24 processes will have a critical impact on the equitable participation of African countries in the mechanisms of the Paris Agreement and ensure adequate resources around mitigation challenges.Mbaye Diagne, Member of the CDM Executive Board and Managing Director of Afrique-Energie-Environnement - who was at the COP24 negotiations, said:'In Africa we haven't benefited from the CDM for many reasons. We weren't really involved when it came to building the rules in 2001 in Marrakesh. Our concerns were not taken into account. Now under the Paris agreement it's different; we weren't represented on the Executive Board of CDM but now we are.If we succeed in embarking on improvements within the new market mechanism that will be for the benefit of Africa.'However, he pointed out that negotiations had been difficult and that it is critical to advocate for and promote African positions and experiences through more visibility at key events like COP24. This can support Africa's efforts to contribute to shaping ongoing reforms and development of multilateral rules.Later in the discussions on the role of the private sector in being active against climate change, the importance of SMEs and entrepreneurship for a clean future for Africa was another message that rang through loud and clear. Muawia Shaddad from the Nile Basin Discourse who moderated the session on greenpreneurship set the tone when he said::'We'll need 600m jobs in Africa in 2030. SMEs have a huge part to play in this, and in helping to mitigate climate change effects. Development needs to be sustainable and green so we don't become part of the problem and entrepreneurship is critical to that'.From the blue economy to the green economy and agriculture, startups and growing SMEs in Africa have a responsibility to not only mitigate but to adapt to climate change. Hearing first hand from dynamic youth from Sudan, Seychelles and Canada who are leading in growing youth-led private sector development in a responsible and climate-friendly manner bought the responsibility and determination of Africa's youth in the effective implementation of the Paris Climate Change Agreement to the forefront.In the end, an enabling environment, the right skills and knowledge and derisking mechanisms for financial investments in green private sector development were reiterated by young entrepreneurs and Marcel Fodgo, Head of Climate Finance and Insurance at the National Climate Change Programme for the Government of Cote d'Ivoire.The African Development Bank's Jobs for Youth in Africa (JfYA) Strategy aims to support African countries in scaling up responses to youth unemployment and underemployment.It focuses on practical, high-impact solutions aimed at creating opportunities through education and training, jobs and a business environment conducive to youth entrepreneurship. The goal of the strategy is to create 25 million jobs for African youth over the next decade and to equip 50 million with a mix of hard and soft skills to increase their employability as well as their entrepreneurial success rate.[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uknewswire@enpublishing.co.uk\l"

It's not one iota of use making grand speeches advocating policies and objectives that the people do not sign up to. This is why having someone as respected as Sir David Attenborough as a leading 'voice' in the debate is so important.""Let us stop burning coal as soon as possible, turning to gas as a transition energy source until battery technology development makes renewables a full replacement. We should turn down our heating systems, and use less water. In particular, we should ensure protecting our climate and environment features in all of our thinking.

As with most of the climate change conferences in recent history, the backdrop is grim.The current pledges of national governments see us land somewhere between 3 and 5 degrees of warming by 2100The latest special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) set out in clear terms what is required from society to keep global temperatures from rising above 1.5 degrees, avoiding the disastrous impacts that we would see at just 2 degrees of warming. A 50% reduction in carbon emissions is needed by 2030 and reaching net-zero by mid-century. The current pledges of national governments see us land somewhere between 3 and 5 degrees of warming by 2100. HYPERLINK https://www.building.co.uk/communities/securing-a-greener-future-for-public-sector-estates/5096733.articleAlso read: Securing a greener future for public sector estatesTo coincide with the start of , the Secretary for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Michael Gove, has announced a consultation on mandating a ""biodiversity net gain"" in the development process. Such a law would require developers to assess the impacts and implications of their development on local ecosystems, ensuring that biodiversity stands to gain from any development, rather than suffer. In the words of Mr Gove, he believes that his government's ""commitment to protecting and enhancing our natural world can go hand in hand with our ambition to build more high quality homes.""Well, can it? Yes, of course it can. And it must. The biodiversity of the UK is vital for sustaining and protecting a healthy environment. Our agriculture sector, our air quality and the health of the population are all interlinked with the strength and complexion of nature's biodiversity. And as the built environment has such a hefty carbon footprint - with some estimates suggesting the sector is responsible for nearly half of the UK's carbon emissions - we have a duty to deliver buildings that serve both the environment and communities.In practice, mandating a 'biodiversity net gain' within the development process will require a step change in how we approach, design and deliver built assets. Architects and landscape architects will need to be involved from the nascent stages of the development process, working alongside planners and developers to understand the existing ecosystems and how the project can add to it. Factors such as the public realm and the green infrastructure will need to be reimagined to serve all the communities that occupy the site, human and non-human.But it can - and is - starting to be done both at scale but also increasingly on a development by development approach. Mitch Cooke, director of sustainability at Greengage, who work closely with Assael on a variety of schemes, notes that ""we are already seeing the adoption of Urban Greening Factors within planning policy, and developments being rejected at planning because they are haven't integrated enough biodiversity and green infrastructure.""In terms of delivery, development is hugely disruptive to local biodiversity. The preparation of a Biodiversity Impact Assessment before breaking ground on a project could, in some ways, opens up the possibilities for integrating new methods of procurement and construction. For instance, pre-manufacturing aspects of the development offsite can limit disruption to the local environment, as well reducing the carbon-intensity of the build process.This consultation is necessary, but not groundbreaking. The impacts of climate change require us to reimagine all aspects of our lives; the development process included. What's needed is more life-cycle thinking in development, which sees the built environment a series of interconnected entities that serve a common, unified purpose. The 'biodiversity net gain' consultation, and last month's Raynesford Review, hint towards this common purpose: creating sustainable, lasting communities that serve the health and wellbeing of those that live there. We'd do better to extend this purpose to the other species we share our land with.F\'e9licie Krikler is a director at Assael Architecture\l"

Today the EIB is presenting the findings of the first two parts of its survey.Despite encouraging trends in climate awareness across Europe, the survey shows that 20% of EU citizens still do not feel concerned when thinking about climate change. When compared to the United States and China, Europeans have a much stronger understanding of the challenges of climate change. 78% of Europeans describe themselves as being concerned or alarmed about climate change compared to 65% in China and 63% in the US.The survey also revealed that there is only a very small proportion of sceptical Europeans, 7% compared with 14% of US citizens who express scepticism about climate change.Jonathan Taylor, EIB Vice President responsible for climate action and environment said: 'The EIB Climate Survey sends an important signal to delegates at COP24 in Katowice, that citizens are increasingly aware of the challenges posed by climate change. This is key to the international climate debate, because citizens already are making a difference through their individual actions. It is now up to businesses, citizens, governments at all levels and public institutions to use this momentum and work together. The EIB stands ready to play its part'.Regarding the public's perception of the impact of climate action on job creation and economic growth, the survey found that EU citizens are more pessimistic than their Chinese and US counterparts: Europeans express greater concern about the financial impact of climate change. 55% of Europeans consider that the financial impact of climate change will affect them personally - as compared to 40% of Chinese and 45% of US respondents. According to the survey, Americans are also the most optimistic regarding the economic benefits of measures to combat climate change: 26% believe the effect of climate action can be positive on the economy in contrast to only 21% of Europeans and 11% of Chinese.Against this backdrop, the European Investment Bank (EIB) is committed to serve as one of the largest sources of finance worldwide to fight climate change: the EIB has invested over EUR 130bn globally, supporting the delivery of over EUR 600bn in climate action investment since 2011 - roughly the equivalent of the Polish GDP.Monica Scatasta, the Head of Environment, Climate and Social Policy at the EIB, said: 'Finance is a key factor in the global fight against climate change and its negative impacts. At the EIB, we strongly believe that financing climate action is also key to harness growth and innovation opportunities. We are convinced that measures aimed at addressing climate change can also generate sizeable benefits for economic growth and create a significant number of new jobs. But public finance alone, including from international institutions, is not sufficient. Investors, entrepreneurs and all economic actors have a role to play against the threats of climate change. At the EIB we are working alongside our partners to help mobilise these forces for climate action'.Key chartsClimate change seen by EU citizens - strong contrast between North and South in the EUEIB climate surveyClimate change perception: comparing the EU with the USA and ChinaEIB climate surveyIn terms of levels of concern towards climate change, the EU comes first, ahead of China and the USA.

"COP24","UK","COP24_UK124","-Utrecht University: Oceans offering solutions to combat climate change","October 5, 2018 Friday","ENP Newswire","The world's oceans offer unexplored solutions to counter the adverse effects of climate change like ocean warming, ocean acidification and sea level rise.An international team of world leading experts in marine science, geoengineering and climate change, including Earth scientist Jack Middelburg at Utrecht University, evaluated the potential of thirteen different ocean-based measures to lessen the impact of climate change, such as the development of renewable marine energy sources, creating marine protected areas or relocating coral reefs. Their findings are published in Frontiers in Marine Science.Global efforts to combat climate change and its impacts have so far largely focused on land-based actions while relatively little attention has been paid to the potential of ocean-based solutions, the researchers write. These solutions could reduce the magnitude and rate of ocean warming, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, while they could also play a significant role in helping to reduce global warming and its impacts on the rest of the planet.'The world's oceans already regulate the effects of global warming by removing about a quarter of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The ocean has the potential to remove and store much more,' says Jack Middelburg, professor of Geochemistry at Utrecht University and the Netherlands Earth System Science Centre. 'Collectively, we've assessed the effectiveness of thirteen potential ocean-based solutions to reduce the causes of climate change, and to lessen adverse impacts on vulnerable marine ecosystems, like coral reefs.'Assessed solutionsThe different measures that were analysed were selected on the basis of the frequency with which they are addressed in the scientific literature and were grouped in four different categories:reducing causes of climate change, for example by developing renewable marine energy sources or restoring marine plant life to capture more carbon;preserving ecosystems by creating marine protected areas and prohibiting overexploitation of resources;reducing the effects of solar radiation by changing the ocean reflectivity;manipulating biological and ecological adaptation, for example by relocating coral reefs.The solutions were compared to each other in terms of respective risks and benefits. 'Marine renewable energy and solutions based on carbon storage by plants offer numerous benefits and are easy to implement. In contrast, measures based on the control of solar radiation, which is global, are controversial in the scientific community because of numerous technological unknowns and the risks. Evaluating such actions enables us to inform policymakers on the risks associated with them,' explains lead author dr. Jean-Pierre Gattuso, research director at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS).COP24The researchers find that the various solutions described are not equally realistic, effective, or even appropriate, but do constitute concrete actions that merit study by government and society in unison. The scientists hope their analysis will inform decision-makers gathering in Katowice, Poland, for the COP24 conference in early December.[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uknewswire@enpublishing.co.uk\l"

PR consultant Ingmar Rentzhog's We Don't Have Time climate change PR agency used Miss Thunberg's image to gain funds for his firm, according to Climate Change Dispatch.{\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\parBut the publication said the teenager's family deny being aware that she would be used in this way, and have since cut ties with Mr Rentzhog's organisation.Miss Thunberg said: 'I was briefly a youth adviser for the board of the non profit foundation We Don't Have Time. 'It turns out they used my name as part of another branch of their organisation that is a start up business. They have admitted clearly that they did so without the knowledge of me or my family. 'I no longer have any connection to We Don't Have Time. Nor has anyone in my family. They have deeply apologised and I have accepted their apology.'Mr Rentzhog told Vice: 'They think that I am the PR genius behind Greta. That I write her speeches and arrange meetings for her with journalists. That's simply not true.'It was also revealed earlier this year that Miss Thunberg's school strike coincided with the launch of a book about climate change written by her mother, well known opera singer Malena Ernman, according to Swiss magazine Die Weltwoche. The publication said that on the day of the book's release, Mr Rentzhog published a picture of Miss Thunberg in action to his firm's Instagram, having taken a photographer along to the school strike. He also posted an article about her on Facebook, starting the first of the teenager's publicity. Yet Miss Thunberg denied that the book launch had anything to do with her personal school strike. Writing on Facebook, she said: 'My family has written a book together about our family and how me and my sister Beata have influenced my parents way of thinking and seeing the world, especially when it comes to the climate. And about our diagnoses.'That book was due to be released in May. But since there was a major disagreement with the book company, we ended up changing to a new publisher and so the book was released in August instead.Swedish journalist Henrik Alexandersson also claimed that Miss Thunberg's much-reported on speech to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poland in December 2018 was delivered to an empty room.However clips and photographs from her speech - which went viral - fail to prove or disprove the claim as they centre mainly on the teenager.\l"

We do this by optimizing the value of our hydrocarbons. Kuwait's refineries are being updated and building up new units will help in reaching the capacity that we are aiming to produce in the future.The global oil market has been fluctuating over the past few years with unpredictable trends of prices but it has not really affected the Kuwait oil sector per se in cutbacks and investments or in the capital projects. It broadens the ideas, and the expansions, and the visions of the oil sector into investing into other diversified options.In terms of diversification of solar or renewable energy, Kuwait has already started executive steps in renewable energy projects. This started when State of Kuwait committed at the COP18, United Nations at Doha to contribute to climate change mitigation. This set the roadmap for a renewable energy vision.\~In terms of solar energy, we started late but we are moving fast. The key driver is the vision of his highness, the Emir of Kuwait, to see Kuwait utilising 15% of energy through renewables by 2030. The Al Dibdibah Solar Park is one of the biggest projects in the world, a 1.5-GW plant, which will be commissioned in early 2021. It's a country initiative.\~The project consists of five SGUs - solar generating units. Each SGU is estimated to generate 300 MW DC. The estimated number of solar panels that will be used in the project is 6m solar panels. The main objective of the project is to generate 3150 KWh in the year 25 after commissioning. It's a unique model. We are really confident that our project will meet the objective.\~The project also will promote investments from foreign and also local manufacturers and companies. Contractors have to comply with the Kuwaiti law with respect to a secure 30% of material from local companies or manufacturers as well as the 30% also from services inside Kuwait. Also there is opportunity for supplying materials from outside Kuwait like inverters, solar panels, and also the technology and the applications of solar systems and other systems. So this project definitely will create opportunity for investment from outside and inside Kuwait.Also we impose Kuwaitisation requirements as per Kuwaiti law in the the contract and the tender documents.\~The clean fuel projects and all the mega-projects implemented now in Kuwait will help recruiting more Kuwaiti nationals in the oil sector. The market is available for all Kuwaitis. All the majors that we require to be worked in the oil sector are available in Kuwait University and all private universities where we have specialisations towards petroleum engineering, petrochemical engineering, electrical engineering. And with having them, they will be having the best training required to fulfill therequirements of these new projects. We are going to train our employees and prepare the new generations towards fulfilling those goals, being a global world-class integrated refining and petrochemical player in the world.Implementing and maintaining the world-class standard for operational excellence, to achieve sustainable leadership in oil and gas industry, is one of the KPC's common 2040 strategy directions.

"COP24","UK","COP24_UK135","-AfDB-Cleaning up the transport sector in African cities","December 12, 2018 Wednesday","ENP Newswire","Cleaning up the transport sector in African cities.Africa is the continent with the most rapidly growing urban population, at an estimated annual rate of 3%. The surge in population is paired with rapid urbanisation and increased transportation. Consequently, emissions from transportation are growing significantly all across Africa, further driven by urban sprawl, rapid motorization and low levels of institutional capacity to manage traffic and its impact.The exponential increase in transportation brings with it a worsening urban air quality. Emissions from transport-related sources are a major cause of chronic respiratory-related illnesses and premature deaths in Africa. It is estimated that 90% of urban air pollution in developing countries is attributable to vehicle emissions. The World Health Organization has calculated that 176,000 deaths per year in Africa are due to outdoor air pollution.At an event hosted by the African Development Bank, at the COP24, on transport emissions monitoring and mapping, attendees and speakers exchanged experiences on developing cleaner and more efficient transport infrastructure.The speakers agreed that governments are not acting quickly enough in addressing the worsening urban air quality situation in the region. One of the reasons offered was the lack of reliable data on air pollution levels due to weak and non-existent air quality monitoring networks in several countries. This makes it harder for local and regional governments to take coordinated action to tackle the sources of air pollution.'Standards are important in this area. The first standard to be respected is to protect human health. These standards must be adapted to each government and to the specificities of each region,' stated Mark Radka, chief of energy and climate at UNEP.Another reason for weak government support for air pollution measures was thought to be the limited regional evidence of the environmental and human health impact of air pollution, and the exact magnitude of the associated health risks.To address these gaps in both knowledge and collaborative action to address air pollution, there is a need to develop a systematic assessment and approach to guide governments, key municipal stakeholders, and policy-makers on the most effective ways to collect, store and analyse data, and map air pollution levels within cities.A study by the African Development Bank on the topic 'Transport Emission, Mapping, Monitoring and Capacity Building in 5 selected African countries', proposes several recommendations to strengthen the coordination of air quality efforts in African cities, by integrating mandatory quantitative air quality components in environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) to establishing institutional frameworks and basel"

It's technically and economically possible, it's an opportunity and, moreover, there's a demand from society that demands future answers.For his part, Victor Vinuales explained that 'climate is one of the pillars of the United Nations Agenda 2030 and it is a challenge that we cannot face individually. Collective action through alliances reinforces our chances of success, so our goal with this initiative is to expand the level of commitment reached to the largest possible number of stakeholders'.The vice-president of the Spanish United Nations Global Compact Network added that 'to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), we need collective action, government commitment, private sector drive, awareness and metrics'.Moving for Climate NOW brings together over 40 participants from different countries and organisations, who will travel more than 600 kilometres by electric bicycle with the common objective of making society aware of the need to act urgently against climate change using all the mechanisms available.The bicycle rally will depart from Vienna on Monday, 26 November, and pedal to Katowice (Poland), the city that hosts this year's Climate Summit, where they will arrive on Sunday 2 December.Upon arrival, the members of Moving for Climate NOW will deliver the initiative's Manifesto to the United Nations Executive Secretariat for Climate Change.

Looking at the streets of Paris, you could be forgiven for thinking the collapse had already begun.Action is being taken, of course, though it seems painfully slow.

It was co-hosted by KAIST Graduate School of Green Growth and Coalition for Our Common Future under the theme of ""Hothouse Earth? How to Mobilize the Change for Our Sustainable Future"". Steve Zhu (Founder, Wealedger Technology Co., Ltd.) was invited to attend the conference and delivered a speech at the ""Blockchain: Carbon Reduction and Fine Dust"" session.The conference consists of 5 parts that are ""Trajectories of Earth Climate System: Where Are We Heading and What Needs to Be Done?"" ""How to Finance the Change We Need to Have"", ""Korean Strategy of North-East Asia Super Grid"", ""Blockchain: Carbon Reduction and Fine Dust"" and ""Voices from the Young"". Attendees also concluded Korea government officials and global climate experts. There are Chang Hee Kang (Chairman of Climate Change Center, Former Speaker of the 19th National Assembly), Hyoung Kwon Ko (Vice Minister, Ministry of Economy and Finance of the Republic of Korea), Park Chun Kyoo (Vice Minister of Environment) and others.Sung Chul Shin, President of KAIST, delivered a welcoming speech, ""the goal of green growth and sustainable development is to promote cooperation, integration and social attention among countries to achieve new economic development.""The ""Blockchain: Carbon Reduction and Fine Dust"" session was held at 15:20 on that day. The conference was hosted by Kim, Sungwoo (Head, Environment and Energy, Kim and Chang). The speakers were Kwon, Sei-joong (Director-General, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of Korea), Steve Zhu (Founder, Wealedger), and Anton Galenovich (Founder, DAO Integral Platform for Climate Initiatives) and Tom Baumann (The Founder and Co-Chair, Climate Chain Coalition).In the session, Steve Zhu delivered a profound speech entitled ""Carbon Emission with Blockchain - the Innovative Way to Go"", showing the audiences how Wealedger used blockchain to provide several solutions to carbon emission reduction challenges.Wealedger committed to the blockchain technology and its related industry-level application development. Steve Zhu introduced that Wealedger started from Shenzhen and are gradually conducting business in Shanghai, Chengdu, Beijing, Hong Kong, Seoul, Silicon Valley, New York, Zug, Berlin and etc. Its strategic positioning is based on technology development platform, financial innovation consultant and business transformation expert. Its success is based on two types of chain: Zhongxin-Chain and Xinyun-Chain. Wealedger has successfully implemented many innovative solutions in different scenarios such as digital IP, traceability, charity, fitness, supply chain finance, logistic finance and etc.Steve Zhu proposed three major challenges of carbon emission reduction:1. Lack of credible carbon emission databases around the world, especially data collection standards and methods. Centralized database led to lack of trusted data.2. Global Carbon trading is inactive. Generally, ERPA (Emission Reductions Purchase Agreement) for primary carbon credits is not standardized. And access threshold is high, only limited experts and investors can play the game.3. Global attention and engagement are not enough. Lack of systematic relevance to everyone's daily life. Lack of motivation and education for the public.In response to the three challenges, Steve Zhu also gave the solutions: trusted data, encrypted transaction and incentive.Details as follow:1. Help government and enterprise to build blockchain IoT based carbon emission data collection, which improve the data transparency, efficiency, and irreversibility. (Data generally come from smart electricity meter, aerial detection, sewage detection and other sensors.) In addition, Wealedger's blockchain tech can provide an investment platform for carbon emission reduction projects in developing countries.2. Establish a decentralized carbon exchange based on blockchain. In the exchange, participants can use carbon emissions to accumulate credits and use the credits to conduct transactions. Build Carbon DEX and use smart contract to define the right trading mechanism in a global vision. The carbon trading threshold can be significantly reduced, thereby effectively increasing the activity and participation of carbon trading.3. Create a personal carbon incentive mechanism based on blockchain. Wealedger used blockchain to link the encrypted Carbon-DEXwith eco-friendly products, and when eco contribution occurs like ""public transportation"", ""recycle products"", ""new energy vehicles"", ""daily eco saving"", Token or point could be rewarded as incentive. Points could be exchanged for eco-friendly products. Through such an incentive plan, improve the relevance to everyone's daily life, and encourage everyone to actively participate in carbon emission reduction rather than a bystander.At the meeting, Sukhbaatar Tsegmid (Chairman, the Mongolian State-owned Energy Company) asked: It is all-known that modern technology's development would cause eco damage. As a modern technology, the bitcoin network is very energy-intensive. How to balance the relationship between the two when using blockchain to promote eco protection?Steve Zhu responded: It was a really bad practice to build an eco-friendly DAPP based on Bitcoin and Ethereum. We should reconstruct a climate and energy friendly public chain that meets eco requirements. He appealed to work together to build a global blockchain ecology. Wealedger could provide blockchain technologies, including but not limited to middleware and basic DAPP development.The final part is to introduce the Copenhagen P4G summit's results, which Moon Jae-in (the Republic of Korea's President) has attended, and discuss how to continue to implement the results. As the only female entrepreneur representative to visit Copenhagen with the President, Lee Soo-young (KOLON ECO ONE Group CEO) gave a wonderful speech at this session, and announced that KOLON ECO ONE and Wealedger were co-researching how to implement the CarbonBloc project.Steve Zhu has been highly recognized in the conference. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea also invited Steve Zhu to attend the upcoming COP24 in Poland, further promoting the eco-friendly public chain advocated by Steve Zhu.(COP24 refers to the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. COP24 will take place from 3-14 December 2018, in Katowice, Poland. One of its most important tasks is to develop and adopt a set of decisions to ensure the full implementation of the Paris Agreement.)Steve Zhu's visit to South Korea for the 5th Seoul Climate-Energy Conference strongly suggests Wealedger's globalization strategy. Wealedger has more and more prominent appearances in the world, and its international influence is also constantly improving.Seoul Climate-Energy Conference: Since 2014, it has gathered global climate experts, scholars, universities, legislatures and media with a focus on climate change, energy issues, and specific solutions for sustainable developments. It conducted a special session to discuss the Copenhagen P4G Summit's results and Korea government's future tasks. It has conveyed the main results to the global leaders.

This agreement forces the 195 signing countries to reduce CO2 emissions into the atmosphere derived from industrial activity, electric energy, heating and transport.Capturing the excess of CO2 emissions and guaranteeing its secure storage in deep geological formations is a fundamental strategy to limit the greenhouse effect and stop global warming. According to Juan Alcalde, 'we are not going to reach our objectives on reducing the CO2 emissions unless we implement this and other technologies, and increase the production and work on renewable energies'.The geological reservoirs that enable CO2 storage 'have to be porous and permeable rocks -covered by other non-porous and impermeable rocks to act as a seal- so that the injected CO2 stays in the sub-seafloors and does not go back to the surface', says researcher Xenia Ogaya, from the Department of Earth and Ocean Dynamics of the UB. 'In general, we select rocks in sedimentary formations that are already storing other fluids (such as hydrocarbon or water) so we are more certain the seal is functional, since they have been storing these fluids for thousands or even millions of years. Lately, the storing in basalts has been studied as well, in Iceland, but project is still being worked on.What happens when CO2 is injected in the sub-seafloor?The authors of the new study, in which experts of the University of Edinburgh (United Kingdom) take part, have added an outstanding volume of data at a global scale on natural CO2 and methane (CH4) storing, projects of gas storing and activity of the hydrocarbon industry (natural gas storing, injection sounding and laboratory experiments).'This is a complex database, which took us almost four years to complete and which enables us to understand what happens with CO2 when it is injected in the sub-seafloor', points out Juan Alcalde.In the study, researchers created a CO2 geological storing model, which enabled them to work on simulations of predictions on the behaviour of stored has for the next 10,000 years. As scientific fresh news, this study gathers all the available information on the factors and processes that take part in gas storage: for instance, the natural trapping of CO2 inside the rocks through microscopic bubbles, or its dissolution in the water which occurs inside some rocky formations in the subfloor.'The security of CO2 storage is an understandable concern for citizens and governments. Our job shows subfloor storage of this gas is secure on the long run, and therefore, it is a fundamental tool to fight climate change', notes Alcalde.'The obtained predictions offer valuable information on the security and efficiency related to different storage projects', highlights researcher Xenia Ogaya, who collaborated in the development of the mathematical models that enabled the researchers to make the predictions on the behaviour of CO2 in subfloors once it was injected'.Researcher Stephanie Flude (University of Edinburgh), who co-leads the research study, notes that 'the selected inputs to build our models are conservative but realistic. It is important to highlight that those simulations that were made out of data from areas with a strict regulation of the hydrocarbon industry activity -like the North Sea- retained more than 90 % of the injected carbon dioxide after 10,000 years in 95 % of the cases'.[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uknewswire@enpublishing.co.uk\l"

The study has found that despite the general notion of land degradation in populous countries from over-exploitation, China has set up a replicable example by rolling out ambitious programs to conserve and expand forests and effective measures to address global warming.The finding released by NASA on Twitter has won appreciation from Internet users across the world. In addition to NASA's satellite images reflecting global greening, two remotely sensed satellite images showing the transformation of the Kubuqi Desert in northern China have once again become popular on the Internet.Changes in ELION Desertification Control Area in Kubuqi. Source: Remotely Sensed Satellite Data of Chinese Academy of ForestryThe sharp increase in forest area in China is made possible thanks to enduring afforestation efforts guided by the proposition that ""lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets,"" including the 40-year-long Three North Shelter belt Forest Program, and the desertification control project in Kubuqi carried out by Elion Resources Group (ELION) since over 30 years ago. China's ""outsized contribution"" to global greening trend demonstrates that the country has been proactively taking up its responsibilities to address climate change through emissions reduction and carbon sink increase.In particular, the growth of carbon sinks matters a great deal, as ""one hectare of forest can absorb 1,005 kg of carbon dioxide and provide 735 kg of oxygen every day, and conserve over 500 metric tons of water every year,"" said Wang Wenbiao, Chairman of ELION, at UNFCCC COP24 held in Katowice, Poland in December 2018.""At a conservative estimate, 36 million km2 of land on the planet has been desertified, which is 100 times the size of Poland,""he continued. As the leader of desertification control in the Kubuqi Desert, and a winner of the Lifetime Achievement Award as a ""Champion of the Earth,""Wang proposed the Global Desert Afforestation Initiative for Carbon Sink Increase at COP 24, and offered a breakdown analysis of its possible benefits forthe representatives attending the conference, who heatedly discussed the successful Kubuqi Model in desertification control.As noted by Wang, desertification control through afforestation is one of the most important solutions to climate change. The restored deserts are the best carbon sinks, contributing to carbon sequestration and water resource conservation.Wang's proposalin the Initiative that the 30 million km2 of desertified land on earth shall be utilized appropriately to help increase forest carbon sinks and address climate change was appreciated by Jorge Chediek, Envoy of the Secretary-General on South-South Cooperation, as an innovative example for the world to follow.At the conference, Wang shared the theories, technologies, experience and models used in the Kubuqi desert control project, where the successful practice of increasing forest carbon sinks has proved that desert control and greening are essential to combating climate change.What Wang proposed at the conference comes from ELION's groundbreaking exploration led by him over the past 30 years: deserts, rather than negative assets, are regarded as a source of organic fruit and vegetable, and solar energy; new techniques invented by ELION such as the minimally invasive planting have helped improve the efficiency of desert control at a geometric rate and lower the cost by over 50%; the greening project also helps alleviate poverty and improve employment, creating a beautiful and wealthy community.Over the past 30 years, with the support of governments at all levels in China, ELION has reclaimed more than 6,000 km\'b2 of desert land, which helps sequester 15.4 million metric tons of carbon, conserves 24.38 billion m3 of water resource, and produces 18.3 million metric tons of oxygen.According to world's first ecological wealth report released by the UN in 2017, the Kubuqi desertification control project carried out by ELION has created over RMB 500 billion of ecological wealth, and helped lift 102,000 people out of poverty. The result was confirmed in a report issued by experts from authoritative academic institutions in China in 2018, such as the Chinese Academy of Forestry. The achievements made by ELION in Kubuqi over the past three decades were reviewed in the report on the basis of credible data, including the MODIS data from NASA.The efforts made by ELION in massive desertification control and industry development have been highly recognized by the Chinese government and international organizations including the UN. On April 22, 2014, or the 45th Earth Day, the ELION eco-restoration zone in the Kubuqi Desert was identified by the UN as a global ecological economy demonstration zone.On December 15, 2018, it was recognized by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of China as an innovation base for the implementation of the proposal of Chinese President Xi Jinping that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets.For the approach to increasing forest carbon sinks through desert forestation, Wang expects that if all stakeholders work together more closely to turn 10% of the desertified land on earth to forests in the next decade, the carbon sinks will increase by 100,000 metric tons and water resource by 150,000 metric tons globally each day, and more than 100 million people will be lifted out of poverty.Media ContactCompany Name: Discover KubuqiContact Person: Max DuEmail: Send EmailCountry: ChinaWebsite: HYPERLINK http://www.reachpartner.cnhttp://www.reachpartner.cn\l"

The challenge was to show disengaged young people that the UN drives real change and makes a difference to people's lives. That's where WPP agencies came in.BIG CHALLENGE, BIG IDEA To prove that the UN can drive real change, Grey London tapped into a new wave of activism to give everyone a chance to have their say at the crucial climate change talks, COP24. Grey London's idea was to create a new seat at the UN, The People's Seat, the first seat in UN history not to represent a nation or a specific interest but the world's people. It would give them the opportunity to speak directly to decision makers.To launch The People's Seat, the team needed the right delegate. Sir David Attenborough was chosen for his authority and resonance with young people. He agreed and invited the world to #TAKEYOURSEAT in a social media campaign to rally the public. Social media users worldwide shared their fears, thoughts and experiences of climate change. Grey London used Instagram's network of influencers and innovative formats such as Stories and Stickers to tell a mass audience there was a new way to make their voice heard and drive action.With their messages collated, two weeks later, on 3 December at COP24, Attenborough gave the first People's Seat Address to the UN - 19 million watched the Facebook Live video of the speech on Facebook.ONGOING ACTION Attenborough's speech also unveiled Actnow.bot - a chatbot for the UN designed to speak to people globally and encourage users to tackle climate change in their everyday life.Grey London and partner WPP agencies also had to overcome challenges such as the need to adhere to UN protocols and undertake global negotiations to get the parties involved to agree to creating The People's Seat.STANDOUT RESULTS ? 1.3 billion reach globally through earned media (1_30z] Kbx^2x0) and no media spend ? 19 million watched the Facebook Live video of the speech on Facebook ? 1600 English-language articles, including front-page news in three UK newspapers ?

Leading climate scientists have recently warned that unless we act now, we have just 12 years before global warming risks drought, floods and extreme heat. Despite these stark warnings, the climate crisis is being almost entirely ignored by the Conservative government.Of course, Brexit is one major reason why every other issue is being pushed to the side. Gone are the days of David Cameron's forays into the Arctic with huskies. The Tories are frankly as environmentally friendly as a dustbin fire.It is therefore no surprise to me that tens of thousands of students will walk out of lessons to raise awareness of the climate crisis, including in my Oxfordshire constituency.Inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist, , who held a solo protest outside the Swedish parliament, this movement has now seen from 70,000 schoolchildren each week across 270 towns and cities worldwide.As a former teacher, I know how frustrating it must be to watch students walk out of class, particularly if they have important exams on the horizon. But, given the gravity and urgency of this issue, I support this strike, and the students, wholeheartedly.In fact, I think the strike is what we call in the professiona ""teachable moment"". OK, lessons may not go to plan, but if I was their teacher, I'd be using the strike to discuss the physics behind climate change (I was a science teacher), the benefits of activism, and why this issue is important to them. I would also, however, encourage the students to be responsible. That means being safe and ensuring they make up for the work they will be missing.At the end of the day, I trust the judgement of head teachers to decide if they should authorise the absences. However, I'm sure many heads will feel hamstrung by fears that they'll be taken to court, as rules around absences are currently being interpreted particularly strictly. I'm concerned that many will be forced to come down hard on students.This raises the wider point that head teachers should be given more discretion on whether to authorise pupil absences. I believe, as do the Liberal Democrats, that a system in which up to 10 days' absence within term time per year can be authorised with the support of the head teacher - I believe this system would resolve the current issue.That said, the message from these students in protest today is to demand better for our environment. When Liberal Democrats were in a coalition government from 2010, we more than trebled investment in renewable power, helped developed Britain's offshore wind industry into a world leader and secured an EU-wide agreement on new ambitious climate change targets for 2030. But this progress is not being taken forward by the Tories.Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent MindsWhat we want to see is a carbon neutral Britain by 2050, backed by a suite of policies like new financial regulations to promote green finance and fast track away from fossil fuels to create an economy that is truly green and sustainable. It would be a radical solution to an imminent problem. My challenge to other parties is they need to be just as radical, and we cannot wait for them to catch up.These strikes are a call for us MPs to take much stronger action on the climate crisis. In 2018, there were just three debates on climate change, and just one of those was in the main chamber of the House of Commons. While Labour MP Anna McMorrin's Westminster Hall debate on - otherwise known as the 2018 United Nations - last month was excellent, it was only given one hour of parliamentary time. This is nowhere longenoughfor MPs to express their views, especially considering the UK has bid to hold the crucial UN climate change conference in 2020. That's why I'm working with groups of MPs from all political parties to find a way to debate the issue on the floor of the house.After all, that's what the students are challenging us to do. Act now, for their futures. It is vital that MPs take the issue of climate change seriously and support the students in their activism. They can rest assured that I certainly do.Layla Moran is a Liberal Democrat MP for Oxford West and Abingdon\l"

There has been no significant global warming for over two decades.If the group which advocates that global warming is real, is due to increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere and will lead to catastrophic future climactic\~events and has clear evidence of this, why will they not debate this hypothesis with a panel of scientists of varied views\~in an\~open televised debate?Of all the doomsday predictions not one of them has come true.Polar bears should be extinct by now but their numbers are higher than they have been in many years.The main coral reefs should all have died out but in fact they are all still there and mostly in good health.The polar ice caps would disappear leading to massive increases in sea levels yet the sum of the Arctic and Antarctic icepacks has remained about constant as confirmed by recent satellite data and sea level rises have remained the same at about 1.3mm/year.There would be massive increases in rainfall, droughts, floods, hurricanes, etc but none of these events have increased in numbers or magnitude over the last 100 years or more The scaremongers have led people to believe that CO2 is a polluting gas but without it life on earth would cease to exist.\~ In some geological periods the CO2 content of the air has been up to 20 times today's content and there was no runaway temperature increase.Higher CO2 levels lead to higher crop yields which could ameliorate\~the problem of providing the food for an ever increasing world population.Meanwhile we are all eagerly awaiting the 24th Conference of the Parties (COP24) in Poland when 30,000 attendees will use thousands of tons of fuel flying in from every corner of the world.Gilbert PatonKnutsford\l"

Game of Thrones -style clash on the Zambezi floodplains of Zimbabwe between two rival packs led by alpha females - the ageing matriarch Tait and her oldest daughter, Blacktip.Over the episode, the fourth in the BBC series, Tait's group faced threats from lions and hyenas after being forced into hostile territory by Blacktip's pack.Yet the programme ended with Tait's group recovering, gaining old hunting grounds and new numbers when the leadership passed to Tait's youngest daughter, Tammy, after the death of her mother from a lion attack. Viewers were told the family's future appeared secure.Since the BBC crew finished filming two years ago, however, only a single pup, a male, has survived from 17 born to Tammy in three litters. Born seven months ago, and named Atten by researchers in honour of the broadcaster, his survival remains uncertain.""What has happened to Tait's pack since Dynasties was filmed epitomises the attrition rate among painted wolves,"" Nicholas Dyer, who has photographed the animals for six years, told The Times Last week Mr Dyer, from the Painted Wolf Foundation, returned to the Mana Pools National Park where was filmed. He added: ""We can't be sure that Atten will survive. The rains have just started and it is harder to hunt now, but in Mana Pools the painted wolves are at least lucky that they are facing only natural threats. In other human populated areas, they are shot, snared and succumb to domestic dog diseases like rabies and distemper.""The BBC followed Tait's and Blacktip's packs for two years, and became the first to film the animals at night when they are most active. Among the most dramatic scenes was the snatching of one of Tait's pups by hyenas, who devoured it in front of the helpless mother.Only 6,600 painted wolves, previously known as African wild dogs, are left in Africa, down from half a million a century ago. Each animal has unique markings and the species shares a common ancestry with the wolf rather than domestic dogs. They were classified as endangered in 2016. Blacktip's pack has given birth to two litters, with most pups surviving, since the BBC crew left. Attenborough will tell a UN conference on climate change in Poland today that failure to cut emissions will result in catastrophe for the planet. He will take up the ""people's seat"", warning of the effects of extreme weather on millions of people's homes and livelihoods.\l"

Extreme weather has affected all continents, while the melting of sea ice and glaciers and rises in sea levels continue. The past four years have been the hottest on record, and the 20 warmest have occurred in the past 22 years.The warming trend is unmistakeable and shows we are running out of time to tackle climate change, according to the https://www.wmo.int/pages/index_en.htmlWorld Meteorological Organi HYPERLINK https://www.wmo.int/pages/index_en.htmlzation, which on Thursday published its provisional \~ HYPERLINK https://www.wmo.int/pages/index_en.htmlstatement on the State of the Climate in 2018.

The year started with a weak La Ni\'f1a event but by October there were signs of a return to El Ni\'f1o conditions, which can raise global temperatures further.There were a greater number of violent storms than usual, including 70 tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere, compared with the long-term average of 53. Storms brought devastation to the Mariana Islands, the Philippines, Vietnam, the Korean peninsula and Tonga, while hurricanes HYPERLINK https://www.wmo.int/pages/index_en.htmlFlorence and Michael caused substantial damage in the US.Wildfires raged in HYPERLINK https://www.wmo.int/pages/index_en.htmlGreece, Canada, \~ HYPERLINK https://www.wmo.int/pages/index_en.htmlCalifornia and other areas, while floods devastated \~ HYPERLINK https://www.wmo.int/pages/index_en.htmlKerala in India and displaced more than 1.4 million people. Japan also experienced serious flooding, as did east Africa.Petteri Taalas, the secretary general of the WMO, a leading authority on climate change, said: ""We are not on track to meet climate targets and rein in temperature increases. If we exploit all known fossil fuel resources, the temperature rise will be considerably higher.""We are the first generation to fully understand climate change and the last generation to be able to do something about it.""Manaenkova added that every effort to reduce greenhouse gases and the impacts of climate change was worthwhile. ""Every bit matters,"" she said, citing the harm done by temperature rises to every aspect of life, including economic productivity, food security, glacier melt and water supplies, and the future of low-lying islands and coastal communities.Jens Mattias Clausen, Greenpeace's head of delegation at the UN climate change conference ( HYPERLINK https://www.wmo.int/pages/index_en.htmlCOP24 ) in Poland, said: ""The evidence, if we needed any more, continues to stack up.

It's an ambitious aim. Global temperatures are already rapidly approaching the 1.5?C target and the 2?C limit is not far away.If we are to achieve this, it is imperative that we stop burnhopes ing fossil fuels. There is simply no long-term plan that doesn't include cutting our net fossil carbon emissions to zero - and our present trajectory suggests we're not on track.The scientific consensus is that we need to do this by 2050 to meet the 2?C target. But if we want to avoid going above 1.5?C warming, this latest global conference, known as COP24, should see the world setting a much earlier target date: 2035.The UN has accepted that there is no obvious pathway to zero emissions in such a short time frame, so it has pegged its on NETs - Negative Emissions Technologies - coming to our rescue.These include carbon capture and storage, which involves sucking CO2 from the air and storing it deep underground.Globally, we emit around 40 billion tons of CO2 every year - so another aim of this UN conference must be for us to develop major forms of carbon removal technology, starting immediately. But CO2 isn't the only problem. We emit other greenhouse gases, such as methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which all contribute to climate change.Methane is on the rise and is 84 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2. It comes from cows and it leaks from oil wells and coal mines as ""fugitive methane"".It is also seeping out of the melt-ing permafrost in the Arctic. This is a worrying form of ""positive feedback"", where global warming causes the further release of gases that cause further warming.Nitrous oxide, which is 300 times more potent than CO2, is rising, too, caused by modern agriculture. And the concentration of refrigerant gases, such as CFCs, which are thousands of times more potent than CO2, is not falling as fast as we had hoped. If we can stabilise non-CO2 greenhouse emissions at presentday levels, we'll be doing well, but concentrations are rising fast.All of this is going to be hard work. We're failing to cut down our emissions, the technologies for NETs don't exist at any meaningful scale yet and there are no political drivers in place to enforce their deployment.We therefore need to consider emergency plans, including some very controversial ideas.There are so-called ""geoengineering"" technologies, for example, which can be used to cause changes in global temperatures. One of these is Solar Radiation Management, which involves injecting tiny aerosol particles high in the atmosphere where they reflect sunlight into space.We know from the volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 that stratospheric aerosols caused a cooling of around 1?C over a year. The northern hemisphere's winter of 1992 saw a dramatic increase in sea ice and a stalling of glacial melting.Technologies to replicate this artificially already exist and the first sun-dimming experiments are under way. There is a realistic possibility that deploying them can buy us some time to enact the essential measures needed to stop warming at or before 1.5?C. We must keep all options on the table. As unpalatable as geoengineering technologies might seem, their deployment may prove to be unavoidable.All indications show that we are in the danger zone - with increasing Arctic temperatures, rapid loss of Arctic sea ice, reduced Arctic reflectivity, rapidly melting ice shelves and methane released from permafrost.We urgently need decisive action to be taken at COP24, when it closes on 14 December.

"COP24","UK","COP24_UK180","-Afdb-Why Africa is the next renewables powerhouse","December 10, 2018 Monday","ENP Newswire","It is increasingly clear that Africa has the potential to lead the world in scaling-up and generating renewable energy.Why Africa is the next renewables powerhouse. The potential was made clear by delegates and speakers at Energy Day, on the African Development Bank pavilion at in Poland.Sessions such as 'Unlocking Commercial Finance for Small-Scale Renewable Energy in Africa' covered the African Development Bank's 'Facility for Energy Inclusion' (FEI) - a $ 500 million debt platform for small-scale renewables that aims to provide senior and mezzanine debt financing to small-scale projects and off-grid solutions, whilst a panel of speakers shared news about the 'Desert to Power' initiative, which seeks to harness the sun of the Sahel region across 11 countries in one of the biggest solar projects in the world.A later session drew lessons on energy efficiency in Africa; despite the huge renewable generation potential, this is still a critical element in the sustainable future for the region.Africa has an almost unlimited potential of solar capacity (10 TW), abundant hydro (350 GW), wind (110 GW), and geothermal energy sources (15 GW). The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that renewable energy capacity in Africa could reach 310 GW by 2030; which would put the continent at the forefront of renewable energy generation globally.There is huge scope for Africa to build a climate-resilient and low-carbon continent, with attractive investment opportunities in climate-resilient infrastructure, climate-smart agriculture, and the sustainable management of natural resources.Case study: Morocco - largest concentrated solar park in world The Ouarzazate solar complex in Morocco is one of the largest concentrated solar plants in the world. It has produced and delivered over 814 GWh of clean energy through the national electric grid since 2016. Last year, the solar plant saved 217,000 tons of CO2.For Morocco, which until recently sourced 95% of its energy needs from external sources, this project is part of a drive to diversify sources of production and generate value from renewable energy sources. It is hoped that the country will increase its share of renewable energy to the total energy consumption to 42% by 2020.The Ouarzazate solar complex project uses an innovative financing structure, which pools the capacities of independent power producers, who then sell the generated power back to the government in a public-private partnership.The project's financing support mechanism will reduce the capital cost of solar power to levels comparable with traditional technologies and the wholesale cost of power in Morocco.Africa needs a renewable energy revolution: the continent holds 15% of the world's population, yet may have to pay nearly 50% of the estimated global climate change adaptation costs.These costs will cut expenditure on health, water supply, agriculture, and forestry, despite the continent's minimal contribution to global emissions.And that's not to mention the energy deficit that continues: most of the 600 million people without access to electricity live in Sub-Saharan Africa. This energy poverty across the continent holds back African economic development, and is estimated to cost the continent between 2% and 4 % of GDP annually.Speaking about the 'Desert to Power' project in the Sahel region, Magdalena J. Seol, the African Development Bank's representative for the initiative, has noted that: 'Without energy, it's impossible to imagine economic growth. A lack of energy has been one of the key factors that has hindered the economic development of the region.'In order to catalyse the transition to renewable energy, the African Development Bank has placed energy at the top of its High 5 priorities and launched the New Deal on Energy for Africa with an overarching goal of universal energy access in Africa by 2025.This will be achieved through expanding grid power by 160 GW, and connecting 130 million people to the grid. Additionally, the Bank aims to connect 75 million people to off-grid systems and provide 150 million households with access to clean cooking energy.The African Development Bank is also working with African countries to transform their energy utility sectors and attract investment in new energy markets.Joao Duarte Cunha, Manager for Energy Initiatives and Partnerships at the African Development Bank said, 'We provide support along the entire project development continuum, providing resources from seed capital to technical assistance, debt finance and investments in private equity funds to build a renewable energy pipel"

"COP24","UK","COP24_UK185","The 16-year-old who's our best hope for saving Earth","January 26, 2019 Saturday","The Independent - Daily Edition","Considering the icy temperatures gripping central Europe, it's remarkable how much hot air was able to circulate in the small town of Davos at over 5,000 feet this week. As per usual, the annual WEF gathering of politicians, business leaders, celebrities and the global media delivered a healthy portion of pomp and splendour. Brexit-weary journalist friends who managed to get their hands on a coveted accreditation shared selfies with Bill Gates, a hastily snapped picture of a star-struck Prince William as he prepared to face David Attenborough, and a shaky video of Wycliffe Jean serenading a dinner crowd.The philanthropic (and not so philanthropic) regulars donned their Monclers and rocked up in force - Bono, Al Gore, Matt Damon, George Soros, and Sting, to name but a random few - but when the supposed leaders of the free world got down to the noble business of actually safeguarding our future under the grand theme of ""Globalization 4.0"", it all got a bit uncomfortable.The Wall Street Journal's Greg Ip summarised it neatly when he said that Davos's raison d'etre is to gather intelligence and collectively conjure up solutions to the world's most pressing problems. ""Hedge funds go to chat up CEOs, CEOs go to chat up politicians, politicians go to chat up donors, and journalists go to chat up everyone,"" Ip explained in a recent piece, sketching out the weird ecosystem of largely well-heeled attendees.But 2019's crippling malaise turns out to be utter cluelessness, making Davos's mission basically unachievable this year. Anyone know how the US government shutdown will finally end, how Brexit will pan out, whether US-China trade tensions will defuse, or whether robots will indeed take all of our jobs? No, nein, non and nyet. But everyone's perfected the art of the sober nod and everyone is eager to express their ironclad commitment to making the world a better place. They just haven't quite got around to figuring out how to do that.And so it was with some relief that I learned of at least one sensible voice among the fat cats in the snow. The figurative adult in the room just happens to be a Swedish teenager. Greta Thunberg is no stranger to the public eye. Last year she led a massive school strike to raise awareness of climate change outside the Swedish parliament. She's done a TED talk and addressed the United Nations in Poland last year at the tender age of 15. On Thursday in Davos, unintimidated by the magnitude of her fellow panellists (Bono, diplomat Christiane Figueres, Jane Goodall, will.i.am and Japanese businessman Kengo Sakurada), Thunberg - who also happens to be autistic - took the floor and fearlessly accused some of the planet's richest and most influential people of imperilling her future while looking them dead in the eye.""Some people say that the climate crisis is something that we will have created, but that is not true, because if everyone is guilty then no one is to blame. And someone is to blame,"" she said in a stoic, steady voice, as heavyweights like former Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff looked on. ""Some people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular, have known exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money,"" she added in flawless English with a charming Scandinavian lilt, before going in for the kill: ""And I think many of you here today belong to that group of people.""A short, excruciating pause ensued before a flutter of guilty laughter filled the room and then eventually (thank God!) wordless applause. Many in the audience no doubt wished they were anywhere - anywhere! - but here.Legitimately or not, millennials have earned a reputation for being feckless snowflakes, but I dare anyone to fob off Generation Zers like Thunberg as equally gritless. The 16-year old and her peers have the most to lose from the reckless way in which we're mistreating the planet, so perhaps it will take her and her contemporaries' passion and courage to inspire change. Call it youthful ignorance if you will. I'll call it necessity.Events like the WEF need more Thunbergs. Despite a push by organisers for change, women this year represented just 22 per cent of delegates and the average age was well over 50. Just as homogeneity breeds homogeneity, diversity breeds diversity. In a sea of still predominantly white men, the fresh-faced Swede, with long braids frequently tucked under a woolly hat, has already achieved what scores of campaigners will spend a lifetime trying to do. She's been heard and hopefully her words will haunt the elite for a while.Hot air might make snowflakes melt but Thunberg has shown us that Generation Zers have other plans.\l"

With the WT5000, Yokogawa aims to expand its business in the power measurement field and build a sustainable society by helping its customers improve the efficiency of their electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy products.Development BackgroundThere are many global issues that need to be addressed to achieve a sustainable society, and almost all nations recognize the need to do this. Initiatives on this front include the adoption of the Paris Agreement at the 2015 United Nations (COP21) and the UN General Assembly's announcement of sustainable development goals (SDGs) to be achieved by the year 2030. Accordingly, industry is speeding up the development of EVs, plug-in hybrid (electric) vehicles (PHVs/PHEVs), fuel-cell vehicles, solar and wind power generators, and energy-saving home appliances. To make these products more energy efficient and help them operate more efficiently, it is essential to be able to precisely measure the slightest improvements in efficiency. Global demand is thus rising for highly precise power analyzers that can precisely measure power consumption and assess energy efficiency.In response to such needs, Yokogawa has improved the performance and functions of its flagship power analyzer by adding new functions, and is releasing this new product as the WT5000.Features1. Improved measurement accuracyWith reference to the WT3000E, the measurement accuracy of the WT5000 has been improved from \'b10.04% to \'b10.03% at AC 50/60 Hz, DC power measurement accuracy has been improved from \'b10.15% to \'b10.07%, and the low power factor error has been decreased from \'b10.03% to \'b10.02%. With these improvements, power consumption, power loss, and conversion efficiency can be assessed more precisely, satisfying our customers' need for a solution that can help them develop products that consume less power and are more energy efficient.2. Accommodates up to seven modular input elementsTo meet the need for a power analyzer that is capable of efficiently performing the ever increasing number of measurements required for the development of power conditioners and other devices used in EVs, PHVs/PHEVs, fuel-cell vehicles, and solar and wind power generators, Yokogawa has increased to seven the number of input elements that can be mounted on the WT5000. The WT3000E accommodates four elements. The WT5000 input elements are in modular design and can be easily swapped in and out by the customer. With this feature, it is no longer necessary to send the unit back to the factory for modifications to change the number of inputs, at considerable savings in time and cost. Despite all these enhancements, the WT5000 still has nearly the same dimensions as the WT3000E, and is thus appropriate for use in locations where space is at a premium.3. Simultaneous measurement for up to four motorsAn optional function supports the simultaneous measurement of speed and torque for up to four motors. This is ideal for applications involving EV in-wheel motors and four-wheel drive vehicles.Regarding the release of the WT5000, Masaharu Yamazaki (senior vice president of Yokogawa Electric Corporation, head of the Aerospace Products Business Headquarters, and president of Yokogawa Test Measurement Corporation) comments as follows:""In August 2017, Yokogawa drew up sustainability targets for the year 2050 and has been carrying out activities across the entire Group with the aim of achieving a sustainable society. By quickly and precisely meeting market needs, Yokogawa Test Measurement continues to provide highly precise power analyzers that are essential for achieving a low carbon society.""Major Target Markets- Automakers of EVs, PHVs/PHEVs, and fuel-cell vehicles, and manufacturers of in-vehicle batteries and chargers- Manufacturers of air conditioners and other home appliances; OA equipment; and motors, compressors, and other industrial equipmentApplicationsMeasurement of power consumption and evaluation of electric power use efficiency during product design or final examinationYokogawa in the power analyzer businessAs a pioneer in this field, Yokogawa started the development and sales of electronic power analyzers in 1970.

""People across Africa are already experiencing the growing impacts of climate change. This region is particularly vulnerable to increasing floods, droughts and destructive storms,"" she said.""We have to do more and do it faster, or millions of people could be plunged into poverty. That's why the World Bank is providing more money to build resilience and help communities cope with the effects of climate change in Africa.""The funding is part of the Bank Group's 2025 Targets to Step Up Climate Action, launched in December 2018 during the UN's in Poland. The $200bn is made up of $100bn in direct finance from the World Bank's two main arms, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Development Association.The remaining $100bn is a combination of direct finance from the International Finance Corporation and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and private capital mobilised by the World Bank Group. The $22.5bn is part of the $100bn in direct finance from the World Bank. The money will come from the bank's resources rather than new debt finance.The first phase of the adaptation investment will include a $500m support programme for better water management and land administration systems in Ethiopia that is currently at the preparation stage.\l"

"COP24","UK","COP24_UK193","Protests must not end climate policy","The New European"," ","The gilets jaunesSince 2014, domestic excise taxes on energy products have been linked to carbon content, with more carbon-intensive fuels taxed at a higher rate. Tax rates have also been scheduled to increase on an annual basis.The problem, however, is that such taxes tend to be unpopular. While the recent protests in France stand out for their intensity, they join a growing record of political turmoil spurred by carbon and energy taxes in different parts of the world.In 2017, Mexicans took to the streets to express outrage at fuel tax increases. During the recent US midterm elections, residents of Washington state again rejected a ballot measure aimed at introducing a carbon fee. North of the border, several Canadian provinces have started legal proceedings against a federal carbon pricing framework. Germany and Ireland recently backed away from carbon tax expansions.Research has long shown how difficult it is to win popular support for carbon and energy taxes. One reason is that these impose an explicit and immediate cost on emitters, disproportionately affecting politically influential industries such as fossil fuel companies, which tend to use their influence to resist or weaken pricing policies. At the same time, they only promise diffuse future benefits for the broader population.Renewable energy subsidies are a costlier way of achieving emission reductions overall but they spread that cost across the broader public. The financial benefit, meanwhile, is highly concentrated for subsidy recipients, creating strong supportive constituencies.Surveys confirm that voters prefer financial aid policies over taxes, suggesting that public support for climate action is broad but shallow. Addressing climate change enjoys widespread approval - until climate action comes with a tangible price tag, that is.Unlike other climate policies such as subsidies, carbon taxes make that price tag visible, and that is a big reason for their low popularity. Some commentators have therefore suggested a sequenced approach in which less contentious policies pave the way for gradual introduction of a robust carbon price. Still, the fact that other policies don't carry an explicit price tag doesn't mean they don't also impose a burden on the economy and on consumers.In the long run, the cost of doing nothing will almost certainly outweigh the cost of climate action - but the latter is real and will be allocated unevenly, creating winners and losers. That explains a growing preoccupation with the distribution of climate policy impacts. The idea of a 'just transition' is an overriding theme at this year's climate summit in Poland, COP24. It asks us to consider how we can move society to a low-carbon world without leaving anyone behind.The idea was enshrined in a declaration signed by ministers attending COP24, calling for greater consideration of the social consequences of a low-carbon transition. The French could well have used this as a guide in its response to public backlash against its energy tax plans. The demand for a just transition includes gaining social approval for climate policy by compensating, training and supporting people likely to be impacted by it.The French government assigned revenues from its energy tax increase to the general budget and earmarked parts of it for a business tax credit meant to stimulate employment and competitiveness. For taxpayers, the benefits remained obscure, and credibility of the carbon tax suffered. Instead, the government could have returned the revenue directly to taxpayers in the form of uniform or targeted cash transfers.Not only would that have made the use of revenue more transparent, it would have counteracted the general tendency of carbon and energy taxes to be regressive, that is, to affect low-income households disproportionately. Dedicating a share of revenue to helping disadvantaged communities could further reduce the perceived inequities that sparked unrest in the first place. Other places have shown that it can be done. A carbon tax introduced in British Columbia in 2008 faced initial opposition, but smart investment of tax revenue - including an annual Climate Action Tax Credit for every citizen - and a robust communications strategy have since won it broad support. People need access to affordable low-carbon options if a carbon price is to be effective, which underscores the need for adequate investment in innovation and infrastructure, such as public transit or electric vehicle charging stations.The gilets jaunes\l"

NDCs also describe priority actions for countries to adapt to climate change.The announcement was made at the 24th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP24) in Katowice, Poland, which is aiming to finalize a rulebook for the Paris Agreement when it goes into effect on 1 January 2020.The agreement aims to limit the increase in the global average temperature to below 2\'b0C, while aiming for 1.5\'b0C.""Through their NDCs, our developing member countries have made ambitious commitments to respond to climate change,"" said ADB Vice-President for Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development Mr. Bambang Susantono. ""We need to ensure that countries are able to mobilize the needed financing to deliver on their commitments. NDC Advance will help countries devise investment plans to tap financing from a variety of sources and to implement priority projects effectively.""NDC Advance is funded through a $ 4.55 million grant from ADB and will have three aims: providing technical assistance that helps countries better engage with potential sources of climate finance and to make use of innovative finance mechanisms; identifying and prioritizing climate projects; and supporting countries in tracking how projects deliver against their NDC goals.The new initiative will help propel the climate actions ADB has committed to under its Strategy 2030 program.ADB earlier this year committed to ensuring that 75% of its operations will support climate change mitigation and adaptation by 2030, while providing cumulative climate financing of $ 80 billion from its own sources between 2019 and 2030.ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty.

The left wing GUE/NGL group in Parliament said it had supported moves for Thunberg to address the plenary in Strasbourg this week but says that the proposal was blocked by other groups, including the EPP, Alde, ECR, EFDD and ENF. A GUE source told this website, ""The EPP said this is 'not a place for children' and the EFDD said they should be at school. GUE/NGL, the Greens and the S&D argued otherwise."" RELATED CONTENT Greta Thunberg slams 'wasted decades' of climate change denial COP24 COP24 Bas Eickhout: Man on eMission EU needs 'paradigm shift' in climate policy to reach Paris agreement goals In opposition to the ""veto"" GUE said it invited 60 youth activists from 22 countries to meet MEPs in the French city and speak about their demands and on ways to support their environmentalist cause. The source said the young people attended individual group meetings and were invited to watch a parliamentary debate on Wednesday on climate change from the tribunes inside the Parliament. He said, ""The progressive groups wanted to invite her [Greta Thunberg] but she did not come."" GUE said it welcomed the rise of the protest movement of youth from across Europe striking for climate action. ""Greta Thunberg was blocked from addressing this Parliament because she speaks truth to power. That truth is that we are failing on climate change"" Lynn Boylan MEP The latest student climate action, initiated by Thunberg, was a global strike by school children on Friday, their biggest global protest to date. GUE MEP Lynn Boylan (Sinn F\'e9in, Ireland) said, ""Greta Thunberg was blocked from addressing this Parliament because she speaks truth to power. That truth is that we are failing on climate change. Failing to take the bold steps that are required. Failing to lead."" ""There are some in this chamber who are more concerned that young people would strike from school than they are about the fact that we have just 12 years to sort this mess out,"" she added. If Thunberg were to win the peace prize, she would be the youngest recipient since Pakistan's Malala Yousafzai, who was 17 when she received the prize. Norwegian Socialist MP Freddy Andre Ovstegard said: ""We have proposed Greta Thunberg because if we do nothing to halt climate change, it will be the cause of wars, conflict and refugees."" ""Greta Thunberg has launched a mass movement which I see as a major contribution to peace,"" he added. The school strikes were inspired by the Fridays For The Future movement started by Thunberg under the hashtag #FridaysForFuture. ""Politicians have known the truth about climate change and they've willingly handed over our future to profiteers whose search for quick cash threatens our very existence"" Greta Thunberg So far, there have been regular walkouts around the world, including in countries such as Germany, Belgium, the UK, France, Australia and Japan. But Friday's protest is billed as the biggest so far. In an article published to coincide with the strikes on Friday, Thunberg writes, ""These strikes are happening today - from Washington DC to Moscow, Troms\'f8 to Invercargill, Beirut to Jerusalem, and Shanghai to Mumbai - because politicians have failed us."" ""We've seen years of negotiations, pathetic deals on climate change, fossil fuel companies being given free rein to carve open our lands, drill beneath our soils and burn away our futures for their profit. We've seen fracking, deep sea drilling and coalmining continue."" ""Politicians have known the truth about climate change and they've willingly handed over our future to profiteers whose search for quick cash threatens our very existence."" The Guardian article goes on, ""If those in power today don't act, it will be our generation who will live through their failure. Those who are under 20 now could be around to see 2080 and face the prospect of a world that has warmed by up to 4\'b0C. The effects of such warming would be utterly devastating."" Meanwhile, MEPs in Strasbourg adopted a resolution on the EU's long-term reduction targets of greenhouse gas emissions in the framework of the Paris Agreement. The text calls, among other things, for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In a non-binding resolution, adopted with 369 votes to 116 and 40 abstentions, MEPs stated that only two of the eight scenarios (""pathways"") proposed by the European Commission in its November communication would enable the EU to reach net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, the commitment made by the EU under the Paris climate agreement. They said they support the Commission in pushing for these two scenarios. Parliament also voiced support for the demonstrations, in particular in the form of climate marches and school strikes that are raising awareness of these climate risks. MEPs say they will now ask national, regional and local governments, as well as the EU, to take concrete and swift action in order not to overshoot the 1.5\'b0C climate limit. The resolution stressed that in order to reach net-zero GHG emissions in 2050 in the most cost-efficient manner, the 2030 ambition level will need to be raised. The EU must therefore send a clear message that it stands ready to review its contribution to the Paris Agreement. \l"

This compares to Germany - currently phasing out nuclear - where the rise has been significantly higher (+87%). Having nuclear as part of the energy mix helps to stabilise electricity prices as its fuel source, uranium, is abundantly available and its price has little impact on production costs.Furthermore, with COP24 right around the corner, a decision to invest in nuclear will show that Poland is committed to reducing its CO2 emissions in accordance with the Paris Agreement. At European level, the European Commission is expected to set a strong decarbonisation target of up to 95% by 2050 in its strategy for long-term EU greenhouse gas emission reductions to be issued on 28 November 2018.Investing in low-carbon nuclear will enable Poland to reduce its CO2 emissions and other air pollutants (e.g. NOx and SO2), whilst ensuring people and industry have access to the electricity they need, when they need it. And all of this at an acceptable cost to consumers.These are the conclusions of a high-level meeting on day 2 of World Nuclear Spotlight Poland, which brought together stakeholders from the Polish nuclear power programme and the Polish Ministry of Energy, as well as World Nuclear Association and FORATOM, the voices of the nuclear industry.Contact:Jonathan CobbTel: +44 20 7451 1536Email: HYPERLINK press@world-nuclear.orgAbout World Nuclear AssociationWorld Nuclear Association is the international organisation that represents the global nuclear industry.

He has previously said of the demonstrations: ""It is time to stand up and save our home.""Dozens of Extinction Rebellion activists have been arrested during previous protests, which included blocking bridges over the Thames, stripping in the public gallery of the House of Commons, gluing themselves to government departments and throwing buckets of fake blood near Downing Street.The group has written to Theresa May demanding a meeting with her and saying: ""Until we are satisfied that the UK government is willing to step up and take urgent action, we will continue to escalate our campaign of non-violent civil disobedience.""Claire Perry, the energy minister, agreed to meet members of Extinction Rebellion after they disrupted a speech she was giving at a in Poland in November.Sam Knights, one of the activists, said an aide to Ms Perry approached them after they had interrupted her speech and suggested a private meeting, which took place at the conference.Scotland Yard said that it had ""appropriate plans"" in place: ""We will always provide a proportionate policing plan to balance the right to a peaceful protest while ensuring that disruption to communities is kept to a minimum.""Extinction Rebellion is demanding that the government ""enact legally binding policy measures to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2025"". This would mean banning flying, scrapping 38 million petrol and diesel vehicles and disconnecting 26 million gas boilers, all within six years.The group claims at least 2,500 people have pledged to take part in today's protests in London and says tens of thousands more will take action in the coming days in 80 cities in more than 30 other countries.\l"
"COP24","UK","COP24_UK205","Bertrand Piccard, Founder and President, Solar Impulse Foundation; and UN Ambassador: Interview","Oxford Business Group: Articles"," ","Interview:\~Bertrand PiccardBERTRAND PICCARD: Morocco has very limited fossil fuel reserves, and it has had to adapt its energy strategy to this deficit. Despite being advised not to invest in local renewable solutions by leading strategic consulting firms around the year 2009, the authorities were wise enough to launch a vast development plan focused on solar, wind and hydroelectric capacities, with an initial goal of generating 42% of its energy mix from renewable sources by 2030. The good news is that Morocco has been right on schedule in reaching this aim. As such, King Mohammed VI set a new goal of 52% during the COP21 UN Conference on Climate Change in Paris.This success story could inspire other developing countries, which spend a lot of money every year on importing fossil fuels to run their economy, when they could be producing their own energy locally through renewable solutions. These options are no longer only accessible to developed countries. Today, there are simple solar panels that can both power irrigation pumps to enhance agricultural capacity and provide electricity to a small village. It is commonly said that $1 invested in renewables in developing countries creates $30 of added value.Another positive outcome of the Moroccan initiative is the fact that a number of Middle Eastern sovereign funds have contributed to the financing of these projects. This shows that even traditionally oil-producing countries are looking to mitigate their risks by investing in renewables. In other words, this is no longer a trend driven by ecological goals alone, but also by economic profit.What actions can Morocco undertake to further promote energy efficiency?PICCARD: Producing electricity through renewable solutions is surely a positive step, but at the same time Morocco must work towards mastering its energy consumption. With growing industrial needs and a notable trend towards urbanisation, the country will inevitably see its energy requirements increase significantly. Energy efficiency initiatives should be rolled out to spread awareness among the population and impose rules on economic operators.The creation of the Moroccan Agency for Energy Efficiency is a positive first step, but it should be granted more extensive powers in order to better carry out its mission in Morocco and the rest of Africa. Better management of how energy is distributed could also improve the country's short-term prospects. Smart-grid solutions can provide both national and regional authorities with tools that enable them to better allocate energy flows.Additionally, Morocco could benefit from improving and extending its energy mix beyond solar, wind and hydroelectric power. For example, some initiatives use industrial waste to fuel biomass-fired boilers, especially in the concrete segment. This idea could be duplicated in other industrial segments and become a significant source of energy production.Lastly, the country must remain an ambassador of goodwill on the international stage in order to lead the way on the African continent. Its recent commitment to reduce its gas emissions by 13% by 2030 is an example every country should follow.\l"

This vision, initially promoted by King Mohammed VI, has created a positive dynamic, mainly due to Morocco's location, its position as one of Africa's leading investors, and the strong presence of its banking and insurance sectors across 34 African countries. Furthermore, CFC has taken steps to create a modern regulatory framework and CFC label, with the objective of bringing Africa closer to investors. With the support of national regulatory authorities, CFC acts as a catalyst in providing fast track services, a balanced business environment and strong credibility.In what ways is CFC contributing to the growth of sustainable development financing in Africa?IBRAHIMI:UN Conference on Climate Change, which has the long-term objective of investing $100bn in infrastructure and sustainable development in Africa. We also recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to develop green financial instruments with Shanghai's financial centre, and several training initiatives are planned to further our expertise.In September 2018 a 15-year green bond raised $35.8m to extend our environmentally friendly real estate programme. We view the development of these assets as an opportunity for African countries to facilitate the transition towards low-carbon economies.We took an additional step to formalise our commitment to green finance by becoming a founding member of the International Network of Financial Centres for Sustainability (FC4S). This initiative was created with the support of the UN Environment Programme to help these institutions play more pivotal roles in funding sustainable development. The first meeting of the FC4S took place in Casablanca in September 2017 and resulted in the 11 founding centres signing the Casablanca Declaration. FC4S now brings together 19 financial centres with the aim of engaging our African partners and creating associations between other financial centres on the continent to share best practices and collaborate in developing sustainable investment opportunities. We are continuing our efforts to promote global investments in green initiatives in Africa. We currently have a range of investment funds in our CFC member community, such as Global Nexus, Finance in Motion, Green of Africa and Nova Power.How are CFC and other Moroccan entities promoting the uptake of financial technology (fintech)?IBRAHIMI:Fintech is a segment of focus because we believe it has the potential to revolutionise the sector with innovative and cost-effective solutions. In Africa, where levels of financial inclusion remain relatively low, demand is growing for new forms of access to funding services, such as mobile payments, transfer solutions, crowdfunding and microcredits. We hope that our work in fintech will help boost financial inclusion and bridge the financing gap for small and medium-sized enterprises.\l"
"COP24","UK","COP24_UK207","Morocco's green bonds supporting a switch to cleaner energy","Oxford Business Group: Articles"," ","\~With Morocco's future electricity generation capacity firmly dependant on renewable energy sources, attracting private financing for new projects is critical. Green bonds are an increasingly viable option to help finance energy production in the kingdom. Although they were initially restricted to multilateral finance institutions, more and more private lenders and institutions are following the same path. Expanding the role of green bonds and other types of environmentally sound financing will nonetheless depend on the presence of adequate regulation and the necessary market incentives.Despite being a relatively new addition to the capital markets arena, green bonds - fixed-income securities used to raise capital for low-carbon or environmentally sustainable projects - have quickly become an efficient way to attract capital to sustainable projects with an environmental component. Green bonds were first issued by the European Investment Bank (EIB) in 2007. The EIB has continued to use green bonds to finance its lending to renewable energy projects in different regions of the world.Domestic PotentialFor Morocco in particular, green bonds and other financing instruments with an environmental component might be an essential mechanism for the country to reach its renewable energy goals. Current government plans aim to have 52% of electricity capacity come from renewable sources. Furthermore, the kingdom is planning to reduce its carbon emissions by 32%. This would be a tall order for most countries, but will prove especially testing for a nation of over 35m people that needs high rates of economic growth in order to reduce various inequalities. Renewable energy projects are expected to account for most of the $45bn in investment that Moroccan authorities have earmarked for the sector over the coming decade.""Green financing is more developed in Europe than in Morocco, but we are on the right path, and our market will certainly have use for it,"" Abdesslam Ababou, managing partner at Red Med Finance, told OBG.Prompted by its strong commitment to environmental sustainability, Morocco had already approached the green bonds market from an investment perspective. When it hosted the COP22 UN Conference on Climate Change in 2016, the kingdom announced it would buy $100m in green bonds issued by the World Bank, which has been using this mechanism to help support loans for climate change-mitigation projects in several countries.Local IssuesWithin the kingdom, the first institution to issue a green bond was the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy. It tapped the market in 2016, issuing a $118m green bond to help pay for three solar energy projects under the Noor I solar project. That year BMCE Bank of Africa became the first Moroccan bank to participate, launching Dh500m ((EURO)45m) in green bonds with a five-year maturity period to finance several renewable energy projects in its portfolio. The bank was soon followed by other large-scale Moroccan lenders, such as Banque Centrale Populaire, which issued a (EURO)135m bond with a 10-year maturity. As of early 2019 the total amount of green bonds issued in Morocco had reached Dh3.65bn ((EURO)328.3m), according to figures from Red Med Finance.However, the successful adoption of green financing mechanisms will ultimately hinge on a change of attitude in the kingdom's financial sector. Morocco boasts a sophisticated banking sector that has been able to successfully expand across the African continent. However, its success in the banking retail space has obscured a more cautious attitude when it comes to financing projects.""There are a lot of projects worth financing, but there is some adversity to risk,"" Ababou told OBG. Overcoming the banking industry's current focus on credit allocation and the capture of deposits will thus be especially critical for the renewable energy sector.\l"

In addition to introducing new instruments and modern market infrastructure, we must use multiple channels to promote international openness. Memoranda of understanding, membership in international bodies and the technical committees of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions can help improve the market's appeal to local and foreign investors. The AMMC will also make efforts to cultivate best practices and review resources in order to align them with regulatory changes, international standards, and incurred and potential risks. Generally speaking, we hope to apply these regulatory functions while also focusing on market development.How can the market's attractiveness be enhanced? To enhance the attractiveness of the market, we are in the process of broadening the range of financial instruments to include exchange-traded funds, real estate investment trusts and sukuk (Islamic bonds). We are also trying to stimulate new market activities and segments by creating an alternative market for small and medium-sized enterprises, and a dedicated compartment for qualified investors. We also plan to allow for the issuance of equity in foreign currencies, create an appropriate framework for crowdfunding activities and enact other measures. The attractiveness of the market is closely linked to its liquidity. We are conscious that substantial liquidity can only come from a diversified domestic and international investor base, including both retail investors and a range of institutional investors with different investment horizons and perspectives. Hence, the AMMC is actively involved in growing the retail investor base through the development and implementation of a financial education strategy, while at the same time ensuring the presence of a suitable investor-protection scheme and the existence of mechanisms to facilitate access to markets.Another solution to the liquidity issue could be to create a regional marketplace. This involves harmonising regulatory standards across the participating countries, facilitating cross-border issuance and investment, and establishing technical links between the markets.In l"

This, he says, has been a neglected area when thinking about renewable energy.""It is still quite a young area,"" he says. ""A lot of people have been talking about it but the question is how will it work? How can you make a business out of it? I experience this every day trying to sell the services of our platform: people need convincing, they need to see the benefits. Currently I think we are in a transition period. There are enormous benefits but of course you need to understand how to use it.""Kaiserwetter's latest solution to the conundrum is a digital portfolio management tool called Aristoteles, which takes advantage of the possibilities offered by the internet of things and big data analytics and puts it at the service of investors.""It is all about collecting data and using data aggregation,"" Schoklitsch explains. ""Our tool uses aggregated data and performs analytics out of that. Take for example a wind farm or a wind turbines. What we are doing is taking all the meteorological data from the farms - say what the power curve is telling us in respect to the wind speed or which turbine is working properly and which isn't. There is a need for everyone to understand how these things are working. So we collect the data and relay it to a dashboard to show precisely what it is going on.""This has two benefits, Schoklitsch says. First, simplicity. ""We currently have 160 million data points in the cloud,"" he says. ""That's a lot of data. With our tool, it is very easy to understand what is happening. We can help minimise risk by simply showing whether or not an asset is performing at the optimum level.""Second, the tool allows for transparency. ""On a daily basis you can see the relevant financial data,"" Schoklitsch says. ""Are you losing revenue or energy production? Do you have access to the financial figures from the banks accounts? Is there a deviation between the revenues on the books and the cash in those accounts? Our tool provides a very easy way of doing that risk management. It brings proper transparency.""The tool can also be used anywhere in the world, Schoklitsch adds. ""It doesn't matter where you are. If an investment is going to Africa, even if there is no internet it doesn't matter. We are taking the data from the wind farm from a satellite and getting it into our system. Again, this is how we can show real transparency to investors and financial institutions.""&lt;h2&gt;Keeping executives informed&lt;/h2&gt;While Aristoteles isn't the first tool to attempt this, it has two unique selling points, according to Schoklitsch. First, it integrates different data in a way that hasn't been done before.""You have one digital platform and you see in your dashboard on your table, all the relevant technical and financial data,"" he says. ""A lot of people talk about technical data, others talk about financial data: we are combining both. It's an advanced platform.""Second, Aristoteles is a tool specifically designed for executives. ""Everything we are doing is at the executive level,"" Schoklitsch says. ""We are not building a daily operations tool, this is about how executives can view the performance and make sure their assets are providing a return on investment.""A year after it was launched, Kaiserwetter won ""Best Renewable Energy Asset Managers 2017"". For Schoklitsch, it is a strong vindication of the work the company has been doing.""I think this a great achievement,"" he says. ""It shows we are convincing people, which is one of the things we really have to do if capital is going to raise investments. We have also been participating in an innovate climate finance tool competition, which has been sponsored by the United Nation's environmental programme.""&lt;h2&gt;Aristoteles 2.0&lt;/h2&gt;The company is now working on the next version of Aristoteles. ""The future will be Aristoteles 2.0,"" Schoklitsch says. ""We are currently building our algorithms and plan to release the tool in the second quarter of 2018. It will involve predictive analytics and I think we've made some great achievements already. We want to keep pushing things forward.""Almost a year after the United Nations in Marrakesh, which Schoklitsch attended, the CEO also says he is optimistic the world is finally waking up to the dangers of climate change.""I am confident in the commitments different countries are taking to push things ahead,"" he says. ""Even if you are talking to Americans, who have an administration which doesn't believe any of this is necessary, a lot of people still know it is a must.

Some areas may see an increased risk of drought. Southern Europe, the Mediterranean and southern Africa are among the places expected to become drier overall.At 2-degreeC warming, 4-13% of developing countries were calculated as having a higher vulnerability to food insecurity than seen in any country in the world under the current climate.At 4-degreeC, unprecedented levels of food insecurity were calculated in one tenth - one third of developing countries.Discussions at Wednesday's event will focus on heat stress, water resources, river flooding and coastal flooding. Dr Katy Richardson from the Met Office will discuss the implications for vulnerability to food insecurity.Prof Schellnhuber will discuss the risks of tipping points in the climate system, including a perspective on the 'Hothouse Earth' concept that was proposed in a widely-publicised paper earlier this year.The event is from 11.30 - 13.00 in the Katowice conference centre, Area G, Room 6 and is open to all conference attendees.You can watch a live broadcast of the event here and follow Helix Climate on Twitter at @helixclimateAt 4-degreeC, unprecedented levels of food insecurity were calculated in one tenth - one third of developing countries.[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uknewswire@enpublishing.co.uk\l"

Buoyed by this success, Belfius and the EIB have signed a new agreement to provide an additional EUR 400m with a view to supporting even more projects helping to develop smart cities, the circular economy and the fight against global warming.This new programme - Smart Cities, Climate Action Circular Economy II - aims to help local authorities, inter-municipal groupings and non-commercial organisations in the social and education sectors in Belgium to implement their smart and sustainable projects by granting finance on favourable terms. The scope of the programme covers not only energy, mobility and urban development, but also water (distribution networks, sewers, drainage, treatment), waste (selective collection, sorting, biological treatment and sludge treatment, energy production) and e-government (particularly open data). In addition to an integrated, innovative and sustainable approach, the circular economy and climate action are key focal points of project appraisal and evaluation.More than 2 million people have already benefited from EUR 1bn 121 projects representing an investment of more than EUR 1bn have already been financed thanks to the partnership between Belfius and the EIB. These projects, which have an impact on the daily lives of more than two million people across the country, come from local authorities, CPAS (Public Social Action Centres), inter-municipal groupings, provincial institutions, and non-commercial, social and education sector organisations.Already completed or in progress, they range from the regeneration of city centres and the transformation of the hearts of villages to the renovation of schools and cultural and sports centres, the construction of rest and care homes, and the centralisation of administrative and emergency services in new smart and sustainable buildings. In addition, they include the creation of cycle and pedestrian paths and the construction of a wind farm alongside a motorway, as well as the replacement of an ageing fleet of vehicles by cleaner models. Most of the projects financed combine energy efficiency and renewable energy measures with sustainable mobility and urban development. The circular economy is also a central aspect of many projects.Smart Cities projects: Hainaut: 13, Liege: 12, Walloon Brabant: 11, Namur: 11, Luxembourg: 7, Antwerp: 12, West Flanders: 22, East Flanders: 16, Limburg: 7, Flemish Brabant: 10Climate and the environment targeted by local authoritiesLocal authorities can play a major role in combating global warming and developing the circular economy by setting an example and thereby encouraging companies, individuals and other organisations to implement environmentally-friendly initiatives of their own. A number of Belgian cities and municipalities have already signed the Covenant of Mayors, undertaking to promote climate protection and voluntarily cut CO2 emissions in their area. With this new joint programme - Smart Cities, Climate Action Circular Economy II - Belfius and the EIB intend to continue to provide the best support and assistance for these efforts.EIB Director General Jean-Christophe Laloux said: 'By 2050, more than 75% of the global population with be concentrated in cities. This is why transforming urban areas to make them smarter and more sustainable is among the EIB's key objectives. Together with Belfius, our long-standing partner for the Smart Cities programme in Belgium, we are confident that by helping local authorities to implement their projects according to their needs, goals and size, the EU bank will have a quick and direct impact on residents' quality of life, the environment and climate.

SIRI: The natural gas supply from the Bongkot and Erawan fields accounts for over 75% of domestic production, and 50% of the country's natural gas consumption. This is a significant contribution. If we lose these two sources of gas supply, then we will be faced with problems. Therefore, we are working to ensure the continuity of gas supply from the two fields, and we are establishing terms of reference to secure a new operator for each of these fields. Since it has been determined that the ""production sharing contract"" fiscal regime is more suitable for the management of these fields than the previously used concession contracts regime, the terms of reference will need to be designed specifically for this purpose.Existing players, which include Chevron for the Erawan gas field and PTT Exploration and Production for the Bongkot field, are eligible to contest for the operating rights under the new contracts. One of the major requirements for the new operator is the commitment to produce a minimum quantity of gas supply, which is 800m standard cu feet per day (scfd) for Erawan field and 700m scfd of the Bongkot field, for the first 10 years of operation, starting in 2022.

In fact, I found it difficult to name anyone who filled me with enthusiasm, encouraged me to work harder or simply inspired me to be like them.However, surfing the internet the other day I discovered someone who made me stop and listen.Their words affected me so deeply that I instantly knew I had found my ""inspirational person"".COP24 conference on climate change - a cause that I have often referred to in this column. This 16-year-old Swedish girl (Greta Thunberg) stood up and, in perfect English, literally told off world leaders about their lack of care, action and effort in the guardianship of our planet. She spoke with such conviction that I actually had tears in my eyes.Not only has she spoken many times on the subject but she has also spearheaded a movement that the young have taken up across the world. About a million schoolchildren, in more than 100 countries, followed her lead of striking from school on Friday, March 15, and marching to their relative governing bodies.I sincerely hope this is recognised by our politicians and that they begin to understand that this planet is in crisis and that our young do not think they have a viable future.While the internet showed children leading peaceful protests, I saw little evidence of this being covered by our own TV stations.The Financial Times did run a column about Greta in which the columnist focused not on her message but on the fact that she has Asperger's, she is a vegan and that her family own an electric car. The column then suggested that she was under the influence of environmental activists who were using her as a ""front woman"". Really? Can this intelligent young girl not have a mind of her own? I think I have been privileged to witness the birth of a revolution that might just save our dying polar bears and dwindling green spaces.With Greta as our climate change warrior our species may also have a chance to not become extinct.I think I have been privileged to witness the birth of a revolution \l"
"COP24","UK","COP24_UK217","Hundreds of UK students have joined thousands across the globe to stage second walkout of lessons to demand politicians take action on climate change","March 15, 2019 Friday 11:54 AM GMT","MailOnline","British students join striking counterparts in 120 other countries including New Zealand, Australia and JapanThey chanted 'this is what democracy looks like' while gathered in London's Parliament Square this morning  The walkouts are taking place in more than 100 UK towns and cities as part of a global day of actionScores of schoolchildren around the world have walked out of their classrooms and trooped on to the streets for a second time to demand that politicians take action on climate change.Hundreds of these placard-waving youngsters ditched their lessons and flocked to London's Parliament Square this morning to try to grab the attention of MPs. They chanted 'this is what democracy looks like' while primary school children, who were at the protest with their parents and holding handmade placards, shouted 'climate change, boo!' The walkouts are taking place in more than 100 UK towns and cities, including Kent, Edinburgh and Bristol, as part of a global day of action inspired by teenager Greta Thunberg who protests every Friday outside Sweden's parliament. Who is Greta Thunberg? Greta Thunberg is a 16-year-old pig-tailed Swedish schoolgirl who has been obsessively researching climate change for seven years.Since last summer, she has been skipping school every Friday to sit on the steps of the Swedish parliament, the Riksdag, with a home-made sign that reads 'Skolstrejk f\'f6r Klimatet' (School strike for the climate).She grows her own vegetables, refuses air travel and luxury hotels, even if the only option is a 32-hour train journey and a tent.She accused the attendees at the Climate Change Conference in Poland in December 2018 of leaving the burden of climate change with future generations.Many politicians, including environment secretary Michael Gove and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn have already backed the 'inspirational strikers'. Greta Breveglieri, 21, a political science student at Univesita Statale Di Milano, travelled from Italy for the London demonstration today.She said: 'The protest in February was really big, but today is way more important and has been way more publicised. There's been a lot of momentum, so I think it's going to be big.'We have been silent for too long. There have been singular voices or movements that have always struggled against climate change, and for the environment and against pollution. 'But this kind of global and coordinated and spontaneous, and especially youth movement, I've never seen this movement before.' Thousands of students defied warnings from teachers and politicians when they bunked off on February 15 and the organisers predict that even more will skip classes to protest today.While the youngsters may not have the support of Downing Street and education secretary Damian Hinds, who disapproves of the children missing school, an Opinium poll suggested that a majority of the public backs the walkout. Although climate change is the cause which unites the protesters, some placards in London were emblazoned with socialism endorsements and some are campaigning for the voting age to be lowered to 16. Their calls come after a UN report last year which warned that limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, beyond which climate impacts become increasingly severe, requires unprecedented action.That includes cutting global carbon dioxide emissions by almost half within 12 years, and to zero by mid-century. In London Joe Crabtree, 15, from south-west London, who is missing his GCSE mocks for the protest, said: 'I'm here today to send a clear message to Government that I'm fed up with inaction on climate change.'I think they're not doing enough to curb the problem that is climate change, leaving it to the side like us with homework, hoping it will get done, but it's not being dealt with.' Mr Corbyn has also backed the strikers, tweeting: 'Thank you for standing up against climate change. You shouldn't have to pay the price for the mistakes of previous generations.'Cat Smith, shadow minister for youth affairs, said Labour stands 'in solidarity' with young people across the UK taking action over the Government's lack of leadership on climate change.'This should serve as a wake-up call to the political establishment that young people's views can no longer be ignored, and urgent action is needed to tackle the escalating ecological crisis.'Anna Taylor, 17, from north London, co-founder of the UK Student Climate Network and one of the organisers of the Youth Strike 4 Climate movement, said the Government was failing to recognise the severity of the crisis.'We're here because we feel betrayed and we don't feel we can trust them to protect our future, which is why we're having to go on strike to make our voices heard, and let them know that unless they change something we will keep striking until they consider our demands.'They're failing to make environmental reform and environmental policy a priority, they focusing on economic policy and Brexit and failing to address the climate crisis facing us.'It's something we all feel very passionate about, because it's personal to us, it's about our future. This is a broad movement and we are all striking in solidarity. And United Nations climate change chief Patricia Espinosa said: 'What we're seeing is a clear message from youth throughout the world that nations must significantly increase their efforts to address climate change.'Given the urgency the world faces, it's vital nations come up with more ambitious plans both this year and in 2020 as stated in the Paris Agreement.'This is how we will not only reach our collective climate goals, but how we will build a cleaner, greener and more prosperous future for all people.' \l"

Buhari, who is seeking re-election next year, spent a large part of 2017 in London for treatment for a serious illness, which has never been revealed to the public.A lack of specific information about the illness, along with Buhari's gaunt features and a reduction in public appearances have fed speculation about his well-being.{\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\parClaims about the president's identity emerged a month after Buhari returned from another lengthy medical trip to London.Those pushing the rumour were known critics of the president and his government.Buhari was elected President of Nigeria, Africa's largest economy and top oil producer, in 2015.The former general became President in his fourth attempt at leadership since he was ousted from power in 1985.Buhari was among military strongmen who dominated Nigeria decades ago.

"COP24","UK","COP24_UK222","Be in no doubt - Theresa May lied to Parly over her disastrous Brexit deal; Our columnist Ian Blackford says the Tories are lurching from one crisis to another ....","December 10, 2018 Monday 4:30 AM GMT","dailyrecord.co.uk","Last week in theHouse of Commons, I called outTheresa Mayfor what she is - a liar or rather, because doing so is deemed ""unparliamentary"" I had to say she ""perhaps misled"" the House.But there should be no doubt, the Prime Minster has lied to Parliament and the public over herBrexitdeal.It was during Prime Minister's Questions when I asked the Prime Minister to explain why she continues to deny Scotland the rights and opportunities her Brexit deal offers other parts of the UK.Earlier that morning, legal advice the UK Government received on Brexit was published to reveal what they had hoped would be kept confidential - the special deal Theresa May had created for Northern Ireland when the UK leaves the EU was permanent - despite claims it would be temporary - making clear the disadvantage Scotland faces by comparison.Northern Ireland of course has special circumstances - their peace has been long fought for and the terms of the Good Friday Agreement must be respected.But not only are the Tories planning to make Scotland poorer by dragging us out of Europe against our will, they also want to put us at a competitive disadvantage within the UK.SNP accuse Theresa May of 'lying' over controversial Brexit backstop\~People in Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain part of the EU and this is the preference of the SNP.We have consistently argued that Scotland, which voted by a 62 per cent majority to remain in the EU, should have its decision respected - protecting jobs, living standards and our NHS.If the opportunity to stay in Europe is possible through a second EU referendum then the SNP will back giving people that choice.However, the party have - for over two years - made clear that they could back a compromise that keeps the UK and Scotland in the European single market, which is eight times bigger than the UK alone.But when we asked for Scotland to stay in the single market to protect jobs and living standards, we were told by the Prime Minister this wasn't possible. How can that be fair?Since the EU referendum the UK Government have lurched from one crisis to another. In recent weeks the Prime Minister has lost two Brexit secretaries, a home secretary, a foreign secretary and a work and pensions secretary.Last week the Government suffered from three consecutive defeats in the voting lobbies - in just two hours; the first government to do so in 40 years.And then the Government were found to be in contempt of Parliament for concealing the facts on the Brexit deal from members of Parliament and from the public.And just when you think it couldn't get much worse for the Tories- they are preparing for an embarrassing defeat tomorrow when the Brexit deal is put to MPs for a vote.The SNP cannot support this deal. We have reiterated that we are the only party with a clear, consistent and sensible approach to Brexit. We were promised strong and stable, but what we have is a government in crisis.More than one in five Scots starving due to lack of cash\~It's a big week in Holyrood with the Scottish Government setting out their budget on Wednesday.As the Finance Secretary Derek Mackay has said, his plans will be bold and ambitious, and will drive Scotland forward to create a more progressive, prosperous and equal society for all Scots.Nicola Sturgeon slams Tories for leaving thousands of Scots at risk of poverty over Christmas\~In stark contrast to the international embarrassment that is the Tory UK Government due to their Brexit shambles, Nicola Sturgeon has been highlighting Scotland's world-leading climate change policy at the United Nations in Poland this past week.The First Minister announced extra funding of \Â£3200,000 to tackle climate change as she arrived at the global summit, explaining that the money will support the work of the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action, which promotes collaboration between governments, businesses and investors to lower emissions.It was great to see Nicola Sturgeon being interviewed by Al Gore on Scotland's track record on tackling climate change and also our ambitions for the future.The former US vice president who is known for his campaigning work on climate change was full of praise for Scotland's ""political will"" on the issue.He also referred to the age of enlightenment in Scotland and how he felt the legacy of that was still very evident. As the First Minister made clear, we are absolutely determined that there will be no let-up in our efforts.Tackling climate change requires everyone in society - individuals, businesses and governments - to play their part in changing behaviours.I'm delighted our small but influential country is leading by example.Theresa May's fresh Brexit crisis after Tories in contempt of Parliament for first time ever\~Today we are expecting an important judgement by the European Court of Justice following a significant Scottish case on what would happen if Theresa May failed to get support for her Brexit deal.The cross-party group of Scottish parliamentarians who brought forward the case - including SNP MP Joanna Cherry and MEP Alyn Smith - have been aiming to establish as a matter of legal certainty that Brexit could be stopped. We already know that it is a false choice to say that it's the Prime Minister's deal or no deal, and today we could get further confirmation.The Court's Advocate General last week gave the opinion that the UK could unilaterally revoke Article 50 - the process for leaving the EU - and today we are expecting the formal judgement.Theresa May's deal is bad for Scotland and we are working hard to stop her from inflicting damage on people's jobs and living standards.I'm particularly proud that it's Scottish parliamentarians and the Scottish legal system who have ensured this case will give all the nations of the UK an alternative option from the Tories' mess.

Secretary-general Antonio Guterres warned attendees from almost 200 nations at the COP24 meeting in Poland that such a conclusion ""means sacrifices, but it will benefit us all"".A group of countries including the EU have pledged to enhance their climate plans before 2020, in response to fresh scientific warnings about the dangers of global warming. However, other aspects of the talks have seen slow progress, and Mr Guterres' return after opening the conference last week was seen as a sign of how fraught the situation had become.Failure in the talks ""would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change"", said Mr Guterres. He added: ""It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal."" The secretary-general cited the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's key report concluding emissions must be cut rapidly within just 12 years to keep warming below 1.5C.Over the weekend, a bloc of oil-producing countries made up of the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were accused of stalling progress by objecting to the findings of that report. Mr Guterres' call came after the two-week meeting in the coal-mining city of Katowice shifted from the technical phase of discussions to the final political phase, when ministers took over negotiations.The aim of the summit is to produce a ""rulebook"" that nations can follow to implement the 2015 Paris climate agreement. While progress has been made in formulating the rulebook, with a draft text expected on Thursday, it has been marred by disagreements. Campaigners also warned the current version contains too many loopholes to be effective.Other issues that have seen disappointing progress are commitments to increase the ambition of emissions cuts, and to provide financial support for poor nations so they can prepare for climate change.Environmentalists accused powerful players such as the EU of not pushing hard enough for an agreement. ""A new leadership must step up,"" said Vanessa Perez-Cirera from WWF. ""We cannot afford to lose one of the 12 years we have remaining.""Mr Guterres said while he and most people attending the conference would not be alive by the end of the century, children today would see the full impact of uncontrolled climate change. ""I do not want my granddaughters or anybody else's to suffer the consequences of our failures,"" he said. ""They would not forgive us if uncontrolled and spiralling climate change would be our legacy to them.""\l"

We will also discuss the EU's goals for the COP24 UN climate talks in Katowice in December. To ensure the success of our climate efforts, it is crucial that we secure a fair contribution from the transport sector.The EU has been instrumental in reaching an ambitious climate agreement in Paris, and has recently taken a number of steps to secure the goals set in 2015. We agreed to revise the Emissions Trading System, increase the share of renewables in the energy sector, and step up efforts on energy efficiency. But while other sectors are picking up the pace, emissions in the transport sector are still rising. Car manufacturers may get a free ride to Paris.As the Financial Times reported last week, the European Parliament voted to curb that trend. But the deal isn't done yet. Several member states, as well as the European Commission, are concerned about possible job losses in the industry. We share these concerns. But stating that higher ambition would equal less employment overlooks certain key facts. Higher reduction targets and the transition to low and zero-emission mobility can actually create more than 200,000 new jobs by 2030 in both the automotive and supply chain sector, as well as in the wider European economy.Sales figures for (plug-in) hybrid and electric vehicles are rising - Volkswagen, Daimler, BMW, Toyota, and Volvo all expect their sales to reach 20 to 50 per cent by 2025 - and it thus seems contradictory that the industry would lobby against higher targets. They are already outpacing the commission's proposal. As EU ministers, we need to make sure these cars will be produced and driven inside the EU. Right now, European carmakers invest seven times more in electric vehicle production in China than in Europe. This investment and the jobs it brings should come back to Europe.In our joint effort to reach the Paris goals, we should create a stable home market for zero and low-emission vehicles. Just like we have done for other sectors, we stand willing to support those who need help in the transition to a low-carbon economy. The move towards zero-emission transport can be an advance for growth and jobs in Europe, provided we set the car industry on the right path.Stientje van Veldhoven State Secretary for Infrastructure and Water Management, The Netherlands Lars Christian Lilleholt Minister for Energy, Utilities, and Climate, Denmark Sokratis Famellos Alternate Minister of Environment and Energy, Greece Denis Naughten Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Ireland Shane Ross Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Ireland Claude Turmes Secretary of State for Sustainable Development and Infrastructure, Luxembourg Jure Leben Minister of Environment and Spatial Planning, Slovenia\l"
"COP24","UK","COP24_UK227","Europe must grab chance to make up ground lost to China","FT.com"," ","Last week the European Commission launched its HYPERLINK 2050 Strategy that shows a path to achieving  climate neutral economy, or net zero greenhouse gas emissions, by 2050. This goal, set out before the latest UN conference on climate change in the coal-mining centre of Katowice, Poland, is ambitious. Questions remain about how realistic this target is, what it could cost to achieve, and what would be its global impact on climate change  because Europe\' s share of world greenhouse gas emissions is only 10 per cent and shrinking.The answers provided in the analysis that accompanies the strategy statement are bold. They show that European climate neutrality by 2050 is possible and affordable. It would require, however, a different economic mindset.Until now, the language used in describing the EU\' s actions on climate change has been marked by terms such as  cost ,  burden and  responsibility . The message has been that the task would not be easy, but we have to do it. It has taken a decade for EU governments to change this narrative and to see that a low-carbon economy is a field of innovation growth but also fierce competition. The focus of European leaders has shifted from constant modelling of costs and burdens to seeing more of the positives of investment opportunities and economic development.Europe is clearly waking up to the risk that it might be left behind if it does not move up a gear in the low-carbon technological and economic race.To stay ahead in the new economy, Europe will have to hurry up. A HYPERLINK https://europeanclimate.org/a-net-zero-emissions-european-society-by-2050-is-within-reach-but-getting-there-starts-today/ study by the European Climate Foundation also showed that, if Europe wants to reach its 2050 Paris-consistent climate goals, it will need to increase its midterm ambition in reducing emissions for 2030 across all key sectors  industry, transport, power, buildings, agriculture, forestry and land use. This study argues, however, that the cost of this accelerated action would be in fact lower than the business-as-usual scenario. This is due to increased energy efficiency, reduced use of fossil fuels and better energy demand management.Co-ordinated European action could mobilise huge investments, drive research, technology and innovation forward, create jobs and have a significant positive impact on health.These can deliver tangible and politically popular short and medium-term benefits while at the same time make a significant contribution to mitigating the economic risks of rising global temperatures.But being a mere advocate of a low-carbon economy will not improve Europe\' s competitive position. The EU had the bitter experience of the HYPERLINK Lisbon strategy launched in 2000 aiming to make the EU  the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world . It failed. Now the bloc is waking up to a second chance. In order to grab it, European governments, universities and companies need to invest solidly in low-carbon technological research and its commercialisation.The leadership of China in a number of low-carbon sectors has taken many people by surprise. Fears that Chinese companies are buying critical technologies and infrastructure should prompt competitors including those in Europe to up their game and increase investment in green innovation.With just over 2 per cent of gross domestic product invested in research and development, China has already https://www.aaas.org/news/data-update-us-and-eu-rd-budgets-remain-flat-asian-investment-decelerates surpassed the EU in terms of its research and development intensity. Until now, China has invested heavily in green energy technologies as an export opportunity.In order to maintain a position of industrial leadership in the energy transition, the EU should boost its competitiveness through research and innovation, the mobilisation of sustainable finance and investment, and pioneer the testing of breakthrough technologies.The internal European market will not be the only global driver for the low-carbon ambition of Brussels. The EU\' s low-carbon strategy, if it manages to establish itself as a catalyst for corporate investment in innovation and technology, will have influence beyond its borders. Europe is the largest economic bloc in the world. Strong climate action by the EU will force anybody who wants to access attractive European markets to comply with its climate-related rules. The knock-off effect will be felt across the world.Julian Popov is a fellow of the European Climate Foundation and former environment minister of Bulgaria \l"

This committed countries of the world to limiting global warming to well below 2C, and to pursuing efforts towards a 1.5C limit.

But though the rules for implementing Paris were finally agreed, they do not reflect the urgency of the situation, and are not robust enough to prevent the worst impacts of climate change.There had been great hope in Katowice that the worst emitters would heed the warning of the IPCC Special Report released in October, underlining the urgency of the crisis. This report demonstrated that the world is on a warming pathway of 3.5\'b0C or more, and could reach 1.5\'b0C in 12 years at current rates. Missing that 1.5\'b0C target is a matter of life or death. Warming over 1.5\'b0C means millions more people exposed to droughts, heat-waves and floods; irreversible biodiversity loss; ocean warming that threatens marine life and the people who depend on it; and rising sea levels that can wipe small island states off the face of the earth.

This financing level-an average of $ 10 billion a year-is more than double what was achieved during FY15-18. The World Bank Group will also pilot new approaches to increasing private finance for adaptation and resilience.'Our new plan will put climate resilience on an equal footing with our investment in a low carbon future for the first time. We do this because, simply put, the climate is changing so we must mitigate and adapt at the same time,' said World Bank Chief Executive Officer Kristalina Georgieva. 'We will ramp up our funding to help people build a more resilient future, especially the poorest and most vulnerable who are most affected.'The increase in adaptation financing will support activities that include:Delivering higher quality forecasts, early warning systems and climate information services to better prepare 250 million people in at least 30 countries for climate risks;Supporting 100 river basins with climate-informed management plans and/or improved river basin management governance;Building more climate-responsive social protection systems; and Supporting efforts in at least 20 countries to respond early to, and recover faster from, climate and disaster shocks through additional financial protection instruments.In addition to boosting finance, the Plan will also support countries to mainstream approaches to systematically manage climate risks at every phase of policy planning, investment design, and implementation.'This Action Plan is a welcome step from the World Bank,' said Ban Ki-moon, former Secretary-General of the United Nations and co-chair of the Global Commission on Adaptation. 'The world's poorest and most climate vulnerable countries stand to benefit from its increased finance and support for longer term policy change.'The Action Plan builds on the link between adaptation and development by promoting effective and early actions that also provide positive development outcomes. For example, investing in mangrove replanting may protect a local community against sea level rise and storm surges, while also creating new opportunities for eco-tourism and fisheries. Early and proactive adaptation and resilience-building actions are more cost-effective than addressing impacts after they occur.The Action Plan also includes the development of a new rating system to create incentives for, and improve the tracking of, global progress on adaptation and resilience. The new system will be piloted by the World Bank in FY19-20 and rolled out to projects in relevant sectors by FY21.The Action Plan on Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience forms part of the World Bank Group's 2025 Targets to Step Up Climate Action which were launched in December 2018, during the UN's COP24 in Poland.Note to Editors: The Action Plan on Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience will be implemented starting June 30, 2021 through July 1, 2025.[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uknewswire@enpublishing.co.uk\l"

It would be an appropriate gift for delegates at the COP24 climate talks in Katowice, Poland, to send each other after an often acrimonious fortnight of negotiations. Right from the choice of host city, in the heartland of the Polish mining industry, coal has loomed large over the meeting, intended to agree ways to implement the global commitment to curbing climate change made in Paris in 2015.The talks finally concluded on Saturday after nearly 200 countries reached a compromise on a single set of rules to govern how they report their greenhouse gas emissions and their climate targets. The agreement was hailed as a success, but the strongest emotion among supporters of climate action was relief that the talks had not fallen apart.In theUS, Two incidents at the start of last week highlighted the difficulty of finding a global consensus on how to tackle the threat of climate change. First, the US teamed up with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to water down governments' approval of a report spelling out the consequences of letting global temperatures rise more than 1.5C since preindustrial times. It was no coincidence that the objecting tackling the threat of climate change will be taken on by business group included the three largest oil producers, and another in the top 10.The US delegation went on to hold an event to emphasise the importance of fossil fuels, reflecting the Trump administration's plan to withdraw from the Paris agreement. Wells Griffith, the lead official for international affairs at the US Department of Energy, told the meeting: ""We strongly believe no country should have to sacrifice economic prosperity or energy security in pursuit of environmental sustainability.""The US may be in a minority of one in wanting to leave the Paris accord, but there are a wide range of interests and objectives among the remaining countries. Xie Zhenhua, China's senior climate official, described the Katowice agreement as ""a victory of multilateralism"", but the effort needed to reach that compromise suggests countries will continue to take different paths, at least for now.That means in some countries, particularly the US, much of the work in addressing the threat of climate change will be taken by businesses investing in renewable energy and taking other measures to reduce their emissions, often following pressure from shareholders. There are limits to this approach. Some of the world's largest investors, including BlackRock, Vanguard and Axa, have increased their holdings in coal since the Paris agreement, according to a British non-profit group, InfluenceMap.A study published in the journal Nature Climate Change said companies were underestimating climate change. But given the difficulties attached to climate policy, the private sector looks one of the best bets to make steady progress.In the US, tackling the threat of climate change will be taken on by business\l"

The aim is to boost the modal share of rail freight in the EU to 30% by 2030, with road's share falling to 63% and waterways carrying the remaining 7%. Today the split is 18% rail, 75% road and 7% water.This programme forms the basis for the Vision 2030 target launched by RFF at the COP24 climate change talks in Katowice the following week.F\'f6rst emphasised that the objectives would only be achieved if train operators and infrastructure managers continue their efforts in collaboration, innovation and service flexibility. However, it would be up to state authorities to ensure that the whole transport sector was properly structured to take advantage of rail's ecological and environmental benefits.Participants agreed that the main obstacle to increasing freight transport by rail in Europe was a lack of co-ordination between the many nationally-oriented participants. This was particularly noticeable in the lack of harmonisation of operational rules at border stations, which cause considerable delay to international freight trains.The past two years have seen significant advances in the ELETA project (Electronic Estimated Time of Arrival). This is bringing together various train operators and other players to combine their data, in order to provide more accurate predictions of when a freight train will reach a given location.However, participants emphasised that the whole international timetabling process needs rethinking. The slow average speeds of European freight trains is attributed to a lack of harmonisation between the timetables developed by national infrastructure managers, as well as the lack of capacity to meet the needs of the freight operators. To counter some of the problems, a web-based Path Co-ordination System is being developed as a tool to co-ordinate international path requests and offers.Similarly, participants argued that interoperability across the Single European Railway Area was being hampered by a lack of co-ordination between national bodies. They believed that progress would be impossible without further investment in new ideas and innovative technologies.The Wien Declaration adopted at the Rail Freight Day celebrated the progress that has been achieved since Rotterdam, but noted that the development of a pragmatic win-win strategy to support rail freight would be a lengthy process which could only be achieved through a genuine spirit of co-operation.\l"
"COP24","UK","COP24_UK236","EU energy chief pushes bloc to adopt tougher emission targets ahead of UN climate talks; Carbon reduction","July 30, 2018 Monday","Financial Times (London, England)","The EU's energy chief is pushing for member states to formally adopt a new set of carbon reduction targets ahead of UN climate talks this year.The EU already has some of the most ambitious carbon emission reduction targets in the world but Miguel Arias Ca\'f1ete, EU energy commissioner, wants the bloc to go further. ""We have to press the throttle,"" Mr Ca\'f1ete said.After the US withdrew from the Paris climate talks agreement this year, the EU has emerged as one of the leading advocates for reducing emission targets.Under the new target, proposed by Mr Ca\'f1ete, the EU would increase its carbon emissions reduction target to 45 per cent by 2030, up from the current target of 40 per cent, relative to 1990 levels.Raising the EU's official target requires the approval of all member states through the council of ministers.Mr Ca\'f1ete's letter to the council of ministers will include modelling that shows the EU will ""de facto"" reduce emissions 45 per cent by 2030 because of the other energy targets that have been recently adopted. With new legislation, at least half of the EU's electricity will come from renewable sources by 2030, Mr Ca\'f1ete said.Reaching the new energy and climate change targets would require a mixture of public and private investment of (EURO)379bn a year between 2021 and 2030, as well as a 50 per cent increase in the amount of new renewables installed each year, Mr Ca\'f1ete said. Hitting the new renewable target was ""clearly a challenge"", he added.Mr Ca\'f1ete said UN climate talks, which are due take place in December in Katowice, Poland, would be ""difficult"". Countries that signed up to the 2015 Paris climate deal will try to agree on a common ""rule book"" that will govern the pact.However, the preparatory talks for the conference, known as COP24, have made little progress due to disagreement over whether there should be a single set of rules, or different rules for developed and for developing countries.The Paris agreement suffered a heavy blow after Donald Trump said last year that the US would pull out of the agreement. The US president denounced the agreement for imposing ""draconian"" burdens on his country.If EU ministers formally adopt the new emissions target ahead of the UN climate talks, it would become the first big economy to raise its climate targets under the UN framework this year.However, some argue the EU should be much more ambitious. Energy ministers from 14 member states - including France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands - wrote to the commission in June requesting it raise its targets, some to as much as a 55 per cent reduction by 2030.Climate Action Network Europe estimated that the increase to 45 per cent will ""fall well short of what is needed to implement the Paris Agreement"".

I write about it because there is an awful lot of research being done into it, but also because I think it is an important topic that people need to know about.The problem is that for a slow-burning problem like climate change, it's not often an event happens that is dramatic enough to really stand out from the background hum of scientific research and expert warnings. This means that even though this environmental catastrophe is - as I have tweeted - the ""biggest news story in the world"", it seldom makes newspaper front pages.That's why, when the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was released in October, I was pleased that it got a good showing in The Independent. Though the report itself was written in a typically dispassionate style, within its pages were predictions of a world completely devoid of coral reefs and where millions were forced from their homes by rising tides. Built on the expertise of hundreds of scientists and thousands of studies, this document was definitely worth making a big deal out of.Of course, this makes it all the more tragic that, given the opportunity, only a tiny fraction of the British press chose to prioritise the story over the far more important Strictly snog.Considering the year we have just had, with heatwaves scorching Europe and setting the Arctic on fire, my prediction is that global warming-related front pages will only become more common. Scientists are now confidently identifying the ""fingerprints"" of climate change in extreme weather across the world.These fingerprints can also be seen in many seemingly unrelated news stories, from wars to mass migration. At the major climate summit that has been playing out in Poland over the past couple of weeks, leaders of island states made it very clear they were terrified for the future of their nations, as rising sea levels gradually render their homes uninhabitable.UK government advisers have issued clear warnings that this problem is not restricted to faraway lands. Only a few weeks ago, a Committee on Climate Change report urged ministers to protect coastal communities from rising sea levels, and stated that in all likelihood many coastal areas will become essentially uninhabitable.It's sad - but perhaps inevitable - that some will only sit up and listen when the waves are lapping at their front doors, but now the evidence is clearer than ever, it is the responsibility of good journalists to make those unseen fingerprints of climate change very clear to their readers.Alarmism must be avoided, but what the IPCC report made clear was that seemingly outrageous warnings are not alarmist: they're just true.Yours,Josh GabbatissScience correspondent\l"

"COP24","UK","COP24_UK240","Shell's emissions targets are a model for others","December 7, 2018 Friday","Financial Times (London, England)","Royal Dutch Shell's decision to set carbon emissions targets from next year is as welcome as it is overdue. The announcement was made as signatories to the Paris climate change agreement, which seeks to limit global temperature rises, gathered for the COP24 talks in Poland to try to agree rules on implementation. Like the Paris commitments themselves, Shell's pledge and its plan to link 1,200 executives' pay to progress against its targets raise the bar for everyone.Only six months ago, Ben van Beurden, Shell's chief executive, was content to have an ""ambition"" to halve carbon emissions by 2050. He dismissed hard targets as superfluous and worried about the lawsuits they might lead to. Shell's turnround marks a victory for investors, including Robeco and the Church of England, which convinced Mr van Beurden that success in reducing emissions was contingent on adopting timetables and specific goals. More interestingly, Shell said the decision was an evolution that resulted from dialogue with investors, highlighting shareholders' increasing power in pushing companies to make progress.Shell's adoption of rolling three- to five-year emissions targets provides a clear model for other oil majors and will increase pressure on them to take comparable steps. Much of this pressure will come, as it did for Shell, from investor alliances such as Climate Action 100+, which backed Shell's decision.The group, which includes Legal & General Investment Management, Calpers and UBS Asset Management, pushes corporate polluters to cut emissions and improve disclosure on climate issues. It has more than $32tn in assets under management. With an oil major-sized notch in their belt, group members' determination to have other carbon producers and emitters follow suit, and their influence, will only grow.Another reason these alliances are becoming more powerful is that they include unlikely bedfellows who find their investment interests are more closely aligned than ever before. It has been easier than anyone expected for them to make common cause on climate issues. Hard-nosed investors such as BlackRock are worried that energy company operations are exacerbating global warming at the same time as global climate commitments are tightening, which could make them uneconomic. They find their interests converging with those of social justice and ethical investors, such as the Church of England, which focus on inter-generational effects but equally need good returns over the long term.The scale of the carbon emissions problem is staggering. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warned that on current trends, global temperature increases will overshoot the Paris target of 1.5C, reaching 3C by 2100, with devastating consequences. While Shell has set an example that other hydrocarbonintensive industries such as utilities, carmakers and cement manufacturers should also emulate, it is a long way from becoming a low-carbon company. It still commits only 8 per cent of its annual capital expenditure budget of $25bn to clean energy projects.One way for Shell to prove its bona fides is to provide more detail on how executive pay will be linked to the new targets. The oil major could learn from BHP Billiton, which has explicitly linked several hundred executives' pay to progress towards gender parity. Shell's leadership is welcome, as is the new-found influence of investor alliances. Such groups should continue to hold companies to account. Lofty commitments will count for little unless they are effectively implemented.\l"
"COP24","UK","COP24_UK241","The price is right so why delay?","December 27, 2018","Windpower Monthly","Winning the economic argument has been a fundamental goal for the global wind power industry over the past few years. Renewable-energy sources, it was said,would only really flourish when they were cost-competitive with fossil fuels and nuclear. Being green was not enough on its own to persuade policymakers, despite increasing urgency on irreversible climate change.To a large extent,wind power has succeeded in this aim. Its costs, of course,vary widely according to location and the age of the hardware deployed. But recently built projects in most parts of the world are now generating electricity at a levelised cost of energy that compares well with thermal sources, despite low prices for oil and gas,while offshore costs are falling faster than anyone expected.Reaching this goal has not been easy.The industry has made huge progress in the design of wind turbines,which are now of an order of magnitude greater in power,efficiency and reliability than those of even five or ten years ago (p20).The policymakers who demanded clean energy-generating sources with a minimal economic impact on bill-payers have got what they wanted. So why are so many of them still so sluggish to respond? The COP 24 UN climate change summit in Poland's Katowice ended on 15 December with a rough deal agreed on how to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement, but leaving many of the details to the next summit.Failure to deliver The overall tone of the summit was not encouraging, though. In his opening address,Poland's president, Andrzej Duda,boasted that his country was sitting on 200 years worth of coal supplies and that ""it will be hard not to use them"".Of the 50 most polluted cities in the EU,36 are in Poland, causing nearly 50,000 premature deaths a year. How do you get elected with that much contempt for the health of your people? Only the most rabid deniers now refuse to accept the science of climate change.And only the most criminally unaware fail to recognise that the means of generating clean energy at competitive costs are widely available.Jennifer Morgan of Greenpeace summed up the reactions for many as the COP 24 talks concluded: ""A year of climate disasters and a dire warning from the world's top scientists should have led to so much more.Instead, governments let people down again as they ignored the science and the plight of the vulnerable. People expected action,and governments did not deliver.This is morally unacceptable.""\l"

As part of the agreement, USTDA will provide a $996,000 grant for feasibility studies, which are expected to be completed by 2019.Located near the southern city of Divo, the facility is expected to have an installed capacity of between 60 MW and 70 MW and become operational in 2023. In addition to saving an estimated 250,000 tonnes of CO2 per year, the project will also help the country reduce the amount of cocoa waste it produces - currently estimated to be around 26m tonnes annually - and provide a new source of revenue for cocoa farmers.In tandem with the Divo project, Biokala, a subsidiary of local agro-business group SIFCA, and the France-based energy firm EDF are moving forward with a project to build a CFA105bn ((EURO)160.1m) palm oil biomass plant in Aboisso in the county's south-east.Once it becomes fully operational in 2020, the plant is projected to convert around 400,000 tonnes of palm oil into an estimated 288 GWh of electricity per year.Biomass and hydropower key to meeting climate change commitmentsThe development of the biomass projects comes amid HYPERLINK http://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/analysis/green-solution-solar-and-biomass-play-key-roles-bolstering-productiongovernmental efforts to diversify the country's energy mix and increase the role of renewables.As a signatory of the COP21 Conference on Climate Change, C\'f4te d'Ivoire has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 28% by 2030, as well as increasing the share of electricity generated by renewables from current levels of 20% to 42%.As of 2017 some 80% of total electricity generation was generated by natural gas, 19% by hydropower and around 1% by renewables, according to the Ministry of Petroleum, Energy and Renewable Energy Development.To that end, in November last year http://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/news/c%C3%B4te-d%E2%80%99ivoire%C2%A0-une-nouvelle-centrale-hydro%C3%A9lectrique-pour-lib%C3%A9rer-le-potentiel-d%E2%80%99%C3%A9nergie-proprethe country's largest hydroelectric power plant opened at Naoua Falls, near the city of Soubr\'e9. The development of the 275-MW project was undertaken by the China-based Power Construction Corporation, with financing coming from the Export-Import Bank of China and the Ivorian state. The operation of the plant has since been transferred to the state-owned utilities body operator CI-Energies.In addition, four other large-scale hydropower projects are slated for completion by 2030, adding an additional 595 MW of capacity, while the government has unveiled plans to construct a series of smaller hydropower facilities, which are expected to add 81 MW over the period.Renewables expansion to open up private investment opportunitiesThe transition towards renewables and the subsequent increase in electricity generation is also expected to lead to $9bn worth of new investment opportunities for the private sector by 2030.The government plans to HYPERLINK http://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/news/c%C3%B4te-d%E2%80%99ivoire-doubler-la-production-d%E2%80%99%C3%A9lectricit%C3%A9-d%E2%80%99ici-2020increase overall domestic generation capacity to 4000 MW by 2020 and 6000 MW by 2030, up from current levels of around 2200 MW. Of this, the World Bank-backed International Finance Corporation (IFC) estimates biomass capacity alone to total 1200 MW, while CI-Energies puts the figure at 1650 MW.Unlocking this potential presents opportunities for private-sector investment, given that the authorities have set a maximum selling price of CFA62 ((EURO)0.09) per KWh for biomass, considerably higher than the CFA24.78 ((EURO)0.04) per KWh that the government pays to purchase energy from the Azito thermal power plant in Abidjan.However, according to the IFC's recent report on C\'f4te d'Ivoire, the renewable energy sector presents several challenges for stakeholders: procedural regulations regarding the confirmation of the availability, security and calorific testing of biomass supply still need to be clarified.Additionally, the IFC report states that biomass projects necessitate the involvement of the Ministry and Agriculture, and the procedures to do so are not streaml"

Xie Zhenhua, China\' s senior climate official, said the negotiations were at their  most intense point, and that finance commitments to help developing countries address climate change had become a sticking point.\~China has been thrust into the spotlight at this year\' s UN climate talks in Katowice, Poland, amid a leadership vacuum created by the US, which has said it planned to withdraw from the Paris agreement.\~ We hope that the US will come back a little sooner, back into this climate arena, and use its leadership, he said in a briefing with journalists on Thursday.  The US has been an important country and player in this process. \~Many negotiators say the absence of US political leadership has exacerbated the challenges at this year\' s talks, , which are trying to reach agreement on a set of rules for the Paris climate accord.\~As the annual talks near the end of the second week of negotiations, which have already featured several all-night negotiating sessions, little consensus has emerged on what those rules will look like.\~Mr Xie, China\' s longtime climate chief and an architect of the Paris agreement, is one of the most influential people at the climate talks. China is the world\' s largest carbon emitter but also the biggest builder of renewable energy, and it has become an important voice in the negotiations for the bloc of developing countries.\~Mr Xie said that the issue of climate finance  loans from rich countries to poor countries to help with climate change  was still a point of disagreement, because developed countries had not yet met their commitment of $100bn a year in climate finance.\~ The things they were supposed to do, they haven\' t done, or they aren\' t finished yet, and yet they still come out with new demands for the developing countries, he said.  This is the point where the developing countries are the most unhappy. \~Mr Xie also issued a plea for countries to embrace multilateralism. China and France issued a joint statement on climate change at the G20, pledging to uphold the Paris agreement. We wanted to reaffirm our commitment to multilateralism and to supporting a successful outcome from the negotiations at this current COP, he said.\~The talks are scheduled to conclude on Friday evening. However, most delegations expect they will be extended through the weekend as ministers scramble to cut deals.Mr Xie said he had been busy meeting with other delegations to try to bridge the differences that remained. The final result will be that nobody is really happy and nobody is really sad, multilateral agreements are just like that, he said.  Everyone should feel like they have some losses and some gains, that is the best outcome. \l"

On 30 November and 1 December 2018, it will host the Leaders' Summit in Buenos Aires. This event will mark the 10th year since the first Leaders' Summit took place in 2008 in response to the global financial crisis.In 2018, the Argentine Presidency has focused on three agenda priorities: education, employment and innovation issues given the future of work in the digital era; the financing of infrastructure projects to support development; and sustainable agriculture and food security.At this Summit, France will defend a collective approach to key international issues.France's Five Priority AreasThis will be reflected in five priority areas in which multilateralism is essential:Building on the momentum created by the Paris Climate Agreement and stepping up efforts to protect biodiversity. The G20 Summit will take place before the COP24 meeting in Katowice and after the second One Planet Summit in New York. Given the urgency of climate issues, France and its partners will advocate for the G20 to renew its commitment to the environment.Defending a multilateral trading system that is open, rules-based and fair. This involves two closely linked actions: rejecting protectionism and ensuring that the conditions for fair competition are met and World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules are effectively applied. To develop long-term solutions to trade-distorting practices and inappropriate unilateral measures that compromise this goal, the Buenos Aires Summit must result in a roadmap being drawn up for WTO reform.Fighting terrorism and terrorist financing. This means capitalising on the results achieved at the G20 Summit in Hamburg in 2017 and the international ""No Money for Terror"" conference held in Paris on 25 and 26 April 2018, for which a follow-up conference will be held in Australia in 2019.Making progress on sustainable development issues and the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Education, particularly for girls, is one of the French President's priorities. Another is gender equality, which must be a cross-cutting feature in all of the G20's work. Development financing and risk prevention in the field of debt distress in least developed countries are also key questions in 2018. Given rising debt levels in poor countries, we need to reinforce the sustainability and transparency of financing granted by public and private creditors.Promoting better regulated and more inclusive globalisation, focusing on several aspects:- Financial integrity, by ensuring that the G20 commits to fighting corruption and illicit financial flows and maintaining pressure on non-cooperative tax jurisdictions following the Paradise Papers revelations;- The digital field, by taxing digital companies, promoting fair competition among Internet giants and protecting personal data;- The Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, which France will call upon other States to support in order to increase private stakeholders' responsibilities in terms of security in cyber space.Source: French Foreign Ministry website in English 28 Nov 18\l"

It has enough solar, wind and hydro resources to power up the whole continent and to increase the economic development of all its countries. Unfortunately, those valuable resources have not been used well over the last decade. In 2017 it was estimated that two-thirds of Africa's vast population (about 600 million people) currently have no access to energy, and only seven countries on the African continent have electricity access rates over 50%.Access to electricity is a critical element for development; it is needed for powering water supplies, telecommunication services, and strengthening health care and educational delivery services, which in turn also contribute to development in rural areas, supporting new industries and creating more jobs.On Tuesday 4th December at the African Development Bank Pavilion of the UN Climate Talks (COP24) in Poland, experts discussed how to unlock commercial finance for small-scale renewable energy in Africa.'Energy itself is not the final objective for people in the local community. Energy is the catalyst that makes things happens for them' said Dean Cooper, energy sector market development manager at SNV, a non-profit international development organisation founded in the Netherlands, during the panel.Even though the availability of traditional grid-connected electricity generation is slowly increasing via large-scale power plants across the continent, it is now clear that locating and creating alternative options in the 'decentralized' energy space is imperative. Accessible, reliable and affordable energy for all is the way to guarantee social and economic development, and this needs to happen fast.The African Development Bank has been addressing the obvious African energy investment gap. In 2016 African Development Bank approved a $ 100 million financing package to seed the Facility for Energy Inclusion (FEI), a $ 500 million debt platform for small-scale renewables that aims to provide debt financing to small-scale projects and to energy companies and others focused on off-grid energy solutions. This project was considered a big step for the African Development Bank to deliver on its commitments for energy access through decentralized renewables under the New Deal for Energy in Africa.'We started with the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa in 2012, a multi-donor initiative providing risk capital and technical assistance for small-scale renewables of different configurations' says Joao Duarte Cunha - manager for energy initiatives and partnerships at the African Development Bank; 'What we learned with these projects is that the enabling environment has to be there in order to bring these projects to fruition. There is still a lot of work to be done in the countries and with their policymakers. We have been shifting towards more programmatic support for country scale-up programmes that can attract private investors at scale, leveraging our close relationship with African governments and credibility with the investment community'.The African Development Bank has also pledged to commit $ 12 billion of its own resources by 2020, to leverage another $ 50 billion as part of its strategy for delivering energy to the continent, and is increasingly focused on the deployment of renewable energy solutions. By making dialogue easier amongst stakeholders who can impact Africa's energy landscape, the Bank is creating the best possible foundation for accelerated private sector investments in Africa's energy sector for universal energy access.[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uknewswire@enpublishing.co.uk\l"

The proposal by climate commissioner Miguel Arias Ca\'f1ete would make Europe the world's first major economic to go fully ""carbon neutral"". Speaking yesterday, Mr Arias Ca\'f1ete said while the EU already had ""the world's most ambitious"" climate change policies, they were ""clearly not sufficient"" to limit global warming in light of new evidence.The European Commission has unveiled a new strategy assessing options to achieve the goal, laying out a series of scenarios to be considered by member states. National governments will have to agree a final approach next year. That will be submitted to the United Nations in 2020. Agreement on the issue will be hard, however, with some countries like Poland and Germany struggling to meet their commitments, and others such as Denmark, Sweden and Spain seeking a more ambitious commitment.""In October, the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] special report on 1.5C made it clear that emissions need to be reduced with far more urgency than previously anticipated and that limiting climate change to 1.5C is necessary to reduce the likelihood of extreme weather events. This has been a wake-up call,"" Mr Arias Ca\'f1ete told reporters in Brussels.The announcement comes ahead of the COP24 UN summit in Katowice, Poland, where it is hoped the implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change will be finalised. Under current policies the EU is expected to cut emissions by about 60 per cent by 2050 compared to 1990 levels, with most of the work done by new energy efficiency and renewable energy targets. But to meet the Paris Agreement and keep warming below 2C or ideally 1.5C, the Commission's report accepts that more action is needed.The Commission says going carbon-neutral will also have other significant benefits, such as cutting premature air pollution deaths by 40 per cent and adding 2 per cent to the EU's economies by 2050, while reducing energy imports by over 70 per cent and saving up to Euro 3bn a year. The EU is already being hit by climate change, with the worst wildfires on record in Greece this summer killing 99.""The EU has already started the modernisation and transformation towards a climate neutral economy,"" Mr Arias Ca\'f1ete said. ""And today, we are stepping up our efforts as we propose a strategy for Europe to become the world's first major economy to go climate neutral by 2050. Going climate neutral is necessary, possible and in Europe's interest. It is necessary to meet the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. It is possible with current technologies and those close to deployment. And it is in Europe's interest to stop spending on fossil fuel imports and invest in meaningful improvements to the daily lives of all Europeans. No European, no region should be left behind. The EU will support those more impacted by this transition so that everyone's ready to adapt to the new requirements of a climate neutral economy.""\l"

On the morning of Wednesday, 20 March, the week will be formally opened by the President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo; Ghanaian actress and television personality, Joselyn Dumas; and COP24 President Michal Kurtyka.This curtain-raising ceremony will introduce a series of discussions throughout the course of the day that will feature prominent leaders, seeking to unlock barriers around enhanced national climate ambition, as well as issues relating to carbon pricing and markets. A new in-depth program, detailing Wednesday's activities and also the sessions for the remainder of the week, has now been publishedhere.To date, the event has attracted upwards of 1,500 registrations -- far surpassing previous attendance figures and hinting at the renewed significance of the Climate Weeks in relation to driving regional action to implement the Paris Agreement.The Climate Week will attract Ministers, policymakers, and non-Party stakeholders from businesses, community initiatives, financial institutions, and city municipalities across the African continent.To support these record participation numbers, United Nations Volunteers today put out a call for energetic people to facilitate the delivery of the Climate Week. Full details of the tasks involved, as well as information on how to apply, can be foundhere.The Accra event will act as a focal point for actors to showcase groundbreaking solutions to climate change. For example, a Pitch Hub and Knowledge Corner -- located in the heart of the Convention Center -- will provide a stage for specialists from Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), climate change initiatives, and civil society organizations to share ideas with attendees.Meanwhile, the youth will enjoy a strong presence at the Climate Week -- leading on a number of side events to highlight youth-led initiatives, and will also convene a climate march to coincide with Wednesday's high-level segment.Africa is being severely impacted by climate change. From floods in the Lake Victoria basin to drought in Somalia, to environmental degradation in the Sahel region, climate change is a particular threat to continued economic growth and to livelihoods of vulnerable populations across the continent. However, while Africa is one of the lowest contributors to global emissions, it is leading the way by mitigating and adapting to climate impacts through climate action initiatives -- examples of which will be displayed at the conference center.The upcoming Africa Climate Week in Accra is the first 'Regional Climate Week' to be hosted this year which will be followed by the Latin America and the Caribbean and Asia-Pacific Climate Weeks. Collectively, these Climate Weeks will serve as critical stepping stones in the lead-up to the UN Secretary-General's Climate Action Summit in New York in September 2019.Africa Climate Week is being co-convened by UN Climate Change, UN Environment, the West African Development Bank, UN Development Programme, World Bank Group, African Development Bank Group, and International Renewable Energy Agency, in collaboration with Climate Technology Centre Network, UN Food and Agriculture, United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, West African Alliance, Adaptation Fund and Climate and Clean Air Coalition.

"COP24","UK","COP24_UK257","EU energy chief pushes for tougher emissions targets","FT.com"," ","The EU\' s energy chief is pushing for member states to adopt a more aggressive carbon reduction target ahead of UN climate talks later this year. The EU already has some of the most ambitious carbon emission reduction targets in the world but Miguel Arias Ca\'f1ete, the EU energy commissioner, wants the bloc to go further.  We have to press the throttle, Mr Ca\'f1ete said. After the decision of the US to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, the EU has continued to act as one of the leading advocates for reducing emissions targets.Under the new target proposed by Mr Ca\'f1ete, the EU would increase its carbon reduction target to 45 per cent by 2030, up from the current target of 40 per cent, relative to 1990 levels. Raising the EU\' s official target requires the approval of member states through the council of ministers.Mr Ca\'f1ete\' s letter to the council of ministers will include modelling that shows the EU will  de facto reduce emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 because of the other energy targets that have been recently adopted. With new legislation, at least half of the EU\' s electricity will come from renewable sources by 2030, Mr Ca\'f1ete said. To reach the new energy and climate change targets will require a mixture of public and private investment of \â¬ 379bn a year between 2021 and 2030, as well a 50 per cent increase in the amount of new renewables installed each year, Mr Ca\'f1ete said. Reaching the new renewable target is  clearly a challenge , he added.Mr Ca\'f1ete said UN climate talks, which are due take place in December in Katowice, Poland, would be  difficult . Countries that signed up to the 2015 Paris climate deal will try to agree on a common  rule book that will govern the pact.However, the preparatory talks for the conference, known as COP24, have made little progress due to disagreement over whether there should be a single set of rules, or different rules for developed and for developing countries. It\' s a very important COP, and a difficult one, said Mr Ca\'f1ete.The Paris agreement suffered a heavy blow after Donald Trump said last year that the US would pull out of the agreement. The US president denounced the agreement for imposing  draconian financial and economic burdens on his country.If EU ministers formally adopt the new emissions target ahead of the UN climate talks, it would become the first big economy to raise its climate targets under the UN framework this year. However some argue that the EU should be much more ambitious, given the substantial fall in the costs for wind and solar energy and the need to keep temperature rises below 1.5C.Energy ministers from 14 member states  including France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands  wrote to the commission in June requesting it raise its ambitions, some for as much as a 55 per cent reduction by 2030. Climate Action Network Europe estimated that the increase to 45 per cent will  fall well short of what is needed to implement the Paris Agreement .Wendel Trio, director of CAN Europe, said:  We are happy to see that there is growing momentum among member states for scaling up EU climate action from incremental to transformational . . . The increase needs to go far beyond what is currently on the table, and definitely exceed the recently raised energy targets. \l"

Consultations on cyber will begin early next year and focus on prevention, attribution and consequential sanctions. Wider UK-Poland consultations on Russia, beginning early next summer, to share information and improve insight into developments in the region, resulting in a more effective international response to Russian malign activity and greater resilience to hostile state activity in Eastern Partnership countries. Joint support for NATO reforms to ensure it has the right capabilities to deal with the growing number of threats and challenges we all face. This means collectively helping to ensure NATO remains relevant in the evolving security context, and encouraging all allies to follow through with decisions taken at this year's NATO Summit for which the UK and Poland are fully aligned. A Clean Growth Partnership, working together on initiatives to decrease emissions and increase economic growth, including a second Business, Trade and Investment Forum focused on Clean Growth. Together we will build on our joint ""Driving Change Together"" initiative launched during COP24 in Katowice, exploring ways to tackle global green issues such as climate change. A Tech Partnership, including holding a 'Start-up Games' in Warsaw to bring start-up talent and potential investors together.

While their involvement in issues such as climate change has been celebrated, Tognini likens it to ""brainwashing"".She argues: ""Loading the Kalashnikov with a bunch of small kids and firing off is incorrectly teaching them about what it means to stand for something you believe in.""It's incorrectly teaching them that protesting is super fun, comes with a day off school, fawning, supportive media and absolutely no personal cost whatsoever.""Students in more than 90 countries and more than 1,200 cities around the world are planning to walk out of their classrooms on Friday, protesting against the lack of action on climate change by their governments. It could be ""one of the largest environmental protests in history"",CNN reports.The protests have been inspired by 16-year-old protester Greta Thunberg, who held a lone protest outside the Swedish parliament in the run-up to their elections last August. She accused her country of not following the Paris Climate Agreement.Thunberg has given a TED talk on the issue, spoke at the COP24 United Nations climate talks in Poland, andtold world leaders at the 2019 World Economic Forum in Davos:""I don't want you to be hopeful.

As part of the Paris accord, developed countries agreed to help less developed countries achieve their emissions targets by jointly contributing $100bn a year by 2020.Without adequate financing, developing countries will struggle to deal with both the increasing impacts of climate change, and in adopting greener technologies.The proposed changes to the agreement, now under consideration, could mean in future, commercial loans would count towards a developed country's climate finance obligations.The setback comes days after a top UN official warned urgent action was required to avoid the ""catastrophic effects"" of climate change, and warned governments are not doing enough to meet their climate targets.""One point five is the goal that is needed for many islands and many countries that are particularly vulnerable to avoid catastrophic effects. In many cases it means the survival of those countries,"" she said. ""With the pledges we have on the table now, we are not on track to achieve those goals.""ActionAid International, which is monitoring the Bangkok talks said: ""With a little over 48 hours remaining, developed countries, led by the US have roadblocked negotiations on financing.""""Most alarming is the complacency of other developed countries as the US seeks to undermine this vital element of the Paris accord. The organisation added: ""Even parties that want to be seen as climate champions, like those within the EU and Norway, are hiding behind the US and remaining silent.""The Paris agreement set out grand ambitions to move the world away from fossil fuels and avert the worst consequences of climate change. But the plan was vague on details, and after the US and then Australia distanced themselves from the agreement, there has been greater pressure to take decisive and binding action.The Bangkok conference was convened to decide the rules that will govern the accord, but as it draws to a close it looks as though less will have been achieved than organisers hoped. The summit was designed to provide the essential framework for the Paris agreement, ahead of the UN's climate change conference (COP24) in Poland at the end of the year.The US has taken a leading role in the effort to abandon financing agreements, and blocked talks over long-term future financial plans to help limit global emissions, despite the Trump administration announcing its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement back in 2016.Provisions in the agreement mean the US withdrawal will not take effect until 2020.""The contribution of the US negotiators at the talks is actively hindering progress at this critical stage,"" ActionAid International said.\l"

In Poznan, the PM10 level exceeded 200 micrograms. The gusty Wejherowo was not much better, with the acceptable norm exceeded only threefold. In Katowice, where the [UN's COP24] Climate Conference just ended, the PM10 level peaked to almost 200 micrograms, and in the municipalities surrounding the town, it [the concentration] was at times close to 300. The worst [particle pollution] was recorded around Krakow. In Niepolomice, the PM10 level on Tuesday climbed to as high as 297 micrograms per cubic meter.However, all this is still not enough to declare a smog alarm in Polish cities as, in accordance with the provisions adopted by the Minister of the Environment in 2012 that currently regulate levels of air pollutants [in Poland], an alarm is to be instituted when the concentration exceeds 300 micrograms. Only then are village, town, and province heads obligated to launch an emergency crisis management centre; inform the public about the pollution in the media and on the web; send an alert [about exposures] to schools, kindergartens, and hospitals; prohibit children from going outside, even suspend lessons in schools; halt work on construction sites, and reduce truck and passenger-car traffic.Until an alarm is announced, nothing happens -- except for the public suffocating. The airborne substances trigger asthma and lead to respiratory failure and heart attacks.A few weeks ago, the Polish National Health Fund [NFZ] admitted that ""a spike in air-quality deterioration"" contributed to a higher number of deaths in January 2017 than in January 2016. Let us not forget that 2017 began with a major smog episode in all of Poland when high concentrations of poisonous particles were continuously recorded for several days in over 70 per cent of the country.Western European countries institute smog alarms with a toxic concentration at a level three times lower than the values in the Polish air. For example, in Czechia, it is announced when the daily average concentration of noxious PM10 is at 100 micrograms per cubic meter, in France at 80 micrograms, in the Italian Lombardy at 75, in Belgium at 70, and in Slovakia at 150.At such times, French, German, and Italian cities restrict vehicle movement while Austria introduces diesel bans, and Belgium imposes restrictions on house heating.In Poland, residents have for several years appealed to the Ministry of the Environment to lower the alert thresholds, which are the highest in Europe. Yet, neither [former Environment] Minister Jan Szyszko nor current Minister Henryk Kowalczyk has agreed to it.On Tuesday, the Environment Minister's spokesperson said that the work on lowering the alert thresholds has begun. ""Work is under way in the Ministry on the possibility of changing the information and alert thresholds for certain air pollutants,"" Aleksander Brzozka said. An interdepartmental meeting has been scheduled for today. It is still uncertain what threshold would result in a smog alarm being instituted.However, as the Ministry's spokesperson pointed out, the new rules will be enforced in the first half of 2019, in other words: after the smog season has ended.Source: Gazeta Wyborcza in Polish 19 Dec 18\l"
"COP24","UK","COP24_UK263","Q&As: Eat more vegetables to do your bit to stop climate change","December 26, 2018 Wednesday","Gazette (Essex)","Jill Bruce, Women's Institute Climate Change Ambassador, answers your questions on how we can tackle climate change with what we eat.There has been more news in the last few days about climate change, but don't be surprised if you missed it, squeezed between Brexit and more Brexit!Two big stories, one is that huge chunks of Antarctic ice are now breaking away, due to the warming sea. The rate of melt has tripled in the last five years, and will keep on increasing sea levels and flooding unless we reduce our carbon footprint now. The other is COP24, the United Nations meeting on Climate Change in Poland, where UN General Assembly President Maria Espinosa has echoed Sir David Attenborough's warnings by saying mankind is ""in danger of disappearing"" if climate change progresses at its current rate. Of course we don't expect that to happen soon, but we do expect our children's lives to be much more difficult due to climate change, with far more heatwaves, droughts, storms and floods leading to food shortages and price rises.This is too big for governments to change without our help, but fortunately very small changes in the way we live can make a huge difference to our carbon footprint.Q. How does the food we eat make our climate change?A. Surprisingly, about a quarter of our carbon footprint is due to the food we eat. That's more than is produced by all forms of transport combined, including flying. It is partly caused by cows burping methane, as Laurel says, but also by the fuel used by agricultural machinery in sowing, growing, harvesting, processing, packaging, distribution, and discarding waste. Two of the easiest, cheapest ways to keep our world safe for our children are to eat more vegetables and less meat, and to stop wasting food. Buying locally produced food also cuts emissions, and helps our farmers.Q. Why are we being asked to eat less meat and more fruit and vegetables?A. It takes up to 7kg of grain to produce 1kg of meat. This has led to the massive clearance of forests in order to grow crops for livestock, whether that is beef, dairy, pigs or chickens, and we really need those forests to keep taking carbon out of our air for us and as habitats for wild animals and birds. It is healthier and cheaper for us to eat more vegetables, too!Q. What about farmers? They are not going to like it if we buy less meatA.During this summer's drought, grass stopped growing and farmers had to feed their livestock on the silage and hay intended as winter feed. Hay is now twice the price it was last year. Climate change is already hitting farmers harder than anyone else. Changing seasons and unpredictable weather make it hard for them to know what will grow well each year. The best way we can help farmers is by tackling climate changeQ. Will climate change affect our food supply?Q. What are food miles?A. Very simply, the distance your food has had to travel to reach you. If you buy something produced locally rather than on the other side of the world you are cutting your carbon footprint and helping your local farmer. There really are no downsides to tackling climate change. Everyone benefits!\l"

On the morning of Wednesday, 20 March, the week will be formally opened by the President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo; Ghanaian actress and television personality, Joselyn Dumas; and COP24 President Michal Kurtyka.This curtain-raising ceremony will introduce a series of discussions throughout the course of the day that will feature prominent leaders, seeking to unlock barriers around enhanced national climate ambition, as well as issues relating to carbon pricing and markets. A new in-depth program, detailing Wednesday's activities and also the sessions for the remainder of the week, has now been publishedhere.To date, the event has attracted upwards of 1,500 registrations -- far surpassing previous attendance figures and hinting at the renewed significance of the Climate Weeks in relation to driving regional action to implement the Paris Agreement.The Climate Week will attract Ministers, policymakers, and non-Party stakeholders from businesses, community initiatives, financial institutions, and city municipalities across the African continent.To support these record participation numbers, United Nations Volunteers today put out a call for energetic people to facilitate the delivery of the Climate Week. Full details of the tasks involved, as well as information on how to apply, can be foundhere.The Accra event will act as a focal point for actors to showcase groundbreaking solutions to climate change. For example, a Pitch Hub and Knowledge Corner -- located in the heart of the Convention Center -- will provide a stage for specialists from Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), climate change initiatives, and civil society organizations to share ideas with attendees.Meanwhile, the youth will enjoy a strong presence at the Climate Week -- leading on a number of side events to highlight youth-led initiatives, and will also convene a climate march to coincide with Wednesday's high-level segment.Africa is being severely impacted by climate change. From floods in the Lake Victoria basin to drought in Somalia, to environmental degradation in the Sahel region, climate change is a particular threat to continued economic growth and to livelihoods of vulnerable populations across the continent. However, while Africa is one of the lowest contributors to global emissions, it is leading the way by mitigating and adapting to climate impacts through climate action initiatives -- examples of which will be displayed at the conference center.The upcoming Africa Climate Week in Accra is the first 'Regional Climate Week' to be hosted this year which will be followed by the Latin America and the Caribbean and Asia-Pacific Climate Weeks. Collectively, these Climate Weeks will serve as critical stepping stones in the lead-up to the UN Secretary-General's Climate Action Summit in New York in September 2019.Africa Climate Week is being co-convened by UN Climate Change, UN Environment, the West African Development Bank, UN Development Programme, World Bank Group, African Development Bank Group, and International Renewable Energy Agency, in collaboration with Climate Technology Centre Network, UN Food and Agriculture, United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, West African Alliance, Adaptation Fund and Climate and Clean Air Coalition.

Today the CCC published its advice recommending a 2050 net zero emissions target.Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Greg Clark said:Few subjects unite people across generations and borders like climate change and I share the passion of those wanting to halt its catastrophic effects.One of our proudest achievements as a country is our position as a world-leader in tackling this global challenge, being the first country to raise the issue on the international stage, introduce long-term legally-binding climate reduction targets and cutting emissions further than all other G20 countries. Today's report recognises the work we've done to lay the foundations to build a net zero economy, from generating record levels of low carbon electricity to our ambitious plans to transition to electric vehicles.To continue the UK's global leadership we asked the CCC to advise the Government on how and when we could achieve net zero. This report now sets us on a path to become the first major economy to legislate to end our contribution to global warming entirely.Additional information- We are convinced of the urgency of action on climate change, which is why we asked for this advice from the Committee on Climate Change last October.- We are not immediately accepting the recommendations set out in the Committee on Climate Change's detailed report but will be responding in due course to ensure the UK continues to be a world leader in tackling climate change.- The UK is committed to tackling climate change and we are a world leader in cutting emissions while creating wealth. Between 1990 and 2017, the UK reduced its emissions by over 40 per cent while growing the economy by more than two thirds.- In October 2017, we published our Clean Growth Strategy, setting out our plans for meeting our carbon targets and our ambition to legislate for a net zero emissions target. Since then we have continued to bring forward new policy and deliver on the strategy.- We also put clean growth at the heart of our modern Industrial Strategy through making it one of four 'Grand Challenges', boosted by significant innovation funding.- We've heard the urgent calls to protect our wildlife and habitats, and we are already acting to do so.

There's one takeaway from the surrounding conversations, news coverage and research reports: climate change is a serious problem that is already having a tangible impact on the world and people's lives.The recently released Fourth National Climate Assessment reaffirms, 'the impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the United States and are projected to intensify in the future.' The Assessment goes on to explain that travel and tourism is one of several industries expected to be 'degraded by the impacts of climate change.'As a global business, we see the impacts of climate change every day. From hurricanes to droughts, wildfires to floods, our Team Members and guests are facing an increasing number of extreme weather events and natural disasters caused or amplified by global climate change.At Hilton, we take the threat of global climate change very seriously and we've made combatting it a top business priority. Over the past decade, we've made promising strides in curbing our environmental impact, including reducing our carbon emissions by 30%, energy consumption by 21%, water use by 20% and waste by 31%. However, we are conscious there's so much more we and the industry can do.This is why we've taken our corporate responsibility efforts to another level. This May, we became the first major hospitality brand to set science-based carbon reduction targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Our carbon targets align with the carbon reductions stipulated in the Paris Climate Agreement, and they are just one part of our broader Travel with Purpose commitment to cut our global environmental footprint in half and double our social impact investment by 2030.In order to fulfill these commitments and redefine sustainable travel and tourism, Hilton continues to explore new ways to reduce carbon emissions and improve energy efficiency across our business.An example of this is the new photovoltaic solar array currently being installed at the Grand Wailea - A Waldorf Astoria Resort. Once completed, the 1.5 megawatt solar array will be the largest on the island of Maui and will significantly reduce our carbon emissions by providing clean renewable energy to the hotel. The Millennium Hilton Bangkok has also installed a solar-powered hot water heater that doesn't require grid electricity to heat the hotel's water.We're also testing 'smart' technologies including Hilton's Connected Room, which will enable guests to sync air conditioning and lighting preferences with their schedule and will allow our hotel operators to monitor how their hotels are managing energy in real time. In conjunction with our award-winning LightStay system, Connected Room will help us track how effectively we are reducing our environmental impact.However, with every climate change report and conference, we're reminded of how quickly this critical global issue is progressing - and how serious the impacts will be for our industry. As chairman of the World Travel and Tourism Council, Chris Nassetta, Hilton's president and CEO, has dedicated his platform to fostering sustainable tourism and is calling on the industry to make big changes now.We hope you will join us in combatting climate change. To our industry peers, let's make sustainable tourism a priority and work together to scale solutions. To our guests, we ask that you Travel with Purpose by continuing to demand and expect sustainability not just from us but all of your travel companies. We all want to enjoy the amazing places the world has to offer - now and in the future.Hilton Corporate CommunicationsMcLean, Virginia 22102 HYPERLINK mailto:hiltonpr@hilton.comhiltonpr@hilton.com[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to HYPERLINK mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uknewswire@enpublishing.co.uk\l"

Not Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, who, despite facing criticism for exceeding his mandate, has suggested the risks arising from climate change should form part of its annual stress tests for banks from 2019. The suggestion is timely. It comes a few days after rules governing how to implement the Paris climate agreement were approved, against significant odds, by nearly 200 countries at the COP24 talks in Poland. It is also uncontroversial  it does not require a change to the regulatory framework, but simply adds a risk to the list that banks are already meant to measure. Furthermore, the Bank of England is suggesting including climate change as an exploratory scenario, which banks can neither pass nor fail. They are required only to scrutinise whether they are doing enough. For that reason, many climate activists will consider the proposal, much like the Paris agreement itself, does not go far enough. The measure should at least help to convince financial sector actors of the potential impact they face from climate issues. The latest warnings about global warming are sobering. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change HYPERLINK http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/ report noted that on current trends, average global temperatures are set to rise by 3-4C from pre-industrial levels by 2100. Failure to take action to curb that rise creates multiple risks. Extreme heat events are likely to multiply. So, too, are the frequency and intensity of heavy rain and floods, and of droughts. Actions taken to mitigate climate change also carry risk. New policies aimed at limiting average global temperature rises, in l"

Since being elected he has sent mixed signals about his green intentions, saying Brazil could stay in the agreement if certain conditions are met but also indicating he wishes to strip powers from his nation's environment agencies.""My inclination is ... to say that we shouldn't leave the agreement,"" Ricardo Salles, who is tipped to become minister after Bolsonaro assumes office on 1 January, said in an interview. ""But on the other hand, it doesn't signify that we will accept any and all sanctions, restrictions and programmes indisputably.""All countries must respect Brazilian autonomy to manage its territory and to decide its environmental policies internally,"" he said.Brazil has committed to cutting emissions 37 per cent by 2025 and 43 per cent by 2030 under the agreement, although the country has yet to fully lay out how it will meet those goals. It will use common sense in the details of how it will deal with the agreement, and the country thus far has been very responsible in preserving a large proportion of its native vegetation, the incoming minister said.Mr Salles, who previously served as the top environmental official for the state of Sao Paulo, said he does believe climate change exists, although he could not say for sure whether it is human-made or a change that is occurring naturally. Brazil should leave that question to academics and get on with the ""less charming"" business of environmental protection, he said, including dealing with waste, biodiversity, soil issues and converting the car fleet to lower emission biofuels.Mr Bolsonaro will not cut the budget of the ministry and environmental agencies government oversees, which include enforcer Ibama - the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources - and conservation area administrator ICMBio, Mr Salles said. But environmental agencies are not producing the results they should be with the resources they are given, and he said he will seek to correct this ""mismanagement"" and ""inefficiency"".Asked about whether Brazil should reconsider Ibama's decision last week to deny Total SA a permit to drill in the sensitive Foz do Amazonas basin near the Amazon rainforest, Mr Salles said it would have to make sure ideology did not enter into the decision and that it was based solely on facts.The country must strike a balance in environmental licensing, whether for farms or mines, and development, as overly strict rules drive people to illegality or lead producers to exit the market, he said.Though Mr Bolsonaro has not been as forthcoming about his views on climate change as US president Donald Trump, he has been associated with known climate change deniers, including his new foreign minister who called global warming a ""Marxist plot"". When Mr Trump first announced his decision to quit the Paris accord, the Brazilian president elect shared an article defending the decision on Twitter titled ""the greenhouse fables"".Recently he criticised the Brazilian government's environment agencies and said he will take away their powers to impose ""fines all over the place"".Attendees at the UN COP24 climate summit currently underway in Poland have expressed concerns that under Mr Bolsonaro's leadership Brazil could be turned into a ""climate rogue"" state.\l"

The greatest progress has been made in the public debate. You see everywhere that the way we talk about our climate has completely changed. For example, until just before the adoption of the Paris Agreement you still had many discussions about the science, also at international level during the climate negotiations. That has completely shifted. You also see that it has become more difficult for policy makers to hide behind the non-action of other countries. We are all part of the Paris Agreement, we have all committed to the same goals, and the national climate plans (NDC's) show that the climate efforts of most big economies do not differ that much. Where much more work needs to be done is when it comes to translating this shift in discourse into concrete action. See for example what happened recently when EU environment ministers adopted, under pressure from the automobile industry, completely inadequate targets for CO2 emissions from cars and light commercial vehicles. Even more worrying, take the vague language on increasing the evenly inadequate EU 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target. How worried are you by US President Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and should we be more positive considering two of the fastest economies in the world, India and China, are adopting strategies to use more renewable energy? Of course, the election of Trump was a blow. However, when it comes to the international climate negotiations, it is reassuring to see that little has changed. It even created an almost opposite effect; negotiators became more determined to make the Paris Agreement work. ""The election of Trump was a blow. However, when it comes to the international climate negotiations, it is reassuring to see that little has changed. It even created an almost opposite effect; negotiators became more determined to make the Paris Agreement work"" The 'We Are still In' movement, also has a positive effect. All those US federal states, cities, business who basically say that even without the national government playing its part they are still committed to the Paris Agreement. And not only when it comes to greenhouse gas reductions, but also to international climate financing. That the withdrawal by Trump has had less effect than one would expect is also because people realise he is in complete denial of where the future is heading. In the longer term, his anti-climate policies will seriously damage the competitiveness of the US economy. The development in India and China is indeed something to be more positive about. I would even go one step further: it is something to watch out for. If you see how fast those countries are going when it comes to electric cars for instance, we have to be very careful in Europe that we do not miss the boat through sloppy policies. Do you think the EU is doing enough to show global leadership on the issue of climate change and where it can improve? Leading is something you do by example. The coming months are crucial for the EU in that regard. We all know that the national climate plans (NDCs) of the parties to the Paris Agreement are far from sufficient, including the one of the EU. If all those climate plans are rigorously implemented, we still face a temperature rise of at least three degrees Celsius. The in Poland is the moment to change that. Countries will be collectively reviewing their climate plans during the so-called Talanoa dilogue. It's a very important moment, especially since the next official collective review will only be in 2023. If the EU wants to show global leadership, this is the moment to shine. Why would other countries make stronger international pledges, if the EU, an economic giant, and with so much historical responsibility, does not manage to increase its NDC of minus 40 percent and bring it in l"

We have also spent time in the Alps and in both of those locations we have seen the effects of climate change firsthand.\'e2(EURO)oeWe wanted to travel from the southern-most point to the northern-most point of Alaska but our expedition was cut short at the very end due to the fact that many Arctic lakes which once held water have now drained, meaning we were unable to kayak in them. Having that personal and very clear view of climate change had a big impact and it has stuck in our minds.\'e2(EURO)The pair had a similar experience in the French Alps, over a period of years noticing the steady retreat of the Mer de Glace glacier.Mrs Robertson added: \'e2(EURO)oeWe were fortunate enough in 2001 to go to the French Alps and returned 17 years later and we were able to count the number of steps it had receded.\'e2(EURO)oeIn 1988 it would have taken three steps to get down the ladder to the glacier, in 2001 it took 106 steps and by 2018 this had extended to more than 400 steps.

We've already almost halved our emissions based on 1990 levels but we are in the process of legislating to increase our ambitions to keep pace with the Paris commitments.""We aim to be a carbon neutral country by 2050, we aim to be net zero of all greenhouse gas emissions as soon as we possibly can achieve that and we will achieve that by taking action across a range of sectors.""We have set ambitious targets around electric vehicles and we want to be a country that is reaping the economic benefits of being an early adopter and being in the lead on tackling climate change.""Sturgeon went on to highlight the economic advantage for countries that become ""early adopters and innovators"". With a population of five million, Scotland had a ""significant"" low carbon and renewable economy, with 50,000 jobs.""It has a turnover of \Â£311 billion, so it is significant and growing. By being a leader, for example in wind energy and tidal energy, we've created jobs and research opportunities and economic opportunities.She said: ""We will be working closely with civil society, trade unions, the NGO community and private companies to demonstrate that there is nothing to fear and everything to gain from the transition to a low carbon economy; that we can create new jobs that replace jobs in the older industries; and that those jobs can often be higher skilled, better paid.""So we can benefit by doing the right thing for our own country and for the planet.""Earlier, African climate leaders had called on the Scottish Government to raise its ambition on climate change.In a letter to Sturgeon, the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA) - representing more than 1000 member organisations from 45 African countries - praised Holyrood for its pioneering efforts so far, notably the ""bold step"" of launching the Climate Justice Fund which has been emulated elsewhere.However, its executive director Mithika Mwenda said that in light of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, Scotland must respond by ""putting in place measures to drastically cut its emissions as science demands"".""For communities in Africa devastated by the adverse effects of climate change, we keep hoping against hope that countries like Scotland will rise to the occasion and stand to be counted as the global community rallies against time to avoid the precipice,"" he said.Chris Hegarty, spokesperson for Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, added: ""The Paris Agreement puts equity at the heart of global efforts to tackle climate change, yet this principle is under threat with richer countries unwilling to do their fair share.""\l"

As no consensus could be reached, the text ultimately had to be dropped.""The fact that a group of four countries were trying to diminish the value and importance of a scientific report they themselves, with all other countries, requested three years ago in Paris is pretty remarkable,"" said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists.While the oil-producing Gulf states had long been ""troublemakers"", and Russia's intentions were unclear, Mr Meyer attributed US action to president Donald Trump's ""cavalier attitude"" towards climate science.An avowed climate sceptic, since taking power Mr Trump has rolled back many US environmental protections and declared the withdrawal of the US from the Paris climate agreement.""That fossil fuel corporations and governments overrun by fossil fuel interests are buddying up should come as no surprise, but there should be no place in these climate talks to take steps backwards, to attempt to sidel"

We have a source of unlimited clean energy in the form of solar power - we just need to capture it. Last year solar energy only provided 3.5% of the energy used in the UK. Increasing this share will take time, investments and innovation. 2017 saw the global renewables sector enjoy significant growth as a result of increased uptake and support from national governments and global climate change initiatives, such as the United Nations . In addition, renewable energy is benefiting from increasing cost efficiencies and is in most cases supported by some form of Government and/or regulatory support. In the UK, renewable energy capacity has increased to 40.5GW, demonstrating a 13.3% increase from the previous year, notwithstanding the retraction of the ROC regime. The Company believes that, within renewable energy, solar represents the most attractive risk-adjusted investment opportunity. Of the 40.5GW of renewable energy capacity installed in the UK, solar represented 12.8GW. In its fourth year of operation, the Company has contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions into the Earth's atmosphere. The amount of CO(2) emissions avoided by the Company's plants amounts to 158,600 tonnes per annum. This amount is expected to increase as the new plants being acquired are commissioned and achieve a full year of operation. Market Growth Today, out of the total global share of the market, solar PV constitutes 306GW of installed capacity and is estimated to grow to between 489 - 716GW by 2020. Global cumulative installed capacity (all energy) by 2040 is estimated to reach some 14,000GW of which solar would constitute 32%. A total of $2.8 trillion of investment in solar is expected between 2017 and 2040. The focus for this increased capacity will be initially on wind and solar PV. However, as the cost balance shifts in favour of solar PV, the Company expects solar energy to become the dominant driver of new capacity. Other than investment value, the growing transition to cleaner energy is driven by the primary considerations to tackle and address climate change. The Paris COP21 Agreement was ratified by 146 countries and continues to be adhered to. Developed countries and economies in transition across the globe continue to embrace renewable energy as a key energy source to satisfy increased energy demand and replace obsolete power generation plants. Both developed and developing countries have set high renewable energy capacity targets for 2020. For example, Italy is preparing targets to increase solar installed capacity for 2030 to 55GW in place of coal, from an existing capacity of 20GW in 2017. Of these dedicated countries, the 2020 targets are now within reach and hence governments are looking towards 2030. The relative rapidity of the construction of renewable energy plants, in particular solar, and the decreasing investment cost of solar shows that these targets are becoming more and more realistically achievable. The UK itself has seen its efforts reach fruition: 21 April 2017 was a ""watershed"" moment when Britain went a full day without turning on its coal-fired power stations for the first time in more than 130 years. On 26 May 2017, the UK achieved a solar power record as 8.7GW of solar power was generated at 1pm, representing 24.3% of the entire power demand in the UK. The Company's contribution to this was 5% (or 0.47GW), which represented 1.5% of the entire power demand in the UK at 1pm. Continuing this trend, on 18 April 2018, the UK reached 55 continuous hours without coal. Only a few days later on 24 April 2018, it was 72 hours, another record.

The Statement asks governments to strengthen their Nationally Determined Contributions to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and to enact policies to facilitate the world's transition to a low-carbon economy.Three overarching priorities are highlighted in the Statement for global leaders to address: achieving the Paris Agreement's goals; accelerating private sector investment into the low carbon transition and committing to improve climate-related financial reporting. Additional detail is provided in an accompanying briefing paper also shared with leaders. Among specific policies, the investors request governments ""phase out thermal coal power"", ""put a meaningful price on carbon"" and ""phase out fossil fuel subsidies.""Investors highlight the ""ambition gap"" the U.N. has determined exists between governments' commitments and what is needed to deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement - in limiting global warming to well below 2\'b0C - and ensuring the necessary transition to a low-carbon economy.

The Statement asks governments to strengthen their Nationally Determined Contributions to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and to enact policies to facilitate the world's transition to a low-carbon economy.Three overarching priorities are highlighted in the Statement for global leaders to address: achieving the Paris Agreement's goals; accelerating private sector investment into the low carbon transition and committing to improve climate-related financial reporting. Additional detail is provided in an accompanying briefing paper also shared with leaders. Among specific policies, the investors request governments ""phase out thermal coal power"", ""put a meaningful price on carbon"" and ""phase out fossil fuel subsidies.""Investors highlight the ""ambition gap"" the U.N. has determined exists between governments' commitments and what is needed to deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement - in limiting global warming to well below 2\'b0C - and ensuring the necessary transition to a low-carbon economy.

"COP24","UK","COP24_UK295","INSIGHT: IEA focuses on carbon capture, use and storage for tackling emissions reduction","December 11, 2018 Tuesday","ICIS Chemical News","LONDON (ICIS)--If chemical producers believe they can continue to benefit from above-GDP rates of demand growth, how seriously do they expect to contribute to greenhouse gas emissions reduction?Increasing pressure to tackle carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gas emissions will weigh heavily on petrochemicals producers in many parts of the world, while advancing climate change presents a clear challenge to growth.It is technically feasible to halt global warming at 1.5C, a special[1] report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has suggested, but the goal requires direct action from governments and steep cuts in emissions.How that might be achieved in a period of global expansion with more people living in cities, travelling and consuming is the challenge of the age.Chemical producers have to innovate on many fronts to deliver the materials that effect emissions reductions. They also have to work to curb their own emissions and introduce processes that release less carbon and consume less power or use power that is sourced from renewables.Marrying the two is seen by many businesses as vitally important if carbon emissions are to be curtailed and if we are to avoid the predicted temperature increases and disruption that are expected to accompany climate changeThe International Energy Agency (IEA) this week has highlighted the importance of carbon capture use and storage (CCUS), a series of technologies that have not seriously found their mark, in tackling climate change. Without CCUS as part of the solution, reaching our international climate goals is practically impossible, said the IEA s exeutive director, Fatih Birol, ahead of a recent conference. The IEA was promoting its [2]CCUS campaign ahead of the COP24 series of meetings and ahead of its own meeting of (energy) ministers in 2019.New business models are showing that CCUS is increasingly cost-competitive across a range of sectors, says the IEA.In one of its energy scenarios, which looks at how climate goals might be met while tackling air pollution while ensuring universal energy access, almost all new investments would have either to be zero carbon, offset by retiring other emitting facilities or would need new technology like CCUS or hydrogen.The IEA estimates that more than 450m tonnes of CO2 emissions could be captured for use or storage each year with an incentive equivalent of less than $40/tonne of CO2. Increased investment and deployment of CCUS, especially where there are opportunities to act at low cost, could help trigger further cost reductions, it adds.Ahead of a CCUS [3]conference last month, it said that there is no other cost-effective technology solution capable of delivering the deep emissions reductions needed across key industrial processes such as steel, cement and chemicals manufacturing, oil and gas production all of which will remain vital building blocks of modern society .CCUS is also the only technology that can reduce emissions from coal-fired power generation, which has continued to increase despite the push towards renewables.Carbon capture and storage, or reduction, technologies may not be new, or fashionable, but they are likely to prove essential in tackling emissions from large, energy intensive and CO2 emitting facilities. They will become increasingly cost-effective as the cost of carbon rises.They will not be used in place of the shift towards renewables, greater resource efficiency and the upgrading of production assets with the retiring of older facilities.But the IEA has stressed that they are probably the only way to assure energy security and tackle emissions from new coal-fired power plants in some parts of the world and of maintaining output from existing energy-intensive production plants and industries such as steel.By Nigel DavisReferences1.

The climate policy of the European Union and the winter package compel a further decrease of the share of coal in the energy mix amid the continuously growing demand for electricity. The minister said that Poland must introduce a new low carbon energy source that would allow it to reduce the average CO2 emissions produced in the course of electricity generation.As Mr Tchorzewski noted, development of nuclear energy would be an investment in Polish engineering know-how and the economy. The minister said that for the Polish industry, nuclear power provides an opportunity to implement technologically advanced projects that can contribute to the creation of stable, high-value jobs. He added that the development of the nuclear sector in Poland may also be a factor in accelerating the transfer of technologies and the development of many parent industries.Nuclear energy also allows countries to comply with the objectives of the Paris Agreement as it contributes significantly to cutting CO2 emissions. Poland is already showing its commitment, having recently joined the Nuclear Innovation Initiative under the Clean Energy Ministerial (NICE Future), and hosting the next Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 24) in December 2018 in Katowice.A recent report published by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that achieving the 1.5C goal, in l"

Some see the talks dragging on until tomorrow.Donald Trump's shadow looms large over the conference, as his pledge to remove the US from the Paris climate agreement appears to have driven the US to align with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia.Concerns were raised the moment this coalition of oil producers questioned the importance of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's scientific findings.""They are going to the letter of what Trump said ??? when he announced the intention to withdraw,"" Camilla Born from climate change think tank E3G told The Independent.The group's intransigence has meant US delegates held back from making stronger pledges to cut fossil fuels and emissions - a crucial step to limiting warming to 1.5C as the IPCC report recommends Mohamed Adow, Christian Aid's international climate lead, criticised US representatives attempting to water down an agreement they will not even be part of for much longer.""Their reckless intention to withdraw from the Paris agreement was bad enough, but yet they continue to hang around like a bad smell, blocking progressive action from other countries,"" he said. Ms Born said the US team seemed to be keeping the nation closely enough aligned that a future administration might participate, but their caution was giving power to other disruptive participants.""That has certainly emboldened the likes of Saudi, who are one of the bad guys when it comes to doing more on climate change,"" she said.As it stands, the draft text references the 1.5C target and the need to step up efforts, but avoids outright ""welcoming"" the scientific findings in a possible concession to these polluters.Jennifer Morgan, Greenpeace International's executive director, warned against such concessions at such a late stages in the talks.""Compromise texts are paid for in human lives lost and the poor and vulnerable are demanding so much more,"" she said.With the US unwilling to take the lead, a group of nations including the EU has formed a high ambition coalition pledging to further cut emissions and help poorer countries achieve their own climate targets.Meanwhile the major emerging economies of China and India have remained relatively quiet throughout, and may yet make their presence felt in the final stages.Head of climate change at WWF, Gareth Redmond-King, said there was a divide between nations that feel threatened by climate change and those that ""feel a bit more threatened by climate action"". Bringing these competing forces together requires a strong presidency, and Mr Redmond-King said there had been concerns the coal-loving Polish leadership had struggled in this task.He said the ultimate goal is to achieve an agreement that commits to ratcheting up climate commitments by 2020, when countries must release their official targets for cutting emissions.Other key issues need resolving too, including how countries transparently report their emissions, and whether nations should be paid to fix damage caused by climate change.""The number one reason we are still here is because it's really complicated - it's technically really complicated and politically really complicated,"" said Ms Born.\l"

These conferences are held every year and COP 24 is the informal name for the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which will be held later this year in Katowice, Poland.One would think that after 24 years of conferences there would be some progress in the shape of legally binding agreements but there are few of these. One would think all countries were reducing their greenhouse gas emissions but China and India are rapidly increasing theirs and are responsible for 34 per cent of global emission. Each of these conferences has attracted between 11,300 and 15,000 participants, plus another 6,000 attendees from UN bodies, agencies, intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations and 2,000 journalists.One must ask how much additional greenhouse gases have been created by, say 20,000 people every year for 23 years, from their flights, hotels, limousines, taxis and other sources: probably the CO2 output of a small country.

I want you to panic.

"COP24","UK","COP24_UK303","Africa and the Arab world are key to a clean-coal alliance","November 18, 2018","Al-Arab Weekly","Egypt, Oman, Iran, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates all have clean-coal plants on the drawing board or under way.Egypt, Oman, Iran, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates all have clean-coal plants on the drawing board or under way.T h eA r a bW e e k l yThe Arab WeeklyJOHANNESBURG - Sharing technology on clean coal, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Marek Magierowski says, ""lies at the heart of our relations with India.""He made the comment on a recent visit to New Delhi. Like many in Africa and Asia, both Poland and India get most of their electrical power from fossil fuel.Egypt is building a clean-coal plant run with expertise from China. Iran and the United Arab Emirates are doing likewise and Japan and the United States have considered pooling research.Australia and South Africa are leaders in carbon capture and a cleaner burn and Colombia, which has one of the world's largest coal mines, is helping Latin America along the same path.So why isn't there a clean-coal alliance?""We need a global sharing of research and the climate change summit in Poland next month could be where it happens,"" said Samson Bada, a Nigerian engineer at Witwatersrand University (Wits) in Johannesburg.Bada said the cost of electricity has become a political issue around the globe ""and a lack of power comes up at every election right across the developing world."" Economies in Asia, Africa and the Middle East ""will not stop using fossil fuel, no matter what activists in New York or London may say so the task is to make it cleaner,"" Bada said.Rosemary Falcon, a recently retired professor in charge of clean-coal research at Wits, said an ""alliance is crucial and it would need to cover oil, gas and coal because all these put off smoke if you don't use them properly and there's an overlap in the chemistry.""How can anyone suggest a poor country without the technology should be left to pollute the air with coal or gas when we know how to burn it cleanly? Obviously, this is something we must share with everyone.""COP24  scheduled for December 3-14 in Katowice, Poland, could be the place to build ""even an informal union where we can share the science.""Falcon said coal was the cheapest and most reliable source of energy. ""Sun and wind only work some of the time and there has to be a baseload, topped up with renewables,"" she said.However, she added, any association must include all continents. ""People forget that Tanzania has 4 billion tonnes of coal or Colombia with its huge open-cut mines. Africa, Asia and Latin America must all be part of the mix.""Despite its huge oil reserves, she said the Arab world relied on a mix for electricity including gas and coal. ""Even so, it's a voice that's often left out,"" Falcon said.""I'm passionate about the environment,"" said Jacob Masiala, like Bada, one of Falcon's former students at Wits, ""but those who want to see an end to fossil fuel need to spend more time on the ground in Africa.""Masiala said he believes in climate change but laments that ""it's become an obsession for the pampered and well-off."" The priorities for poorer countries are different, he said.""When you have no job and live in a shack without electricity and your family is always hungry, you don't talk about climate change. You worry about the next meal, not the next 50 years,"" Masiala said.The idea of an alliance is not new. Indian Coal Minister Piyush Goyal, for instance, has been hinting at it for years. ""We must share technology for clean coal because this will be the mainstay in India's fuel mix,"" he said at a meeting in Japan in 2015.US Secretary for Energy Rick Perry spoke about it on a visit to Cape Town in 2017, saying the supply of electricity across the developing world was not just a social issue but ""a matter of national security for the United States.""Perry said that without power, poor countries were unable to industrialise, leading to ""poverty and a lack of jobs that drives young people to join militia.""It was a factor, he said, in the war on terror.So why no treaty? Could it happen in Poland, home to one of the world's most ambitious clean-coal programmes?The first step is money. Even an NGO would need a secretariat with an office and a media team to get the word out. Fees from members could meet the cost but someone must kick it off.At the United States Energy Association, a grouping of public and private energy-related organisations, executive director Barry Worthington said it was also a matter of politics. ""Energy is tricky,"" he said.Taiwan has the world's largest clean-coal plant, he said, ""so how do you put them at the same table as China?""One could say the same about Turkey and Saudi Arabia or the United States and North Korea.He said this made it vital to set up an alliance that was politically neutral.""Emissions blowing south from Pakistan don't stop when they reach the border with India. ""Ideally, there must be space for everyone at the table,"" Worthington said.He said the Paris Accord on climate change might serve as a template. ""Some in the room are on less than good terms but they work to a common goal,"" he said. ""Why can't we do the same thing with clean coal?"" is contentious because Poland has angered the European Union by building coal-powered generators and is planning more.Developing countries, however, may be sympathetic to the Polish view.Zimbabwe has among the largest coal deposits in Africa. Tanzania has a new plant on the border with Mozambique and Kenya is building its first near Lamu on the coast. South Africa is a leading exporter and gets more than 90% of its own power from coal.Africa is often dismissed as a bit player but, for a clean-coal alliance, it could lead the way. Asia is of the same mind. India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia and the Philippines are growing their use of coal.The World Bank refuses to fund anything using oil, gas or coal but hundreds of projects across the globe have been funded by China, India or the private sector.World Bank President, Jim Yong Kim admits he's getting pushback. Leaders in Africa, he said, complained that the World Bank would not let them ""have baseload power because we can't use a single drop of fossil fuel for our own energy needs.""""I can tell you, when I hear that, it's compelling to me,"" he said.However, he and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Christine Lagarde ruled out any change though the United States, the largest donor to the World Bank and IMF, has made clear it wants an end to the ban.Masiala said any policy that ignored Africa was doomed. ""We hold nearly one-quarter of the seats at the United Nations but millions of our people are still without electricity,"" he said. ""Yet there are those who seem to view themselves as our overlords.""Bada agreed, saying: ""That's why we need an alliance of countries using fossil fuel. It would put us all on a more even footing, from big players like the United States and China, across to Africa and Latin America and, of course, the Arab world.""Falcon says she has no doubt it will happen. ""The idea of an alliance may have started with India and the United States but smaller countries are now pushing it,"" she said, ""and I think we could see Poland take the lead at the COP meeting in December.""I guess there will be protesters in Katowice telling us there's no such thing as clean coal but anyone with a brain has moved on. The focus now is on working together so coal can be part of the plan on climate change.""

Agriculture and consumer choices are major factors driving disastrous climate change.'We need a robust and ambitious policy response to address the climate impacts of agriculture and consumer choices - and scientists have a major role to play. 'Our new report is a wake-up call to leaders.'The researchers are urging world leaders to shift toward climate-smart systems.And, they're calling on the public to make changes, too.Reducing meat consumption would benefit both public health and the climate. HOW MUCH FOOD DOES THE WORLD WASTE EVERY YEAR? Billions of tons of food amounting to roughly $1 trillion goes to waste each year without ever reaching the consumer's plate, a shocking new study has found.According to the report from the Global Panel on Agriculture and Food Systems for Nutrition, the total annual waste accounts for one third of all food produced for human consumption.Food is often thrown away by retailers for aesthetic reasons, the report points out.And, perishable items frequently spoil during transportation, storage, and refrigeration.Both retailers and consumers are guilty of buying more than they need, particularly in high income areas.The study found that more than half of all fruits and vegetables produced every year are wasted, while 25 percent of meat (or 75 million cows) never makes it to the table.The wasted items also include high-nutrient foods such as seeds, nuts, dairy products, and seafood.Experts say reducing food waste is a critical step in ensuring people have access to the nutrients they need.With a more innovative approach to food, such as meat-mushroom mixes, lab-grown meat, algae, and appealing insect-based foods, the researchers say we could slash emissions and fight obesity simultaneously.But, in any case, the researchers say it's time for world leaders to take action.'This is no time for business as usual,' said Professor Volker ter Meulen M.D., co-chair of the IAP project.'High-calorie diets have become cheaper, and this has serious implications for public health, obesity, and malnutrition.'Science is critical to tackling the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular, hunger and health.'\l"

Nothing but the contempt of the 174 countries that signed it, which is almost the entire world (now with the exception of Trump's United States),"" Rossi wrote.In a 2 December editorial, leading daily O Estado de Sao Paulo requested from the new government ""prudence and moderation"".The newspaper made clear it was referring to all who were currently involved in the Bolsonaro transition team, whose ""words and actions"" could have considerable impact inside and outside of Brazil.The editorial made a special reference to what it called the ""worrisome"" visit to the United States last week of Bolsonaro's son, federal deputy Eduardo Bolsonaro.According to O Estado, congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro ""travelled to the US as a special envoy of his father, to offer, without expecting anything in return, the full support of Brazil for the agenda of President Donald Trump"".The worst part of the visit, according to the newspaper, occurred when Eduardo Bolsonaro let himself be photographed ""with a Trump 2020 cap"". O Estado said diplomacy required ""neutrality in foreign political disputes"".Writing in his blog on news website UOL on 2 December, analyst Josias de Souza said Eduardo Bolsonaro ""behaved as if he was another Foreign Minister"", despite the fact that the president-elect had already appointed Ernesto Araujo as Brazil's future top diplomat.Souza pointed to Eduardo's Bolsonaro's interview with US TV channel Fox News, which was posted by the congressman on his own Facebook page. ""With his humility reduced to a minimum, he [Eduardo Bolsonaro] said that his trip was intended to pave the way for the recovery of Brazil's credibility, for a country that had just abandoned socialism to be a much more liberal economy,"" the analyst wrote.In a few minutes of air time, Eduardo Bolsonaro ""offered a complete package"", according to de Souza. He put ""China aside"", left Brazilian meat exporters ""nervous"" and enlisted Brazil ""in Trump's infantry"", the analyst added. Some see 'overreaction' against BolsonaroHowever, some media analysts defended Jair Bolsonaro's courting of the United States, especially after the president-elect met with White House National Security Advisor John Bolton, who paid him a visit in Rio de Janeiro on 29 November. Bolsonaro, who is an ex-Army captain, greeted Bolton with a military salute.Merval Pereira, writing in daily O Globo on 2 December, rejected criticism of this salute, saying Bolsonaro only offered a ""gesture of kindness, and not one of subservience as his rivals want us to believe"".Writing in daily O Estado de Sao Paulo on 1 December, Neumanne had harsh words for such critics: ""Go get a life, you idiots.

For instance, drought in the Sahel region last year led to widespread pasture and water deficits, with Mauritania and northern Senegal being the most affected.Africa also has been experiencing the greatest rates of food insecurity.The growth of Africa's agricultural sector is central to increasing prosperity, food security, industrialization, intra-African trade and to bolstering Africa's contribution to global trade. On a more basic level, millions of human lives rely on the land to produce the food they need to survive.Clearly, building resilience to climate shocks including drought and floods is a pressing priority for the Continent.

It is also, to a large degree, due to Beijing\' s early support of solar and wind power industries that we have witnessed a remarkable fall in prices of renewable energy over the past decade.The BRI offers an even bigger chance for China to show leadership in climate financing.

A lot of the unpaid work that women do, such as collecting firewood and water, and caring for the family, are massively affected by climate change - so we have to make sure adaptation initiatives address their needs, vulnerabilities and potential.""Women as agents of changeStudies show that when women are part of decision making, ratification of multilateral agreements on the environment are more likely, adds Mafalda Duarte, head of the $ 8.3 billion Climate Investment Fund, one of the largest climate financing instruments in the world.There is also strong evidence that women play a vital role in dealing with disasters by mobilising communities - something that will become increasingly important as climate change advances, she says.""Discourse is quite tilted to considering women as victims of climate change - but we are agents of change and if we are perceived as such this will make a big difference,"" says Ms Duarte.""Our empowerment represents greatly under-utilised opportunities to build our economies and tackle climate change.""When women are empowered - given access to finance, assets and decision making - there are big impacts across sectors, she adds.""Renewable energy is traditionally seen as a male sector but if you are deliberate in giving access to women, they become entrepreneurs and help us push forward that agenda,"" says Ms Duarte.Women can drive business and technology solutionsWhen women are empowered equally to men there is a massive leap forward in economic gains: a recent McKinsey study found that if women were participating economically as much as men, they would be adding 28 trillion dollars to global GDP by 2025.In Africa, lack of access to finance has resulted in an estimated $ 42 billion financing gapfor women entrepreneurs across business value chains.Yet unlocking African women's ingenuity and giving them access to finance could generate technological advancements that help deal with climate change, believes the African Development Bank.As mobile phone technology has proven, Africa is capable of leapfrogging into an era of digitisation, which minimises risks and cuts costs of doing business.African women have shown potential to compete in this digital work-space -- Mfarm, AppsTech, JuaKali, Nandimobile, Hehe Ltd, Obami, DotNxt, are only a few of the women-led tech startups in Africa listed by Forbes.""If we women are given the right platforms, we will achieve the change we wish to see in the world,"" says Ms Duarte.Unlocking investment in African women holds incredible return and transformational impactpotential.

'We are continuing to step up our leadership toward a more sustainable future - in our own operations, and in solutions for our customers.'3M becomes the largest company in Xcel Energy Inc's service area across eight Western and Midwestern states to convert to 100 percent renewable electricity. 3M's St. Paul global headquarters is a 409-acre campus with about 12,000 employees across 30 buildings and research labs.3M's transition to 100 percent renewable electricity at its headquarters will increase the company's total global renewable electricity sourcing by more than 5 percent to approximately 30 percent and further help the company reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 3M has recorded a 68 percent absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions since 2002, while nearly doubling its revenue.'We applaud 3M's leadership in making a bold commitment to 100% renewable energy. Xcel Energy is proud to partner with 3M, because we both share a drive to innovate and a commitment to reducing carbon emissions and protecting the environment,'' said Chris Clark, president, Xcel Energy-Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota.Committing to 100 percent renewable electricity is part of 3M's strategic focus on science for climate with the aspiration to innovate to decarbonize industry, accelerate global climate solutions and improve the company's environmental footprint.As part of the global goal, 3M is joining RE100, a global leadership initiative, led by The Climate Group in partnership with Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) that brings together influential businesses committed to sourcing 100 percent renewable power for their worldwide operations.3M is committed to the move to sourcing 100 percent of electricity from renewable sources and has set an interim target to source at least 50 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2025.'By joining RE100 and switching to 100% renewable electricity globally, 3M is building sustainability into its business growth strategy and showing the two go hand-in-hand,' said Helen Clarkson, CEO of The Climate Group. 'Seeing such a large manufacturer commit to 'go all in' on renewables to produce sustainable new products is an encouraging step forward. Big brands like this can influence positive action from other companies and customers and accelerate the clean energy transition around the world.'As a global manufacturing and technology company that produces thousands of diverse products, 3M is committed to accelerating global renewable energy adoption and to transparently sharing progress along the way.3M also recently announced an increased commitment to build Sustainability into the pipel"

Many of the Bank's initiatives show the importance of more collaboration and linkages between the private sector and communities in respect of climate change adaptation and mitigation projects. It has also highlighted the importance of youth involvement in these initiatives.In an event hosted on 13 December, a selection of young entrepreneurs and environmental activists were invited from several different countries, including Sudan, the Seychelles and Canada. They were joined by a government representative from the Cote d'Ivoire and a business expert from Morocco to discuss the opportunities and challenges of climate resilient entrepreneurship in tackling climate change.Africa has the most positive attitudes towards entrepreneurship compared to the rest of the world. 7 out 10 young workers in Africa are self-employed. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are of great importance to the growing challenge of climate change, and are also a powerful way of addressing underemployment and unemployment. But as policies and programmes continue to emphasise entrepreneurship to encourage Africa's youth to become job creators instead of job seekers, it is also important that SMEs can contribute to reducing climate change impacts, since SMEs constitute 95% of Africa's private sector, the main energy user and greenhouse gas producer.In order for young people to succeed at running their own enterprises, they need to be provided with an enabling environment. 'We have noticed that the mistakes of the past were mainly about inadequate training. You can always have a good idea but you need training to turn that idea into reality.' noted Said Chakri, a supervisor and trainer at the Proponents Project in Morocco.Said Chakri, MoroccoGovernment can play a major role in creating an enabling environment for green entrepreneurship by having a national strategy that focuses mainly on supporting the sector. Marcel Fodjo from the Government of Cote d'Ivoire said: 'We certainly need a national policy. If you are a job seeker, and you can't find a job, create one for yourself, as there are many projects that you can be created, especially in the green entrepreneurship space. We have investments that work on encouraging and helping green entrepreneurs, so although we do work on this at the national level, we of course need a national policy.'The high level of innovation and creativity among young people in Africa needs to be utilised more in order for countries to be able to deal with current and future climate change impacts. Yannick Memee, a young entrepreneur from the Seychelles who is a leading blue economy entrepreneur enabler in his home country, said that young people in Africa and other regions need to learn from each others' experiences and be open to new ideas: 'As young people we are afraid of failure and we need to learn how to accept and ensure that we have passion. You do not go into business because of money. Money is good but it is not everything and if it is your only motivation you will quit after the first setback you have.'One of the key challenges for youth-led initiatives is the availability of adequate training, access to markets, mentoring, and access to innovative financing schemes. The African Development Bank, through its Jobs for Youth in Africa Strategy and Youth Entrepreneurship and Innovation Multi-Donor Trust Fund aims to equip 50 million young men and women of working age with the skills they need to help them join the formal sector and create their own businesses.

In smaller towns such as Fort William, Forres and Ullapool, striking pupils will meet outside the school gates.READ MORE:\~Microplastics found in guts of 100% of marine mammals in new studyIn total more than 30 locations across the UK have confirmed they are planning action to draw attention to the need for policy makers to take urgent action, with thousands expected to participate. Most are inspired by the actions of 16-year-old Swedish school girl Greta Thunberg, who decided to hold a school strike outside the Swedish Parliament building last August and has continued weekly strikes under the Fridays for Future banner.In December a video of Greta speaking at a United Nations Climate Change conference in which she told delegate that they were ""not mature enough to tell it as it is"" leaving ""even that burden"" to children like her - went viral. Youth strikes have been held in countries across Europe in recent weeks and months, including several small protests in Scotland. Last Friday more than 10,000 students and school pupils marched through the streets of the Hague, chanting and holding banners.Jake Woodier, of the UK youth climate coalition, which is helping to co-ordinate the UK-wide strike said: ""There have been a few isolated strikes around the country but this is the first UK day of action with some places in Scotland seeing their first youth strike.""It's exciting to see that young people are grasping the sense of climate justice. Our futures are the ones that will be affected the most and yet we are the ones who have had the least voice.READ MORE:\~Nicola Sturgeon signs climate change agreement with New Jersey""We are expecting thousands this week, but we hope it will grow. In some countries in mainland Europe it has started with hundreds and then just ballooned."" An international day of action is also planned for March 15.The rise marks the point at which the risk of irreversible changes significantly worsen along with drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. The ""unprecedented"" and urgent changes to tackle global warming lie at the most ambitious end of the Paris Agreement on climate change, scientist have said.Last week the UK Met Office warned global warming could temporarily hit 1.5C above pre-industrial levels for the first time between now and 2023. But climatologists stressed this worrying sign did not mean the world had broken the Paris agreement as international temperature targets are based on 30-year averages.Scottish local authorities are already beginning to take action. Earlier this month Edinburgh City Council agreed to declare a ""climate emergency"" with a proposed action plan due to be presented in May.READ MORE:\~Warning that climate change is putting chips under threatIn Glasgow the council has set up an emergency working group, in recognition of the severity of the situation, led by Scottish Green Councillor Martha Wardrop.Megan Rose, 20, a student who is one of the founders of Glasgow University's Extinction Rebellion group, is one of the organisers in the city's first youth strike this Friday. Though it is student-led, the group is also expecting secondary and primary school pupils to attend the strike.She said: ""Like most people I have been really inspired by the action going on across Europe.""The only thing we can really strike with is our education. In Scotland that is paid for by the Scottish Government so we hope it sends a message to them.""I've been in a place of considerable fear about the situation [with climate change]. It will really affect my future. So the strike has given me a bit of hope. It makes me feel like I'm actually doing something. There's a lot of excitement about it and I'm hopeful that this week's strike will help us grow it.""Tobias Walters, 19, who is studying Psychology and Sociology at Glasgow University will be joining the Glasgow student-led strike on Friday. He added: ""I really feel that given the current situation we can't not be doing something. The situation is really serious and some of the effects are already being seen around the world - freak storms and flooding and fires. It is really is a fight for survival.""Finlay Pringle, 11, his sister Ella, 9 and their friend Megan, also 9 - all from Ullapool - believe they were the first children in Scotland to join the climate strike on December 14 last year.

Together we are stronger, have a bigger voice which hopefully will be noticed and listened to.""This will only be possible if they stop talking and take action, we hope by striking that they get on and save our planet.""For 13-year-old Holly Gillibrand the UK-wide strike will be the sixth time she has missed Friday classes to stand outside Lochaber high school in Fort William. ""I've been interested in the environment and in nature all my life and now the planet is in trouble,"" she said. ""We need to stop subsidising fossil fuels and reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025."" The situation makes her sad and angry, she claimed.She hopes this Friday's strike could mark a turning point, boosting the number of pupils willing to get involved and admitted she was excited but anxious as a result. ""But I've had great support so far,"" she added. On Friday Scottish Green MSP John Finnie joined her, teachers have been supportive and passing cars honk and wave.Layla Clark, 15, from south Edinburgh attended last week's protest outside Holyrood with her friend Becca, who also intends to take part on Friday, says it's exciting to be part of.""I think it's a great way to show that we as young people think it's an important issue,"" she said.

Critics saw in his rapid rise the unhappy influence of politics in business.The question of the link between politics and business resurfaced last week after Rafal Bochenek, until 15 months ago spokesman for Poland's prime minister, popped up as director of marketing at PGNiG, Poland's state-controlled oil and gas group. PGNiG said Mr Bochenek was appointed on merit, and pointed out that he was involved in organising last year's COP24 climate summit as proof of his experience managing large projects. But opposition politicians seized on the appointment of the one-time weather presenter as an example of the ruling Law and Justice party finding cushy jobs for its allies.The collision of ""No one from Law and Justice gets offers from the private sector. They all end up at companies of the state treasury,"" said Ryszard Petru, from the opposition group Teraz, adding that people linked to Law and Justice seemed to get jobs there based on their service.business and politics brings unwelcome consequences The state plays a huge role in Poland's economy. The state treasury holds direct stakes of 27 per cent or more in nine of the 20 companies listed on Poland's blue-chip index, including the country's biggest bank and a host of energy groups. It also holds sway over two other banks, Pekao SA and Alior, via the country's biggest insurance group, PZU, in which it has a 34 per cent stake.Poland's nationalist government sees control of such groups as key in protecting the country's strategic interests. But for private investors, the collision of business and politics brings a number of unwelcome consequences.The most striking is the game of musical chairs in the top ranks of Poland's biggest companies. This is not unique to the Law and Justice party. Previous governments have also hired and fired corporate chiefs with relative abandon. But since coming to power in 2015, Law and Justice has undoubtedly had the music playing faster.Shareholders Only one of the state-controlled groups listed on the WIG20 index - Poland's biggest bank, PKO BP - has the same chief executive as it did when Law and Justice took office. Last year, Puls Biznesu, a Polish daily, calculated that since Law and Justice had come to power, the chief executive of a listed statecontrolled group had been switched every 20 days. By contrast, under the centrist government that ruled from 2007 to 2015, a CEO got his marching orders every 57 days.have a right to question whether their funds are put to best use Of course, Poland is not the only country where the state is involved in corporate life.

"COP24","UK","COP24_UK326","Uranium Market Outlook - Q4, 2018 Report","February 7, 2019 Thursday","M2 PressWIRE","February 7, 2019The ""Uranium Market Outlook - Q4, 2018"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.After having said in my Q3 2018 Uranium Market Outlook that despite the U3O8 spot price having recovered from a low of $ 18/lb on November 28, 2016 to $ 26/lb at the end of August 2018, optimism on structural continuation of the recovery should not be overstated, the effect of Cameco's announcement on August 21, 2018 that it is seeking 500,000 pounds from uranium producers between the end of this year through March 21, 2019, has not succeeded to break the important resistance level of $ 30/lb to date.This resistance level was addressed to by me since 2012 when there occurred a difference of more than $ 10/lb between the falling spot price and consolidation of the long-term price yet, which has blocked an earlier recovery of the spot price.With the 500,000 pounds to be delivered by Cameco before March 21, 2019, the Company's total need to meet its contractual obligations is said to be 15 million pounds of uranium through the end of 2019.Referring to my analysis of statistics on the top 10 countries of the world's uranium producers, as well as nuclear power reactors and uranium requirement, it is to be noticed that while the United States in 2017 had a deficit of 18,056 tonnes in supply, this deficit could be covered easily by Kazakhstan's supply of 23,391 tonnes. In addition, there is access to delivery from long-term agreements with other countries, of which Russia in particular.This actually means that based on current global production and supply, almost all trading doesn't have to be generated by the open market, and as a result could halt a further recovery of the uranium spot price to required economically viable prices above $ 50/lb.With existing long-term obligations to dry up in the next few years and to be replaced, it has to be noticed that utilities will be reluctant to offer a high premium for committed long-term deliveries of U3O8, like happened in the period up to year-end 2015, at which time the U3O8 price was $ 50/lb.From this perspective, it is also to be considered that the need of uranium to feed the anticipated strong growth of new nuclear reactors in China, Russia and India, can be fully accommodated through secured bilateral agreements rather than through the non-transparent open market.By Kazakhstan playing a dominant role producing 40% of total world uranium production, representing a surplus in supply of 24,575 tonnes and together with a Canadian surplus of 12,447 tonnes and Australia 6,315 tonnes in supply to provide global uranium demand, which now comes for account of the United States, showing a deficit of 24,575 tonnes.Based on a new future energy strategy in the U.S., with the goal to be less dependent on foreign supply of uranium from percentage of around 7% only, this will result in decreasing imports and support higher local U.S. production.Key Topics Covered:- General market comments- Content summary- Worlds largest carbon emitters- World nuclear power reactors Uranium requirements- World top 10 uranium producing countries- Paris Climate Agreement confirms essential contribution of nuclear energy to limit global warming- United Nations report reiterates increased need for nuclear power- COP24- China and Russia to dominate international sales of new nuclear plants- Rio Tinto sells entire 68.62% interest in Namibian Rossing mine to CNNC of China- European Union fails as leader reactors in profiling itself as a leader on promoting action on climate change- Phasing out Germany's nuclear reactors in conflict with EU energy policy- Kazatomprom Company Profile- Resurrecting JC Inkai between Kazatomprom and Cameco- Market Valuation of the World's listed uranium industry- Geographical overview of the world's highest valued exploration and development countries- United States dominates global energy markets- Call for U.S government to revitalize its uranium industry- U.S. uranium mine production 2017 55% less than in 2016- U.S. uranium in-situ leach plants- US congress approves US$ 1.2 Billion budget for nuclear energy- Energy Fuels Company Profiles- Ur-Energy Company Profiles- Peninsula Energy Company Profiles- UEC prevented from technical default in 2019 and Company ProfilesCompanies Mentioned- Cameco- Energy Fuels- Kazatomprom- Peninsula Energy- Rio Tinto- Ur-Energy- Uranium EnergyFor more information about this report visit HYPERLINK https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/mn8zdp/uranium_market?w=3https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/mn8zdp/uranium_market?w=3CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.com,Laura Wood, Senior Press Manager HYPERLINK mailto:press@researchandmarkets.compress@researchandmarkets.comRelated Topics: Chemicals ( \~ HYPERLINK https://www.researchandmarkets.com/categories.asp?cat_id=63campaign_id=mn8zdphttps://www.researchandmarkets.com/categories.asp?cat_id=63campaign_id=mn8zdp) \l"

With more than 68 million forcibly displaced people in 2017, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has seen an unprecedented number of people uprooted by war, violence or persecution worldwide. According to the NGO Oxfam, an estimated 23.5 million were forced to leave their homes in 2016 due to extreme natural disasters. When these humanitarian crises occur, often in zones that are either cut off or away from electricity grids, access to easy, fast, clean, reliable and affordable energy is required to bring vital supplies (medicine, food, etc.) to impacted populations. Up until now, relief operations have had to rely on fossil fuel energy, renowned for being dirty, expensive, noisy, difficult to transport and dangerous for health and safety.A containerized plug and play solution for fast, affordable deploymentSchneider Electric presents Villaya Emergency, a containerized mobile solar microgrid solution designed for ease of use in any humanitarian emergency. The system produces a minimum of 10 kilowatts peak of electricity - enough to power a village, a health center or individual/group areas in refugee camps - thanks to a system of easy-to-use and easy-to-move photovoltaic panels. The entire solution is fitted into a standard shipping container for fast, easy transportation or relocation to anywhere worldwide. Born from discussions between UNHCR experts and managers of Schneider Electric's Access to Energy program, Villaya Emergency meets all critical needs of relief specialists. 'Its main benefit is easy installation in less than half an hour after delivery,' said Olivier Jacquet, in charge of the Emergencies, Refugees and Conflicts team at Schneider Electric. 'Villaya Emergency can be handled by an on-site operator without any specific training nor requiring any specific maintenance.' Another advantage is the solution's robustness: 'We've made sure the system can operate in extreme heat and can be installed or dismantled as needed without any damage.'Contact:Tel: +33 (0)1 41 29 84 18Villaya Emergency includes an inverter and a battery developed by Schneider Electric for tropical environments. The functional unit can transform direct current (DC) into alternating current (AC), can operate in temperatures of up to 45-degreeC without any performance drop, with a maximum operating temperature of 60-degree. A comprehensive monitoring system enables users to check battery status, along with energy production and consumption levels, at any time. The data can be captured and sent by GSM, 4G or satellite, and analyzed thanks to EcoStruxure Microgrid Advisor. It consists of an application for EcoStruxure for Energy Access, an affordable, flexible and open platform that improves the profitability and performance of electric microgrids. With this technology, system managers can monitor and visualize in real time their worldwide installed base. The solution also integrates innovations by partner start-ups, such as FZSONICK's 'hot' sodium nickel chloride batteries that can operate at high temperatures. The batteries are free of toxic or environmentally harmful materials, they are maintenance free with high cycling/discharge characteristics and are unaffected by ambient temperatures between -40 to +60-degreeC. To guarantee easy deployment in less than 30 minutes, even on soft or uneven ground, the photovoltaic panels are ready to install, mounted on wheels, precabled and placed on a mobile system called EXOrac manufactured by a start-up named PWRstation. Production of Villaya Emergency started in July 2018, its commercial launch starts at the occasion of COP24 in Katowice (Poland), from December 3 to 14, 2018.About Schneider ElectricSchneider Electric is leading the Digital Transformation of Energy Management and Automation in Homes, Buildings, Data Centers, Infrastructure and Industries.

"COP24","UK","COP24_UK331","-Europa-Closing speech by Commissioner Arias Canete at the High Level Stakeholder Conference: The EU's Vision of a modern, clean and competitive economy","July 12, 2018 Thursday","ENP Newswire","Closing speech by Commissioner Arias Canete at the High Level Stakeholder Conference: The EU's Vision of a modern, clean and competitive economy.Ladies and gentlemen,Let me start by paying tribute to Mr Laurent Fabius, and the central role he played to securing the Paris Agreement at COP21. Without him, we wouldn't have got the Paris Agreement and we wouldn't be where we are today in terms of tackling climate change.I am also convinced that the COP24, the next key step for the international community towards credibly meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement, is in good hands with the Polish Presidency. And I look forward to further close cooperation before, during and after Katowice.At our EU Talanoa event on June 13, I was very encouraged to hear the many stories of stakeholders, businesses, NGOs, investors and labour unions about the successful climate action that is already taking place in Europe.This High Level Conference confirmed that our stakeholders' community is equally committed towards looking into long term perspective. We all need to put our collective experience and ideas together to come forward with a shared vision for a prosperous, modern, clean and competitive economy that will turn the Paris Agreement into a reality.In my opening remarks yesterday I said that we are here to listen. From the discussions during the past two days I heard that we have the full commitment of the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council to the task of establishing a long-term strategy as well as the support from the European Investment Bank.But most importantly, during these two days I could also see this commitment coming from our stakeholders community. The clean energy transition cannot be a slogan invented by policy-makers; it is a reality that is already shaping the European economy and the way we live.I was particularly encouraged by the strong commitment of some major EU companies and investors to deploy practical solutions for decarbonisation, based on European technologies. We have already seen the change in their energy mix, in the widening of the scope of their activities and gaining new market shares.Let me mention three messages that I believe summarise the main themes addressed during the conference:1) first of all, the need that our efforts are comprehensive and encompass all sectors of the economy;2) second, the need to ensure that our efforts are inclusive so that citizens can feel the benefits and become change agents of this transition and no one is left behind;3) and third, the need to have a clear vision of the way ahead, help create the right conditions for change, and consolidate our leadership also at global level.1) Let me begin with the first point: the need that our efforts to drive the clean energy transition are comprehensive.We know that to achieve our common goals, we need all sectors on board.This is the approach we have taken with the implementation of our 2030 climate and energy package - by putting in place legislation on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in all sectors of the economy and bringing Clean Energy to All Europeans.We have made good progress - but it is also clear from the discussions that there's still a lot of work to be done to achieve a post-carbon European economy.For instance, the importance of combining and coordinating progress on renewables and energy efficiency, as two key pillars towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions was clearly underl"
